If this is your first time listening, welcome. Thank you so much for picking this episode to tune into. The podcast is essentially the story of the road and it's most importantly the story of the trembling egg at the center of the earth that's about to explode and cause the apocalypse by spreading super intelligent spiders through the cities of the world that are gonna eat all of our children and eat our feet leaving us screaming in our hallways with blood gouting out of our feet. That's all they do is eat babies and feet, but that's enough to take civilization down and I'm here to warn you of this impending horror that's about to happen and along the way, hopefully make you laugh and teach you about how important it is to come to terms with who you are and forgive yourself and recognize that as Herman Hesse said in his beautiful book, Demian, that to be born you must first destroy a world. And in this case, the world you must destroy is the world of your former fear self, that terrible prison you've been trapped inside of, a prison of your own creation where you stare mournfully out the keyhole of yourself, not knowing that the key is in your hand. And in this case, the key is recognizing that in only three years an egg in the center of the earth is going to explode and super intelligent fear seeking spiders are gonna climb out of the volcanoes and calderas of planet earth and they're gonna go right for either your children or your feet, more likely both. And you're gonna look down and there's gonna be a chittering super intelligent spider eating your feet and you're gonna think to yourself, man, I wish I'd learned to not be so afraid. Like I heard on that podcast because I wouldn't be in excruciating pain right now watching this horrible creature devour my feet. But let's stay positive and not focus on the impending arachnid foot devouring apocalypse. And let's enjoy podcasts. We have got a particularly wonderful podcast for you today. Trudy Goodman is here with us today. We're gonna jump right into it, but first some quick business. This episode of the DTFH is brought to you by Squarespace.com.

Squarespace is amazing for many different reasons. The first reason is you can sign up for it without using a credit card. You can just try it out to see if it works for you. If you're thinking about making a website and you're sort of on the fence wondering if you should make a website or huddle there and the shadows completely anonymous and alone, maybe you're thinking, I don't know, do I hire somebody? Do I do it myself? How long is it gonna take if I do it myself? Head over to Squarespace, try it out. You will soon realize that they have created an incredible service that allows you to assemble beautiful templates created by world-class designers. They've got amazing e-commerce functionality that lets you sell anything online. And God forgive me for saying this yet again, but to me it is truly the fulcrum upon which the entire internet sits, which is that I know someone who sells their socks online. If someone's making money selling their stinky socks online, my God, just think of that. We live in a world where there was a time when people were crawling through the cracks of Mount St. Helens looking for a cricket to eat and now, holy shit, there's sock mongers sitting in piles of gold with freshly enameled teeth grinning from ear to ear, because they just made another million dollars on their musty, stinky socks. And friends, that's the kind of America I want to live in. Squarespace, it's got everything you need. Everything's optimized for mobile right out of the box. That might not sound impressive to you, oh youngster, but in my day, trying to get a website to fit onto all the varieties of cell phones was one of the most brutal, horrific, terrible, very expensive things you could attempt to do. You would end up with a pissed off web designer shoving a sawed off shotgun into your grandmother's beautiful breasts that your mom used to feed off of because he'd had some kind of schizoid break and he couldn't take your notes anymore and he was just telling you to give him your money or he was gonna finish your grandma. That was a common experience for people who lived in the 90s, but now, thanks to Squarespace, you don't have to deal with that anymore. You can use Squarespace for anything, whether you're an architect, a musician, a writer, a blogger, a photographer, or just a cacophonist looking to create a little bit of chaos in the world by, say, building a website that seems to have been created by the United States government that connects, I don't know, your brother or your sister to ISIS and then email that to them and ask them if they're aware that this website exists. There's so many beautiful pranks that could be played. PS, I mean, legal, good-spirited, fun pranks that are designed to make your friends realize how much you love them because you put this much effort into creating a little bit of mischief, not malicious pranks. Right now, if you head over to squarespace.com, forward slash Duncan, you can get a free trial and when you're ready to launch, use offer code Duncan to save 10% of your first purchase of a website or a domain.

Welcome, welcome upon you, that you are with us, shake hands, don't need to be moved, welcome to you, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, it's the DuncanTrussell Family Hour podcast, Trudy Goodman. Trudy, thank you so much for coming on my show, it's so great to have you in my house. It's really fun to be here. I have really been enjoying getting ready for this conversation, listening to you speak and I've been very moved, it's a bit like, I know it's gonna be a great conversation when prior to the conversation, my life feels slightly better just by researching the person I'm gonna interview and so thank you for all of the beautiful stuff that you have out there. Thank you. I'm putting it out there for us. So I wanted to start this one off with a Terrence McKenna quote. I was really moved by listening to you talk about your experiences in Darfur and the refugee camp there and what's it called, Ripple, what's it? Little Ripples, little Ripples, yeah. So I wanted to read something to you and then I thought maybe we could just jump off of this particular diving board of a quote. This is Terrence McKenna said this. The apocalypse is not something which is coming. The apocalypse has arrived in major portions of the planet and it's only because we live within a bubble of incredible privilege and social insulation that we still have the luxury of anticipating the apocalypse and I wanna talk with you a little bit about that because not only you've had this experience of firsthand glimpse of what a refugee camp looks like in a place where there was genocide but then also you have worked with dying people, you have the experience of teaching insight meditation and I guess you are aware of the fact that many people don't seem to realize that they're going to die and that they're still enjoying anticipating the apocalypse but they haven't experienced it in their life. Well, they're not dead yet. They're not dead yet. Or they somehow haven't, you know, we see these pictures of people with their elderly parents and they're just like taking it for granted, their parents are still around, you know, they haven't had the loss yet, right? And so I wonder if we could just start off by talking a little bit about how your contact with the thing happening in Darfur isn't the apocalypse. Well, then I don't know what the apocalypse is. For those people, that's the end of the world. And in one of your teachings, you were talking about how you leave your home and you're never coming back to your home. You leave your home and you're never coming. It's done. That's right. That really, really hit me right in the heart. I never thought of that. Can you talk a little bit about what that's taught you, being around these people who are in this sort of existence? Yeah, I mean, that's why I went there too, Duncan, because I imagine being, I have a very vivid imagination so I could imagine what it would be like to not ever be able to go home, no longer have a home. In many cases, no longer have a state, a country, anywhere you belong. And once I read a description by a Tibetan Buddhist teacher who was talking about, just what you're saying, that people lack awareness of their mortality. And he was saying, people don't realize, now this is a tradition that believes that there is consciousness after death. So I just say that. He said, people don't realize what it is like to have your consciousness severed from your body. And I thought that is what it would feel like in some way to be a refugee, to have your entire consciousness and existence severed from its roots. And not only did the people, I mean, the camp that I was in was Darfurri refugees. And we were about 45 minutes from the border with Darfur, Sudan, Darfur is in Sudan. And we were in Eastern Chad, right over the border. And 45 minute drive on a red dirt road. And there are hundreds of thousands of people now who have been in Eastern Chad for 13 years. Yes. The genocide is still ongoing. And it's as though they can't believe that the international community doesn't care that Al-Bashir is still in power. Most people here have no idea who that is. And that, without going into the whole history of the war and what happened, I would just say that, not only did they have to leave their homes, they left their homes because the militia, the Janjaweed, would come on horseback and torch their grass. Their homes are grass huts. This is very rural grass hut Africa. We're not talking about urban Africa. Right. So they're leaving with things on fire, under a rain of bullets. They're not just feeling unsafe. So gee, we should move on, they're fleeing. And when I went to the refugee camp in Eastern Chad, the leader of the community who speaks enough English to interface with us, he explained that when he left, he left with a lot of people, but he couldn't get his grandmother out in time. So not only are you fleeing, but sometimes you've lost. Family members have lost each other. So it's extremely intense. They fled at night only. They hid during the day. And when you're in the Sahel, which is the sub-Saharan, it's a very arid region. There's nowhere to hide. There's no big trees and forests. I don't know how they made it, but they made it. And they all are there in the camp. And I was stunned by the organization of the community, the pretty democratic and harmonious way that they are living in this camp. In this camp, there are about 30,000 people, and they're dotted up and down the border with Sudan. 30,000? Yeah, in that camp. Who's paying for this? Well, that's the thing. The UN helped at the beginning, and the government of Chad helped, but there isn't money, so their food has been cut in half. So now everybody's hungry. They only have between six and 800 calories a day, which is not enough. Just to put that in perspective, I was just at Chipotle last night. Your typical Chipotle burrito is 800 to 1400 calories. So you're eating like a sandwich a day. You're eating a burrito, yeah. A burrito a day. And I went there because they were looking for a mindfulness teacher who had a background in early childhood education to help bring mindfulness into this beautiful preschool program, and the anti-genocide group called IACT who invited me. Wait, what's an anti-genocide group? It's a small, I call them small, but mighty. What are they called? It's called small I, ACT, capital A, capital C, capital T, IACT. And they asked me, and I called everybody I knew who worked with kids and knew mindfulness, and said, you know, why don't you go? They're looking for this, and I didn't really want to go, but I was- Dangerous. It is dangerous. It's dangerous in lots of ways. The rebels can pour over the border, and at one time, the two directors were caught in a hotel for three days with bullets flying over their heads. I mean, it's not, now it's safer because we stay in, we call it Chinese Chad. We stay in a hotel out in Jemaina, the capital. We're only there one night, but we stay in a hotel that is outside of all the Western hotels, so it's not a potential target, but anyway- Trudy, you're de-emphasizing your heroism. I'm sorry to cut you off, but to go into a place like that is, it's not just like, when we, it's actually, in situations like that, things can go south so fast. Yeah. So fast, and they can stay south, and so the fact that you're going out there, it feels like you're de-emphasizing, and that's cool. I think I have to de-emphasize it because maybe I wouldn't have gone, but I mean, there's no doctors, there's no medical care, and- And people are sick out there. People have all kinds- Well, the scary thing is they have a bad kind of malaria, which I couldn't take the anti-malaria medicine, so at six in the, and we couldn't stay in the camp, because I think at dark, it's probably not that safe, so we stayed in a UN compound about a half hour away, and you know, barbed wire and guards, and we stayed in a metal box, and at dusk, at six, I would get in my mosquito net, and I would just stay in it for 12 hours, so I wouldn't get bitten. So it was- The kind of malaria out there, it'll, it kills you. Yeah, you have five days, and then you're dead. You don't have five days to get treatment. I mean- You really have two or three days to get treatment. Those are painful, brutal. But you don't dwell on this, Duncan. If you did, you wouldn't go and do anything, and I was tormented by the idea there are 65 million refugees in the world. This was before the election, and I just felt this is something I need to do because of that feeling of what it would be like to be not only homeless, but nowhere to go and be that safe, and- Why don't people, right now, this is what I don't understand, and I mean this, when I say people, I mean me. Yeah. We watched this story of the refugees on our border, and it has become a political statement to say, I think we should help refugees. That's right. Saying that publicly now- That's right. Is become political. So if you say that now, people will be like, really, what's your plan? Don't you believe in borders? Do you not believe in borders? I know. And so you hear someone saying that, and by the way, full disclosure, this thought has emerged in my own mind, so in a more refined way, where the thought has emerged like, well, when I go to Canada, like going through that border there is almost, it's difficult. I've been detained in Canada for no reason. I don't even know why they did. They questioned me, they interrogated me. They let me through into Canada so I could do stand-up comedy, but in Canada, Canadian comics are always getting thrown out of the US and going into Canada and coming back is like a tricky thing. So in a lighter yet equally, I would say in human way, my mind is thought, well, you know, we gotta have borders. Like what are we gonna do without borders? If we don't have borders, then we don't have a country. If we don't have a country, what are we gonna do? We're being taxed. Our taxes are going to people who are from another country. Shouldn't our taxes be going to schools where our teachers aren't getting paid or the kids who aren't getting enough food here in the United States? And so this terrible dehumanization of everybody on the other side of an imaginary border that got created by people a long time ago starts happening in your mind. Trudy, what do we do? How do we look at this situation in a way that is not only compassionate but pragmatic, recognizing that what do we do? Well, I took a lot of inspiration from IACT because they went, Gabriel Storing, who's the director, and Katie Jase got, who's his wife, when they went, they asked the refugees, what do you want? Now that's radical. It seems like it would make be a no-brainer, but that's radical to go ask people, what do you want? Because the big agencies, they can't do that. They just have these top-down solutions and they give what they can and the refugees said, we want preschool and we want soccer. We want soccer so we can belong to the world, feel some connection to the world and we want preschool because the young kids are watching the littler kids while the parents are out trying to grow a few things to eat or scrabble for fuel and they're getting hurt. The little kids are falling into the wadi and drowning or falling in the fire and burning themselves and hurt. So they essentially wanted educational daycare. And so what we can do is ask people, what do you want? How can we help? If everybody did one small thing, obviously not everybody's gonna travel across the ocean and go into a very rural and dangerous area, but if everybody did, every time they felt, every time we feel hopeless or despairing or frightened or freaked out by what's going on in this country right now, if we did one thing, if we asked around, it would help us personally. It definitely helps us. And I think it would help the world. You're saying like, so a person is listening to an NPR story on children being separated from their parents and the sort of, which I just heard an incredible story and it was up until that, it was, man, it's so easy to dehumanize people. It's so terrible. But you can't dehumanize children. You can't. You can't. But you can turn them into numbers. You just tell others, you know, there's a situation on the borders and you go back to your job. You don't really think about it. And I guess not everybody loves children as much as I do. So maybe they can. People love children. People love helping. It's just in people's minds. Somehow there's this like ridiculous thing that is happening, which is that on the other side of the imaginary line, for one of the, here's one of the things people say, it's irresponsible for these parents to be bringing illegally trying to get their children into this country. And they're saying that as though these is a recreational activity. These parents are not coming even because they want a green card and they want to work. They're coming to save their lives. And the causes that are threatening their lives actually began in this country. So we actually have a responsibility to help. That's sort of how I feel. And I've been heartbroken Duncan because I don't speak Spanish, but I love kids and I've worked with kids all my life. And then I think I want to go. I want to go and help out. I probably will go because I found somebody who wants to be my translator. I probably won't have access to kids, but there's a lot of people who are just at the border. Suffering. And what we're looking at here, people are acting like this is an anomaly. And when we look at the projections for climate change, when we look at what's happening in Europe right now, where places are hitting the hottest they've ever been in recorded history, the ocean, I don't remember which ocean it is, they just measured it, it's hotter than it's ever been in recorded history. Well, make a pilgrimage to Venice where I live and jump in the ocean, it's tropical. It's like swimming in Hawaii right now. I mean, Hawaii in the winter maybe. The oceans are heating up and we're going to be seeing this. This whole refugee thing, and this is where to me it gets particularly, I think what you're doing is incredible in your ability to articulate is incredible to humanize these people because everyone in this country, people who are living anywhere, there's an ocean nearby. People who are living anywhere or there's any chance that some climate related catastrophe could happen, they act like they're not going to be refugees eventually. I know, I know. And that comes back to where you began, which is there's a saying that, it's in the Maburata Indian holy text, that what is the most wondrous thing in the world? Like the eighth wonder of the world, what is it? And it's that we see people die all around us, but we somehow never think it will happen to us. Wow. And that was millennia ago. This is human nature. Right. And it's not that we're supposed to terrorize ourselves with thoughts of our impending death and how's it going to happen and so forth, but to realize the preciousness of life and of each other. That's what it's for. And it's a matter of learning, just learning to open our hearts and open our consciousness to see what this life actually is and in the light of what we see, what matters most to us. And I have to say, I feel people say this and I always thought it was sort of trite, but I feel so much more gifted by the time in the refugee camp than anything I was able to offer there, meeting people who are so resilient, so committed to the kids and their education. These programs are now refugee run. There are young women who are teaching in the Little Ripples program, who are cooking for the kids. They get one meal six days a week, which is often their only nutritious meal of that day, but the kids in that program do not have orange hair, which is the sign of total protein deficiency. They have black hair and it's, and the teachers, this one teacher, Zaneb, she said, before I became a Little Ripples teacher, I didn't know, she said, I knew the words human rights, but I didn't know what they meant. Oh God, wow. And now I realize that men and women have equal power and I didn't know that before. I didn't know that women in the home and outside of the home can speak up and have a say just like men. And when people say these things to you, it's so moving and so powerful. And all you wanna do is go back. And all I have, I actually have wanted to go back, but we can only fit five people at once in a UN Jeep and you have to be in those because it's so unsafe. And so until they, mindfulness has been established in that program. So there isn't, I trained, somebody came with me, Jocelyn Hitter came with me as an assistant teacher and then she went back next time and taught. And I don't know if there'll be a need for me to go back, but maybe I'll go to the border now. We have a different situation. And everybody is in some sense, I'm not trying to, I'll just say it, we're all refugees in some tiny sense in the sense that we're all fleeing some kind of pain or suffering that we were either born with or the causes and conditions in our families or we've lost our job or we don't have a home or we're traumatized by having been in the military or the victim of a crime or endless possibilities, right? And the practices of mindfulness and compassion and awareness and loving awareness, they really make a difference. I've seen it just in, and it doesn't matter what culture, it doesn't matter where you are. We all have consciousness and we all have emotions and we all need to be able to learn more skillful ways of being with our emotions and our insane reactivity, which is the cause of most of our suffering, really. Right. So, you know, I really- How do you not be reactive? I hear you, when I was listening to you, talk about your experience, and I'll post the link to this wonderful talk you did with Jack where you're talking about this Little Ripples program. And in between like- And we can give a shout out for IACT too. And IACT, I'll put the link- And Insight LA, because we're partners with them. Yes, all the rivers people can go down to find you. We'll be there. Trudy, I was fluctuating between beating myself up, just thinking like, Duncan, you jerk, you've been allowing your mind to sink back into this ridiculously lazy position regarding the current refugee crisis. You haven't been saying anything about it. And the stuff you have been saying has been veering in the direction of dehumanizing a group of people in some kind of weird way, just because I don't have the solution. I have no idea what we would do. And then it was listening to your voice. This is you had just come to- You'd left Darfur to go to the Romdoss Retreat in Maui. That's right, it was just a couple. I had just been in Eastern Chad. So you were dealing with culture with Darfur. So you had gone from this complete, the apocalypse. I couldn't face all the food at that buffet. Right, and I heard it in your voice. And I was- Oh, it makes me cry right now, thinking of it. I was, and I could hear, what I heard in your voice was a very skillful suppression of what would have made me want to sit up there and scream. Like, you guys don't understand what's happening. You're here with the ocean and the buffet, and we all are doing great. But they're over there. They have, these children have trauma that's never gonna go away. And they're not getting enough food. And their hair is turning orange. And so how do we not, like, for me, it makes you wanna scream. Well, I do write certain things. I try to help people understand by saying, imagine you went camping, and then you just had to stay at that campsite for 13 years. Oh my God. Like, I try to, you know, give people images that would help them understand and care. There's so many things to care about here and everywhere that there's really room for us all to pitch in and do something. And I do think that's the antidote to despair and rage that you're talking about. I also, you know, I live here. I have a privileged life too. I have plenty to eat. I have to worry about not eating too much. You know, that's my life in America. Right, that's our problem here. So, because it's also abundant and fabulous. And then I just realize, well, that's how it is for us. How would we know we're not being told these folks are forgotten? And I'm just talking about a few hundred thousand people amassed in Eastern Chad. There are people, there are Syrian refugees. There are people all over the world. People drowning in the seas, you know, between, in the Mediterranean. I mean, I think that I keep feeling like if we weren't pouring all of our money into the military, if enough people rallied to care and share our caring and listen, deeply listen to the people who don't see it the way we do. Everything so politicized now and polarized that I wrote one of my little weekly blogettes about diversity and inclusion. And as an organization of mostly white people, how we're looking at that and learning what are our implicit biases. And anyway, I wrote about this and I got this very, one very hateful response saying you drank the Kool-Aid and why do you feel so guilty? And that's reverse racism. Trumped Arrangement Syndrome. Yeah, and on and on. And I thought, but if we sat down with each other and made an agreement to deeply listen and had enough, just a little bit of mindfulness that we could learn to notice when we're still caught in our fabricated thought world of how I'm gonna answer and how I'm gonna rebut that argument and just quietly listened to each other just that is healing and powerful. And I have a friend who's a very, I think he drank the Kool-Aid. He's a total Trump supporter. And people say to me, well, how can you be friends with him? I said, because I learned so much from him and we listened to each other. And we're saved by a sense of humor. Yeah. He's trying to get me to come to Zambia and do a program for women and girls there. And he said, when you and your team leave here, you will all be Republicans. I'm practicing my speeches so we can joke about it and have some capacity to connect, even though we don't necessarily persuade each other. I don't, this is, even that is a political, you can't, so I've caught heat on this podcast for certain guests where people are like, how dare you? Now, how dare you? No, I've had people from both sides of, I guess you could say both sides of the spectrum, brilliant professor, Jordan Peterson, a brilliant journalist, Abby Martin. And you have people on and put a microphone in front of their face and Abby Martin says, oh, Palestine, that's an open air prison. And boom, get ready for the attacks on Twitter. How dare you give that person a voice? That person is anti-Semitic. I know, Abby, she's not anti-Semitic. Not at all, she's brilliant. And, but that, you know, or how dare you give Jordan Peterson a voice? He's against, he doesn't like trans people or he's a, you know, alt-right icon. And so even the concept of producing a dialogue with people who have been deemed too far on one side or the other is considered to be, do you wanna go back in time and have a conversation with Hitler? Do you wanna just have a nice little chat about why Jews are destroying the planet? You know, like, do you wanna give a voice to these people? And I keep thinking like, well, number one, neither of those people are close to being, or close, it's not a fair categorization, but also, like, if we, how do you know you're about to go to war with another country? You cut off all lines of communication. That's the first thing that happens, right? You can't hate each other if you know each other. You can disagree. You can disagree ferociously. But you can't hate each other when you know each other in that way. And I'm not talking about, you know, criminal abusers or people who've hurt you the most in this life. But I actually have a poem that I wanna read because I think it speaks to this. It's a poem by Fred Lamotte, and it's called My Ancestry DNA Results Came In. Just as I suspected, my great-great-grandfather was a monarch butterfly. Much of who I am is still wriggling under a stone. I'm part larva, but part hummingbird, too. There's dinosaur tar in my bone marrow. My golden hair sprang out of a meadow in Palestine. Genghis Khan is my fourth cousin, but I didn't get his dimples. My loins are loaded with banyan seeds from Sri Lanka. My uncle is a mastodon. There are traces of white people in my saliva. 3.7 billion years ago, I swirled in golden dust, dreaming of a planet overgrown with lingams and yonis. More recently, say, 60,000 BC, I walked on hairy paws across a land bridge joining Sweden to Botswana. I am a bastard of the sun and moon. I can no longer hide my heritage of raindrops and cougar scat. I am made of your grandmother's tears. You conquered rival tribesmen of your own color, chained them together, marched them naked to the coast, and sold them to colonials from Savannah. I was that brother you sold. I was the slave trader. I was the chain. Admit it. You have wings, vast and golden, like mine, like mine. You have sweat, black and salty, like mine, you have secrets, silently singing in your blood, like mine, like mine. Don't pretend that the earth is not one family. Don't pretend we never hung from the same branch. Don't pretend we don't ripen on each other's breath. Don't pretend we didn't come here to forgive. So that poem helps me. Poets give voice to our deepest, deepest stirrings of our hearts, and the reality is we are not separate. And it's tragic not to realize that. Right, yeah. That is beautiful. That is beautiful. That is beautiful. I just, forgiveness thing is like such a, it can feel so ambiguous, can it? What is it? Forgiveness is tricky. I debated about whether to read the last line of the poem for that reason, because forgiveness, you have to be ready to forgive, and it's a process, and forgiveness is the end point. We all wanna start there usually, because we are spiritual people, and besides, it feels better to forgive than to be enraged and carrying around grudges and resentments, and with just being tied in knots, but the reality is that some things are unforgivable, and that often the best we can do is, think of forgiveness as for freeing your own heart from these states of grudge and resentment and anger and ill will, and sometimes that's the best we can do. We're not gonna love our enemy, but we don't have to be obsessed for our lifetime with the harm that was done to us. Forgiveness is tricky. I think that, I like it too. No, I mean, I guess what I mean is what I'm saying is, I like that poem, and I like that he said we're here to forgive is the primary thing, because I think of it as like this ultimate spiritual pull-up bar. Like when I was a little doughy kid, they used to do these monstrous exercises, which I don't think are presidential fitness exercises. I could never do those. Oh, oh, I do. Do you remember that too? My daughter went through that hell. I'm too old, thank God we didn't have that. So you get in line. I'm this like pudgy, I don't know how to put it, like a weeble wobble, essentially, right? And you get in line and it's like, there's this pull-up bar waiting for you, like looking at you, like, oh, get ready. Oh, I feel it in my stomach right now. You gotta go and you're so, this is what- Because I was a couch potato. The swine president, I don't know who it was at the time, whatever that monstrous person was, was like, I don't know, a child should be able to do in three-in-poll arms. And so like, so- These humiliation, right? Life, children are jumping up on that pull-up bar. They're doing like 17 pull-ups just for fun. They love it, they love the pull-ups. And then you march up to the thing. It's like not a firing squad, but it's the same feeling of like, as you desperately tried to just- Oh, in front of everybody too. Yeah, right. So, but you know, and I remember getting it, like a few years ago, getting a trainer and he like brought me to the pull-up bar and he's like, we're gonna get you to start doing pull-ups. I'm like, can't do it. And he's like, no Duncan, I'm gonna teach you how to do pull-ups. And I'm like, I can't, it'll never happen. And so sure enough, I couldn't do a pull-up the first time. But then he's like, let me show you something. And he starts putting like these embarrassing, I don't know what they are, these straps on me or something. And so it's a little lighter. Oh, he gave you some support. Some support. And then you put within a few weeks, pull-ups. I'm doing pull-ups. I've liberated myself from- Can you still do a pull-up? I don't know, because I haven't been going to the gym, but I know that I can now. So what I mean is- That's fantastic, Duncan. Forgiveness is the pull-up bar. We look at it and we think no fucking way. That son of a bitch, are you kidding? I can't. He didn't. Okay, but you didn't do it alone, Duncan. All right. We can't do it alone. You got support. This is Maya Angelou. She's like, okay, auto play next video, lying, thinking last night, how to find my soul a home. Where water's not thirsty and bread loaf is not stoned. I came up with one thing and I don't believe I'm wrong. That nobody, but nobody can make it out here alone. And then there's the reframe. She goes on, you know, you got support. We need each other. We need community. And that's actually why I started Inside LA. I came here, I was like already middle-aged. I didn't have any money. I didn't have connections. I wasn't like, you know, young and beautiful anymore. It was like, oh no. I was driving around in my car and I didn't understand that you have to group your errands in Los Angeles or you'll spend all day and you come. I'd come home and I would have gone to the cleaners and bought some groceries in like eight hours. Or do you know, it was just insane. I thought, if I'm this lonely and finding this so hard, what you learn when you practice mindfulness and meditation, you come to realize what I experience is what human beings experience. So I thought, okay, other people must feel this way too. Why don't we get together? Why don't we create some community together? And then we need that. And just like that guy, he gave you a lift and then you could develop the strength to do it yourself. That's right. And it's the same with forgiveness. It's the same with mindfulness. It's the same with love. We can't do it ourselves. I hear you say that and I think, just on the phone, my friend, who he, just his mother just passed away. His father died years ago. His brother, he's estranged from his brother. And thank God for Ramdas. And thank God for people like you have taught me, like, oh yeah, let's just be available for folks, you know. And so I talk to him sometimes. And I've told him, you know, just call whenever and I talk to him. That's all. We just talk and I was so lucky. I feel really, really lucky. Like you're talking about, you go to the refugee camp and the cliche thing is you realize like, who's helping who here? And similarly, in these little situations where we deal with, where we talk to people like that, and you realize like, I'm the one who should be calling you for help because your strength is giving me inspiration and your contact with reality is helping me. And I think I'm so lucky this person had the guts to not be afraid to reach out to me. Yeah, but it's not luck. It's because you listened. Right. We have sonar for when people are deeply listening to us. Right. It's so healing to be listened to in that way. Right. So that's why he came to you. Right. But I think to myself of people listening right now who are thinking, I don't really have a Duncan to call and I'm really alone. Yes. Or maybe I have people I could call but they are not listening. What do they do? What about that? What about those people who are still in the forest from whatever house burnt down, whether it's a metaphorical house or an actual house and they're completely, they feel completely disconnected and alone. I just sometimes, what do they do? Who do you talk to when you've got nobody? Yeah, that's a hard one. And I think, I have a friend, he's a public health doctor in Boston named Jeremy Nobel and he just started something called the Unlonely Project. And it's really addressing what is an epidemic of loneliness in our society, just what you're talking about. Looking at how can we connect? How can we connect? There's somebody, one of our teachers at Inside LA teaches mindful writing and she has a writing group at a place where people who are experiencing homelessness and also mental illness can come. And so everybody comes and they do a little bit of mindfulness meditation together and then they write and then they read their writing to each other and they listen to each other. Yeah. And the people love it. And then things happen. There's magic that happens. Like this one lady, she had been, I guess all her stuff was stolen from the place while she was sleeping. And she's all alone, God knows where she's sleeping. She woke up, but she wrote about this experience. And then these two guys in the group who were friends said, you know, come sleep under our bridge. We'll watch over you and we'll keep your stuff safe. And they reached, now, you know, this is the kind of, I mean, it's a shame that people would have to be sleeping under bridges, but creating chances for people to hear each other. I keep coming back to that. And if we don't have a place, maybe starting a place because if you're lonely, you know other people are lonely. It's just find another lonely person. Trudy, you're a very amazing, special person. You start, I'm thinking like in times of my life where I've been lonely, I'm not starting a center. I'm gonna sleep on a mattress and try to forget life. We didn't start with a center. We started my first sitting group. And keep in mind, I came from Boston where I had a big life, you know, I was a very well-known psychotherapist. I had a waiting list, what do you call it, line of people around the block waiting. I had my husband, my husband, my then husband and I were pillars of a, you know, a Zen community. But when I came here, I didn't know anybody. And I started my first sitting group with two people. Fred and Steve came, two people. I didn't start a center. It grew organically. It was like cooking from scratch. I didn't even have the idea of starting a center, Duncan. I wanted company. Right. And I found, I don't know how I found Fred and Steve. I think it was through a friend of my cousins or something. You know, it was just a... Right. When we set an intention. That is so cool. To have something happen, then somehow the world seems to magically come to meet us. Have you felt that? Yes. And it is stunning to see, it's almost as though the world is waiting for you to decide what side you're on. And what matters most to you. Yeah. Yeah. Right. How to gather your energies around what really matters and what's most important to you. And that means in the moment when you're lonely, company is what's most important to you. When you're hungry, food is what's most important. We've got a little bit of time and I wanna close with this question and I'm gonna set the question up with a very quick story. Very quick. Oh, no, it's not a story. You were talking about listening a lot and you talk about listening in many of your teachings. The other night I was at a party and ear-beating somebody, like giving someone the most brutal ear-beating of all time. I was talking to him about my modular synthesizers. His eyes had glazed over. This I'm sure doesn't happen to you because you have a regular practice. But like it was like I was sitting in a giant yappy meat robot and I lost control of the mouth function. Like I couldn't stop myself from talk and I'm yapping about modular synthesis. I'm looking at this guy. All he's thinking is how do I get away from this dude? And I'm thinking how do I get away from this dude? Like I'm wanting to get away from myself. Like if I could have like ejected from the robot to not listen, I was boring myself. So God knows how this sweet man felt because he was really listening to me. Anyway, and this is kind of a sinister way to end the story. But it actually happened. And I didn't know the guy very at all. I just met him at that party. I come to find out the next week, he died in a car accident. And so, you know, like in his last moments on earth, 15 minutes was filled up with what must have been the most rotten ear-beating about modular synthesizers on earth and I didn't listen to him. And you know, it's not like I'm beating myself up or anything like that, but it does sort of like, if I had known that he only had a few days left to live, I don't think that I would have done that. So my question for you is, sometimes to me, I know I can listen, but sometimes I really feel like I lose the ability to listen. I get so caught up in my own bullshit that I can't listen to people anymore. And I'm faking listening. You know, like I'm nodding and looking and being intent and everything, but I'm not hearing a damn thing they say. Can you tell us a little bit about how we can cultivate the skill of listening in our own lives? Yes. And the story you told, it also links again back to the beginning when you were talking about how we don't, we don't get it. We don't really let it in about our mortality. Because if we really did understand that this body will be a corpse, right? The time of death is uncertain, but death is certain. If we really got that, we would have fewer of the kind of moments where we regret having wasted our time or somebody else's that way. And we would be more acutely, I mean, people who have a terminal diagnosis, sometimes they say this weird thing about how they're grateful because they never felt more alive. Right. And you think, really? But that's what they're pointing to, that they're acutely sensitive to the fleeting nature of being alive. And it's so precious and just as horrible and brutal as the world can be. It's gorgeous and exquisite too. So I think to listen to each other requires a little bit of mindfulness and we have to learn to recognize what's going on in our own minds while we're listening. We have to learn to, how do you be aware that you're actually thinking about something else while somebody's talking to you? Right. You know, cause lots of times we don't even realize it. We just realize, oh God, I didn't even hear the last paragraph. That's right. What about that? And then you have to pretend that you did hear it. Tell, I don't mean to stop you, but let's stop there just for two seconds. Cause I want to hear, cause that is a common, that has happened to me many times. Sure. And it happened to me too. What do we, so instead of lying and nodding and being like, I just heard this thing, what is a way that we could gracefully say, I'm sorry, I just completely tuned you out accidentally. Like, I think you can just be honest and say, you know, I was listening up until here and then my mind just like took a holiday. Right. Spaced out. And I missed the last thing you said. Right. Yeah. And if you do it that way, like, wow, that's really amazing how that happens. I could be sitting here, nodding, looking at you. Yeah. And completely gone. Yes. To the point where I didn't even hear what you said. Yes. Even though my ears can hear the sounds. Yeah. I mean, that's the kind of wild thing. If you think about it. Yes, it is. But we spend a lot of time that way in these sort of fugue states. Yes. Where we, what did you say? The robot. Yeah. We're not even sitting in the robot control chamber. You're like down in the bathroom. So I think that that's where I really do feel like a cheerleader for awareness. But it has to be what Ram Dass calls loving awareness. It has to be, mindfulness can just devolve into this self-surveillance system. That's riddled with judgment, you know, if we're not careful. Yeah. It's not that. It's supposed to be kind. Right. It's supposed to be loving and caring. It's supposed to come from a place of wanting to uncover the goodness that we all have in us. We all have sanity and goodness and clarity and love and compassion. It's our birthright. These qualities are innate. They just get totally covered over. So I am a cheerleader for doing practices that help us uncover and learn what it is that covers over our capacity for radiant presence with each other. Right. Right. And usually it's that we are lost in thought. We're in our encapsulated thought world, but we don't know how to recognize that even. Right. And that's where, I mean, I'm sure there are other ways, but the way that I've learned and practiced my whole life has been this way of mindful awareness. When we sit and meditate, you know, they say meditation is the practice, is practicing for death. But I like now you're practicing for life. Practicing to listen. Yeah. I love that. Continue, I'm sorry to cut you off there. No, I think that's all I would say, except I was intrigued by what you said about practicing to listen, because in a way, listening is how we connect with our aliveness, like listening to our own bodies, listening to the sounds of life around us, that grounds us, you know, in the present moment, listening to our own inner voice and intuition. Every time I override that intuition, it's a disaster. Every time. Every time, Duncan. Yeah. I did it this year, recently. You did? I was in a Tabata class. I had, I had this, I was just totally overdoing it. I had done an hour of water exercise, and then I did an abs class, and then I went to the Tabata, and then she took us out on the sidewalk to do these sideways jumps. Yep. And I heard this voice in my head. It said, let's skip this one. You're tired, let's skip this one. But I went out anyway. Yeah. And we were on cement, and we were going fast, and I slammed, tripped on the sidewalk crack, and slammed my back into the cement, and broke my back. Oh my God. Yeah. I remember when you were through the tree, I saw you heroically. You saw me, it was only two and a half weeks later that I came to Maui. With a broken back. Well, you saw me, I always had to lie down on the stage. I couldn't sit up. But I'm just saying, the more it seems to me, it seems to me for my own life, like the more sensitive I get, and the more I know, what was it, John? Instant karma. But it comes hard and fast when I overlook what I know to be true, and just forge ahead. So I think that deep listening protects our aliveness too. Wow, listening is the connection to the universe. It's the thing that like, wow, it's like a weird, like, you know, they say when we breathe, we're connecting by breathing in everything, and breathing, but then when we listen, it's almost a form of respiration, isn't it? We're just receiving, receiving aliveness, yeah. Aliveness in the form of your voice, or in the form of the stillness in this room. Yeah, receiving it. What a joy to get to chat with you. Thank you so much for this conversation. My delight, Duncan. I will have all the links where people can find you, but do you have anything coming up at Inside LA? Yes, I do. We have, well, we have Joseph Goldstein coming Monday night, one of the great icons of Buddhist meditation, and then we have a really unknown person who's terrific named John Lockley. He's a South African Sangoma, which is a traditional healer, and a medicine man, and he's doing a day long on August 16th, and he wrote a book called The Way of the Leopard Warrior about his journey to becoming this. It's insane. He's a white South African who has- I met him at the Ram Dass Retreat in New York City. Yes, you know him. Yeah, okay, cool. So John is coming August 16th. George Mumford, my beloved friend who wrote The Mindful Athlete is coming in September. So we have great people coming, and then every Sunday morning, we have a live stream between 10 and 12, and when I'm in town, I teach it. When I'm not in town, other wonderful Inside LA teachers are there, and if you aren't able to physically battle whatever distance if you're living in a faraway place, you can always join us to meditate, and here's some teachings, and you can ask questions through the live stream and be part of our community that way. Beautiful. At Inside LA. Wonderful. I'll have all the links you need. That was Trudy Goodman, everybody. All the links you need to find Trudy will be at dunkatrustle.com.

What happened to all our money? Spin it on razors kid. I had to keep my face fully shaved for my job at the Laundromat and the only way I could do that is with the supremely overpriced razors at the local razor mark. Now we're broken. Your mom's dying of Ebola. Been added she gave Ebola daddy. I don't understand. She got Ebola by going to pick up razors for me at the local razor mark. She passed one of these aid workers who just returned from Africa. If your mother wasn't a chronic alcoholic, she might have noticed that the aid worker was showing the symptoms of Ebola. Bloody boils all over his arms and legs, dilated eyes, bloody diarrhea. He sneezed blood, ropey, bloody knots of parasite filled snot right into her mouth as she was opening her mouth and shocked horror at the price of razors. She swallowed at least three ounces of Ebola mucus and by the time she got home she was already showing symptoms herself and more than likely we've all been infected too. Oh no daddy, are you saying that you and me and mama are all going to die of Ebola because of the overpriced razors down at the local razor mark? Couldn't have said it better myself kid. You and me and your mama are all going to die of Ebola because of the overpriced razors down at the local razor mark. If only we'd used Harry's Shave Club.

Go to harrys.com forward slash family hour this is a great company support them they're supporting this podcast Harry Krishna. I want to start this podcast off by saying thank you to Adam Corolla for leading the war against patent trolls. I don't know if you guys are aware of this or not but some time ago a patent troll by the name of personal audio LLC said that they owned the patent for episodic content and therefore wanted a licensing fee from all podcasters. They directly sued Adam Corolla and they also sued a few other podcasters and they sent letters really spooky letters to some other podcasters saying that if we don't pay a licensing fee then they were going to sue us too. Patrons for those of you who somehow have missed this are is the name given to people whose business is based only on suing people. It's a really terrible grotesque awful thing. Quite often when they invoke these lawsuits they're expecting the company the small business that they're suing to fold because they don't have the money to pay for the legal fees. These people made the dreadful and terrible mistake that so many other people have made of sticking their greed stick right into the honey hole of the hive that is the internet and when the internet swarms beautiful beautiful things can happen. Adam Corolla led a crusade where he raised more than four hundred and fifty thousand dollars to fight this ridiculous patent and here is a beautiful beautiful statement released from personal audio. You can read all about this at ourstechnica.com I'll post the link on the comment section of this podcast but I'll briefly let me just read this statement from personal audio who is saying that they want to drop their case against Adam Corolla and that he is not letting them drop the case but it's continuing the lawsuit from personal audio. This is from the patent troll personal audio Adam Corolla's assertions that we would destroy podcasting were ludicrous on their face said personal audio CEO Brad Little but it generated sympathy from fans and ratings for his show ratings these are people who say that they invented podcasting and they don't understand that we don't get ratings but it generated sympathy from fans and ratings for his show getting his fan base to continue to donate to his legal fund is a cynical exploitation of the publicity power he enjoys as an entertainer he continued to say that personal audio is quite surprised Corolla turned down their offer perhaps this is because he feels he can simply get his fans to fund his future and now unnecessary legal expenses or perhaps it relates to how he uses the case as material for his show the fact of the matter is that Adam Corolla is asking people to donate money to him for a lawsuit that he no longer needs to defend we would like his listeners to understand this situation when deciding whether or not to donate additional money to the cause according to personal audio they've lost interest in suing podcasters because the podcasters even one of Adam's Corolla size just don't make enough money for it to care they haven't stopped suing podcasters you would think that the reason that they decided to stop suing podcasters was because they suddenly realized that they were not just fighting a few individual podcasters but actually found themselves up against legions of us who enjoy podcasting who enjoy listening to podcasting who enjoy creating podcasts and feel that anyone who would dare threaten such a beautiful medium for self expression is the lowest form of scum that has ever existed on planet earth you would think that the real reason that they stopped suing these podcasts is because suddenly they realized that they weren't like some schoolyard bully who found a paraplegic with bags of money attached to his belt but rather had stumbled upon someone who appeared to be defenseless but in fact was the leader of an army which Adam Corolla is in which so many other podcasters are and all of us band together and donated money to this and you can see the effect has been that personal audio is saying that they're no longer going to sue podcasts but here's the problem the patent still exists and that's why Adam Corolla is continuing to fight personal audio LLC because he is trying to invalidate the patent and also I think he wants to teach a lesson to patent trolls out there I'm guessing I don't know if this is for sure but I imagine there's some sense of wanting to show these people that you can't just file ridiculous lawsuits against small businesses who are putting out really great content into the world and not expect the force of justice in the universe to manifest around you and swarm upon you like black eyed hell bees from some terrible nest deep deep deep in the third circle of hell and I have a feeling that personal audio is just starting to understand what happens when you try to screw with the internet so guys I'll have a link to Adam Corolla's fundraiser for this this is not over until this patent has been invalidated this is not over until we completely crush this ridiculous case and make it so that podcasters of the future and podcasters now will never have to worry about some company trying to shake them down for what they call a licensing fee for a patent that from a failed business that happened many many years ago of course you can read more about this by it's all over it's all over everywhere you can check it out but I just want to say thank you so much to Adam Corolla for standing up in this way and for not being a greedy pig because Adam Corolla I have a feeling is probably doing pretty great for money I did I did I've never done his podcast but I've definitely been in the garage where his podcast happens and it's filled with really it's just nice and I know his podcast is super popular so if Adam Corolla wanted to be a lazy person or if Adam Corolla wanted to be a person who wasn't thinking about other podcasters he probably could have just paid the licensing fee that they wanted and it wouldn't have done much to him but instead of doing that he organized a campaign the campaign is clearly having an effect and even though they want to drop the case against him he is continuing the lawsuit and to me that speaks volumes for the kind of person Adam Corolla is so thank you Adam Corolla and guys definitely I'm I'm going to donate a little bit more to this thing and I think you guys should too let's really crush this threat because who knows even though they're not apparently not suing podcasters now it doesn't mean that they can't go back ensue us it's some other point in the future until the patent is completely invalidated this threat could exist forever and that's a spooky creepy thing all right we've got a great episode for

dunkintrustle family our podcast it's so cool to have you on the show the way we met is really interesting really interesting yeah but before we get into that uh I already did an intro for you but I you are an incredible photographer and an artist same thing and your pictures recently I have been trying to get a little bit into photography yeah you asked me for the million-dollar camera yeah I thought you were dicking with me no I thought you were dicking with me because I emailed you asking for a more and more expensive oh right no I was I'm trying to I'm pulling cameras out there like 35 65 thousand dollars like more expensive I was joking like I sent you well no what I did was I here's what happened everyone michael is a renowned photographer and uh you will see I'll have links to his pictures on the website and you will see that he's an amazing artist and so I thought well I want to get into photography and so I emailed him can you suggest a camera I didn't say an expensive one and you just sent back what was that when your initial response what's that kind called oh which one was it the Hasselblad or I don't know what it was I don't know it was but the camera was like I think it was like a ten thousand dollar camera or something like a like a like and that was your I swear to God you said I want the most expensive one my first one was a camera and your first response was oh try a like it I'm like oh cool a like it sounds like something I could buy it or a drugstore or something so I look it up it's a ten thousand dollar camera for a point and shoot yeah for a point and shoot uh but for you that anyway before we get into that the point is not you can't just be a photographer like it photography is really interesting to me because it reminds me of the it's there's a it seems so simple it's like I I believe a quote from you and Johnny Pemberton was that the photographers are what is it history's lost artist wow yeah because people see that but it wasn't it wasn't it was from the the piece that you did it was uh let me let me just get you some water let me get you some coke oh yeah yeah yeah like that dick well you know what man I to all photographers out there I apologize because ever since I've gotten my brother sent me a I don't know a Canon EOS Rebel or some kind of like and I put an a lens on it and I went riding around on my bike trying to take pictures of ducks and uh got home and put the pictures in being like these are gonna look great I'm sure they're just gonna be incredible and it's like the worst pictures you've ever seen they're boring they're stupid ducks it's it's but yeah go ahead they suck so my what I mean is photography is a really cool thing because it looks so easy when you see a photographer you're just seeing a guy with a device that he's pointing in the direction of something interesting collecting and he's collecting and you look at that and you're like whatever anyone can do that but when you try it yourself it's not like that so can you explain to me what is the process that you use when you take pictures but I think that's okay so backing up I do think that anybody could do it but they have to know they have to stake a claim in what they're doing so you can take shitty photos of ducks and say oh I'm a really good I'm a really good photographer but I might I take photos I do ducks but I make them look shitty so I look like an amateur does them you know and then and then if you get a handful of people like oh that's that's good I like them oh yeah I totally feel that right but obviously as you get better and better you know they're not like they're not the photos aren't shaky or whatever the hell your problem is is it's how much of photography is a technical understanding of the camera and how much of it is there's so many professional photographers that really don't use cameras I still when I do jobs I'll ask assistants to order the equipment because I don't always there's a piece of equipment called a butt plug and I don't know what it is but it makes yeah it makes me giggle when it's on the the um on the sheet but uh I know I know what I know what it is like I know what a butt plug is but I know what and then I know what a butt plug is but still I don't know because I like I do but I don't because I don't pay attention to the technical side yeah um I do know my technical side but very I keep it very minimum because my style isn't that style so it's everybody has their own style what is wait what the fuck is a camera butt plug it's no it's it's for the gear it's it's it's for the equipment so it's uh like um yeah I'm not going to be able to describe it see I don't even I can even describe it ask me to describe what it looks like you know no I just read that there it's just interesting that you say that because I did just read this thing about how there's a piece of equipment called a it's called a gag gag or something but it's like a camera inside a vibrator where you could take pictures inside this is what butt plugs look like yeah that's that's the butt plug I'm familiar with I'm very familiar with that that style but I've never heard of it anyway though so there's so much strange equipment that goes on with this and it's such a weird art form in that sense because it's so very very technical yeah and whenever things become really really technical for me it just feels like it's so easy to lose whatever that initial uh uh inspiration is that makes you want to start doing something you know it can get lost in the gears and the wheels well I think that's the thing is because the camera it is it's it's a handful of gears so it's it can go spin forward and backwards and sideways and left and smaller and bigger there's a lot of that going on but I think that people get caught up in that so you start off with this is this is my my idea is that most people when they pick up a camera they start shooting um it's shit shooting is what I call and it's shooting shit like rocks yes and uh uh signs signs and get get a get a flower yes after you get your flower get your then you start moving to ducks or you know things that you kind of take a step up you get some good landscape yeah uh and then you eventually you ask your friend can I take a photo of you you know you get to a human being which is a total that's when it gets that's when you realize that it's not technical at all that it comes down to how you're relating to people and you're relating to what they're you know you you have to have an emotional connection to the viewer so they're your audience and if you you have to play a game on how can I get uh this person to do whatever the hell they're doing and then for me to capture that in a way that the audience will relate to wow because a lot of I feel that what happens is that people get really caught up in the gear and they can make this really great image but it's boring as fuck yes because we've seen it a million times before so that already makes it we're jaded yes and then like we've already seen duck photos you know so so and then you have an idea of how good a duck photo needs to be but if you're thinking of in terms of entertaining your audience and you have that duck you can oh let me just make it even blurrier and call it duck soup yeah and then and then it's like the name is part of the the photo or you know that it changes the story of the of the image yeah yeah I get it and what you're talking about reminds me of um have you ever heard of you've obviously heard of the observer effect in physics which is that you you know that your perception of the way a thing works on the quantum level seems to have some some effect over the way the thing works this is a problem where the expectation and the quantum level this is something new age people love to talk about yeah is the very expectation of the observer seems to affect things on the quantum level yeah so in that same way when you're when you're taking pictures it's not just that you're taking pictures of the external world you're taking pictures of the way the external world is reacting to you the photographer you're taking a picture of a reaction that's based on you being in the environment so you're even though you might be taking a picture of a duck a flower or a person yeah you're really taking a picture of a reflection of yourself well and that's the the saying that photographers will say is that uh you never take a picture of the person you're really taking a picture of yourself they say that it's a it's a photographer thing and I know I was a photographer I always looked at a photography is you know photo is light and then uh isn'tography isn't that uh latin for study of so it's a study of light and so and I'm probably fucking this up yeah so someone is somebody smarter than me is gonna tell me that I'm an idiot but this is how I see it so you're a studier of light and then what is light well light is light is like god like god is is energy so you're a studier of of god energy you know so when you take a photo you are you really are you really just take you know you're taking a an image that will be placed onto instagram or onto uh facebook or wherever or on on your website or on in print but really you are studying something the more that I think that good artists they they're they're study they'll study the world and just happens you just capturing it or collecting it and it's just like putting rocks in a bag that you from a from a trip to the beach you know and you just look at this and oh look at this this red round rock this reminds me of but the red round rock you can understand it if I show it to somebody who doesn't wasn't there at the beach with me right and do you do you find that the when you're collecting these rocks or images do you find that your mood has an impact on the images if you go into a shoot with a and you're in a certain mood do you think it changes the result I I think that it yes but it's part of the thing where it is it okay yes but but the this is what I found is that the mood isn't the mood of the day so the mood is uh I think we have wider moods it's like climate change and people will look at the weather so today the weather is uh angry and and sad you know the the next day it's happy and fun and the next day is but what I found is that I'll go through and I'll purposely make new make a new body of work so I'll spend a few months looking for a new way to look at the world and when I look at the world through those that lens I'll make it uh I'll come up with words like I'll make it it's the expensive world oh yeah expensive cool and dark and so for a month I can look through change the filter in my eyes yeah you know in my mind and just pull it out and say well do I want to look at the world as happy and whatever or or right now or recently I went through one that was very moody dark and macabre yeah and so I built this whole body of work wow within two three weeks where it just and then I could see it and I could turn it on and then of course I'm you know hanging out and doing other things and then I lose the that macabre dark moody but I think that if I'm able to do this to myself I know other people can do it too yes you know we can and if we can do it we're probably already doing it right or it's happening to us right and we're not aware that it is happening to us on you know if I'm able to do this if I'm able to create an image and I know that I can make a dark moody feel that will make you feel dark and moody when you look at it if I get a girl smiling happy in a photo and she's saying in her in her mind I love you when you look at the image you're going to see someone saying I love you right and you're going to feel loved yes so you have to think too what is the media you know especially within my world what's the media what are the messages being sent a lot of it's like it's happy it's good everything's okay bye bye bye you know and not ever slow down and look around and it's okay that you have a bad day and you know it's okay to buy it's okay to to do this shit but but I do think that if we look at our minds in terms of climate that way I don't know I'm playing with that really cool man it's so it's so it's kind of like to go back to the idea of God being light or light being the you know like the purest form of matter and it's sort you're you have this insane device that's capturing these packets of information or converting them into ones and zeros really yeah converting these things the question is how much information is being stored inside uh inside the device that we don't even understand yet like when you're taking a picture you're taking you know you're taking you're capturing the photons bouncing off of whatever it is that you're pointing the camera in the direction of but what else is inside those photons is it possible that the actual emotional resonance of the subject mixed in with I think they do so you think that somehow these devices are transforming these packets of information that contain within them not just the physical form of what the weird as that sounds I think that it it's picking up their emotional resonance I think that there's a level of it I don't think I think it weakens it's like taking a copy of a copy but I think that you can if it's um because you have to you know it's it's uh we took photos last night you know we took polarized and when you look at them you get this happiness from it yes and then some people just say see it as others were happy people and then other people will look at it and get that energy and then other people will be angry because it's it's the you know the idea that what's the word what is that joke that what's the worst what's the ugliest sound in the world it's other people having fun or whatever you know when you're not so it's you're looking at that might make that person angry but there's still I don't think that it's this heavy strong emotion that you know this or energy but I think that there's there's a little weak signal in there that that it could possibly it could possibly because you know we don't know so why not why not just assume that it does I think it's a good idea to think that way this is in sigil magic when they talk about the potency of symbols or the potency of you know if you look at like religious symbols or you look at occult symbols the pentagram for example you look at that thing and it well it gives you a feeling when you see a when you see the image of a pentagram you you will have an immediate feeling from looking at the thing now a chaos magician uh described this to me he said if you want to understand how powerful symbols are uh put a gun on a table when someone comes over and see what the mood's like in the house and you'll quickly happy time it's gonna be a great party so glad I came to the house with a guy has a gun on the table so the mood instantly shifts yeah so and so that's a symbol the gun is a symbol the gun activates the part of your brain that has a attributed all this stuff to a gun yeah the gun isn't radiating some kind of like dark potency necessarily or is it you look at a pentagram in the same way you're gonna like have a feeling when you look at that yeah now how much of that feeling is based on what you've are is a based on as you're saying the filters that are already in your brain and how much of that is actually radiating out of the symbol it's a it's just a curious thing because when you take a picture of a person and the person's smiling and you've captured the you're seeing a copy of these photons that were bouncing off of this image turned into ones and zeros you're also it's rolling through all the filters in your brain that what I'm trying to get at is whatever that packet of information that's in there what is the packet of information that's separate from your own internal filter that's the question is there some original new thing added to your brain like throwing a pebble in a pond or does it all just get lost in your filtration mechanism and then there's nothing happening at all I hope it's the former not the latter because the latter means we're all just our brains and that sucks yeah I don't I think it's it's uh I I'm trying to reassemble my idea of time and uh so I think that if I think that if you took uh it's right now so assuming that time where we have this this history with these memes you know so you have your pentagram meme that's been traveling through time yes and and then it hits today but uh I think that I think that it can change and it's the idea of uh one of the ideas I have with laughter is it's taking two ideas and maybe this has been said by someone before but it's taking two ideas and you collide them together and that causes the you know that the person that they they get that laughter because it's the sonic boom inside their body of their mind and their spirit and their soul oh shit this is a new way of looking at this thing and so I think that it will travel with stuff but that also can adjust over time it's the you know the color of the story of the color pink with men in blue nope so blue used to be uh feminine and pink was masculine okay and it was uh advertisers in the 50s or 60s that had changed the game and switched it so it was masculine to wear blue and feminine to wear pink so there would have been this meme going along so if you met a man and he's wearing pink like oh that's that's a man tough guy yeah he's gonna kick your ass pink but then it shifted because somebody said I don't want this to be like this anymore I want this to be different somebody had an idea so somebody had a sonic boom within themselves it said this is going the wrong way or or they were evil and said I'm going to make it my way whatever the hell it was and it's like the idea of uh jaywalking you know jaywalking the way that they you know about this how that started with uh uh uh it it was an advertising agency for the auto manufacturers I believe and it was because cars were you know cars were new and they're ripping through the streets just killing people running over people oh my god so they and people didn't like the cars so so the advertising agencies created radio jingles like watch out for that jaywalker see he's a bad person and a jaywalker was a bad man because he was lazy and he crossed in the middle of the street and didn't wait for that important car yeah getting its way around yeah so I think that I think that the hold so uh something will be something but then it'll change right so you can so I do think that we are I don't know if we're changing or if it's changing us or if it's just the world but I do think that you know if you wanted to take us any symbol we could change it today we could turn something negative and turn it into a positive take a positive take it to a negative take something that's dull and make it something mean something right so I don't know I don't know who's who's responsible for that's that's that's a question I would have is who's responsible for changing these things all right you know yeah who is that let's answer the question who is responsible for that man Donald Trump I think he makes a lot of a lot of decisions he's got a tower just like every wizard has a tower have you heard about his his son-in-law over here in the east village no he's his bread this dickhead it's just going through and buying buildings and then just kicking out all the rent controlled people or making it uncomfortable it just but it's great that he's bred more more more dickheads yeah yeah well that is interesting that idea that is a and that's that's that's where you can you you get into the wonderful place of trying to decondition yourself because you start to consider what are the ideas in my mind that have been implanted there by people like Donald Trump and what are the ideas in that are in my mind that are just original ideas yeah how much of my mind consists of symbols in or rather not symbols because a symbol it just exists like for example the pentagram I was walking on the beach in Georgia and I found a starfish okay or a I'm sorry a sand dollar and on the sand dollar there's a pentagram just a pure slayer pentagram heavy metal that's 666 on his belly no 666 just this pentagram on this fucking sand dollar and I'm like well this sand dollar is evil right that's what the conditioning will tell you but really what you're just seeing is like a recurring geometric form that has been existing since the beginning of time and then the hairless monkeys saw this recurrent and turn it into something well you know probably initially they looked at it and they were like wow mathematically this is a really interesting shape and also a human has five appendages sticking out from the torso and this must represent human beings and then wow this is like the mathematical pattern of a perfect human form or the human form is some kind of yeah pentagram that's emerging out of the universe that can walk around all that stuff but then somebody was like shut the fuck up you're freaking me out that's just an evil thing to think we're not pentagrams and then it ended up where heavy metal bands you think it came out of fear oh yeah for sure I mean clearly the shape has no there's no evil potency about the pentagram but if you know youth pastors across America every single day are railing against a geometric form like this that's what the evil satan is used a pentagram those satan has got that pentagram on the sand dollar do you know what I mean so so the question is how many of those instantaneous reactions that you have to the world have been placed there by corporatists industrialists and people trying to actually shape your brain in a way to make you the perfect all over us they're all over us all over us complete our beards are a part of it for me so there was a was it I think it was lever and I can't remember who the other one was they came out with this they didn't call it the war on men but it was the idea of having war on men and so this I you know this I was shaving my head this is four years ago so shaving my head and shaving my beard and then I heard about this war on men and what it was because they weren't making profits for men so if you're going to make more profits from men what do you what do you do well they got to shave off that hair right you got to get that that going so that's when I stopped shaving my my beard is you know I'll trim it but yes because it I don't want to be too crazy but part of that came from knowing that they just want to sell me razors I don't need to shave my face all right I have no reason but so it's like we literally are wearing results of it because even our decision to have a beard came from somebody personally not personally but impersonally attacking my gender and then what is gender right you know and and you can go deeper and deeper and deeper into all this stuff on what we are and who we are but I think that a lot of the shit that we do I think that if I always like the idea of stripping it all back throwing us at the caveman days narrowing it down to 50 people yes so if we all went back 50 people or down to 50 people I would be the guy that we would all have a responsibility and we would just go out there and we'd run around and we would collect food and kill animals when we all get back you're the guy that's going to tell the jokes and tell the stories of the day and get them kind of thinking yes I'm the guy that's going to put his hand on the wall and spit on it yeah I made art guys yeah and that's it and we have a handful of others of of what we're doing but then somewhere it just got so crazy where someone said they started twisting it on us and so that we we feel obligated to to make all of the decisions to wear to wear shoes versus not wearing shoes you you don't have to walk around the city wearing shoes right you have to drive you don't you get in your car do you really need to wear shoes but you feel this need to wear shoes that's fascinating and you don't think about wearing driving without shoes on feels like you're is that against the law I don't know I do it though when I'm in a car I'll kick off my shoes it's great but yeah when you do it you feel like what the fuck this is my toes you don't know if I'll be able to stop right well yeah yeah yeah is this gonna fuck up the functioning into an accident are they gonna say oh this is caused by no shoes yeah that was it yeah that will be Nancy Grace will be talking about a barefoot car killer but but uh but the the so there's this great idea in the world and it's in every religion and the idea is that certain pieces of the universe are alive disembodied pieces of the universe are alive they're malicious malevolent they climb into us they control us and they call these things demons right okay so whenever people think about this they think about the movie version of the demons the exorcist yeah his head around that guy but if you really think about it you know I love the uh one of my favorite stories in the in the New Testament is the story of Jesus pulling the demons out of a man and putting them into a pig have you ever heard this story no it's really cool so I mean god damn the New Testament is so psychedelic and so creepy but Jesus is like there's I think it's an island that he's on I'm not really I'm not sure if it's not Jesus is on island the the the uh people there are upset because there's a demon possessed man who's been harassing them and apparently he has all this great strength and he's dangerous and deadly so Jesus comes to uh comes to him and like the demons say to Jesus something weird like you're not supposed to be here yet and he's like it's really as a as a thing like that his ship arrived like an hour early they're just up sour his flight came in I'm still eating my salad I didn't brush my teeth yet I was pooping I really needed to take a shit before you came in here and then and then he uh uh the the demon said something like the man said something about the demons inside of him wait wait the demon said that the man said no the demon that was in the man said we are Legion and it means that he was not just possessed by one demon he was possessed by uh just a swarm of demons so so Jesus took these demons and he cast them out of the man and into some pigs okay and the pigs went running off a cliff and all died and the you know the I think the villagers were like hey fuck you hippie you just killed all our pigs with the demons that you got out of this dude and they were pissed at him but when I think about demons modern demons I don't what I think of I think how much of a difference is it when you have a consumer completely brainwashed by the popular conditioning the corporate conditioning and you let you know when you listen to somebody and you hear them say something like you know the United States we're not perfect but we're the best country in the world but you hear that coming out of more than one mouth like so many people will say that until you realize like oh you've been encoded with that you don't you got you got the cold you got the cold yeah you got the cold someone put that in you so yeah yeah you clearly said the Pledge of Allegiance as a child sure over and over every morning yeah yeah so you ever wonder what happened to those kids remember that did you ever have a kid in the class that would not say Pledge of Allegiance no I was never had that we had a kid that didn't do I bet she's fucking cool now he's probably in Guantanamo Bay getting fucking force fed but the the uh so how many the that's a demon if that's not a demon I don't know the Pledge of Allegiance is no not the input when you say something okay that isn't an original thought yes it's been implanted into your brain by a powerful I would call it a wizard or a necromancer a magician who works for a massive corporation whose job is to implant demons into people that make them pay for things or buy things or say things that promote this product weren't you weren't you was it I was a little drunk last night were you talking about the uh cult brand the cult of branding or culting of brands yeah that was talk about that a little bit so basically it's um it's you take a brand and there's a cult around it so so you think of the apple you the apple is an easy one because there's fanboys so they you I don't even know where to start with this all brands all successful brands and when I say successful it means that they are making my my version of it would be that they're making enough revenue to continue moving on as as a collective right you know so they can they their product may change or whatever um they may be good-hearted people like toms is a good example of a brand that they treat their employees supposedly they treat their employees well and they do good and they're making basic products shoes and toothpaste right and then there's others that are more nefarious but with each of the brands you have if you if you want to make a good brand you'll turn it into a cult so you'll have it so that there's just the same with a normal cult you get a specific language you get people to follow it you get people to talk about it you get people uh you get it's just I where am I going with this it's uh you have I because now I have apple stuck in my head I want to move away from apple because I think it's like an easy target but I think it's a great it's a well-known great you know a great take BMW okay this this uh BMW is different it's not it's a little bit more uh separate from but you get people that will think negatively about BMW and people think very positive and they'll wear a BMW logo yes or and they have they'll meet up other people to have BMWs yes and so so they've succeeded BMW succeeded at creating a cult and they have a but cult is just a culture so there's nothing wrong with a culture it's just that there's different cultures uh and so your culture if you're a Lamborghini or if you're a Prius your Prius people your culture of Prius doesn't really get along with that side that that does like the Humvee culture sure so I think that part of it is accepted these are different cultures I think the way to because there's so much hatred between cults well yeah sure yeah that you're talking about these like little mini paradigms that have been implanted in people's brains by these um here's the reason I think that even though you're trying to paint the picture is one where it's not so sinister yeah I think that it is a little sinister and the reason it's sinister is that when you're with Apple when you're working at Apple and you're in the marketing department of Apple and you're coming up with phrases or you're looking at the entire scope of the way people think about Apple yeah so when you're sitting there talking you're not just looking at like what's great about Apple you're looking at like what's the controversy about Apple what's the most controversial thing that people say about Apple so that you understand the entire scope because you recognize that you know whenever some controversy springs up you recognize that just always makes more money for the company you know that the controversy tends to work out for the better because it promotes you publicizes you gets you out there the long and short of it is what you're doing on a daily basis as a marketer working for any for any cult yeah is that you are working on new spells and these spells are called the ad campaigns yeah and the ad campaigns are these assemblages of images video and most importantly slogans that are designed to swim through people's ears get into their brains and yeah just do it and they grow there just like demons and then if you've really pulled it off if you've really really pulled it off yeah then what you do then the demon that lives in the person's mind is this packet of information that consists of a image and a slogan and an icon an icon it's a logo yeah that person will infect a person near them with a demon and they will begin saying things that they think are their own original thoughts but that has been that the demon is actually working through them so that they start talking about things that are related to the brand for example they might start saying something like you know what man I just don't get PCs it's like they break down all the time yeah really hard to use they get viruses I mean I just don't want to deal with that shit I want to be able to plug something in and it works yeah and you think you're saying that because you've thought of that but there's a small chance that somebody in some you've read it somewhere yes you've you've absolutely read it somewhere and it's very hard to shut it off yeah from from my world of doing photography and making art I try to not look at stuff but then I have to look at stuff because it's just part of the world that we live in and then I enjoy it too so and it does infect you and then you have the infection and and then there's a part where you know we do we have a jesus to come around and pull the legion out of us and throw it in some pigs yeah do we have that I don't think that we necessarily have that I think that yeah we do do we lsd friend that's true get some ayahuasca down the hatch yeah yes yeah you're right that will get the demons out of you for a second and but the they'll come right back and you know go going to a nice retreat going to a ramdas retreat meditating this kind of stuff for for a second this the like man I was in um uh when I was in this on this island off the coast of Georgia I remember watching a deer running through the forest and there was a swarm of gnats fought like a cloud of gnats around this poor deer and he's galloping to try to get away from the gnats but every time he stopped they're just surrounding him again so a psychedelic will lift this cloud of symbolic demons that are have used our minds as hives away for a second and during that second you see yourself as what you really are you see things for what they really are and you're like oh fuck I am so conditioned and brainwashed that I don't even know what I am and then before you know it they're back on you but you you always remember that time where you realize you have that place to escape yes you can always bring it back yeah yeah and and people call the unconditioned state people will call that unconditioned state crazy the word that people have for the unconditioned unbrained wash status so that that right there so this is this is a game that we could play where crazy crazy doing acid in an unconditioned state or just unconditioned state through meditation acid whatever the hell you want to do that is considered crazy so let's play marketer for a second okay if you want to play this game let's do it let's flip that so let's let's create a meme that takes the unconditioned state and makes it something beautiful and love now let's do another that's fun I like that that makes it something beautiful and love I was going to say let's do it so that it sells coke like if coca cola was like how do we make these acid heads drink more coke like like hey when you're in an unconditioned state free from the corporate symbols that we've infested your mind with what's better than a nice coca cola that's what I needed oh brings you right back down from the unconditioned state get down from their son yeah whenever I want to come down from my unconditioned state that's making me annoy people at dinner parties while I talk about corporate conditioning I drink a nice coca cola I sit down in front of my apple get on my Harley right out into the sunset wearing my dock martins I know what you mean though man it's really cool to like the idea is like you get this it's like in the same way that like the on you can download how to build an atomic bomb from the internet don't say that in front of my computer yeah like can you imagine you and I trying to assemble an atomic bomb our hair would fall out we know shit our eyeballs would fall out within the first day we have no idea how to deal with that shit but you can take that's the funny thing is that you can take the exact same tactics these dark corporate wizards are using and turn it against them in a way to do what you were saying which is like because the thing is too is when you meet the people that are in those organizations they're not bad people right they are just trying to do a job and and they're a lot of times you you you when you break it down they're fucking cool people yes they're just they gotta pay rent and when rent just keeps ratcheting it up higher and higher higher it's this thing where sometimes I think that you know I want to blame corporations but then sometimes you step back and like well it's not really the people and then it's the the hive mentality maybe that's what it is but then you have to look at the the effects that are happening to the hive so you know what I'm looking at New York is real estate same thing's happening in San Francisco it's fucking expensive to live out here a tiny ass this a two bedroom apartment in East Village $4,500 yes you know and unfortunately I got mine for not that but can you imagine if you moved out here because you just wanted to be an artist yes and you had to come up with $4,500 a month and you're a new artist yeah and then you got offered by this company to come up with just come up with shit that people will find catchy and will get stuck in their brain yes like oh fuck I don't but I just want to live here and I want to make art what do I do what do I do and some people are fortunate enough that they have enough integrity that they can fight through that and they're willing to be broke and poor and live in a smaller place and slowly work themselves up with through integrity but other people they're not bad but I think that things like that can affect it that we're not looking at so we'll blame a corporation but we also have to look at this is a this is a being that's trying to survive and the the parts of it want to live and they have to survive but they're dealing with the environment and the environment is crushing them well yeah I think that's yeah I I I think another version of that is like you find yourself suddenly in the United States military let's say for example you find yourself as an Israeli soldier okay you know and you you look at what you you look at the end effect of like you know being a soldier in Israel right now is it a bunch of kids are dying so the organism that you're a piece of you're if you're in the military if you're a soldier yeah then you're a tiny little cell in the body of a dragon yeah and when you when you recognize I like the idea of the dragon okay it's a dragon I love the the visual of that though yeah it is it is a dragon and you look at the combined the Gestalt yeah the Israeli military yeah what you have there is a dragon sure as shit if you look at what's happening it's blowing fire on buildings it's dropping bombs on buildings you know it's the dragon is consists of every single every single person is a pixel in this dragon that forms whenever there's conflict or when it when it feels threatened yeah it turns into a dragon like Voltron it assembles all these little pieces and flies over cities and into ends up indiscriminately killing kids yeah so you're one little it's called diffusion of responsibility because you're not the dragon itself and you're one little cell in the dragon just doing my job yeah I'm just I'm just processing I don't I don't yeah yeah well and the thing that's always scary to me too is that if the if the dragon flipped and started breathing fire on its tail yes you know and it's uh it's if if just bad shit went down and would would the would military soldiers have the would they would they okay the FEMA death camps let's play with this okay so imagine that you're some 18 year old kid from South Carolina and you know you have a conscious you've been listening to Duncan you've been listened to you know for years you're you're just you're doing the right thing but you're joining the military because it's an option yeah it's the most feasible option that you have so you go in there and uh fast forward two years and the entire time you're doing just doing good for you you're meditating you're doing your thing yes but now your boss says we actually are going to do a war on your own country on our own people yeah because we just can't we we can't feed the people we can't water the what the hell they can't do so will that kid how how would that kid get out how would that kid be able to and also infect that group to say we're not doing this because I think once they realize that they can't do it to their mother like we need you to go back home and we need you to slaughter your entire family yeah that kid knows that that's not right but he's hearing it from above I have to do it yeah so he's he has to make a decision but if they can start if people can start seeing that they're a part of this dragon that's just firing dragon at or firing fire at their brother or sister across the enemy line which they are exactly it what would be needed to be implanted what meme or what icon or logo what would we what what slogan would we need to install to get them to stop fighting I yes I think I think it's the the meme that I named Carolee Baba said which is love everyone serve everyone remember God so the idea is if you just follow that and if you don't believe in God you could say remember the you know if you you have to eventually you're going to have to renounce your nationalism no matter where you live and I think that's going to happen so much easier for people I think that we're going to see in the next five ten years borders disappearing renounce your national identity that's the first thing renounce your national identity sacrifice your culture abandon whatever conditioning mechanisms have created a sense of separation between you and some other group embrace the idea that you're an earthling not an american israeli palestinian exactly whatever we're living on earth together and it's a beautiful beautiful planet and it's so wonderful to be here that we don't need to be killing each other anymore so what once people start realizing that which is the truth that's the truth outside conditioning once you start realizing that oh fuck man I got tricked by a bunch of old violent brainwashed vampiric demons they implanted a bunch of ideas into my head that are completely wrong clearly i'm just an earthling clearly there's no canada or united states or mexico there's just this one beautiful swath of land with a bunch of people living on it and so i'm an earthling so then the next time your commander comes to you and says hey man i need you to like fire bomb this orphanage or whatever it is they they're asking you to do you say no and you get arrested or you get shot you give up your life for the planet that's the idea is that if it's it's like another way to put it is at some point with israel and palestine somebody has to have this realization realization which is i would rather my children get murdered than be a child murderer that's the thing because the idea is that if you think they justify their violence by saying they want to kill our kids so they say the way we're going to stop people from killing kids is by killing kids so it's a bad form it's bad logic you know the thing is that the logic if you fall is like yeah that makes sense that makes you just kill them they won't kill our kid yeah it makes sense but it's just it's it's it's it's global it's what is it's globalized child abuse that happened generations and generations and generations ago so you have somebody's great great great grandfather who got into a fight you were telling me yesterday about the the two guys that speak only one language yeah they're the last two on the planet and then they don't want to talk to each other so they're thousands of years two dickheads that got into a fight like that and it just spread and it just got wider and wider and wider that's it that's it so i think if we just like we're look i've been abused and you've been abused everybody's been abused we're all we all react to our abuses and we don't realize that we do these things they're all in us and it's like and you do these things sometimes you just i really shouldn't be doing this but you it's just this like i have to do this thing and you're feeling guilty while you're doing it or whatever and the shame or whatever uh but it's it's you know noticing it being aware once you have that awareness step back and you know when and then i think i think that if we just agree with everybody that look i know that you've had some shit that your mom had shit your father had shit and your great grandparents had shit let's just try just today just to walk away from each other and get along yes you know let's just let's just let's not we don't need to sleep in the same bed together tonight we let's just i'm just gonna go for a walk we need some space we need some space we all need to go on a global walk well you know like here's one like okay if i say to somebody who's been really conditioned in whatever country they live in yeah i come to them and i say would you be willing to die for your country and they will say yes i would i would die for my country but if i go up to the shooter right there yeah right oh here we go that's not the solution but if i go to someone and i say would you be willing to die for your planet they'll be like hell no what am i some kind of commie i would die for my country but not my planet but it's people have to really have to move from their heads from the idea which is quite accepted and considered a heroic trait to want to die for your country yeah to if it's heroic to die for your country isn't it 15 million times more heroic to die for your planet and if it is more heroic to die for your planet and you really feel like that and you're a soldier in whatever military you happen to be in then what you would do is the idea and this would this this would horrify sharon and this would horrify hamas leaders and whoever is trying to engineer these terrible wars if the people realizing the that they would die for their planet poured out into the streets and laid down just like what martin luther king suggested lay down if palestinians came out and instead of hiding and cowering and uh not cowering i'm sorry that i said that but i would be cowering if i was i would i would be cowering i didn't mean that as though they're cowards i meant instead of being in these buildings they're being a human being i would fucking cower if they went out into the streets yes and laid down and here i am railies went out in the streets and laid down all the people yeah just went out and laid down the soldiers put their guns down the people dropped their bombs knowing i'm going to die today but when i die today i'm dying for my planet and i'm dying for a world where these mother these old demonic vampires no longer control us you would see the fucking color drop out of the faces of these warmongers because what do you do now yeah now you have to make now and there's video of bombs being dropped on just groups of nonviolent protesters they're doing that no if they did oh they did okay one bomb drops on a group of nonviolent protesters and that gets filmed and distributed and distributed and seen and seen which it would which it would then whoever dropped that bomb immediately loses the war they've lost the war there's no coming back from that when you drop a bomb on a ewan orphanage which they just did or ewan's shelter and killed so it's the opposite of a suicide bomber it's a suicide receiver it's a suicide protest which is a oh my god yeah it's it's the old monks that would light themselves on fire but that's it i think that yeah because it's if you know would you dive for your planet or even more it's like would you die for yourself yeah you know and you know that's what acid does you die you die i have this idea that every time you go to bed at night you die and you wake up and you're in this new incarnation so you just kind of pop in and pop out i used to i remember as a kid i'd watch my dad like is he gonna be the same person when he wakes up but then you know if you think about it when he went to bed he's kind of like this like i'm tired and a little cranky and stuff and he'd like fall asleep on the couch watching tv and then he'd wake up and he's groggy total different type of character but he's still part of this incarnation but when we do we die i think we die at night and we are reborn and when you do acid you die there's a big part of you that has to die yes and if you're already going to be dying or parts of you traits of you uh uh demons are dying yeah i think that asking these these these guys or these kids or whoever the hell just just go just die for yourself yeah that's a that's a that's a bold question ask somebody would you die for yourself or would you die for your planet but die die for it you would you or even more would you die to save some kids like you know you hear like whenever there's like uh what okay when somebody gets a purple heart or what no it's the now what's the big highest honor you can get in the military it's called the national medal of like it's a national medal of honor yeah it's for people who have thrown themselves on a grenade usually or have like done some incredible thing where they have given up their own lives to help the people around them right and they get the highest honor right but they only get that if they do it for their military you wouldn't get that if you did it for another in other words if you're on the quote enemy yeah and a grenade was thrown at the enemy and you threw yourself on the grenade then you would be that's that's okay so these the the the kids in the military that are defectors because they're so like they can't handle it anymore that's a good way to defect if you're going to defect don't defect by by walking off and then having people search for you and causing a whole shit storm back home instead go get yourself killed and protect the protect people protect human beings or you're just like yeah i'm just going to start protecting people now i'm not going to protect the right color people or the right the people who speak the right language or the people who worship the right religion i'm going to do what i can to protect all people and in comic books you know this every single superhero if there was a superhero that was like no i'm not going to protect this this swath of people because they're islamic or i'm not going to protect these the heroes are the ones who give up their lives in it to protect innocent people so basically and by the way this isn't my idea this is like when you watch any martin luther king's speech or any nonviolent protest or look at what gondy did and look at the effect that nonviolence nonviolent resistance has in the face of oppression you see that it just works yeah because you know is israel's already experiencing it and there isn't the the problem is whenever they find missiles underneath the schools that the israel's blown up it justifies for some group of people it's like see you had to kill them yeah but if there's no missiles there if there's just people protesting non-violently getting slaughtered then the way the world is right now is tightly wound as the world is right now and as is connected as we all are yeah holy fuck it would work so well it would it's it's so much more powerful than bombs and what's another way because i i'm a pussy i don't want to see people dying i don't want to see people i don't want to give people i don't want to give people the the advice to go out there and become martyrs for for freedom in a way that could kill them what would be what would be another way that we could you know what would be another suggestion that we could throw out there to i really i just i'm just picturing these kids i just picture some in some old man and just sitting around their their their ipod or their iphone listening and i want to give them i don't i'd love to give something what would be the ideal advice where i mean i guess that that is good advice but how can we do it how would we do it you're already here's the thing if you live in pal if you're a palestinian right now yeah since they're bombing the shelters you're you're in it you're a target already yeah you the problem the problem with that conflict is that there's closed borders yeah so you have these people living in a place that's about the size of manhattan from what i've read okay the borders are closed they they've closed off the uh the ocean so you are in so you're just a big pain just waiting to be exterminated wow and so so i'm i'm not i'm not as aware i'm just you're being exterminated so you are in a situation where you don't know where to go because they just bombed a shelter and they killed i don't know i can't remember how much it was it was like 130 kids 50 kids i can't remember a lot of kids died from this bomb so now here you are in this it's like you're we're in manhattan together getting bombed and people are telling you here's a safe place to go it's you in place if they're not going to bomb it you go there and you get bombed so now it's like oh well we're just getting exterminated so the the answer if you if you can't the answer would be you know if you don't want to if you don't want to fight back yeah if you don't want to fight back get the fuck out of there if you can't figure out a way to escape yeah get the fuck out of there right because the uprising isn't working shooting missiles it is real clearly isn't working you're out gunned you're out manned there's nothing you're gonna be able to do therefore if you can't get out of there and you're already in a situation where you're gonna die then it seems like you'd want to figure out a way to get as many people to join together and do marches and peaceful protests and i say strip it down i say they all seriously strip it i now is seeing that that makes more sense strip it down i i think they should just take all their clothes off and all walk naked where they become so fucking human there you go where just completely look old young uh all their color all of that take it all away just human fucking beings just walking and i think they should just walk they should just they should just walk they should just continue walking and just walk it off and walk will they wait because what is it real walk into israel yeah walk naked into israel with your arms stretched out and and and like well i don't know what it is and god forgive me because i really don't know like i don't know what i don't know what your son because i know some people over there and i don't know if they have internet now do listen to this podcast and having been having like i remember like somebody emailed uh joe and i because they from palestine and they were talking about how there was bombs going off this was a while ago and they listened to our podcast and like ever since then you know it humanizes people so much they're just people and the people in israel are just people and then you that one then when these bombs are hitting it like creates something worse than anger in me it creates just this sense of like i don't know what it is man it's something that feels like heartbreak and then you're like well what the fuck do you do what do you do you have to you i think that that you have to um play commercial for apple yeah guys we're going to cut to a commercial for apple real quick i'm going to tell you what you do to solve the middle east crisis but first let's cut to an apple commercial i don't know what you do man but i don't know i think i think that i think that it needs i think that the fighting fighting fighting fighting back and forth that's not going to end it i think it does need to be so somebody just needs it it's i think we have the potential to watch it change in front of our lives for the the first time because we do have i mean i look at podcasts as pirate radio you know it's it's great because it's i mean it's it's yeah it's pirate radio so so yeah if you just walk around naked renounce your national identity if you're an israeli and walk right just keep walking right through if you're palestinian renounce your identity everybody get out into the streets as quickly as you can you need a very charismatic person among you who can like who can speak in an articulate non shrill uh hippy way the way that i get get get a child to speak for you there you go get get the children to sing a song that puts the world to tears that's it that's what you need you need stuff like that that's it and the more you do that you know and they're already i mean i don't know if you saw there was a huge protest here in new york um a bunch of acidic jews gathered together to protest what israel was doing it requires like in paris they fucked up because they started burning i think they were burning synagogues and stuff you know it's violent wow violent if imagine this imagine if martin lucer king had i don't know i'm sure you've looked at these because you're a photographer but you've looked at these pictures of the well-dressed black people in the streets of alabama getting hosed getting hosed and beaten awful and those images yeah were so much more powerful than if those black people had instead of being hosed had been kicking the shit out of the cops because the moment that they had done that then everything's over there there is a part i have you know the saying an image speaks a thousand words but i think it speaks a thousand languages i think if you get a strong enough image people will resonate it's going it you don't need to put a caption you people just can read it i i almost feel that it would be great what was it it's something like august 27th or something like that there was the do you remember the the 60s they had that disney the acid disney thing no what was that so um it's this a bunch of hippies went to disney and they announced we're going to go to disney and drop acid wow and uh the national guard was called in wow that's hilarious i mean i don't i'll butcher the story but uh i'm sure people can google that but it's they just they showed up there was not very many they thought there was going to be like 30 000 people and it was like 200 yeah just dropping acid and having a good time and just enjoying the rides until they started working like clockwork and just moving everybody out and shut down disney at 6 p.m. oh my god but it would be great to go to these to to have some kind of it's almost like you know improv everywhere yeah you know how they just do goofy shit yeah what if there was an improv everywhere for activism but the activism isn't just weird it was it's like humans everywhere so on the the the the anniversary of that yeah that date what is it a shit ton of people go to disney with the purpose of stripping down and protesting and walking all the way through or you know and then where else would they go i don't know disney disney land disney world's all like think of but just or or or whatever or because i think that you know people will put there i think we've just lost sight of humanity and because we are wearing these cloaks we're wearing these disguises and these and and again i don't think there's anything wrong with people dressing up and having their own style and wearing you know it's it's a very conflicted part for me working in industry so close to commercialism and so close yeah to to it all and so i can respect both sides but there is a part where there there are people that go so far about it and they i i think we've lost our identity with humans it's it's like going into someone's house that doesn't have plants i think that we're a society that doesn't see people yeah we see identities crazy we're people blind yeah we just see two eyes wrapped up you know and in the summertime we see skin yeah uh there's eyes somewhere you know right but i think that just we i think that if we i think that would be a great thing too to show solidarity is every everybody start finding their thing in cal and canada they can go to the calgary mall or some shit and and do this but everybody just i like humans everywhere i think that's really cool man and i think what that what you would need is like because i i was thinking like i was getting so so angry about uh and so dismayed like i've i've just been fixated on this shit happening over there uh and also the stuff in the ukraine and the fact that somebody just blew a plane up with kids in it uh and i was kids and aides researchers yeah that like you don't know about no i know about yeah though i just thought just the flight was that although it was missing although it was missing was like panda babies being transported just just it's it's just a plane of love and goodness yeah coming everyone's stone coming from amsterdam it's like these aides researchers kids yeah yeah it's but i was thinking like i for a second i was thinking of like and i know this is all just so in a way it's empty but i think anything that i know a lot of people get mad at like social networking protesters or social networking activism because it seems so lame or weak or something but i think anything's better than nothing and i was thinking about and you feel so helpless anyway when you hear about this shit that you don't know what to do but for a second i'm like all right i'll just change my twitter uh avatar to a palestinian flag and then i realized like no because when i do that i'm taking sides which is why humans everywhere it'd be really cool if somebody came up with a a symbol for that so that you could so that you you are aligning yourself not with any national identity just a skin poor yeah that's it just a skin poor everybody's got when you might i was taking a hand someone's missing a hand i i don't know this black and white skin maybe someone will come up with it you know sometimes we spew these ideas out here and people come up and actually like fall through with them so you never know sometimes like people will like do stuff but some way for people to like you know it'd be so cool is like a something you could say that's kind of blasphemous if you're super conditioned where you renounce your national identity and uh become an earthling you know you like you use some kind of oath or a pledge of allegiance that isn't based on your national identity or an oath you take or some weird thing you say yeah where you permanently renounce forever your national identity and just consider yourself an earthling from now on that'd be pretty fucking cool you know like just you know whatever your national symbol is you like publicly destroy it so that people understand that you're no longer but that's a violent act so maybe that's not maybe maybe just an easier way is just a transition into it because you you do need it's like when you leave a cult uh and they bring in those this specialist that will help you transition and there's it's it's not you don't walk away from the cult and see your family and suddenly life is perfect you you have withdrawals from it yeah so there is a transition and there's a window and and to respect the people that are still in it so that you're not i hate you because you still have that america you just know they're in a cult you just know that they're in a cult and to walk away and so yeah it's the culture of humanity moving toward the culture of humanity uh and maybe maybe wasn't there was a language wasn't there a language uh asperand yeah what if that was brought back yeah you know it's it's uh uh these languages that are dying what if we took a language that was meant to bring everybody together and just ever just learning this yeah what if it was and we had uh teachers that would teach this and we just moved because everybody's technology is going to take care of that you know because what's going to happen is remember did you ever read hitchhikers go to the galaxy i never read it oh it's really funny one of four people that haven't there was a thing there there's actually a website called babel fish where you could put in any language and it'll translate that language instantly but that comes from hitchhikers guide because there's a little fish you could put in your ear called a babel fish and it would change any language into the language that you understand so i think technology is going to take care of that by making it so there's an instantaneous when you could you could like have headphones in that whenever anyone around you is talking it immediately will convert into your language so we so instead of having to go through the process of learning a whole new language yeah we'll all we'll all in technology will be the new language technology is the new language yeah you know that's our that's our connective neural connect connect connective tissue but man how much time shit we what time is it it's uh it's been an hour we got off course here yes uh before we wrap this thing up i meant to talk because we even didn't even talk about your job as i just said you were a photographer but you're like a fat you shoot for models you're a fat you're a but i'm not a i'm i don't think i'm a fashion photographer i don't know no i think people people lump me in that community but because i shoot with models but i'm not i don't see myself as a fashion photographer i don't really care about the fashion as much i have some fashion clients uh but mine is more about art and ideas or concept they're just beautiful images or this is what i wanted to ask you okay regardless of i'm sorry i know i didn't mean to like shove you no no no no no no no and i said cheesy question so and just you're a fashion photographer when i ask it you don't have to you know you know anytime you've seen joe's uh fashion photographer bruce testinos no he made this video it was when he had hair of bruce testinos this fashion photographer hilarious i've been seeing that i'll send it to you can put it up too it's it's hilarious anyway here's my question for you yeah god forgive me it's such a cheesy question but i thought about it yesterday and it kept popping it in my head i just want to ask you this so forgive me it's such a dumb question it's like a miss america question can you since you're you're always working with like really beautiful people and your photographer i want can you define beauty for me what is beauty i'm sorry that is a tough one yeah it's a little cheesy no kidding it's good and no it's a good one because i think that there's and there's there's cheesy responses well we're all beautiful um yeah and you can go off of some people will measure it through they'll try to measure it through i can go this actually is a good question because i can break some of the the shit because they've done whole documentaries on beauty and they brought in photographers um who are just staring at people but i do think that i think that because okay so you you get these attractive attractive women right yes and they're symmetrical but then you meet some of them and they're they're so beautiful inside but then you know they're others aren't aren't you know so you can't take the beauty of the face value that takes that away i sometimes think that what happens though i think there's attractive and then there's beautiful and so beautiful is pretty general and i think everybody has beauty somewhere and then when you get into attractive then we're dealing with symmetry and things like that right that that cut away with it but i think that beauty is uh it it's it is the question that we all get asked and i've never i i don't think i've ever been asked this question though and i see other people respond to it and i always think ah that's so stupid it's an impot maybe it's an impossible question to answer i think but i think it's a discussion though because i think that people will have an idea of what it should be because of what they've seen and one of the things that i do is from my work is that i try to find things that are interesting because i find that beautiful yeah so i have a buddy that i brought on my podcast who does beauty photography and his beauty he after we stopped the recording we talked a little more and it was he or maybe we did it on the the podcast but he talks about how he wants very clear beauty and i like interesting looking people so when i cast models i want somebody who has like big lips or big eyes or some something special about them that makes it more more interesting yes um but then i'll also find cases you know and i and it's uh i got contacted by an agent to shoot uh this 35 year old olympic former olympic swimmer kasey legler who has this huge following of people because she was the first female model to work on the men's board uh on the what men's board so as a male model oh wow whoa yeah and she's just an interesting character so they contacted me to shoot her and she had just shot with the two other cast bird and uh ryan mcginley so two big photographers that have been around forever and then they asked me to and i basically built her book and i brought her in a couple times to build this and it was so fascinating i mean her world is fascinating because she's she's she's interesting so that is beautiful so i shot her to look like a man and i shot her to look like a woman but not like oh it looks like a man it was this is a character so i made her look like uh she's in the 1980s hanging out on the street when uh her business is not going well you know whoa and and so it's it looks interesting or she's she's got a nine to five job in midtown um so that's interesting to me and um there's this girl that i just recently saw her name is boy child and she's a performance artist and she smothers her face with paint and does all these crazy things and that's more interesting yeah to me and that's beautiful because it's somebody who's has something inside and so a lot of times when i when i work i work off of the the character and the personality and the person and i don't really you know of course some people are more attractive and so it draws you in yeah and if i'm doing just a visual you know just a visual on the body or the face works for it that's that but i really like the people that have something going on that's just different you know even when i shot you that was the reason why is because it's like you're a beautiful person you're a beautiful you're beautiful who's a pretty boy who's a pretty but you know you know it's it's you have something beautiful going on and uh and rom das i sought that shoot out because it's beautiful and then sharing you know it's it's on paper if you said that if you asked a fashion ask talk to a fashion photographer or let me tell tell them i'm i'm going to hawaii and i'm going to shoot an 82 year old man who had a stroke who had a stroke in a wheelchair uh and i'm going to shoot a woman who's larger yeah and her what is she 50s 60s uh you know Sharon Salisburg Sharon Salisburg and i fucking love them they're so beautiful and when i told rom das that we're shooting you for a fashion magazine he's like what are you talking about i mean i look like this is he looked at me that's what he said this is fashion it's sitting by the pool like yeah it's fashion well it is it and it really you know because because it's kind of like the the the to me one of my favorite things about being around rom das is within 30 seconds to a minute of being around him you're not seeing an 80 year old man who's in a wheelchair at a stroke yeah you're just seeing love and the physical form seems to be just some something that that that that is barely able to like surround this thing that's pulsating out of him yeah and that to me is such a relief to recognize that no matter what your age is no matter what your physical condition is it is irrelevant yeah when you connect to that deeper part of the self and really uh have the courage to just let that come out and not cover it up like you're saying with the clothes that you wear or the things that you veil yourself in when you just like are your personality traits or what are your rather your ego mechanisms when that thing's shining out you you really it doesn't matter what you look like you could theoretically be a reanimated human turd yeah some evil biologist brought to life if you've tuned into the love inside of all things and that's shining out of you chances are people aren't gonna well they're gonna see the turd but not for long it's gonna you're just gonna see the love coming out it's amazing yeah and i yeah i think that and and absolutely and you think you can capture that energy on camera well some stuff is so ineffable you can't do it i was i did a project out in the cascades and so the art director or a friend of mine was oh shoot the cascade or shoot the mountains like and i'd shoot it and i can't really i can't capture this yeah i'm just gonna enjoy the moment because i can't i can't capture this and there's a part where maybe i'm just not technologically advanced enough to capture the the wonder and the beauty and everything of the mountains and when i look at the photos that i did with ramdas it's i captured what i could capture and there's a little bit of it but there is still like i said earlier it's just a little bit because there's so much more when you're around that and when you're in that energy you glow yeah and and it feels it there's this expansion it's like going going there is an expansion pack it's that part of the matrix where they plug you in instead of learning martial arts you learn to i'm gonna accept myself that's incredible that's a great way to put it you mean where they plug you in and like yeah they teach you all yeah exactly i need to learn how to fly a helicopter yeah you're getting encoded with something that you don't even i still don't understand but what it does shift you in the same way like a green psychedelic trip does it it will transform you and the the the um the i think there's something good about the fact that you can't capture all of that that you that it's that there is a need to be around a person uh what do they call it darshan there is a reason that you need darshan with a person darshan is the term they use for when you're around a deity or when you're around a guru or saint they call it darshan okay and and it's sort of like it's this is what i think about with live comedy versus tv comedy when you're watching tv comedy you're seeing the language you're seeing the mannerisms the acting of the comic but when you see live comedy you're picking up a whole other thing coming out of them it's a big big difference and so yeah there's only a certain amount you can capture but um and then and then you also screw with it once you get into editing and i don't just mean you know with photoshop and all of that but also the layout of how it's how is it distributed and how is it seen that can also affect it you know that television show it's when you see it live it's all around you and how you have somebody laughing behind your head yeah you know that's a vulnerable thing to have somebody cackling behind your head you know and and all and surrounding you uh well you're also releasing your thing and when you're sitting in front of a television that's uh been edited down and taken the the cleanest spot so yeah it's um there there is something what is it darshan darshan darshan darshan sounds like a good name for a kid oh darshan yeah that's a great perfect thing to close this on um thank you so much for being on being on the podcast thank you and thanks for a lot of other things which i'm not gonna yap about here because it's embarrassing but you know what i'm talking about what are you talking about now what's the um can you uh can you uh tell my uh the people listen the let me just start over i'm gonna have to edit that because it sounds so retarded like can you tell my list like they're mine tell my bitches can you tell can you tell the people listening how they can find you okay my website studio donovan and then uh so go to studio donovan.com and then i have a tumblr and it's all linked on there what about your book i have my book god and drake and uh named after ramdas's quote treat everyone you meet like god and drake uh which was a very interesting to try to explain that to people because they had just seen me shoot kasey legler and thought you're doing some drake stuff now boy oh boy but um no i have my book god and drake it's sold on the website um and or there's a link to it on the website everything's on the website and then i'm also doing my podcast that i'm just starting uh and i don't quite have a name for it yet i'm still you you're gonna have to help me with that god and drake i can't do god and drake because i want to have it just a slightly different i did think walking home from ramdas's quote uh we're all just walking each other home but then i'm from spokane washington and spokane means children of the sun yeah which sounds very hippie bringing everybody and i'm just children of the sun welcome to the children's or then i thought uh sun people could like so i'll work it out they're all good those are all children of the sun's pretty badass it's hard to name something though it sure

441^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - 424: Bob Thurman Transcript and Discussion^2021-02-20^Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Friends, I want to invite you to hang out with my meditation teacher, David Nickturn, who is about to do a hundred hour mindfulness meditation teacher training. And if that's something that interests you, you can join him for a free online get together. All the links are going to be at dugoutrustle.com. And that's happening Wednesday, February 24th from seven to eight thirty and Wednesday, March 17th from six thirty to eight o'clock. It's sponsored by Dharma Moon and the organization that today's guest is connected to, Tibet House. All right, let's do this podcast. Maximum complexity, squirting from the one. Sometimes I wish I never got on the big bang bus. The big bang bus. I don't like dying, but I'm scared of having a body. That's why I keep doing this. You have a better solution. Where are you? That's Trulania Mump's new track, Big Bang Bus. That's off her album, Dissolving Album, which is available on Klexigore Records. And you can find it on all your various streaming feeds, rivulets, drizzlets, dribbles and low hanging icicle secretions. It's out there for you. My name is D Trussell. At least that's what I'm currently calling myself in this particular part of the multiverse and I welcome you. This is my podcast, the Dugoutrustle Family Hour. The intent of this podcast is to plant the seeds of as many future Buddhas as possible. You don't have to call it Buddha if you come from a different way of thinking. Call it whatever you want, awaken ones, astral blasters. You can call them messiahs, if that's what you're into. I don't really care the name for it. But the point of this podcast is if possible, and I'm fully prepared to fail in this regard, though I hope I don't, to be some tiny drop, a grain of sand on whatever cosmic scale is out there that measures out when we get blasts of fresh bodhisattvas to the time space continuum. Because no matter which way you want to cut the sacred egg that fell from the vast nothingness, the bottom line is if we're in some energetic system within which energy cannot be created or destroyed, the very least we can do is we tattle along from childhood to middle age to late middle age to late, late middle age to extremely late middle age to later middle age. And then eventually to full desiccation from the forces of time and the eventual collapse into a gooey pile of rotting mucousy gunk that used to be the very same pile of meat that our loved ones kissed us on. Then we might as well try to prepare the future as best we can so that should what pretty much every single being that I have some respect for proves to be true that not only does our energy stay in this universe, multiverse, omniverse, whatever you want to call it, but also that that energy reconfigures itself as some sensory apparatus based on our former karma. Then to put it in simpler terms, when I come blasting out of the next vagina that I merge into this universe from, I would like it to be a happy vagina, not just happy because causes and conditions have configured in a way that are creating a temporary, fleeting, illusory form of happiness, but happy because this is an enlightened vagina that I'm emerging from, or at least a vagina existing in a time period in which enlightened beings have appeared. And so that's the intent of the DTFH. We've got a wonderful guest for you today. Bob Thurman is a genius. He's a scholar. He's written many books. He's one of the people who participates in an incredible organization out there, which is called Tibet House, which you should look up. This is an organization that is dedicated to preserving the culture of Tibet, Tibetan Buddhism and all the wonderful, beautiful forms of art and philosophy that are currently encapsulated in what's known as a diaspora, which is the scattering of the Tibetans from Tibet, which happened after the Chinese invasion. He's friends with the Dalai Lama. I could have just said that. But also he is, as far as I'm concerned, one of the coolest people I've ever made contact with in this particular life. And we had an amazing conversation. I can't wait to share it with you. We're going to jump right into it, but first, some quick business. A tremendous thank you to Squarespace for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH. Every once in a while, I like to offer my listeners domain names that have yet to be taken, and I am stunned that enlightened vagina.com is available somehow. It doesn't make any sense to me. In fact, I feel like maybe it's some kind of mistake. Surely this has been taken by now. I feel like aside from the cultural implications of this domain name still being accessible if you wanted to buy it, just the artistic implications. What an incredible sounding name for a website. The entire website could be based on the fact that here we are in 2021. Long past the domain name boom, where almost any domain name even remotely associated with sex has been taken, that two of the, dare I say, greatest things on earth combined.com is still floating out there available for anyone who wants it. Not only that, we've got enlightened vagina.space and enlightened vagina.work. That doesn't sound as good. EnlightenedVegina.Vegas is available. And of course, EnlightenedVegina.Zone. They're all out there for you. You can grab that domain name right now via Squarespace. Squarespace, they've got everything you need to create a beautiful website. I could go on and on about their incredible customer support. If you need help building your website or their beautiful templates or the ability that they offer you to create really beautiful emails for your clients or the way their incredible technology has transformed what was formerly a nightmare, making a website into a joyful act of creative expression. But rather than do that, I invite you to go to what is one 37 consecutive glory time awards from the National Podcasting Website Association, dunkintrustle.com. It's a beautiful website. You might never leave the website acts as a kind of glue for your eyes. The color palette, the content, all of it, mix and merge together to create what is most certainly the watermark by which all other websites can be measured. And that website was created using Squarespace. Give them a shot. Head over to squarespace.com. forward slash Duncan. Try them out for free. And when you're ready to launch, use offer code Duncan and you'll receive 10% off your first order of a website or a domain. Thank you, Squarespace. And we're back. And now we're returned to a previous segment of the DTFH that, uh, I guess I forgot to do or I just stopped doing it, but we're going to return to it. It's mail bag, mail bag. It's a bag mail. If Jonah was the letter, then the bag would be the whale. I'll never rep again. I promise that I'll never rep again. I promise that I'll never rep again. Dear Duncan, I'm a professional waitlifter who follows your only fans page. I can't help but notice your beautifully sculpted glutes and abs. I wanted to know what your exercise routine was because even though I work out constantly, I just can't achieve that chiseled Bruce Lee style look. Can you help? Sincerely, Gloria Linu. Dear Gloria, thank you so much for your question, uh, to answer it. I thought I would, uh, just let, let you in on my exercise routine, which I'm doing right now, I'm doing a plank. Um, I like to read the love song of J. Alfred proof rock while I'm doing abdominal exercises by T. S. Elliot. He would do the same thing. He actually wrote the poem to help him with his ab workouts. But the passage that I read the most is I grow old, I grow old. I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled. Shall I part my hair behind? Do I dare to eat a peach? I shall wear white flannel trousers and walk upon the beach. I have heard the mermaid singing each to each. I do not think that they will sing to me. I've seen them riding seward on the waves coming the white hair of the waves blown back when the wind blows the water white and black. We have lingered in the chambers of the sea by sea girls, wreathed with seaweed, red and brown till human voices wake us and we drown. Fuck. That was, of course, the very end of a three hour plank. By that time, I've read the poem at least 60 times in a row. It's the mailbag lavender hour gmail.com. Mailbag is the mailbag lavender hour gmail.com. And now a word from our sponsors. A tremendous thank you to the purveyors of the finest CBD on this planet or any other planet feels feels its premium CBD delivered directly to your doorstep. My sweet darlings, you don't realize what a beautiful world we live in. There was a time when CBD was illegal. I would have to smuggle vials of it on tour because it helps me sleep. It's a miracle substance. But now you can get it delivered right to you without worrying about getting thrown into a dungeon feels it naturally helps reduce stress. I also like to take some after I go jogging or before I go jogging. It's wonderful stuff. It helps me sleep. And what's great about it is as opposed to some other types of CBD, it doesn't taste like an elf projectile vomited into your mouth. It actually tastes great because they use high quality CBD. It reminds me of something out of a Frank Herbert novel. It's some kind of perfect, beautiful, golden colored nectar. It's awesome. And if you're new to CBD, they have real human support. They offer a free CBD hotline to help guide your experience. If you're wondering about dosages, for example, they will help you dial in exactly the amount you should be taking.

It's great to see you. How are you down in North Carolina? Where are you? I'm in Asheville right now in Asheville up in the mountains. Yes, sir, up in the mountains. Where are you up there? That's really nice up there. It's beautiful. Where are you located right now? I'm in Woodstock, you know, actually literally Bearsville, which is outside Woodstock. And I haven't left here except for one day in over a year. Wow. And it's really great because I'm retired. So I'm really happy being home a lot. Yeah, you're doing a lot of work dealing with the Tibetan and everything. And also keeping Menla and Tibet House alive, you know, Tibet House. We have a healing center, country place here that Tibet House does. I know. And which I'm the custodian, the unpaid custodian, but I love it. It's his holiness, his place. His holiness slept there. You know, we have a bed that his holiness slept in. That's like George Washington. That's how do you work it out in your mind that your karma is such that you get to know his holiness? Well, we've been doing many lives. And I think I, you know, some lives I wasn't being as helpful as I should have. So I had some problems this life, too. But I'm trying to be very helpful. And I think I have been. And we've known each other since 1964. Yeah, yeah. You're your your friends with his holiness, the Dalai Lama. He's an amazing guy, too. He's a great guy. But he's also totally normal. In other words, he doesn't act like you don't have to like bow down and blow a horn and all this crap. But you kind of want to. Yeah, you sometimes do. But he hates that. Actually, there's one funny story I can tell you, please. You're interested in that. Well, although I should be getting you funny stories. By the way, I will tell you one. And that is I was in 1980. I had been there for a year with my family, you know, all of the four kids. One was only two. And I was leaving. I've been there since 79 and I had to leave to go back to work. I had a sabbatical, you know, and then I brought the family to have an exit interview like an audience that you say goodbye and thank you, I've been working together. So I wanted to be very formal to give a good example to my kids about to be respectful to the Lama, right? So I'm going and the kids are coming with me and dinner. And the solace is standing there, reading out. And then I I try to do a bow, you know, a formal bow. And I'm going down with the bow, right? So instead of letting me do the bow, he he steps forward. He grabs my hand to shake it like just like an ordinary thing. But because I'm already going down, I fall over on the floor, flop on the floor. And everybody's laughing and the kids are just having a fall. All the tension was broken. You know, the ice and they're laughing away. And then, of course, it's saying, I told you not to be so formal. It's all it doesn't want it, but she's giving me instructions. Wow. And and I'm kind of get up off the floor and then we're all laughing. And then I'm introducing the kids. They're having fun. But then while we're introducing the kids, the two year old, he thought that was the big thing to do. So we suddenly hear the stomping noise and he is doing the Australian crawl across the floor of the room, because he thought that's what I was doing. Well, that is amazing. That is so good. So this is cracking up totally about all these antics of these kids in here. And that's typical of him, you know, cutting through formality, you know, and just being being cool, you know, it's great to hear these stories because I think most people who feel any kind of draw towards that philosophy don't know, can't even imagine what it would be like to be around or being like that. And it's nice. And I think that anytime I saw him speak in Anaheim and that was the sort of joyful realization is how funny it is and how bubbly he is and how there isn't like a heavy heaviness to it at all. No, no, he doesn't do it. Some Lamas do do that. They act like very like they're like practically some kind of an alien statue or something, but he doesn't. He can be like that in a ritual, be very, you know, grandiose and very, you know, elegant in his movements and so forth and kind of like, hmm. But when he's hanging out, he's just hanging out, you know, he's very resilient. You know, what that is, is that the message of that is about the teaching when you go through yourself and you discover the void, you know, freedom, like openness, not nothing, but openness, you know, and you don't find a rigid thing that's your sort of fixed identity, you know, it's up to maintain it, you know. Yeah. Then you become resilient as far as being appropriate in different situations and you fit with the people, whatever benefits them. You know, you're very oriented towards make cheering them up, you know, making them happy and so on, very specific. And it's very neat. It's very neat because people think, oh, when you realize selflessness or emptiness, that mean you just sort of everything, it doesn't exist and you just sort of do anything. But it's not a role like that. It's you become very focused on the minute details of things to make it nice, you know. Today's episode of the DTFH has been supported by the apothecaries at Amazon Pharmacy, which is amazing. You don't have to go to the pharmacist anymore.

It's actually a kind of a tea where no air comes out. It's what's called an unaspirated tea. Dong ba nyid. Yeah, Dong ba nyid. That's perfect. Yeah, Dong ba nyid. And does this translate directly to emptiness or is there another? Or avoidness. I prefer avoidness in some contexts because in some tantric thing, there's something called a high meditation. And there's something called the four Dong ba nyid, the four empties. And whenever I translate for empties, I think of beer cans. And it's just terrible. So I like to say the four voids. Yeah, yeah. I got to tell you, I'm listening right now to an audio book, which is a translation of the Way of the Bodhisattva by Shanti Deva by His Holiness. His Holiness translated it. And I kind of feel like in the last chapter, the rug just gets pulled out from under you and it seems almost unfair. And the sense that the beginning chapters seem to be a lot about how lucky you are to be human. And then in the very last chapter, it does this systematic dismemberment of your identity. And then it's just like, have a great night. Have a good night. That that's the end. And it's OK. See you later. That's the thing. You see freedom. But what that is, is that the introduction to freedom? Because as long as you still said that, oh, this is the wall. That's a real wall over there. Oh, yeah, this is the floor. This is the real body. You know, my old Mongolian teacher was very great. He used to say, people think they're real and that they're not wrong. They are real. The problem is they think they're really real. So in order to switch from really real, you know, being stuck to being just free but real, you know, free real. Yeah, then you have to at one time see all of it, you know, dissolve, you know, and let go downstream, you know, and let go and go with the flow. You know, then that and then you are picked up by the flow. And then you're open to the surf, the reality, you know, because reality goes in waves, you know, and that's really, that's really fun. But it is, it does seem unfair almost because also everything gets the table just comes apart. Yes, you know, it's a thought experiment. Yes, and that kind of thought experiment when conducted by strong concentration really leads you into an experience of pure space. And then the kid, then the trick is, and this is very tricky at that point. That feels like a huge release. But the danger there is that then someone will think, oh, that's the freedom. And it'll never be back there with all those things. And then they get stuck there. And they think that, you know, that's Nirvana somewhere else. And there is, in fact, the Buddha, that's so natural to make that mistake that Buddha practically let people think that some of them, but then introduce them when they first had after they had that experience. Well, actually that because that's another relational state. It's an altered state, but it's a relational state because you went there from here and then here comes back at some point. Right. And and therefore the key is you have to merge being here as being free and empty space and yet very much here. And that that's that's the deeper thing. That's where love comes in, compassion. It's wisdom becomes love and compassion there, you see, because then when you're here, you feel so great because you're in empty space, but you're here in the illusion and playing with it, having fun. And then you meet somebody and they're really not having fun. They're upset because they lost an election or they lost their shoes or they lost their toothbrush. And then and then you, oh, let me help you with that. Can you address, I have so many questions for you. Well, that's great. I have enough for you, though. I want let me just say, you know, I want to ask you a lot about because you were so close to actually, although I knew him also from 1959, but you were so close in the last years to Ram Dass. And now he's gone and I want to really ask you a lot about that and your feeling and then the other people. So, I mean, we'll come around to it, but we can trade. But I really want to know. Let's trade questions. I just have I have two specific questions. OK, OK, and one of them is can you. Talk about the as we study, I am studying specifically Tibetan Buddhism and I've been on a tear reading book after book or that's for great and but I I'm want to I find myself in my meditation practice having sometimes wonderful experiences. The wonderful experience happens. But because I've been reading this, these books, I think, forget about that. You're not supposed to, you know, don't don't don't even bother with that. But I've noticed a kind of almost a kind of neurotic attitude appearing towards anything that starts emerging that seems remotely akin to some of the things that I've been reading in these books. I either will think, well, this is placebo. You're projecting what you've read onto this experience because you so want to have illumination or you're experiencing some something. But because you're focusing on it, now you're going to get addicted to this something. And then what ends up happening is is a kind of neurotic echo chamber related to this phenomena. I wonder if you could talk about this in the sense that that's so good. That's such a great thought. You see, people too much teach. That as long as you meditate, that's just all you have to do is meditate. You don't have to learn anything, in other words, that's a little bit the attitude of the of the Westerner, who thinks that we're so great and smart and civilized and we're the future. Blah, blah, blah, a lot of stunts and when actually, we're still highly militarized, sitting on top of the genocide of the Native Americans, the slain men of the blacks, new Jim Crow, old Jim Crow. In other words, we're not quite so far out as we think. Right. So actually, maybe we have something to learn from people who, in the past, the Brits conquered them, you know, they, you know what I mean? They were peaceful. So therefore they were nicer. They weren't weaker, actually, they were just less violent. And so we have to learn. So it's so learning is very key and learning does not disturb your meditation. In fact, it helps you aim it in a proper way. In a proper way. And actually, you can make an argument that this thing about projecting into things and so on. Well, we're projecting everything all the time. You know, one of the insights of emptiness is, you know, when you're in a dream, when you have a dream, even if you're not lucidly dreaming, you're sort of narrowly dreaming, which you remember only when you wake up, right, because you're kind of just, but in a dream, you have a mood change and you can change the whole environment. You know, you were in the Eiffel Tower and you were about to go up and have a escargot or something or a beautiful, a beautiful waffle up there for breakfast up in the Eiffel Tower restaurant in your dream. And then you feel a little fear or something. Then suddenly we're falling off the Eiffel Tower. So now you're suddenly in the air outside it in a dream. Actually, we are creating our environment in normal waking time too, because every day we see, we project a concept on it. We recognize it. As we say, we recognize it. That would say we see it again. Yes. Fitting it with some presupposition we have. That's the painting on my wall. That's the wall. This is the floor. I'm Bob, et cetera. And so when we go in, even when we're meditating and if someone has told us that the thing to do is don't think anything, just ignore all your thoughts. Just drop them, drop out and don't think, which actually is useful to a point. But if they're saying that gives you the final goal there, that's a mistake. But the point is it's useful because then you get more to choose what you want to think, you're not just driven by thought. But if you're doing that and then you come to a moment of silence where no thoughts are popping up in your mind, that gives you a little bit of a buzz. And the danger there that has happened to many a meditator is, oh, that was a enlightenment. And at first they have a big buzz and then they get so bored after a while. And then when they're not doing that and someone steps on their toe, they get really pissed off because they didn't actually really unravel their identity habit, you know, me, I, me, may, mine, I, me. The great thing to be able to say, no, I, me, me, mine, I, me, mine, that all day long thing, you know? Yes. And so Chatti Deva is so good with. So even when you are not thinking, you're projecting a state of not thinking into being quiet. Do you follow me? Yes. So, so therefore the reason, the reason what's called the most high thing that you're reading in this Chatti Deva and in Dalai Lama's things always, the most high thing is called the royal reason of relativity. Hmm. And what that is, what that means is that all things are empty of any non-relative component, that includes me and any object that I look at. So what that means is we, even when I see something as if it had a non-relative component, it was really real exactly that way. And I'm really, really exactly this way, that the mere fact I can see it as if it is not empty proves that it's empty because I'm seeing it. Right. I'm even making a mistake about it. And therefore I'm relating to it and to the source of my mistake, which is my projection, my ignorance. Okay. And it's not just that I'm projecting the other thing. I'm predicting it other as a really real thing. Right. So I'm stuck on it and I'm stuck with myself. So, so for example, when I have an emotion, obsession, you know, lust, let's say greed or anger, hatred, when I'm stuck there, it seems to come from a really real place. So it seems to be really real. So I lose it. I forget what would be effective. I forget what is appropriate. I don't get the bigger picture. I'm driven by my rage or my obsession, obsession to do something really usually self-destructive. Yes. Temporarily it might be destructive of something else, but in the long run, self-destructive, like somebody who smashes a valuable plate or something. Okay. And then they were, oh, shit, that cost me $200. You know, like, why did I do that? Do you know what I mean? Yes. And that's because that, that anger is perceived as coming from a really, really real fixed self that has a right to be angry. And the anger seems overwhelming that I have to follow whatever it wants me to do. And it pretends to me that it makes me stronger. And actually it turns me into an asshole. Yes. In fact. Yes. And I've, and I can say that from a lot of experience. I've been an asshole a lot of times. I'm a professional asshole. Well, so, so what I'm, coming back to the question, what that means is, that you have to don't think it's neurotic. You have to do the learning. The first type of wisdom is called the wisdom born of learning. That's why one reads Naga, Junna and Shantideva and Dhalalama and et cetera. And then the second one is the wisdom born of critically doubting and thinking over and knowing on it and struggling with it and, and developing a deeper appropriate, you know, learning what fits with oneself. And, and then the third one is where then you could just focus on that because you're aimed, you know, your, your, your sight, sighting mechanism, your telescopic sight is the focus coming from what you learned. And therefore you're aiming at freedom, knowing that the freedom is right here in the relativity because all of the interrelated things are illusory. Right. They're not just totally non-existent, but they're illusory. So, so you're free and relating to them. You can relate to them in a light way. You know, like, as you said, Ram Dass used to say so brilliantly, you know, you sort of know the one is there, you're in it. He was identifying it often because his body was so painful at the end with sort of a disembodied condition. But he'd also had ecstatic, a lot of ecstatic experience in his life. That man had been super high. I mean, super high in the past. He had. And so, and so he knew it was there. Yes. And so he would say, well, this is just a movie. That was his say, like, say illusory. But that didn't mean he didn't care about the movie. I remember one time when I gave a talk there, I was pretty jacked up. I was because I was enjoying the talk because I talk myself into a state where it seems to miss myself temporarily, that I know what I'm talking about. Which I don't actually, really. But it seems to me. So then I get in good mood because I talk myself into it. But but and then other people like it because I'm getting good mood. So I went up to see him in this chair there. And there were a lot of people looking to see him because he was there still, you know, in as much pain as he was. Yes. And so I was looking at him because we have this old relationship and I just cherish every moment I managed to meet him toward the end there and and and and hang out with him. And then but when he said it was so cute, he looks up at me, smiling, you know, and then he says, look at them. Look at them. In other words, he wanted he wanted he wanted me to look at the other people. Wow. And who are happily there rather than just him. You know, in other words, OK, we got it. We're OK. We like to refine. But look at them and and he was just completely there for them. You know, he was there for me, too. But he was his clue to me was look at them. Yeah, you know, they're so they're young and they're like they have so much life in them and and they're going to find so many things and they're already here. You know, I mean, it was it was just so neat. You know, that's beautiful. That's and that kind of condensed sort of fractal teaching that he was doing towards the end there because he didn't he didn't have the ability to speak as he used to. So he everything was condensed. I unravel so many interactions that I had with him because everything he said was folded up in that. I mean, just that look at them. You can I mean, you could do a book just based on what that has. I know, I know he was he was amazing. I loved him really. I know him when he was Richard, Dr. Albert, driving around in a green Mercedes convertible. How did you know that sound? What? How did you meet him? I was an undergraduate at Harvard when he was a professor there. Wow. And before they really took off, you know, after they all got fired or they broke with Harvard and went to Milburg, then I knew them there, too. But I knew them from when they were actually when they were taking really small doses. I was serving other people and I was there with some young guys and girls and we were taking bigger ones. And they were blamed later on, turning on, but they didn't give us anything. They were doing experiments with, you know, carefully monitored. They're being very proper. Where were you getting your acid from? All the mescaline and stuff, you know, we, you know, it was around, you know, in the late fifties, early sixties. And just some friends, you know, you know, I didn't I don't know where they got it. Well, they were getting it from the Sandos laboratories, I believe they just Harvard people, the doctors from Sandos, and there was some floating around. It wasn't illegal at that time. It's not illegal. You know, in some early trips, I would go and I walk around Harvard Square and I would, I would hug a cop. Well, and what reaction would you get from the cop in those days? Or were they just like this or the cleaning lady in the Hayes Bigford? Yeah. At four in the morning, she would look like the Virgin Mary or like, or even better, but they were used to eccentric students. So they were kind of all right about it. You know, as long as you weren't sort of menacing it anyway, right? Fine. And there were no hippies and there were no wild states so much in that area. You know, so they were all right. So they, you, you have a psychedelic conference coming up with a lot of great speakers. Um, what are your thoughts regarding the current, what people are calling the second or the third psychedelic wave, the end of the prohibition, all the studies that are happening, you know, the other day, just on a whim, I bought a thousand dollars worth of LSD stocks on the stock market. And it was the funniest moment. Cause I'm thinking, I am now living in a world where in the old days, when I was buying stock in LSD, I mean, I was buying LSD. You mean from Sanders? You bought Sanders? No, there's various corporations that are being publicly treated right now that have FDA approved, you know, studies where they're synthesizing LSD. So you can literally invest on the stock market into the manufacture of LSD. What, as someone who was there before the, uh, crackdown during the crackdown and now after the crackdown, what are your thoughts regarding what we can expect culturally as psychedelics continue to, um, have the sort of taboo removed from them and the great book by Michael Paula that I know, you know, you know, uh, how to change your mind, you know, that's great writer or just to do diet and health and all things. Then he, he got into it and then he experimented with himself very timidly, but we're wonderfully, I thought it was a wonderful book. Well, you know, he shows that when it started, it was a great thing. And the psychiatrists were doing fantastic work. There was some nasty stuff by the CIA going on in Canada and here in there. Crazy stuff because they were hoping they could make super soldiers with it and everything was me, Bob, may I wait? May I stop you there? I use, I'm sure you're aware of this. Ted Kaczynski was the unabomber. I believe was at Harvard around the time that you were there. Yes, he was my same class, but I didn't know him. And they were doing the OSS was paying. And I can't remember the head of the facility there, but was paying. They were doing art. They were doing the very research you're talking about on Ted Kaczynski at Harvard. Why are you there? Oh, yes. I didn't know that. I didn't know there were anyone around there. I thought it all happened in Canada, but okay, then that's, that's another piece of the puzzle. I had no idea of that. But the point is that the point is that the psychedelics in general, just to say, are a wonderful tool that are used in many cultures with thousands and thousands of years, and they are part of a kind of initiation thing of finding your place in the universe for someone who is not going to be a monk or they're not going to be an ascetic Christian monk in the desert, whatever. They're going to be a normal person, have a family and do things, but they're going to have a virtual way of pulling themselves together within the terms of Christianity or Judaism or whatever it may be or an indigenous religion. And so plant conversation with plants and plants, you know, essences and mushrooms, which is a whole other genus of biological entity. I saw Stamets the other day online. That guy is so proud. Anyway, you know, he is a mushroom. I think he wants to become. And like Tamsa McKenna was a little bit like that. Yes. And so it was a wonderful discovery of this sort of machine oriented culture of ours, very militarized and racist and dominator oriented and alienated from nature and polluting and destroying it and exploiting it and so on. And it was a great discovery that the nature talked to us to it. And in channeling in through academics and psychiatrists, naturally, the military people are doing their nasty thing and they discovered it was useless to them because actually it had the opposite effect. It made people nonviolent. It made them more in love with nature. It made them more open and some badly directed. It might have made them crazy. But the point is it deconstructed their rigid cultural with a supremacy people. We should own everything and dominate everybody. And so it was not useful. It was a contrary to useful. Now, the other answer to the question is interesting, which is there was a guy called Harry and slinger in the thirties and forties and fifties would be more forties and fifties. He was a Hoover friend. And I just saw this premiere of a movie about Billy Holiday, his great singer, you know, and how she was persecuted and they were really angry with her because she sang a song called Strange Fruit. Yeah. About lynching. Yes. And she was really popular with great singer and nightclubs, but did she now and then would throw in a little black power subversive thing and they hated her and they wanted to arrest her. And then he said in one scene to the Hoover and the other guys, all the white guys, and they are like, we know, OSS type room in this early sixties, late fifties. And he said or early fifties even. And he said, well, we can't arrest them for singing a song. But we can get them for using heroin. Right. Then with the drug laws, you know, right. And do this, you know, and he was notorious. He was the one who put acid on the schedule. One list with a dangerous and anesthetic drugs and things like that. I thought it was Nixon. What? I thought it was Nixon. Nixon came late to it, but he was involved. Yes. But he was. And also Nixon's guy, the plumber, was the guy who busted Milbroke, actually. But that's how he was working for, you know, that whatever his name was, I forgot. I know what you're talking about. Yeah. So point is that they were they were all trying to be in using drugs to promote their racism, in fact, and block Native Americans from Mescalito, and from their ceremonies and block it and then make sure that the black communities had a lot of heroin. Wow. You know, as they were stopping, they weren't doing wasn't with the white community, but they would purposely send it in. The British had done that with the Chinese in the 19th century. That's what the opium war was about. Opium war was not because of the legality of opium. It was because the Chinese were making it illegal and refusing to import British opium, and the British couldn't pay for tea with cash because they were so popular tea in Europe that they were draining the silver resources of Europe. And so they were forcing the Chinese to take opium and raking. Therefore, the population in those opium dents, which we think was some Chinese thing, but actually the British shoved it down their throat. Wow. Hey, it would be the equivalent of some Colombians coming in and invading Washington, coming up from Miami and forcing the cars and all to get stoned on cocaine. I mean, it was a scene. So my point is that the the domineering elite has always used drugs to control majority populations that outnumber them or are more energetic than them. And that was just another instance of that, taking it away from the shrinks, taking it away from the anti-alcoholics, because it's very helpful to overcome alcohol addiction. Right. You know, the ibogaine, not only acid, but, you know, many a plus, like the African ibogaine is very good for heroin, for example, supposedly. I mean, I don't know, I never did either heroin or ibogaine, but I should have, but I never did. But I will in the future if I live longer. I'll experiment with all of them because they're all very useful. Yeah. But in a setting, also, if you're misdirected in the set, when you get a vulnerable, open, you're projecting apparatus is temporarily suspended. Yes. And then you're directly merging with your field of experience. Then you see all kind of new things about it that you didn't notice because the minute you look at it, you wrap a concept on it. And oh, that's what I know. I ahead of time, I was going to see that's all I see. Right. And so when that temporarily is suspended, which most of those psychedelics, entheogenics, as Houston Smith called them, what that's what they do, they temporarily freeze your immediate stuffing everything into your own preconceptions. Yes. And then you see if you see the heaven in a dew drop, like a poet, like Emily Dickinson, you see the lamps of the streets of heaven in a drop of dew. Yes. And they blow your mind. And the people who used it well didn't just do that. Like, like, so Tim sort of never did anything else much after the initial thing. Whereas Richard became Ram Dass and he really explored the mind and he helped a lot of people and he really did well because he didn't only do that. Right. You know what I mean? Just like suspend things. It's like someone who only meditates without learning anything. They're just suspending their bad feeling, but they don't get rid of it. It comes back when they stop doing it. Yes. So then they get addicted to going and running away and doing that. Whereas the real thing is to learn how it works and learn to project things that are helpful out of love and compassion instead of projecting boring things out of domination and alienation. Right. I mean, that's the key. That's the key. So it's like, you know, you bring the language back into it, language is fantastic. It's a wonderful thing, but it never can express reality. You know, Buddha gave them the Copenhagen Declaration 2600 years ago. He did. Indians had atomic physics, they had high energy things, kundalini, little kind of thing. And he said, guys, none of the theories, including anything I say, is going to capture reality. It's inexpressible, you know? You can experience it. So then you'll kind of know it at the deepest way. But then I'm so sorry, you can't explain it to anybody else. You can only explain to them methods they can use to themselves discover. Because when human beings have the ability to do that, we have amazing, amazing brains. We have super computers right there in the skull and all up and down the spine. That's one of the many things I love about Buddhism is that it isn't really telling you just believe this. No, it's saying this is a this is a process that you have to take up. To me, that is one of the many mind blowing things about it. But speaking of the Copenhagen Declaration, and this actually leads right into the second question I have for you, which is. Listening to a variety of these Tibetan scriptures, I've heard the idea of praying to future Buddhas. And I wanted to ask you about that. I guess there's two parts to the question, which is, what is the Buddhist interpretation of time? Right. Is it a thing that is already in existence? In other words, are these future Buddhas somehow already existing? Or is it a thing that's kind of like a quantum soup that is, you know, we're evolving towards or is it just when they say pray to people? OK, both of those. And this in the sense that the Buddha part of being a Buddha, as you go into a moment in which all of the past is still there. You know, in other words, the past is currently there. No problem. It's also there. None of that you can even change the past, actually. Wait, wait. You can magically you can actually change it. OK, you can you can repair every damage that happened in the past. In fact, you can figure it out in a way. And because it's just it's it has an illusory quality. It is like a movie. You can re-edit the movie. You know, and then as far as the future goes, it's not like there's a set future in us, which would mean that is that would be like a mechanistic way of looking. And it would mean that there's no freedom or choices are meaningless. It's just going to unravel. Yes, it was a guy who was a contemporary of Shakyamuni Buddha twenty six hundred years ago who taught that. And he had a famous thing he would do when he would give a lecture. He was a well-known teacher. He was a rival of the Buddha's actually, but he couldn't really do it. But he tried. But he had a thing where we'd have a ball of twine and it would be all wound, you know, ruffled up and he would give his talk about, don't worry, we'll get liberated. It'll just happen by itself. And then he would throw the ball holding one end and the ball would unravel. And when it finally was no more a ball, it would fall to the floor. He was a fatalist, in other words, right? And Buddha rejected that, you know, but the thing about it, you know, the Kala chakra, yes, that the Dalai Lama loves to do so much. And he had special permission, actually, from some some deities to to teach it many times, which usually in the history in Tibet, they did once or twice a year, I mean, once in a lifetime, they would do Kala chakra. The grand, what they call the grand initiation. And he's done it 34 times or 35 times publicly. And he's done it many more times than maybe 50, 60 times in just in the monastery. And what that means is a time machine. So it has a chakra wheel, it's like we say about it, how good, nice wheels. You know, you get a new Tesla and somebody will say, hey, great wheels. Yeah. So it can mean a machine chakra, you know. And but this time machine is not like HG Wells, where you go around in time, which you imagine to be a sort of fixed medium, a real real thing the way it is. Time is also illusory. Like an illusion, it's also magical, like spaces. And so so what happens is that when you become a Buddha, you know, when Duncan Buddha comes there, although you might have a different name. Yeah. And you know, there's a big thing when you meet a Buddha, he'll tell us. You know, you'll be Buddha such and such in such such a universe and your name will be so and so. And it's considered it's considered a big thing to have that from Buddha, because it's like a not a not secret either. And because then you get a kind of confidence about it. Yes. But the thing is that and therefore when a when a Buddha, Buddha has a bodhisattva vow, right? He's not going to take Nirvana until everybody's in Nirvana. Right. He's not going to leave anybody behind. Hey, what about us? Yeah. But in his way, he did it actually, because in his reality, which is more real reality, he saw all our possible futures of all beings. It's like unbelievable. Yes. It's like super computer to the super, super. Yes. So all multiple possible futures he saw. Yes. And he saw we could have really boring and the suffering futures be born as a as a dog and a cat and a crocodile. And in fact, even hell and heaven, gods and pleasures and heaven. But then falling from that, going round and round and round, you know, stupidly instead of becoming really happy. Yes, like a being that makes everybody else happy and is fully happy in the midst of everything and empties the hells and etc. I mean, really fixes it up, fixes up the infrastructure. Yes. And supposedly that's the theory, right? So so a Buddha goes into all those futures of all beings. And he knows all of their past that the ones that he sees around him. And he and in a way, so everybody's around him from all time. Because the moment that he's in has every moment in it. But he knows that it's not fixed the future. So there then his his vow is enacted. So it's like he hasn't broken his vow because he sees every being as they're going to get there. He's going to make sure of it. And he's been in a position where he can actually be effective in doing so. And and he will be at the cornerstone, at the crossroads, at the juncture, in the moment between their deaths and rebirths in their future lives, where he will be able to guide them and give them a little leg up over here and like such a point of road sign that way. Because, unfortunately, he can't just blast them right into his own state because the point is that that takes the infinite energy he has access to and will do. But we are where we don't want infinite energy. If we feel blasted by energy, we'll be frightened. We'll think it's going to kill us. Yes, we'll get more tight to resist it to keep it because we think we have a boundary and that we're not it. It's a universe is different from us. It's alien to us. Yes, we would we would experience a huge burst of bliss as a sort of deathly thing like nuclear fission or something. You know, we hate it. Right. So he only we can only find it from the inside out because we're already in touch with it at the deepest subatomic level of our being, of our soul, you could say, of our subtle cells, even. And so his whole thing is to tease us, create environments and situations, etc. It was that will cause us to feel safe to open and to understand and use our intelligence and to see, OK, it's all relative. You can't really get me that bad. Oh, I'm really like that. And I can identify with it and so on, which we do anyway, right? We identify with our kids, identify with our loved ones, yes, parents, sometimes after we get to give up blaming them. We can identify with them and your grandparents. You know, and and so we have that ability to amplify our identification. And what a Buddha is, is the same conceivable thing of someone who has amplified their identification infinitely, incorporating all space and time. Wow. And joining all the other Buddhists who are all there all the time, they never leave because they are everywhere and in time, too, in time, too. So so my point is that way they fulfill their bodhisattva vow that they stay with us and they will be screwed up this life. Well, next life they'll be at that point and they'll know they're like Groundhog Day, everything is Groundhog Day for them in relation to us. You know what I'm saying? And so I mean, that's the concept. And actually the key to the concept is every single being, whoever was a Buddha, which is infinite numbers of them, because we got a lot of interest is beginningless. It's not like it's some big bang. That's just a local cycle. Right. You know, and it's beginningless. So there's endless numbers of them and they all think they're you and me. What do you mean they all think they're you and me? They do. Well, have you ever been like almost totally empathetic in a love situation or is it something or the birth of a child? Yes, you practically are the other being and you suddenly see yourself from them. Yes. Well, you just we can just switch like that. Normally we don't hear you over there. OK. But the point is this is a being who has managed to do that totally. Wow. And that's why they're compassionate. That's why they don't they can't bear our suffering because they feel it. But you know, just like sometimes you've been in an ecstatic state. I know you have. Yes. And you stub your toe running from one delight to another. And you kind of didn't notice it. Yes. And then later, like, you know, when you call calm down or whatever next day, oh, oh, you know, yeah, you know. But you don't even notice it at the time. So this is such an extreme bliss of being everything and everywhere. Other freedom, bliss, void, indivisible or bliss, empty, indivisible. That they that they can feel all our agonizing pain, even if we're in hell. And then they can know by feeling it where it is we need to open up to like lessen the scrunch of it, you know what I'm saying? Because if they came and it's like you run up and hug a paranoid person, they're going to have to freak out. Yeah, you can't you can't you can't. So so so this is a beautiful thing. I only kind of got into it only recently after 40, 50 years. You know, the Buddha nature is the one. You know, in a way. And by the way, you you're studying Tibetan, which is best place to study. But they will tell you it's all Indian. You know, the Holy Land, you know, the Holy Land for them, you know, the is is. They call it the Holy Land is India where Buddha lived, you know, really come. Yeah, he didn't come to Tibet. He lived in India. And well, his many of his followers eventually did a thousand years later. And then and then I think the great adepts of India realize the foreigners are coming. You know, the military militarized foreigners, first the Persians, Arabs, then the Europeans, they'll be coming because we have such a party here, we're having a name Karoli Baba party. Right. We're doing raga and said we're dancing. Right. We have we have top. It's the top of the world, you know, mango. It's really fun. Yes, India's amazing place. And so and then the guys dragging their wives in the sack behind them or their camel. They're not having fun because the fun is something in the sack behind the camp. Well, they can't they can't enjoy the camel that much. And they're going to come and they were the trampolos and they knew it. So they put the jewels up in Tibet, you know, to bring. Of course, they left a lot of jewels in India, but they but you know, they burnt hundreds of universities and monasteries and libraries that Muslims when they came around a thousand years ago. And so that's where they kept it. Tibet became like a hard drive to store all the way. That's it. Yes, exactly. Wow, that is so they don't act like a we invented everything here in Tibet. They don't know they also didn't just passively just reproduce everything. Repeat it. They develop more subtle things. Oh, fantastic. It's it's this is so mind blowing. It sounds, you know, when I when I've been listening to these scriptures, you know, they're saying things like for some people, Avalokita, Shavara is just a cool breeze on their face. You know, for some people, they get to me and I love it. It's just so trippy. But I just to just to confirm because I really am trying. I really am so inspired by some of these ideas. It sounds like the Buddhist cosmology seems to match like multiverse theory or the idea that there is multiple timelines, multiple universes. And within these universes, there are multiple sort of manifestations of an identical mind, but taking on all these different forms. Wow, that's a body of emanation. It's called nirvana. When you're a Buddha, you could have many bodies. You could have 10,000 Duncan's. You could be doing the Dunkel, Choson podcast in the worst uptight place in Pakistan. OK, well, fortunately, not there yet. But but and I won't keep I won't keep I'm sorry to torch you with these questions. No, no, no, that's not torture. If there is an enlightened version of you and an enlightened version of me. Yes, there is then. Are we entangled with that being? In other words, I could understand why to have a Buddha tell you here's what your name is going to be and here's where you're going to be. From that point forward, could you connect with that version of you? Of course. And is that version of you trying to connect? Imagine, you know, when we imagine something really great. That means we can actually experience it and it can be actual, although any relative thing has an illusory quality. Right. In the Vimalakirti Sutra, did you read my Vimalakirti Sutra translation ever? No, that'll be my next one. That's the next one. You'll love that. It's online for free. You can download it. I'll tell you where. But I'm saying Vimalakirti at the end of the sutra, he meets the Shakyamuni Buddha because he was he lives in town nearby Shakyamuni, but he's from another universe and Shakyamuni verse, although he's a layman, not a monk, but he's respected for his wisdom by Shakyamuni, like the lady, the wise guy and the and the monk-like guy. So I think he goes to visit Shakyamuni and and he takes the whole group in his house with him. He has a thousand people, a thousand. He has like a doctor who like house that you can have thousands of people in it. Yeah, although it looks like a house outside in this big city. Right. So he picks up the whole assembly in his hand and he moves them over to the grove outside of town where Buddha's staying, comes to see the Buddha because they all want to see a Buddha at the end of a long teaching in Vimalakirti's house. So then Buddha says to him, oh, hey, Vimalakirti, I'm so glad to see you. You've been unwelving here, you're elderly, and it's so nice that you're here with all your friends and so forth. A lot of his own monks were there and so on, Buddha's own monks were there. And so he said, so you wanted to see the Buddha, right? You came over to see the Buddha, right? So now that you're here, how do you see the Buddha? And so Vimalakirti is looking at him and he says, well, I don't see the Buddha when I see a body in front of me. I don't see the Buddha when and he goes at that level where what's called the Dharmakaya of the Buddha, the reality body, which best translated as reality, not just teaching body, but reality body. It was an ultimate meaning of Dharma as reality itself. And so he says, oh, he's on that level. So that means he knows that Buddha feels he's Vimalakirti. Buddha feels he's everybody in the audience. Buddha is everywhere in the galaxy. So in many of these sutras, when Buddha starts to teach, you often create a performance art piece for the students in which he'll create a vision that they temporarily see of the Buddha teaching a bunch of students in five thousand different planets simultaneously. And that's your multiple university. No, he sticks his tongue when he teaches the transcendent wisdom sutra. Not in every version, but because they're different like the version. But in the twenty five thousand one on up, he sticks out his tongue first. And the light comes out of the middle of this. He has a big tongue, by the way, like a yogi. He can put it up on forehead and the tip and he and the light comes out of his tongue and they suddenly see that he's teaching this in countless worlds. Like you were looking in two mirrors facing each other just endlessly. Yes. And so what the reason he does that is that, you know, when we do something good or when we learn something, we think, oh, the one who's struggling with this and he's showing that all over the universe is not empty of human beings. He's not a bunch of stones out there and that dinosaurs and with this endless numbers of humanoid environments. Already they're saying that from thousands of you and the people who are more hip, they can travel with mind traveling like dream, projection, sort of thing, consciously and they come when Buddha teaches here, they come out of the world and they go to other worlds and they're able to do that. They say they don't need a metal spaceship here. They don't need Steven Spielberg's closing counter machine. They don't need that. They just go with their mind. OK, so this is this implies the thing that and I don't mean to get into the world. I love this. But the implication would be that it shouldn't awaken being appear on this planet. We might expect an uptick in sightings of UFOs, an uptick in paranormal events. We already have. We already have. Yeah, right. You know, I think we have already, sure. But we are we are the ones we see like UFO and we're assuming it's like a metal thing, like our own clunky 737 or something. Yeah, but what are shaped like a saucer or something that whatever. But, you know, and they may have there may be people who have that. There may be peace, although the one thing I really got pissed off in the closing counter of the third can, which is a great flick. I mean, Steve Spielberg is very cool. OK, but what I thought was pathetic one, you know, I loved it in that moment where he finally looks up and then you see Times Square hanging upside down above you by this powerful anti gravity thing is that in the in the fantasy, you know, in the movie, right? And you see the New York City Times Square is hanging right over your head. All luminous and glowing, wonderful. OK, and then it then they did it and then the gangplank comes down. And then people come out. But then the guys come out and the guys like Casper, the freaking ghost. How about looking like an adult or something? You know, like the terminator or a beautiful woman or like a big human, like something very beautiful human. Yeah, yeah. What makes you think that somebody with advanced technology is going to look like it's so silly and so supremacist? You know, we're the humans. You know, we got our own, you know, we got the terminator. And then the little thing comes out of the hand. Like, yeah, it can feel a little thing like you can make a UFO. It can probably make a peloton. Give it a break. If it is, it can be like, yeah, that's hilarious. So that was that was catering to all sort of American humanoid supremacy things. Yes. Oh, yeah, they got a powerful machine. But what a win, you know, wow, humanoid supremacy. Well, you know, as I've been listening, I like these audiobooks. I've been listening. I really have thought if this stuff I'm listening to is not for lack of a better word, an alien transmission. I don't know what is it's because the perspective of a lot of these teachings is seemingly outside of the time space continuum. And that that that in its own right produces such a unique quality. The consciousness that's emanating it is not does not strike me. It is terrestrial. I mean, clearly it grew out of the earth, but also it does feel like it's coming from somewhere very far away simultaneously, which is one of the things I like about it. Well, wasn't that what was great about Ramdas? I like to go that way. You know, Ramdas was always with the one, you know, and he was always, you know, there was a great notebook term that was developed at Millbrook called up leveling and which Ramdas would use that term. And then he would sometimes say, you know, in a stressful situation, you sort of see the bigger picture and you cool down and then you act more kindly and more beneficially in a difficult situation, etc. And that's the up leveling idea, you know, instead of staying in a certain network where you're trapped in a certain thing. Yes. So you got you were very close with him, right? And you often when I went to when he when he wasn't there, what happened? How did you handle that? That's what I want to know if you would tell me what. I mean, it's it's perfect that you're looking into the Dalai Lama and the books and things. And we we I kind of met name Karoli Babal through the heart of Krishna Das because I didn't meet him. I saw him, but I never met him because I was sort of in another world, you know, writing all my books and everything and the Buddhist thing. And I didn't go to the Hindu temple with my stupidity. Unfortunately, I didn't realize you have a Buddha in the Hindu temple, but you did. And so I lament that I missed him. And I missed a lot of really great lamas that I know about now. And I never got to meet because I had to work, you know, I didn't. I didn't have the money to just be around, hang out all of them. Yes. How to support a family and do it, give teachings in school. So so what is going on with with Ramdas's folks and yourself now that he's not there? And you have KD and you have, you know, we don't go to didn't go to Maui this time. Of course, we couldn't go in and I don't know if they'll renew the thing in Maui or maybe they'll do it in California, Ohio, I don't know what's going on. Yeah, what is going on, but more important than politically or socially. What's going on in your mind? I mean, you know, I feel like it's so funny you say you missed these lamas. I feel like I missed Ramdas. I I because of Ramdas, I have a practice. I have David Nick turn. I have a meditation teacher because of my association with that satsang. I now I'm practicing and reading now. But I wasn't doing it when I was in going to those things. So I feel guilt a little bit or a sense of underutilizing or not plugging in as much as I potentially could have during the times I spent with them. And I know that idea to him. He would probably say, that's just your ego. That's your and I know you can think of how he would react to when you're feeling this and that. Well, I have conversations with him, you know, not, you know, like that, you know, or like, you know, the the the other day even I was and I don't, you know, again, I I like Robert Anton Wilson's advice with most of these things, which is maintain agnosticism, so you don't embarrass yourself with a lot of these things. Don't get to hear what Chogyam Trumbler Rinpoche said, which is just disown it. It's there, but don't you don't necessarily have to like crystallize it and turn it right. But, you know, when I went right after my mom, dad, I I Ragu took me to his house. That's the first time I got to really be with him. And he did, you know, we sat together and I was crying and he was, you know, looking at me in the eye and I and but I do after it was whatever this and exchange between us was when it was over, all I knew was that I didn't really quite understand what had happened there. And then but the other day I was just I can't remember if I was falling asleep or meditating or but all of a sudden I had that vivid memory of being back there. Except this time he was saying, here I put this inside of you so that when you're ready, you could see this. And he was like, he was like, I don't know, I fell asleep. It was Ramdas, you know, it's like I think that the way my mind is, you know, dealing with the loss is by on one level, trying to really respect what he taught regarding, you know, kind of like when he was pointing and saying, look at them, you know, that is the message that I was getting from him in his last days, which is that we know what's so funny is before I ever met him. And again, these are all miracle stories or whatever. Before I ever met him, I had this dream about him. I was standing at the edge of a long pier. It was the Richard Alpert you met like young Ramdas, I think he was smoking a cigarette, which he was standing at this very handsome, very handsome and he was handsome and he was charismatic and he was standing at the edge of this pier looking out at the ocean and he turned and looked at me and then looked out at the ocean and said, I don't know. I think I'm going to go there soon. And that was this dream. Yes. And then the next day, I remember reading online, he had fallen or he was in the hospital and I thought, what the heck? I don't even and then my mom had a dream about him before I ever went to these retreats where he said to her, where's Duncan? He's late. Really? Really? Yes. I think about those as just, you know, whatever. But but to me, the what, you know, that my encounter with him, especially the very last Mala ceremony he did at the retreat, knowing that the stage he was in, but then seeing really how completely there he was and how he was fully giving himself to the people there and that there was just such a beauty. I don't know a better word for it than a true sophistication, like a kind of possibility and so yeah, my my my wife is broke. Everyone's got a broken heart about it. I have I have a broken heart about it. But to put it into perspective, you were talking. We were talking earlier about throwing and breaking things. So just in the love, everyone and tell the truth spirit that just the night before he died, I've been in a fight with my wife and I went down in the garage and I was so mad and there was a picture of him sitting in the garage and I took it and I threw it on the ground. I was so mad and the next day he died. So this so to me that is the as since then I've been I have a meditation practice and I've been really working with that part of me and watching it kind of not go. I don't know if it'll go away in this life, but certainly chapter six. You know, Shantideva's chapter six. You should listen to it again and again. Yeah, I know exactly what they antidote for anger is patience. Shantideva chapter six, it's the patient and I do listen to that. I also listen to it with some grim sense of like, oh, no, because of course. Shantideva is saying, you know, of all the things to worry about, it's anger, a lifetime of practice destroyed in a moment of anger. All of it like just gone gone. But, you know, so I guess to answer your question, I. Only now feel like I'm getting to to to know him and and while I was there, I feel like I was a little frivolous in in in my relate in because I just didn't understand what it was. I couldn't. I knew it was beautiful and I was there. I don't know what you did, though. And then that's why I'm saying you can change the past, you know, you realize that he knew that you knew he also knew that you were thinking you didn't know, yeah, and he saw through it, maybe superficial thing, and you'll be able to see it, re experience it in a completely different way. I promise you. I believe you. I mean, this is really well. But to me, that is the the the gift he left us. And your story confirms what my feeling has been, which is the gift he left us was each other that that that was the that was his parting gift. And in that, in in, I think the the connection between all of us and people who didn't come to the retreats, people who are just whose lives were transformed by his teachings, he's that's where he's at. That's he's there. I know to me. My I joke with my wife sometimes that it's like now that he is no longer embodied. It's a lot cheaper to hang out with him, you know, I know in a lot and a lot quicker, a lot faster, no flight to online. It's all online. Yeah, it's exactly. Raghu and them are all making it happen. It's really great. And yes, they are. Rama Rameshwari, the book is great. Have you been reading the book? Do you see the book? The being or being Ramdas? I haven't gotten into it. I'm telling you. Being Ramdas is really, really nice. Yeah. My wife has been reading it. They tell some of the stories at Milbrook and all kinds of things. And I enjoy the parts too. It's really great. It really is a real live Hindu boo, Hindu boo, Saint. Yes, Hindu boo. Yes, he was he was it. I do I do think of him as a saint. I think as time progresses, you know, it will start dawning on us more and more. Just I think so, just what he was. I think so. And and and I yeah, I yeah, I'll never stop thinking. I don't think I'll ever stop thinking about it. I don't think I'll do my Raju, too. Even though I never hung out with him, although I used to pick up some of his students when they would be sick and take them to the hospital. But I somehow never sat down with him. I was like, oh, I love it up. Yeah. But now I'm appreciating him to seeing feeling his presence in K.D. They're like Nina. Yes, even though she never met him. But she met the Ma, you know, the Ma who is associated with him. And I can feel the presence of it's like a family we all have. It's really nice. It is really nice. But I think there's a feeling of worry right now. Some people have a feeling of worry that once the pandemic ends that what was happening, what was happening in Hawaii won't repeat. That we've lost that ability to sort of commune together. And I hope that's not the case. But I do think it's a bit of a question mark right now. How to sort of you know, there is. Well, we'll all work on it. We'll see what we can do. I think we have to we have to know the whole planet needs to, you know, that's one thing we've learned from the COVID, actually, which is that we can be together and move through the the global brain, you know, yes. Of course, the bad guys are also rushing around in the global brain drink weird propaganda and things, but it is a global brain that we do have, you know. And look here, we're chatting in North Carolina down there in the Tar Heel State, and I'm up here in the woods and in New York. And and and we're we can we can build together. I feel your presence very much right here. I feel yours too. I mean, don't you don't you think that the implication of this ability to communicate because there's a precedent here. There has been a Buddha and maybe there's one on, you know, one on the planet now. But of course, they're on it. But there are many, there are many, there are many. But they are in a form that people can deal with now. If a Buddha came looking like Buddha, it would be like E.T., you know, very much. The creative people are really great. Hollywood, movies, sci-fi, especially. I really like that. Even the comic books, I love them. They're so cool. Black Panther. Oh, the best. It's the best. And it is being spoken through them. But, you know, that what really gives me goose bumps is this possibility that we're all beginning to, you know, it's like watching monkeys encounter fire for the first time, you know, like, like watching like the wild things that we're doing on the internet. I mean, we just have seen like the QAnon, you know, people's fuses getting blown by whatever that is, that's going in the wrong direction. Exactly. Taking a hit. But just like I'm sure when whatever the proto-hominates were that encountered fire, you better believe there were two generations of probably burn victims who just didn't know how it worked and they were burning themselves and setting trees on fire, burning things. That's QAnon. QAnon is like burn victims from this new technology. But what's exciting to me about it is what happens when one of these buddhas on the planet or when one is still sort of manifesting what happens when instead of the deer park, instead of the very slow sort of distillation and the movement into Tibet and the people coming from Tibet to gather the data and bring you what happens when it just goes bam through the whole planet? What happens then to me? Do you think that that's a real possibility? Do you really believe that? Definitely. I'm certain. I have certainty as much as one can be certain about anything in the illusory world. I'm like a relaxed certainty, but I'm sure, yes. In fact, I'm upset. I'm always my old original Mongolian Rup Lama. He used to disagree with a lot of things. We used to whatever, you know, he was very critical, very wonderful, but very kind also. But he did agree with me in one argument that I had with him about Shambhala, you know, the Kalachakra thing about where it's scheduled to be happened around 24, 25 or 24, 15, something in that area. The whole planet goes ballistic into goodness, in other words. And instead of all this sort of half baked and violence and weird tightness and whatever and lack of joy. And I was always telling I was already with one Tibetan astrologer, astronomer, also old Mongolian guy from Puyattia, from Siberia. But I had been in Tibet for decades and, you know, a old guy, very wise. And he was insisting that's the correct time. And I was saying, listen, man, this planet is not going to last 400 more years under this mismanagement of these crazy tyrants, you know, they're who just sucking money and they don't even have fun at it. They don't know how to have fun. Right. And I said, it'll never happen. And we can't we can't wait for 425 years, I said. And he was disagreeing with me. And his argument was that's what's written in the scripture. I said, well, if you were going to change thing in there, a lot of blue means around would you give them the exact timing? Would you put it up? Can you use it? Yeah. And the other argument was that the planets can't tolerate like nuclear wars and things. And everyone is amazed. We didn't have another nuclear outbreak since Hiroshima, but that doesn't mean we won't. You know, they're really crazy people who can eat. Everyone will have these things. You know, they have pocket nukes. They're making them all over the place. That's the problem. That's a real danger. And and so I was that's what I work at. And then my my old Geshe Wangel, I met his name for a purpose. He suddenly intervened and he said to the old modeling guy, the Bariat one, although all about him, he said, I think he has a point about me. But I didn't know I'm challenging a scripture, actually. And he said he said, yeah, he has a part. I said, because I was saying, you know, you have no idea the machinery of destruction. Yes, that is mobilized on the planet now. That's right. And so we need this sort of magical, miraculous intervention. Yes. And you know, in a way, it's happening from the grassroots, you know. And we might know there's a thing in the road, a sutra that I like, where one guy, like you and me, very enthusiastic about the Dharma. This school and that girl, you know, Ramdas, the Dalai Lama, the old Geshe, this person, that person and David Nick turn doing his thing there. Then I got him going on that with my wife, got him booked, you know, going with the Met House and doing it, spending his day. And he's a good guy. And he was the guy who was there playing his cello. What does he play? The cello, right? What does he play? He plays a lot of instruments. Well, he put guitar with Ramdas, so he was playing the bass with Ramdas. That's right. And anyway, so there we are and and suddenly some hardwood guy is doing something about a dating thing because he was shy and awkward with girls and then somehow he turned that into Facebook with like two million members right in a planet where people, you know, somebody might say, oh, in Buddha's time, they were all linked up because they were all clairvoyant because they were like amazing. There was only so in a few hundred thousand people on the whole planet and blah, blah, blah, but we couldn't go like that. But actually from Buddha's point of view, he doesn't want to be the grand old days. He wants this to every generation to be better. Right. That's what compassion is about. You know, there's and so suddenly, as you say, what you put in is beautiful and you just, boom, imagine if the equivalent of Buddha. Well, actually, the other limit we'll teach online right now and 14 million people will listen all over China, actually, they get round, they use VPN, they get round the world, two of them do, you know, the Hipper one and 14 million people in his in his Twitter. And that's still only a few million. How about this? Wait till we get to get to 100 million. And he has to stay lucid. His English is getting, you know, he's 85 now. Yes. But there'll be other ones who will be able to do that. And they'll be younger and blogger can do it now. And KD can do it now. You are doing it now. And you know, they're reaching out through you. And you say, you and they are indivisible when you're really in love and speaking the truth and the name and the biology is doing too. They're all working at it and it's working at the ground grassroots. And I used to have a way where I would say during the past nightmarish four years and actually during the nightmarish eight years where we had the earlier ruling election, you know, in Florida, you know, the Supreme Court, you know, we had this warmongering instead of the environment president, yes, we were supposed to have that close, that close. Oh, he won, actually, if they counted it, if they had counted it properly, they would have an voter suppression when we know that. But never mind. So during those different times, I was thinking, well, you know, something it's natural. It's actually a good sign that the good people are getting better. And the planet is getting more in their hands. It's a good sign that the bad people are still running it into the ground because the bad people are so miserable and they think if they dominate everybody else, they'll be really happy. And that only actually makes them more miserable. Right. And in a few lifetimes of that, they might quit and quit. But the good people are more relaxed. So you can't you're going to block my vote. Well, never mind. I'm happy. Anyway, even you're a bad person. I'm happy. Okay, I guess I'll say I'll be happy in jail. I'll be happy here. I'll be happy there. I mean, that does I'm not making that an excuse. I'm just saying the good people are more alive. They have more personal energy. They have more inner flow, whatever is happening to them. And the bad people are so narrow, but then they are much more focused on domineering and cheating and doing something. So they keep bubbling at the top. They see come up to the top and then we have to watch them all the time, which is like a big lesson of how not to behave. Yes. Yes. Yeah, I agree. They're like reverse gurus or something. And they're paying such a terrible price to teach us in that way. It's like, you know, like I love Buddhism taught me to really like Jesus more than I did originally. Now that I know he's one of the great rabbis, right? Actually, and you know, which it took a while to figure that out. And I really like him. But and but as a religious studies scholar back when I was still in academia, I went with a friend to see Mel Gibson's movie. I don't know if you ever saw it. The Passion of the Christ. Yeah, I went to see it and I knew I'd hate it. So my friend did too. So we made a pact that if we feel like leaving, we're going to make each other stay. So we will watch it all the way through. And I saw it in LA in a big theater. Yes. And one of the things that did shock me was all these fundamentalist families, you know, like born again, you know, like sort of right wing, you know, that kind. There were lots of them there and they've already been to 10 of them. They'd seen it 10 times. But the thing that really freaked me out and gave me a little bit of encouragement, in spite of how awful it was, was they had little kids with them. And they were whacking them to stay in their seats, you know, and the kids were seeing this total SNM night. Yes, that's what it was. And so anti-Semitic and so much of a nightmare. Yes, I blame the rabbi, blame the rabbi. Even the Mrs. Mrs. Pilate was coming out with clean towels. What's the bullshit? Pilate was so vicious. He was removed by a subsequent emperor because he was killing everybody. It was horrible. He was really horrible. So it was him, the Romans are to blame, not the not the not the rabbis. You know, he was a little a little bit of rambunctious to Jesus as a rabbi. But, you know, he was a great rabbi and he was teaching there. He was teaching the compassion of God, you know. Yes. Anyway, anyway, it would encourage me is those kids subliminally have been forced to sit there and they're going to get as far away from this ridiculous belief trap as they can when they grow up. And they'll try to have a little bit fun at life. That's right. And they're not going to see this as an M crap, you know. And in Gibson, it's so freaked out himself personally. Even when Jesus is resurrected and all healed and he's flying in the sky, he still looks pissed off. He's annoyed. You know, and I really love him. And you know, this is a great scene. I'm coming back to Buddhism. Let me just come back for one second. What you're doing. You realize that Dalai Lama doesn't. He's not teaching what he's teaching and doing what he's doing. I was trying to give a by a desire for you to be a Buddhist or me. He doesn't want us. He wants us to be stay in our own culture with our grandma's religion. He has a big thing about it. Wow. Buddhism is so useful is that we can use it without going into a new kind of denominational freak out where we've got to be that it's because we think it's a religion. Those are these are this is high inward inner science and inner technology. Right. Like to matching the sophistication of the Facebook and Twitter and the computer and zoom and everything. This is the inner one. How to develop these inner summaries of this of our inner computer, our wet wear computer, our wet, wet, wet, wet disc. And and so therefore it can be used without disrupting the cultural matrix where grandma is happy. Yes. And you know, I know, you know, at first when I because I was annoyed by the Christian church, so at first I was kind of like, oh, yeah, Buddhism is much better. I want to go and the dynamic kept pushing me not to be like that. And then finally, and then I was a monk and then since then. And then finally one day I had this epiphany where I happened to switch on the tube to some people on TV standing up for Jesus. I think it was black church, maybe. And you know, they're really getting into it. You know, like, yeah, and then I was thinking they are standing up for compassion for a divine emanation of compassion. Yes, whatever the theology might be. But that's what they're doing. And they get so nice. They just go, Jesus, I said, why on earth would I want them to have to call out and be born again for somebody whose name they couldn't pronounce? Right. I'm a little kid. No, yeah, I don't I can't say any of the any of the any of the Tibetan teachers names or Shanti, David, that's it. I can say Dilco Kinsey, Rinpoche, I remember that. Chokin, Trump or Rinpoche. But that's it is I'm listening to this and it's talking about the 18th century Tibetan is the point. The inner science, you know, Buddhism would everywhere among vast populations in India, even India has many nations, your hundred nations. And then China and Japan, Korea, all of them in Central Asia, even Iran, all over the place. And because they didn't interfere like that. Although it would if someone had a nasty view of God, that God was like, wanted to make them supreme and they should go and kill everybody who didn't believe what they think, then they would learn if the Buddhist technology would get them to adapt to modify the technology and the theology in such a way that they wouldn't make it anti somebody else. Right. Yes, that's what it's viral. It affects the DNA. It gets I don't want infections the wrong word, but it gets into the DNA of things. It shows this this process. And I love that. You know, I to be honest, I don't want to be an Episcopalian. My grandmother was an Episcopalian. I went to bed in Buddhism. I want to, you know, I want to like think about Avalokiteshivara rather than like try to understand the transition and they are same. They are the compassion of the universe, the great mother, you know. You know, I have this rabbi who sent me a great book where he claims he's proven. I haven't read it. I don't have time to read it yet. He's proven that the name of Yahweh, Y H W H is actually he who the secret name of Yahweh is he who. And he says that that is the male and female pronouns. So that the Shekhinah was one with God in the ancient, most ancient level of the tradition, he says, in the esoteric level. So that so there is a God, the mother, in other words, he's making. He's written a book like that. That's he's excited. He heard that I was interested in that and I didn't like the idea that the Shekhinah, at least she comes back on the Sabbath for the Jews. But the Christians only have as a Holy Ghost. Yeah, they don't have a mom. Yeah, you know, because the Romans did that. I'm telling you, the Christianity got a little twisted by the Roman. It sure did. I mean, I guess you have Gnosticism. You have what is it called? Yeah, they killed a lot of Gnostics. And they buried there. Now we're just digging them up. You know, they buried them and hid them because they were destroying them. Yeah, they wanted to fit with their authority and their domination. And the Caesar, you know, I'll send you something really bizarre that not to get too off track, but I did just it's funny because you're sort of alluding to the East Indian trading company that were the dominators who were the ones I'm thinking that were, you know, sort of forcing the opium on the British. The East Indian trading company, the East Indian trading company. They were the ones who were slavers. They're the ones who came up with on Wall Street. The contract for shorting the stuff that just happened in the news. They're going to innovate it the way to profit from failure. They're the ones who are poisoning everyone with opium. East Indian trading company. I will send you their logo has the Gnostic Demiurge on it. The exact drawing of the Gnostic Demiurge, the control creature. Send me that. I'll send it to you. It's so wild. You love Robert Anton Wilson. I did too. I really like that too. He's the best. Yeah, I don't mean to get off track. You know, that's not in the track. You know, that that guy, Dan Brown, he sort of uses all those things in his novels and everything. And that's OK, popularized in a certain way. It's I like it as a hobby. You know, it's cool. But I don't want to miss out. Next book, though, Dan Brown is going to have to mummify Tom Hanks. Which would be fine. It would be fine. It would be really great. That's right. So fun, Duncan. Thank you. Thank you. I have one other thing. I want to come back to one of your other questions. I have one thing for you. Thank you. Party gift. OK. And that is I have something I call a consolation prize. OK. You remember that? I think I mentioned it once in Maui, but but I'm not in detail, probably. Because they weren't as learned as you. But the whole group. But, you know, this I awarded to myself. It's paid primarily, but then I'm sharing it at my elder age. This consolation prize has to do with I've been 50 years in this life, doing all this stuff. And I'm still kind of a turkey, you know, in my own way now and then. And I lose it or whatever. Although I'm getting better. My wife always says, yeah, you're improving a little bit here and there. Back slide. I want to step forward, too, back, too forward. Like that. So but the thing is this, I've gotten far enough, though. That I am certain I'm going to be a Buddha. I have no doubt about it. And I will be I will enjoy Nirvana. And I'll be in that infinite moment, yes, eternal moment, which doesn't ignore the past and the future. It incorporates the multiple futures and the multiple path. I know that I'm going to do that. And then this is the amazing thing. I figured this out, you know, in the Buddha's story, just before he attains Nirvana under the tree, he has two previous insights. And one of them is he remembers all his infinite previous lives, yes, which means he remembers being every conceivable type of being, yes, including any kind of sci-fi being they might have cooked up on Star Trek. Yes, not just on this planet. He was in because it's beginningless, infinite. He remembers all of them. Bam, like that. Then he suddenly realizes that he was entangled with every other being, infinite members, all that time, infinite, right? So then he knows all their previous things. And then he can specifically see each one where they've been locally and recently in the last 50 lifetimes or something, right? And then he looks forward and he sees all the possibilities for all of them. And he knows he'll he's cool now. So he will be he can be many beings for each of them. Yes. So he's just. And then, but what about it? I don't want to go further there. What I'm saying is the reason he was able to remember those previous lives, which we can't, is because we don't remember them because we suffered. I was suffering enough now. We don't need to remember when I broke my leg in a previous life. I don't need that. But the point is, he realized he'd always been in Nirvana. That life, the life energy itself is Nirvana. It's love. Life is love and bliss. And he'd always been, even if he was breaking his leg, even if he was a vegetarian dinosaur being by a T-Rex, he was in Nirvana because the life energy of the T-Rex and himself and every cell in his body was bliss. So he could never remember it all because he was watching the movie on the projected on the screen of infinite bliss void indivisible of his own past. Right? Yes. So what that means is now we were there. Actually, we're really feeling happy because we are joining souls, you know, thanks to Ramdhalas and Guruji and Dalai Lama and Shakyamune and whatever. Yes. So we're happy right now. We're really happy and because of our wives scolding us. And and that's also really helpful. Yes. And it really is. And so we're very happy. But we're a little frustrated. We're not kind. We're not Buddha. Yes, we think, we think, OK. But when we do get to be Buddha, even if it's a hundred lifetimes, a million lifetime, we will remember this time. We will revise our experience of this time and we'll be Buddha now. Understand? Yes. That's a collection. That's the consolation that you asked about how to hook up to that future. You follow? So I can only do it with a kind of trust in the universe. I love a loving face. Reasonable, though. Reasonable, not a blind face, not against reason, reasonable by all physics and all subatomic and all Copenhagen Declaration and then Einstein. The wonderful things, even the materialist, nailist, no soul, people, scientists have discovered about matter, yes, in the quantum computers and so on. Wonderful. So that's a consolation anyway. I want to consolation. That's the prize. That's not a consolation. That's the door prize, man. That's it. That's you just made a wormhole. That was a word you created a wormhole out of this Congress. No, it is, it is. So now we can go down and we can pick up the shattered glass of the picture frame with a nice new glass and I've been wanting to fix that thing for a while now. Kiss the hand of our Valentine. Yes, I lost my temper. No, no, no, no. Yes. You're the one. Blah, blah, blah. I want to join Tokyo. So cool. What a joy. Thank you for this. I will cherish this conversation for the rest of my life. Thank you so much. Me too, Duncan. I really appreciate it. Thank you so much, Bob. And let's let's encourage it.

Just a very quick disclaimer before we get going. By continuing to listen to this podcast, you agree to surrender your soul upon the expiration of your mortal body to the VTEC Corporation, VTEC keeping souls safe, happy, and busy. Hello my sweet and beautiful friends. It is I, D Trussell, and you are listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast and forgive me because this is a political episode of the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast and I ask your forgiveness because I am intensely aware that many of us don't want to hear about politics at all. We're chafed, man. Once when I was a kid, my dad, his friend had a motorboat and they tied a rope to it and I could sit in an inner tube and they just drove the boat around and dragged me around on this inner tube and it was like, it was probably one of the best like two or three hours of my life. Just sitting in a fucking inner tube, getting dragged behind a boat on a lake, a beautiful day. It was wonderful. But when I got home, I realized that my just like all around my ass, all around my legs, all the skin had just been rubbed right the fuck off. And I guess the joy of riding around in the inner tube somehow made me not feel the fact that it was actually dissolving the skin from my legs. And so for like a week, I had these crazy like, it looked like I'd been abused. Like I had these crazy fucking scabs all over my fucking legs from this inner tube ride and it hurts so bad. It hurts so bad. I was fucking chafed, deep chafed. And I know many of us are like that now. We're like, we've just been fucking just the constant friction of never ending tweets, editorials, news reports, and all the other anti-Trump or pro-Trump bullshit that's been being exploded out of the glowing black horn of whatever cyclopean demon has possessed our entire society and is cursing us with every single political event that happens has made us feel pretty anti-politics right now. Or even worse, we've just become like infinitely obsessed with politics and can't stop staring at the garish freak show that used to be the American political system and we've become shrill and we're like tweeting, never ending, nonstop, impotent tweets, essentially shaking our fists at a mountain. It's like you're just some lunatic who's standing in front of a volcano shaking your fist at it like, you will never be my president. And that's pretty sad and pathetic too. So I get it, man, a lot of us are chafed. We don't want to fucking hear any kind of political stuff, which is why I often hesitate when it comes to doing political podcasts or having guests on where it's going to get political. But here's the exception because today's guest has got to be one of the great political satirists living today. He's got to be. I'm not exaggerating. He's come up with his own style. I think in the future people are going to call it, I don't know what they'll call it, burgarian, burgarian political satire, I don't know. But I really mean it when I say, I think people are going to study this guy's work in the future and that in the future he's going to be identified as like, you know, one of the great political artists of our time because he is innovated away of focusing in on the absurd apocalyptic nature of modern day politics that is a million times more powerful than writing some editorial. No matter how brilliant a writer you are, no matter how deep you understand the political system, no matter how adept you are at pulling out the unseen threads of what's happening, I don't think you can come close to doing what Berger is doing with three minutes of video of Donald Trump speaking in the way that he has figured out how to underline micro gestures and micro moments. One of the most hilarious and disturbing and beautiful forms of video art that I've ever seen. So I'm thrilled to have him on the show and I hope that you will take the plunge into this political episode of the DTFH, but only take the plunge after you have watched some of Vic's videos. And I know I say this sometimes like stop it and watch this video, but I really mean it this time like really like if like look up Vic Berger, Jim Baker buckets on Google and watch it or go to dunkitrustle.com and look at the clips that I've chosen to put in the comments section of this episode. Just do it. So you get an idea who this guy is and what his art looks like. It's hilarious. It also will make you feel a little kind of uncomfortable, queasy, maybe maybe even a little freaked out if you're super hot and that's why I love it so much because he really has zoomed in on a specific bandwidth of what's going on that I don't even know if you could write about it. It's visual. You need to see it. So before you listen to this episode, please do me the honor of going and checking out one of the clips linked at dunkitrustle.com and then come back and watch it or pull up the clips and watch them while you're listening to this interview with Vic Berger. I love him. So stay tuned. We're going to jump right into this interview, but first some quick business. This episode of the DTFH is brought to you by Casper.com. Friends, the thing you're sleeping on should not feel like it was woven from gargoyle wings. It shouldn't smell like the stinking undergunt of a titillated auntie watching a strip show in Vegas. Your mattress is an occult instrument. It is the boat that will carry you down the river of sleep into the cave of dreams. Respect it. And I know why you didn't want to get a new mattress. You didn't want to get a new mattress because you thought you were going to have to get in your car and go to a mattress warehouse. And I've been to one of these before. I've told this story before. I got right after my mom died. I went crazy. Ate some weed, thought I'd feel better if I had a $5,000, $4,000 mattress. Ended up being hypnotized by a mattress salesman who was so good. He recognized I was stoned and he took me to this vibrating mattress. He looked at me with real concern and said to me, I'll sell this to you, but don't get addicted to it. You've got to promise me you're not going to get addicted to this thing because it happened to my wife. She got addicted to this mattress and he was fucking good, man. And I believed him. All you had to say was like, he was selling me something I could get addicted to. It's like, yeah, I'll take it. I'll pay any amount of money for a heroin mattress. This sounds perfect. The long and short of it is I ended up buying what essentially was like a bed for geriatrics, like a hospital bed that lifted up. I remember showing it to my friends and seeing the look of concern in their eyes as they realized I was legitimately and genuinely excited because I bought a vibrating bed. You don't need to do that. You don't need to fork over that much cash. It meant nothing. The bed wasn't that great. The mattress wasn't that great. It ended up getting all lumpy and weird. You can avoid all of this horror by going to casper.com forward slash family hour, enter in offer code family hour, and you will get $50 towards a brand new mattress, which you can send back if you don't like. So at least before you go get sucked into the swirling charismatic vortex of a highly trained mattress salesman who more than likely is working for the CIA is trying to sell you a mattress filled with scanning devices that are going to be sent to the NSA and used to slowly make you go insane, you can go to casper.com forward slash family hour, use offer code family hour, try out a Casper mattress. They'll send you a box that's got this wonderful mattress in it. You open the box, the mattress explodes out like a volcano erupting mattresses. My God, one day when Jesus returns, we will live in a world where mattresses are launched out of volcano instead of fiery plumes of magmatic death, but I digress friends. You'll get this beautiful box with a wonderful mattress in it. You can try it out. You can try it out and if you don't like it, you can send it back. You get it for a hundred nights. You can take your old cum stain mattress that looks like a shroud of Turin made out of blasts of vaginal spray, put that somewhere off to the side, install your beautiful new Casper mattress, try it for as many days as you need to. If you don't like it, send it back, go get a vibrating bed woven from whiskers plucked from the hair of a pony in Switzerland. That's what you need, but you won't. You're going to love your Casper mattress. I sleep on a Casper mattress. I've been sleeping on a Casper mattress for years, except for right now, I'm in some Airbnb sleeping on a suspicious mattress. I don't want to look at the thing. It's an Airbnb mattress, my God, my God, an Airbnb mattress in Los Angeles. God knows how many freaks have humped on this thing. It's terrifying to think about. I miss my Casper. I only advertise stuff on this show that I actually use. If you're looking for a new mattress, Casper is the way to go. Go to casper.com forward slash family hour, enter in offer code family hour, and you will get $50 towards a beautiful brand new mattress designed and developed assembled in the USA, free shipping to the US and Canada, affordable price because Casper sells directly to consumers and the product design features a marriage between foam layers for ideal firmness, just the right sink and just the right bounce. That means it's great for humping. It's an obsessively engineered mattress at a shockingly fair price. Thank you, Casper, for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH.

Now without further ado, please welcome to the DuncanTrussell family, our podcast, the spectacular glory that is currently calling itself Vic Burger. Vic Burger, welcome to the DTFH. Thank you so much for coming on the show. Thank you. Thanks man. I gotta tell you, is this the first time we've ever actually talked voice to voice? Yeah, this is the first voice chat we've done, definitely. Wow man. I'm a huge fan. The stuff you make has brought me so many laughs and I've shown it to so many people. I'm so addicted to your Jim Baker videos and I think you're the one of the best, I don't know what comedy, I don't know what you call, what do you call what you do? Is it satire? What is your term? Yeah, I guess it's satire and I'm still figuring out what it is that I actually do. It's kind of just repurposing found footage and using editing to comment on it. So yeah, I don't know really what you would call it, I guess it's like satire, comedy. It's yeah, it seems, and it's when it's with Jim Baker, I guess whenever I describe you to people, I describe it as apocalyptic because something about what you're zooming in on, on this footage that you're using, makes me feel like it's the end of the world even more than sometimes I already feel like it's the end of the world. Totally, totally. And yeah, and also I try and focus on how much of a shyster he is, you know, or other people that are just kind of scaring people and ripping them off and getting their money, scaring them and having them send money to them. You're talking about Jim Baker? Yeah, Jim Baker because he's selling all those buckets, you know. Yeah, so can you just for folks who don't know about Jim Baker, could you describe to them who Jim Baker is? Sure, he was massive in the 70s and 80s, one of the top televangelists, you know, on the planet and he ended up going to jail in the late 80s for fraud and there's like a whole sex scandal around it, but then so he kind of disappeared and he was out of the public eye. Is that when he said something about God was going to strike him down if he didn't get a certain amount of money or something? Yeah, there's something along those lines and he, I think he was buying up or he was building all these apartments that like he was going to have people live in this compound and I guess he was maybe overselling them or there's something, I don't know the exact story of it, but he was ripping people off and that's what he ended up going to jail for. So, he kind of disappeared, you know, for maybe five, six years or so and then all of a sudden he reinvented himself, you know, as Jim Baker again, but he's like almost in disguise because he's wearing a baseball cap and he's got his beard and but then he started selling these apocalypse buckets for when the world's ending and he's building up the decline of, you know, of American civilization and and it's all going to hell and the only solution is to buy these buckets. Yeah, and they're and that's this, I mean, I was completely unaware of this until I saw your videos and it's a big part of his show is like dumping out or or or or like cooking a bucket of like this horrific looking orangey cheese and then like eating it in front of everybody and it just looks fucking awful to prove how how tasty it is. But it's just like, you know, a lot of people have done taste tests and it's just disgusting powdered food with a lot of salt in it, you know, have you ordered a bucket yet? No, no, I I haven't I probably don't want to give him any money. I mean, but it's I almost bought a bucket watching your videos. I almost bought one of those fucking things. Well, I think they're collectors items. They're like Bitcoin. Like I bet in 10 years, those buckets are going to be worth a lot of money. Right. And he and he pushes them as, you know, they're furniture, too. You can you can put like 20 buckets and then put a piece of plywood over top that and put a tablecloth and you got yourself a nice dinner table. Oh, yeah. And also, you can shit in them because that's like you're totally shit in them. Yeah, that's a big way that he pitches the man. You can shit in them. You can make a fucking bed out of him. He sells the seat that you just plop right on the bucket and then you can you can shit, which is which is he points out that's going to be a big problem in the apocalypse. You you know, you're going to need to shit in something. What are you going to what are you going to do with the doodoo? As he says, what are you going to do with it all? And you're like in that mode. I mean, just do you ever let yourself just play around with the idea of that version of the apocalypse where you have ordered a bunch of Jim Baker buckets? He was right. There's flashes in the sky. The power goes out. You look at your wife and your kids and you get and they look at you with this look of just pure admiration because like when Noah was building the arc, they were probably like, honey, are you sure honey? Are you sure we should spend this money on these buckets? We're not going to have enough money to buy David's winter clothes. If we buy these buckets, I'm telling you, we can trust him, Mary. I'm telling you, I got a feeling they're looking at you like, oh, yeah. God, you saved our lives. And then and just like you you're eating that fucking. Finally, you finish off one of those buckets. You've picked off bandits a couple of times who came because they knew you had those fucking buckets. And now that you got an empty bucket, you're just shitting Jim Baker rice back into the bucket. You took it out of hell. It's it's a it's a good thought. But I mean, my thing is like if if the world's on fire, so are the buckets. The buckets are going to catch flames, too. So I mean, I don't. Well, you're in a you're in a bunker, man. Like you're like, yeah, I guess you're in a bunker. Yeah, you're in a fucking bunker. And and you're like, but this is so one of the things you do in these videos and in a lot of your videos is it's not just like you're exploring the the horror of the you know, these shysters, as you're saying. But it also there's this like focus on the people who are watching it and believing it. And that combination, as you zoom in on these crowds and the people who are. Living this, I don't know what you call it, man. These people seem to be in a different dimension or something. Yeah. And then and some of them, like, well, actually, a lot of them have just like this glaze over their eyes where it is almost like cultish, you know, where they're just they're just buying it and just like, you know, eating it up, everything they have to say and just not questioning it. That is what terrifies me. And what I love about what you're showing us is that that level of conditioning or I don't know, what would you call it? Brainwashing or because it's not just sorry. Oh, no, go on. Go ahead. Go ahead. No, please. I think it's just comes down to looking. They have the answer. You know, they have there's this problem that often they put out there, you know, like the world's going to end or that, you know, the Democrats are taking this country into the hole and we have to vote for Trump because he's going to guide us out, you know, out of this mess or or whatever it is. So they create this problem, put it out there. And then they also offer a very simple solution, you know, like if you buy these buckets and you buy my Bibles and you buy my buckets of Bibles and and and you have all this and you're prepared, you're ready to go. Then that problem solved. And in the mean, you know, they're in the middle getting all the money. And I see, you know, Trump is in the same arena as that. If you want to get political, you know, he's he's, you know, like, say, you know, the problem with this country is is all the immigration, the Mexicans. It seems like he creates this problem. He creates the enemy, but then he also offers a very simple solution of a wall, which, you know, like, OK, there's the wall. And then instead of money, he gets to be the president. You know, that's so it's same. And also by being president, he does get money too, because he charges the taxpayers to fund his vacations and everything else is lavish lifestyle. But yeah, and I think that they they buy that and they and they believe in what they have to say, because they're looking for that answer. And they offered that solution to them. Well, when you're any of your Trump videos, when you're zooming in on the people standing behind it, something which I think is so important because I mean, like it's a kind of thing. Maybe maybe your brain doesn't want to accept that this is happening or something like you ever hear that ridiculousness about how when the ships came to North America, this is probably a big pile of bullshit, because I think I saw it on that movie, The Secret. But like so this is a ridiculous idea that like when the ships came that because the native indigenous people had never seen a ship before, they couldn't see a ship because their brain couldn't accept it. Like I can remember once running into a friend of mine in Atlanta and it I'm sitting, he came and sat down next to me, started talking to me. I'm looking at him and I'm thinking to myself, who the fuck is this guy? Like, why is he being so forward with me? I don't know this guy. And then I realized shit, man, that's my friend. But my brain so didn't wasn't able to accept that this guy was in Atlanta because he lives in New York and it just seemed impossible that I didn't see who he was in the same way like this shit that you're showing the Jim Baker audience, the people at the Trump rallies. It seems so hard to understand that this is existing in the world. That in such a modern time, there's this group of people that is allowing themselves to be taken in by someone who is such a classic, obvious con artist with. Right, right. But like you think, how did that, how? You know, have you ever thought to yourself how you would get sucked in by that? I mean, it's hard. It's hard because I mean, that's what I'm trying to figure out. I think when I'm making these videos, like, how is it for me, for me and you and a lot of other people, most people, you know, would look at Trump and be like, this guy, he's been a con artist his whole life. You know, he's that's his thing. He's just been this, you know, like self-indulgent loves himself more than anything. And he's just he's a con man. He's gone bankrupt four times. He's not out to help you. He's out to help himself. And it's just like, how would do people not know that? But then some people I talk to know that he is that are supporters of him. They they don't and they don't care. You know, they don't really care that he is conning people into voting for him or supporting him. And that's another problem, too, in itself. But I, yeah, I don't I don't know how I'm not really sure what the origins of it for a lot of people, like why they would be set, you know, get wrapped in with that. Do you think you're wrapped into something that you're not aware that you're wrapped into? Do you ever wonder that? Like, if it happened to them, maybe it happened to me. Um, I was pro that's a that's a good question. Um, but like politically, I don't I don't really trust, you know, any anybody out there. I mean, I just got to be wary of I don't put my whole support behind any one candidate or anything. But yeah, I mean, I think I mean, going back to to my after high school going to college, I think I was looking to get into music you know, I was a musician. And I think the school that I wanted to go to kind of kind of wrote me in. And I think I was sold the dream there. And I guess I'll say the school. I went to Berkeley College of Music. OK, wow. They're very good at, you know, selling this dream of being of, you know, a musician or a producer school, super expensive. Um, you know, and they but they they really sold it to me and and I went there and, you know, got into big debt, big debt because of that. And, you know, my parents got into debt, taking loans out. Are you still paying off those loans? No, thankfully, I managed to, you know, in the in the however many 15 years or whatever I managed to to pay that off. Wow. Yeah. So my parents, I think, are still paying on it. Um, but I that is definitely something that I I would, you know, compare as as being wrapped into, you know, being sold the dream. But you, you know, I mean, just to stick up for musician, Vic, why are you putting it in the past tense? You're like, aren't you still a musician? Yeah, I am. I am. But I think I don't think I needed to pay, you know, was it 200,000 or something like that to to be who I am? You know, right? Musically, I could have taken some classes or gone to schools that I even looked at that were like, you know, a quarter of the price of this school. But but that's yeah, but I yeah, I am I am still a musician, though. And and I that's part of who I am, I guess. Do you make the sound beds for your videos? No, not I I did for a couple, you know, years ago. But but just I've I have this cool like sound sound bank that Super Deluxe provides me. Gotcha. That has that has like tons of stock music. And I use a lot of vintage stock music that's that's in there because it all has to be legal stuff, you know, so it's so it's through that through that website that I use. But yeah, and I manipulate a lot of it, too. Do you the the the thing you're talking about, it's not just music. I mean, it's College College, too. Right. This is right. Right. I should have put it all on them. Yeah. Well, no, I mean, the whole collegiate system these days seems a little ridiculous. Like there is this sense of like the university system itself is is. I mean, I know that I I know I actually dig it a lot out of my college. But what I got out of my college was not. Necessarily, there were a few courses I took that were life changing, but it was just the it was something about. I mean, you know, one of my best professors. This I went to a super liberal liberal arts school up in Asheville, North Carolina. And, you know, like the classes would be sitting out in the forest. And I was like sitting under a tree with this professor is teaching this class called introduction to Southeast Asia. And the whole point of the class was he would just like convince you to go to India. That was it. That was his only goal is to just make you go to India and do whatever over there. But he I remember he would he started his class looking at us and saying, what are you guys doing here? Like you shouldn't be in college. You should be out in the world right now. You should you should consider dropping out of college this year and just going to India. That was his thing, man. It was real. It was real. And I remember he like he said, you know, because this is one of the craziest things he said. He's like, here's what's going to happen. It's imagine you're in a car and you're accelerating down the highway and you're down the street and you're passing telephone poles and the cars accelerating and the telephone poles, they start off like you see one and then the next and they turn into a blur. He's like, that's what's going to happen to your years. And you're not even going to know what what's what happened and you're already going to be dying. So don't spend time wasting time here in college. Like I get that to an extent because like I like at that time at that age, like most people don't know what they want to do. And that's why you're that's why they end up going to college to try and figure that out. But like if I could do it over, I would, you know, those first five years, you know, like like like you're saying, travel and experience more have more life experiences and then maybe look into finding a trade or figure out exactly what you want to do with with school, going back to school or just take that 200 K by some fucking property somewhere, right, right. Fix it up, become getting a real estate, become like rich, go through a few bankruptcies, grab some fucking pussies and become president. It's a simple formula. Just do it. You I want to get back to this conditioning thing, though, man, like and because have you ever taken LSD? I have not, no, but I one day I would like to. I just somehow didn't do it. Never do your videos remind when I was years and years and years ago, I made like pretty much one of the. Well, I don't know if I want to call it an error. But if you're on LSD, probably you shouldn't watch MTV. Like you shouldn't like sit and watch TV. It's probably not the best way to spend the experience, but you can do it everywhere. But I remember sitting with a friend of mine and we're on this like amazing LSD and we're like, let's watch fucking MTV. Let's watch TV and we're watching TV. And that, you know, the stuff that seemed kind of normal from a lifetime of watching TV, you know, watching these people who are the hosts and the clothes that they've decided to wear and their affectations and the things they were pretending to be excited about. And then the crazy fucking commercials and just the entirety of the thing seemed to be a kind of unholy abomination, like just a sick fly trap for idiots that was just trying to suck people into some weirdo's idea of what normal people should spend their time thinking about. And that's what your videos do for me, man, is it's like it reminds me of the absurdity of modern life. And but there also feels in that and it's hilarious, but there's something in them that really feels very sinister. Do you think we're in danger right now? Like, do you have a sense that at least in the United States that we're kind of nearing some kind of we're maybe brushing shoulders with something that could be really, really bad? I think I think we're experiencing a pretty dark moment. But I have faith in our system and the people that this is kind of like Trump and his whole movement and everything is a reaction to, you know, eight years of Obama, of a black president. And I think I see this as like the final push to, you know, make America great again. You know, bring bring all the the hate and the racism and everything else. And, you know, this is like the last push for them to do to get that as the defining, you know, viewpoints in America. And I think it's failing. I think it's, you know, as you can see, he's not really, you know, legislating anything, he's not passing anything. Everything he does is an executive decision. It's just a, you know, which can be erased by the next president. And I think that we're going to be pushing past that. And there will be a reaction to this, you know, coming up in 2018 and 2020. But we have to survive this, you know, we have to get through it. And we have to get through all his all the hateful things he does every day and just, you know, try not to get distracted and try to find a way to stay positive, which I'm having trouble doing quite often. But I think, I think this is, I think they'll be good after this. Do you, that's a very optimistic outlook. And to be honest, I'm a little surprised. I didn't expect that there's something almost, and maybe it's just my interpretation of these things is like completely completely off. I interpret things in a darker way. You know, I was just on Rogan's podcast and we were talking about that song. Daniel Elton John song, you know, and like we're talking about what songs mean. And I always thought that song was, I was just, this is my brain thought that song was about his like friend who died and was being flown off in a plane to get buried somewhere. And it's about a vet coming back from the war. But like, so maybe I'm just a little sinister myself and I'm projecting it. But I think, I think what you're seeing, what you're seeing interpreting. And I think that's great. That's what that's what artists for, you know, like songs have a lot of different meanings to different people. And I think, but what you're seeing in my videos that is there, like the dread and everything, for me, that's personal stuff that where I have, I like, I have like social anxiety and I have a lot of anxiety when I'm talking to people or, or, or, you know, leading up to, to do things in my life. Right. Where I'm hyper aware of people's, you know, affectations. And, and if they look, look at me a funny way, I, I, I usually tend to, I can misinterpret what they're saying or what they're doing with their face. And I think that's where I'm kind of just amplifying those little moments that, that bother me, but I make them more for everybody. Like for people that don't have those kinds of social anxieties. That is cool, man. That is so fucking cool because what, like you're seeing these micro gestures in your life, which are triggering some kind of like anxiety reaction. And because you become adept at seeing those things, you're seeing the micro gestures. Wow, that's so cool. You're seeing them in these videos you're watching and underlining them. Like, look at that. Look at that. Look at that. What do you fucking think that is? What do you think that means? Yeah, what does that imply? Yeah. What does he, yeah, is he telling the truth there or is that, you know? Oh, my God, that we'll see that not to keep heart going back to LSD, which I do seem to keep doing, but the the the the that's one of the things that it does is it it somehow makes you see these in between frames and a person's expressions. So you do start seeing, I mean, this is why when you take LSD, you want to make absolutely sure you the person you're taking it with. If it's a girl, you got to make sure they're not, you know, you have to you have to almost do this Christian kind of like, all right, let's confess to each other any secrets we have, because you don't want to be like two or three hours into a psychedelic experience with someone. And then you start looking at their face and realize, oh, my God, they're fucking having an affair. Oh, my God, I can see it so clearly. It's so fucking crazy. You can't hide anything, you know? Yeah, and it makes you start thinking like, oh, I guess that's what telepathy is, is really just being able to see those micro gestures and translating them into something. But yeah, man, that's really fascinating. Social anxiety is a it's a nightmare, huh? It is. It really is. It's just, you know, I remember like going into college and like not really knowing what anxiety was. And, you know, because it goes hand in hand with depression too. Um, and I just, yeah, I just was always nervous around people. Like in high school, going up to high school, like I was like the prom king, I was very, you know, popular, had a lot of friends and everything. And then when I went to college, it just like hit me. And, and I was like, what is wrong with me? Why is it, you know, I was like nervous to like eat in front of other people and nervous just to meet new people. So it's just, just a bizarre thing that's, that's that I, you know, I still cope with, you know, do you take, what is that stuff? I know people who take, um, fuck, what's it called? It like slows your heart rate down. A lot of actors take it before auditions. Um, yeah, I know what you're talking about. I think my dad actually takes that. Um, so your dad has social anxiety too. I, I think it's like un, un, uh, uh, undiagnosed. He, he kept going to the doctor cause his heart was racing all the time. And they kept giving him all these like heart pills and everything that are for the heart. And then I think they snuck them to say anxiety thing. And that was the, that was what did it. Man, the, the, it's, this is another big shocker here, Vic, because, um, I consider what you do, not only to be some of the funniest stuff I've seen, but I consider it to be some of the bravest stuff because it's political. And, and, and right now we're dealing with a kind of like Africanized B. When we talk about the, um, uh, Trump supporters, right? These people are vicious, man. And, and they are, they will swarm on you and, uh, you have taken on like a huge, huge amount of negative feedback from these people. Uh, how, how do you, how do you have simultaneously have social anxiety? Why, while like putting yourself in the position of being attacked by swarms of people who really seem kind of dangerous. Yeah. Um, well, I, the best way is that, you know, I'm not always super, um, eloquent when explaining myself or, or making arguments with people with political, uh, political arguments. So I prefer to have my work more or less, you know, speak for itself. Like the, I, I can edit it the way I want and present it how I want, rather than having to get out there and say exactly what I, what I'm saying. Cause it's, it's not always, not always super easy for me. And, and I find that, that, you know, I, I've never really convinced anyone, you know, I've never changed somebody's mind totally just by speaking to them. So I think if I can present it in a way where I'm using video and images and sound, um, it helps, you know, get my point across. Yeah. But you're, I mean, you're like, you're, you're in it, in a kind of active war with like Mike Sernovich. Oh yeah. And that, yeah, in that regards, yeah, that, um, that, uh, man, well, that was just me, you know, dicking around on the internet last year, uh, when I was just kind of satirizing him and, and making fun of him with, with editing some of his videos and his periscope videos. And then it turned very dark when he, you know, when he wanted to come at me and if you want to, if you want to talk about that, I don't do like the whole. He accused you of being a pedophile, right? He said, you're, you're fans, you're, you're part of a pedophile ring. Right. I was a leader of the pedophile ring. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah. So I got, yeah. So then that, of course, that's still lingering, you know, a year later that I, I still get those accusations sent from his fans my way. Um, but yeah, that's, that's, it's, it's a dark world that I, that I've entered there. Yeah. I mean, and that's what I'm saying is that by, by the, the type of comedy that you're doing and the subject matter that you're choosing, it's, it, these people who are sitting in the audiences of the rooms that you're, uh, parodying these people are like zombies, man. And, and they, they'll do anything that they're masters tell them to do. And so there's an element of, you know, and this is, there's an element of risks to what you're doing. And I, and I've always thought that's what, you know, really great comedy finds the place where there is danger for the comedian. And then it's not, and it doesn't have to be all comedy, obviously. Right. Right. And you see a lot of failed comedy, which is where they, the, the person trying to make the content thinks that they've discovered some edgy thing, whatever. And they put it out there, but it's not really like who cares. Right. Like I get, we, we already thought we already figured that out. You know, like, I mean, and everyone, like, I guess people are some people were kind of into it, but, and I, I think Jim Carrey, I like Jim Carrey, but this new thing where he's like saying like, we're nothing, man. Have you seen those videos? Yeah, I've seen some of those. Yeah. You know, I, I'm not even standing here. I'm not standing here, man. I'm not a me. I'm a, everything. And it's like this, the thing he's talking about is like, you know, has its roots and like Eastern Vedantism and Buddhism and it's beautiful. But the way he's saying it is like, there's this strange, like edgy, like pseudo edginess to it or something. When you could just easily say, we're nothing. It's such a beautiful thing. Don't you see, you could put down the weight of your personality and your ego identity and merge with the universe, but he's like, he's wearing a black leather jacket. He's like, this isn't my painting. This isn't my floor. This isn't my sky. I'm just a no thing. The Jim Carrey thing. I'm a nothing. It's just, that's not, you know, that's, that's not really putting him in any kind of real danger. It's easy. There's not, I don't think, even though it seems edgy, there's, there doesn't seem to be a lot of risk to it. But what you're doing is risky because you are sticking a fucking stick into a bee's nest filled with fucking lunatics, man. Right. But I think I've like, you know, so far succeeded in because I'm sticking with facts and I'm not, you know, putting words in their mouths or I'm just using, I'm turning their own words against them in a way with, with hypocrisy and, and, and, you know, just using, highlighting what is what I see as bad about a lot of these people, these, these people, you know, in the alt right or, or Trump, just, just sticking, you know, not, I don't know how else to say, how else to say it, but just, yeah, just sticking with, with what's truth. What I see is truth, you know. Right. Again, that's incredibly courageous. Cause I think a lot of people just get real nervous about the, it's kind of like with, you know, Scientology, for example, one of the, you know, one of the sort of defense mechanisms of the super organism that is Scientology is, it's like a skunk. It's like, if you fuck with it, or if it's afraid of you, it'll spray you down with like lawsuits, litigation, you know, and like, you know, when, when I, when some of the Cernovich videos that I've watched, you know, he's like, it seems like he's kind of stopped accusing you directly. If you, that's probably because of some kind of legal thing, right? Um, no, I, I talked to some lawyers and they said, I wouldn't have a case because you have to prove that he didn't actually believe what he was saying. And that's like next to impossible. And he had, he himself has a lawyer that, that does these anti slap lawsuits and just knows how to get them thrown out immediately. Like he was like a free speech lawyer that, that knows how to work the system. So there wasn't really anything legally I could do about what he said. But it was how to walk the line. It seems like Cernovich, though, he, I like, I don't know, the last video I said, he didn't, he didn't seem to, he wasn't mentioning you, but he was saying he had like a private investigator or something. Yeah. And that's, he's talking about me. Yeah. There. Um, but yeah, he has stopped using my name. And I think that's because like I worry him because just, I've been successful at, you know, shutting him down and, and exposing him. But that's, that's like a, that the, you know, saying, Hey, I've got a private investigator. Do you think he, I wouldn't be surprised. You don't think he, no, he doesn't, no, he doesn't, he doesn't, I don't, I think he's just making that up. When you go outside, you don't notice some kind of like dude in a fucking trench coat, snapping shots of you, of you kind of push. Yeah. Just looking at me now. You know, they're not gonna, they're not gonna find much. I don't, I don't do a whole lot really, you know, they're gonna see me hanging out with my kids or, or, you know, editing videos. That's, it's about it. Yeah. Well, I mean, yeah, of course it's gonna find, but that's not the worry something, the worrisome thing is not, I mean, it's not that they're gonna find anything. The worrisome thing is that someone has been sent from this like group or this person and to monitor you. That's the, that's the thing that would fucking bug me. I don't want to be monitored by a, a Cernovich drone. You know, that's right. But I want to, I was wondering if, so this style of content that Cernovich is putting out and people like him put out, baked Alaska. Um, what, how would you define it? Because it seems like a new kind of thing. Like I've never, I've never really seen this before. I don't know what it is. It's political, but it has this like weird attempts at like comedy mixed into it. But then it also has this like strange feeling of passion behind it as though the person creating it was like delivering some holy message to the world. And then there's this like mealy quality to the whole thing. There's this like almost an intentional mealy quality. And I include Trump in that, you know, like, so how, what, how would you define this genre that seems to be new on the scene? I think it's for, for a lot of these guys, for maybe most of them, it's mainly about raising their profile, getting attention, getting famous, um, you know, and getting a big enough following that you can turn those people, you know, to go after your enemies, but also just give you money. You know, you can, they, a lot of these people have, you know, these, these, um, you know, Patreon accounts or whatever, whatever they are, that they're constantly giving them money for doing hateful things and for, for doing bad stuff. Um, but I think ultimately it's about finding a way to, to, to rip your, uh, people off and, and, and then get more fame. Like, and that's what kind of what Trump has done. Um, and like for Cernovich, he's, you know, he's been, he's evolved or devolved by everyone to say it, you know, years ago, he was this, um, men's rights activist and then, and then, and then, you know, that wasn't quite working out for him, wasn't getting enough money. So he evolved into this gamer gate guy, you know, part of that whole movement, which I don't totally understand, but I, I mean, I know he's not into video games at all, but he just kind of, you know, made himself part of that movement and managed to trick enough people into taking him seriously that he, his, his stature rose and then Trump came along and that's, he, he gave rise to a lot of these guys and, you know, endorse them and, and put them into a bigger light. And I mean, you got Don Jr. endorsing Cernovich, Michael Flynn, um, you know, Kelly and Conway, all these, all these people, um, in there. I mean, Trump, you know, retweeting that guy, that Jack Pesovic guy. And so there's the, just giving all these hateful people a bigger platform. But you know, hate, the thing is like, I guess, so, okay. So when I'm picture, like, I don't know. I'm trying to think of some hateful like archetype. So let's take like Darth Vader, right? This guy is fucking smart. He's evil looking. He's wearing this sleek fucking outfit. He is intelligent and focused and nefarious and, and destructive. And that's kind of how I always have pictured my evil people as being, you know, but here, here right now we're running. And again, I don't, to be honest, like, I don't even know if these people are evil. Like I think they're, they're, they're, they're misguided or something. But the, the con, this stuff that they're, I guess what I'm saying is if we, okay, the White House, you know, I don't know if that he's still doing it. But for a while, the White House was putting out these shitty videos. Remember that? Like somebody, somebody go ahead. Yeah, they're so funny. They were like, are you talking about, um, like Trump sitting in the, like the Oval Office speaking, is that what you're talking about? Yeah, like, yeah, they're just so poorly made. Yeah, they're poorly made. They look like shit. There's typos all over the fucking place. Right. And, but something, sometimes I wonder, is this actually intentional? Is it because it's kind of like the idea is, all right, the, it's not enough to. Okay. We either need, if we're going to get people to like us, no matter who we are, and that's, I guess, what politics is, it's not enough to, to just go for the median, right? If you get the median and I get the median, then we kind of have the same amount of people, I guess, because we're going to divide the median in half, maybe, right? Right. So that means that we either have to go for, so we need to go for the median and, and then we need to go for either like things above the norm or below the norm. Right. And so people like in the past, I think politicians have wanted to scoop up great people behind them, right? I mean, that's what you would want. Like I want my, you would want, you would want anyone would want their fans to be like smart and cool and amazing. But it's almost as though these people have realized like, no, no, no, no, no. Fuck those guys. Because those guys, the smart people, you got to work, man. Like you got to actually read and no shit and be something and like, you know, these are, they're, the bar is said to have, but if I start going for like the, the, the hills have, if I start going for like people who are like throwing cats into dumpster fires and laughing, right, then I'm going to have all of a sudden this like freakish army of, of, of like pre-apocalyptic drones who are kind of, who don't really, but to get them, I need to show I'm one of them. And to do that, I can't, I can't use, I can't spell, right. I need to do some misspellings. I need, yeah, I think Trump, like I think Trump wants the best. He wants, he truly does want to look the best. You know, he, he gets all his teeth whitened and everything. And, and he wants to look really, really nice. But I think the problem is he can't hire the best people because they don't want to work with him. You know, that's kind of how I see it. So, so he's getting people like, like, for, like his hats, like the, the Make America Great Again hats. Those are the cheapest, like, just like, it's like he just went online and just found like the first, you know, hat company he could find, just typed it in and, and then, you know, just the cheapest thing he could get. Um, I don't, I don't think, I think he does want things to look really good for him, but, but he's just not able to hire, you know, good enough people to work for him. And it's just amazing that he couldn't, you know, with all the money he has and everything that he still wasn't able to, to even buy those people to do it. Um, well, the, I mean, the, the, the picture that just came out, the one with the first lady in the White House that she decorated. There's like, I think there are like dancers in there. You know that picture? Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That was, that was pretty bizarre. It was, it's, but that it's, I'm, I know you, I'm, I, again, I'm surprised to hear how optimistic you are. And honestly, it makes me happy to hear that, but in my worst days, when I see something like that, like the White House with like this insane Christmas decoration that's with some lunatic standing in the middle of these like just the craziest shit, man, that does just doesn't make any sense, man. It's like, it's, you know, I don't know if you've ever seen pictures of, um, I think the Rothschilds or people who get accused of being in the Illuminati had some kind of crazy fucking Dada's party. And there's like people wearing horse head masks. And I mean, it looks weird, but it looks fucking cool. It's like whatever the fuck they were doing. That looks like a super fun party. There's something sleek and awesome about it. But like, when you look at the style you're talking about, Trump trying to look good, to me, there's something in it that reminds me of when a film starts melting in a camera and it starts bending and bleeding and burning. And it's like, this is why it's so easy for me to think, maybe this is what the apocalypse looks like, like the thing we considered to be the ultimate version of power is like having this Chernobyl style meltdown and is just spitting out like just, just vileness after vileness after vileness. And, you know, one of the creepiest things about Chernobyl, I don't know if you know much about Chernobyl. There's a documentary I saw on it is that when Chernobyl started melting down, all of this beautiful light started coming out of it. It was beautiful. And all these people stood on a bridge to watch this beautiful light coming out of the reactor because it was so pretty. And they're, you know, they, they, they were getting, they got massively rated, they were dead within like 70 hours. But I feel like there's something like that happening sometimes where we're all gazing, we're watching this thing with a kind of like, not like it's beautiful, but there's something beautiful in its absurd idiocy and not realizing like, wait, man, we're, this is actually, this is what it looks like when a country starts falling apart. Right. Yeah, that, I mean, that makes sense. Um, and also I think, like we have to find a way to cope with this too. So, you know, the humor helps, I think, and just laughing at the absurdity of it all because it doesn't seem, doesn't seem real a lot of the times. Yeah. Well, exactly, man. But that's another deceptive element to it is because it's so doesn't seem real because our brains aren't set up to accept that this can happen. Like we're not supposed to have a tacky president. We're not supposed to have a tweeting president. We're not, we want better for our elected officials. We have some standards or at least we thought we had some standards and he just kind of melted all that away. Well, we were, what we wanted is, it's like, I mean, like we were saying, I don't really, I don't really trust politicians either. And, um, but what I do expect from my politicians is if I'm getting conned, I want my con artists to be fucking great. Like, I don't want to have that moment of stopping. I don't, have you ever been conned before? Hmm, maybe like, well, I mean, like some family members have like, like grandparents from, you know, getting calls and to, to sign up for credit cards and stuff like that, that they don't want. But you've never been like, you've never been like with a con per, like I got, I remember I got conned once when I was in college or in high school. We went to this grateful dead show and this fucking hippie attached himself to this group of us and like, basically, like we wanted to buy acid. He got us a sheet of acid, ended up giving me way too much. Um, and I, I wanted to take all this acid home, but like this hippie, like in this very proficient way, he manipulated all of us so that somehow he convinced us to sell the sheet of acid he just bought for us. And yet somehow in that process, we ended up losing all our money and he almost took my friend's car. Like you, he was so good, dude. And I remember him, I remember him saying to my friend, it's like towards the end of the, he's like, he'd been working on my friend. He's like, identify, he like identified that I was the most resistant. So he gave me a shit ton of acid. So I could barely talk. Then he like, identify one of my friends just didn't really care, but one of my friends, he identifies like, all right, this is the true mark here. And cause it also happened to be the friend with the car. And that's when he was really, you know, doing this Charles Manson style. Like, listen, man, you don't need to go to high school, man. Trust me, you could always go back to high school. But how many times can you tour the dead? Let's just go, man. We'll take your car. We'll go. And like, it was amazing to watch. Thank God it didn't work, but his artistry, his first of all, he looked exactly the right way that you wouldn't want your fucking con artist, hippie to look. He was wearing this like psychedelic bandana. He had tie dye on. He had a beard and long fucking hair. And he was like, you know, just like a, wow, crazy, true, hippie man. And like, it was cool. And like, so like, at least in the con, it was appreciate the art, the form, the, the, the style that he had, exactly good at Trump is Trump is a bad con, man. Yes. And, and, and so in past presidents, you know, like, for example, like Obama, you know, who like killed a bunch of people with drones and exported and deported more people than all American presidents combined. You've got this fucking beautiful, charismatic, wise, seemingly noble, intellectual leader, right? Even, but in you, which, and I think that, that's sinister in its own, right? Because like, when you're looking at him, you're like, wait a minute, though, man, you're like, the NSA is monitoring us now. And you know what I mean? But at least you're like, you're fucking, you're wearing the right costume, dude. Right. Slicky as he has intelligent things to say, as, you know, like, yeah, I totally got it. Yeah. And, and, and so this is where it's like real, this is to me where it definitely seems like it's like a meltdown. The machine is melting down because this fucking dude, his dentures are falling out. That whole speech was a meltdown itself because he started out fine. And then it just, it just falls apart. His, his S's, you know, to start going downhill. The most if and if it was, as he said, do you have a nice, nice shape? So, OK, so then on top of it, they, they, they say he just had a dry mouth. That's like the official, that, which makes you crazy. You know what I mean? To think that that's all it was a dry mouth. Well, no, to having done comedy for a while and having had some true bombs on stage. Yeah, sure. Where all the, your saliva is embarrassed to be in your body. So it's like trying to escape back into your salivary glands or something. It's like, I'm not getting, I don't want to get out there, man. Fuck this guy's bombing so bad and your mouth dries up. And when it dries up on stage, that does have it. It is, I mean, dentures or dry mouth, I don't really care. The right, right. Who, who, and I think it's funny that like the White House is like, no, no, no, no, no. Not dentures, dry mouth. It's like, no, right. Who gives a fuck? We like, nobody cares. Yeah, he's 70 something years old. Like, like a lot of people have them. Most people have them. Yeah. Like at that age. Yeah. Who cares? Like, that's the thing. Like he, he just, he's just infallible to, to his people and his followers. Like he can do no wrong. They just have to like rework everything to rework the truth to, to have him like not do anything bad. I just, I just, that's what drives me nuts. But Vic, here's, this is, and again, I don't mean to rain, to even attempt to rain on your optimism, because in my best moments, I try to be optimistic. And then I truly do believe inside that everything's going to be fine. I just don't know what that everything's going to be fine is going to look like. And the, the, I think one of the things that our generation and pretty much everyone we know has going for them is that, and even people like who, who during the Vietnam war have going for them, even people, most just people living in the United States as far, I don't think I have to think about this for a second. So we had the civil war and then like in the world wars, we, the thing is people in this country have never experienced what it's like for a plane to fly over your neighborhood and buildings to start blowing up, right? So we don't know what war feels like over here. Like we don't know what that's like to hear the sound of planes and then here the shit start exploding and wherever you are, you might be about to die. You're probably about to die. And so when, so, so I think maybe in other countries, maybe they're a little bit more serious about their leaders. You know what I mean? Because like, they feel it, they feel the effects first hand. Yeah. And you know, this son of a, this fucking, this guy driving the bus, you know, he could drive this bus right off the, off the fucking cliff, man. And like, and this hat, like in India, when I did go to India, one of my friends ended up in this bus that was zooming around cliffs and the driver, I don't know, who knows, maybe he wanted to die. Who knows. And then somebody in the bus actually stood up and was like, this must stop. This must stop now. And the driver stopped and like Pete, like he, he slept for the night. And there's another thing that happened once, which is in an airplane. I don't remember this fucking plane crash where the fucking guy just locks the door and there's recordings of the guy, them trying to kick the door and then the pilot just flies the plane into the side of a mountain, like kills everybody on the fucking plane and like, and, and, and, and, and they couldn't get in. Like the door was locked. They couldn't even kick the door down, right? But what I'm saying is like, okay, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. His fucking mouth got dry. His dentures didn't work. Okay. Okay. Okay. That's funny. That's funny. And it is funny and he's funny. His tweets are dumb. He's a dumb dumb. Oh my God. The president is such a fucking dumb dumb, right? Until, until we attack North Korea. Right. And, and, and, and everyone's like, Oh, well, they, you know, one of the weird things over here, I think people are comforting themselves in their minds. They're thinking like, well, we know, we got a few more years until North Korea has developed nuclear warheads that they can put on their ICBMs. And also it's mutually assured destruction, right? Well, yeah, except fucking, uh, North Korea has VX gas that they could put on their fucking ICBMs right now and just drop nerve agents on cities in the, in the United States. And if they wanted to, and so mutually assured destruction is a great thing. But if, if, on, if we have sane people on each side, but the moment you've got somebody who's like, I don't really care, I'm 70, everybody hates me. I know they hate me. I don't really fucking care. I think we can go somewhere safe. There's bunkers and shit. I don't really care. He's just drinking Diet Coke and his brain's all gummy and he's foggy and he's having these like adrenaline jumps, you know, from all the fucking caffeine and who knows what else, right? And like, that's what I'm saying, man. That's where it's like the, the, the thing that's the, I just feel, I think the apocalypse isn't going to look like Darth Vader. I think it's going to look dumb, unsophisticated and kind of like grumpy. You know what I mean? Right, right. Sorry for that one. No, no, that's, that's, uh, I mean, I, I do feel that too. I guess my, that was just my answer for the, uh, podcast before it was a little more optimistic, but like, no, that, I mean, I, I'm feeling the sense of dread every day, you know, and, and I, I mean, I do have faith that, that, you know, Bob Mueller is going to, going to find something that, which he probably has already and we'll start getting the Republicans on board for impeachment because he's seems like he's already obstructed justice, but also like hopefully there's enough people surrounding him, which I don't really see too, too much evidence for it, but at least maybe General Kelly will, will be there to, you know, make sure he doesn't press that button. See, I, you know, I, like one of the things Rogan said yesterday, it was so creepy is that basically like a guy who won a popularity contest now has access to a nuclear arsenal. Right, right, you know, yeah, and he didn't even want, he just like, I don't think he really wanted the ability to, to, to nuke people. He, he just wanted to, to win and show up Obama. And then, so then he has to go through all these, these years of being president. I don't think he really wants to do the job, you know what I mean? But, but he may use it as a way to get back at the people that hate him, you know, Vic, let's do some predictions. I want to hear some burger predictions. Okay. Let's do some predictions. All right. What do you, if you had, if you were, if we had a ton of fucking money and we're at Vegas and we're going to put some bets down, what do you see happening in the next couple of years with Trump? Does he finish his presidency? Um, I, I think, uh, the pressure is going to be building. And I think he will make it to, if the pressure doesn't build in, I, well, I don't know, you know, I think he'll end up resigning before anything, but whether that's, you know, after reelection or before, I'm not sure. I don't think he'll go through with getting in peace. I think it'll get down to the wire where they start digging through his finances enough where he doesn't want that exposed that he's, you know, not as rich as he says he is. I think that will be a big blow to him and he will, he will resign and hopefully try to squash that, uh, that, uh, investigation. Do you think, one thing that I wonder is if there's people, and I think there are, if there's people like who work in, you know, what they call the deep state. Right. Right. I think maybe there's just people in, in the gov, in the government who recognize like, Oh, you guys don't realize we've got to, you can't have a fucking guy like this driving the bus and he's going insane. They probably know that because they're monitoring him way closer than we, we, we are, you know, he's in the fucking white house. It's basically like going to live in an MK ultra laboratory. Right. Like you're in a, in the nexus point of all surveillance. You're, you're, he's, he's being watched by other countries, probably, you know, who are like listening to his calls and shit. But they, they know like, okay, okay, we got to do something. We got to fucking do something here. I wonder if they'll like come to him at some point and say, look, here it is. The piss tape, man. Here's the thing, you know, here's just resigned. We're not going to fucking do anything. Just, I think, I think, like, once the Republicans know that they can't get anything more out of him, then they'll, then they'll, then something like that will happen. I think, um, because he'll pretty much sign anything and put in front of him. He doesn't really care too much about it. Right. They'll, you know, once they, once they figure out that, oh, you know, he's not, or, you know, we're, we've got all we can, we've gone as far as we can. Then, then I think, yeah, something like that will happen where, where it will be some kind of uprising or yeah, maybe, yeah, maybe the piss tape, something along those lines. Um, but he's dodged so many bullets as it is. I mean, I could see his supporters, like getting on board with the piss tape too. So, I mean, who knows. Well, somebody told, this is what somebody told me. Somebody told me that just what you're saying, that the reput, once the tax plan gets through, he's done. Like that's the last thing they need from him. So like, if they can get this crazy, whatever the tax thing is done, then there, he's dead. He's dead, dead meat. Uh, that's what I've heard. And also I heard from somebody, I mean, you hear so many fucking things, but right before all this shit went down, somebody came up to someone was telling me, Oh, no, no, no, I know these like really rich people. And they're, they're, they're telling me he's a fucked like that. He's just done. And like, you do keep hearing things like that. And then you wonder, Oh my God, is this just like Huffington post pipe dreams? Like, you know, is it just a dream? Like, and who's to say he's going to leave? Who's to say this is, you know, I dated a girl once whose mom was in the Iranian revolution and when everybody had to leave and like, like, uh, and, and she, she, she, people who've been in those kinds of situations where suddenly it's just like, everything just changes. They, they look at shit like this with, and they're like, you guys don't get it, man. Like you don't get how fast this can, this can change. Like you don't understand. That's the problem because you've never had it happen, but who's can happen. Things can happen, man. Like bad, bad fucking things can happen real quick in a blink of an eye, right? An exit. All we need, all we need, all we need is one large scale nuclear attack in any part, like smuggle in a fucking suitcase, nuke, a dude, a dirty bomb, right? Right. Any of this shit, all that, all that, that's the only thing that has to happen. And the moment that happens, then what is going to stop Trump or any president, really, but Trump, because he's the president right now from declaring martial law, suspending elections, arresting people in the news media for supporting terrorism, you know, it can happen like that, man. And I don't know about you, but I'm not, I'm not ready to go out in the streets and start like a civil war, right? No, I'm not, I'm not ready for that at all. Right. And then, and so then you kind of look at it and you realize, oh, what could happen? Like one of the things that could happen is that actually Trump really doesn't go away. He just becomes Putin. And then the United States kind of becomes like a kind of Eastern block country over time, like, you know, like, like, we don't get rid of him. He's an oligarch and he's in there now and it's like, he's not getting out. Good luck getting me out. What do you think? I'm going to fucking leave. Why would I leave? I'm not going to fucking leave. I'm not going anywhere. I'm just going to hire somebody to stage some fake attacks in different parts of the country. I'm going to rig the election. I'm going to dig my fucking heels in and get ready, get ready, because the next fucking president, if I die, it's going to be a fucking Trump and it's going to go all the way down to Baron fucking Trump. And we're just going to have, you know what I mean? We're going to have a goddamn monarchy in the United States. It's a horrifying thought run by the Trumps. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Which is why, man, what you're doing is so fucking important because in a weird way, you're the guy standing or one of the many, there's many voices out there that are, have a big reach, but you're one of the people standing up on the bus being like, this must stop. What the fuck is this? You got to stop. But the difference between you and that guy in the bus in India is that on the bus that we're in right now, there's people who are like, no, he's fine. Right. Right. We've never had a better driver. Yeah. Speed up. Look at the fucking, this is great. This is great to go this fast. Right. And they, and they're like, sit down, burger. And so I don't know. I think what you're doing is actually one of the coolest forms of political protests I've ever seen, man. It's just beautiful. Thanks. Thank you. Vic, thank you for being on this show, man.

One of the coolest things about working on Midnight Gospel was getting to work with all the people that wanted to work with Pendleton because Pendleton drew to him some of the most brilliant artists that I've ever had the pleasure of meeting in my life. And the fact that I actually got to collaborate with him was mind blowing. Today's guest is one of those artists. He's got a fantastic podcast called The Trap Set, which is interviews, great interviews with musicians. And then he let me be on it, which is pretty awesome because he's a fantastic interviewer. But he's also done music for some TV shows you've probably heard of like Russian doll or the Midnight Gospel. He and I became friends over the course of the production and I just want to introduce you to him in case you aren't familiar with him or his work. I highly recommend checking out his podcast, The Trap Set. And now everybody, please welcome to the Dugga Trussell Family Hour podcast, Joe Wong. Joe, welcome to the DTFH. I've been looking forward to this conversation for some days now. How are you holding up during the pandemic? My day-to-day life isn't much different than it is sans pandemic. There's an extra layer of existential dread, but it's not that thick. And I usually live with the fair amount of existential dread anyway. How, if you had to define existential dread, how would you define it? Well, it's kind of a catch-all for certain things that depression will tell me. I always think about this conversation I had with my mom when I was about six years old. And I was thinking about the notion of dying and becoming nothing in all of your memories going away and stuff like that, which is a heavy thing to think about when you're six. And I just started crying and I went and asked my mom what happens when you die. And she said, nobody knows. And so my family was atheistic, agnostic, but we still, I believed in Santa Claus at the time. And so I looked to him for immortality for Christmas. Like I asked for immortality for myself and my family. But I got a Nintendo, which is kind of even better. I mean, I guess from one perspective, definitely. So for you, existential dread has its roots in the contemplation of mortality? I think so. I think that's, it's larger than that, but that's where it started. So that moment for a kid has, it seems like that moment is such a powerful moment that it's understood by all the movies that make entertainment for kids. Like I was having a conversation with someone a week ago about this, how any Pixar movie, any Disney movie, it almost, there's always. Bambi's mom dies. Yeah, yeah, that sort of, that's like the, it seems like for a kid, you don't, you do cross paths with your own sense that, oh shit, I'm going to die. But even worse, my parents are going to die. Do you know what I'm saying? Like it was worse to realize, to think of your parents dying than to think of yourself dying, at least for me. Right. And I would imagine now it's the reverse. Now you're worried about keeping your kid alive. Well, yeah, yeah, or I'm worried, now I'm worried, exactly. Or I'm worried about me dying, not because I, I'm so much terrified of dying, but because I want my child to be protected and to have a dad for as long as possible. So the, now there's a whole other reason to try to survive that prior to having a kid was most certainly never like a constant reason. You know, you would stay alive because that's just what you do. You're like, oh, I'm going to live. And maybe you'd come up with like reasons for it. And I always had good reasons for it, except for the times when I was suicidal, you know, but mostly there was, now it's like, yeah, I'm afraid of death for my, because I don't want to die because my, it's going to suck for my kid. You know, and that, that's an interesting thing. Where are you right now when you think about your own mortality or your own extinction? Do you, are you, are you freaked out about it still? No, no, I think actually it's kind of lucky that I grew up the way that I grew up and that my parents gave me honest answers because it, it was something that I parsed through a lot in my early life. And now as I'm approaching middle age, I feel at peace with it. I mean, especially after seeing people that I love die, like when I was in the room, when my dad died, it really took death off of a pedestal and he was certainly ready to go. He'd been suffering for a long time and, you know, it felt like a, maybe I told you this before, but it felt kind of like a birth in a sense. I mean, it didn't feel like this giant tragedy. It felt like a release. The tragedy was that he had to live as long as he did in pain. Um, but, uh, it, it took death off of a pedestal for me. It seems like that is the, one of the mystical things that happens when you are with someone who's dying is that it, it relieves you of whatever the projection you had been putting on top of that question mark. And that, right, what you were saying before, when you're a kid, you're so scared of your parents dying and then when you actually are with them and they die, I mean, obviously it's a multi-layered emotional cake and, um, there's, there is heartbreak there, but it also gives you, it's, it's not as bad as what you imagined it to be as a child, at least not, not in my experience. I think that aspect of it causes so much guilt for people because when it happens and you're confronted not with what you imagine would be this level of heartbreak and this level of annihilation that was so great, it was going to destroy you forever. And you're just, you know, you're in a car driving away from where they died and you're broken hearted, you're grieving, but it's nothing that you imagined. And something in that softness of the experience, I can remember, I struggled with that. Like, how dare I feel okay right now? It's only been a few days, I think I'm okay. What am I, an animal? And then the grief. Yes, you are. And that's what your parents would have hoped is that they'd prepared you for that moment so that you would have the strength to function throughout that heartbreak, that it wouldn't be so debilitating that your life would be derailed.

But it does get derailed. Wouldn't you say that your life was derailed after your father passed to some degree? No. My life was a little bit derailed after he got sick, but not after he passed away. Maybe that's a special case. It's unique in the sense that he was sick for almost 10 years and was a shadow of himself for most of that time and wasn't happy. It made it easier to say goodbye because he was ready to say goodbye too. Do you remember the day he told you he'd been diagnosed and what was the diagnosis? Well, he didn't have to tell me anything because it was actually April 22, 2010. He had a stroke and it affected the basal ganglia region of his brain, which controls lots of your motor functions. Essentially, he never regained use of the left side of his body. Then as a follow-up from the stroke and then essentially losing everything in his life and not recovering, then he had dementia that was caused by the physical stroke, but also by just being institutionalized and he had to live in a nursing home. It was terrible. Nursing homes are generally not great places to live. That was 10 years of your life. Yeah. What happened when he first got sick? I took over his life. He had owned a business and a building and I had to get rid of all that stuff because he didn't have any health insurance at the time, unfortunately. He was about to go on to... He was going to become eligible for Medicare and he had pre-existing conditions. This is before Obamacare went into effect. His monthly payments were really prohibitively expensive and he just was risking it for a few months and he was going to go on Medicare. He didn't make it to the window where I could have activated Medicare early or gotten retroactive payments from them. He essentially lost everything. I had to sell everything off and run his life. At first, we tried to keep the business open for about a year because we were hoping that he would recover and that he would be able to go back to running it. What was the business? It was a restaurant. Of course, it was a nightmare. People were stealing and I couldn't be there to run it. I was trusting certain people to run it on the day-to-day level but I would go in and check in and the numbers weren't adding up. I knew that was happening and I knew there was nothing I could do about it so I tried not to let it cause me too much anxiety but it was mostly about, okay, can I keep this place floating until my dad can come back or until we know that he won't be able to come back. Then when it was obvious that he wasn't going to recover, I had to be the one to tell him, hey, look, we're selling everything that you own and getting rid of this business and firing everybody and all that. That was really hard. Those kind of things, seeing him stripped of his dignity and his life's work and all that kind of stuff, that was more painful than the actual death. Wow, yeah. Yeah. I didn't get that. My dad, he had COPD and he faded so fast that it wasn't quite so terrible for him in the sense that he did get to hold on to some a little bit of dignity. My wife says that he points out that he passed away literally the day after she went to the store to get adult diapers for him because we thought he might have to start wearing it and he just didn't want to stay. He's like, forget it. I'm not going to do that. He just dropped his body but you had to go through. That was smart. Well, yeah, there were lots of adult diapers involved and my dad was completely at the mercy of the people at the nursing home and I have a lot of empathy for people that work in nursing homes because it's a hard job and the people that are actually changing the diapers and wiping butts are not getting paid commensurate to the value that they're contributing and as a result, there's lots of turnover and there were some people that were not very good people that my dad had to rely on to change his to wipe his butt and change his diapers and sometimes my dad would call me and say, they're letting me sit in my own feces because they don't want to change me today. And then I would have to call the office and it was terrible and then there would sometimes be times when I would leave and I was living out here in LA and then I would go back and his nails hadn't been cut in months, things like that. It was just a complete stripping of his dignity. Wow. This has, how did you simultaneously? Keep it together. How did you keep your career and your art? How did you maintain anything knowing all this was happening? Well, the first two years that he was sick, I took on a lot of the responsibility because I'm the oldest kid and I also think it was selfishly a way for me to prove how I felt to him after being somewhat disconnected from him for the years prior to him having a stroke and it was kind of a way to reconnect and show him my love. And so there was a lot of stuff that had to happen in those first two years. Like I said, the first year we kept the business floating and then I had to settle some lawsuits that had been ongoing when he got sick and there was just a lot of logistical stuff to take care of getting him onto insurance, Medicaid, finding a nursing home that wasn't terrible to get him placed into and that required us talking to some of his old business connections who were on the board of a particular nursing home and sneaking him in as a Medicaid patient. Basically, all those kind of things and that two years was really hard and pretty traumatic and simultaneously I had an album come out with a band during that time and was touring in Japan and Europe and that was the first around that time I scored the first TV show I scored and another movie. So there was a lot going on and I was just not sleeping very much and you know how sometimes they say that taking care of somebody who's sick can be a self-abusive behavior or it can be a way of diminishing oneself because it's almost like an addictive behavior in the sense that everybody you know heaps praise on you for being such a good person for taking care of this person and it's a noble pursuit but then on the other hand you can easily use it as a place to hide and throw your own life away in a similar way to how people abuse substances. Well I think I got about I think I kind of started approaching the cliff of you know it becoming bad for me to do it and so after two years of kind of taking the reins it was I was lucky because my siblings many of whom were still in school at the time or out of state were in a position to really help and I'm the oldest of five kids so they were a lot of help and after that you know some of them started getting real jobs while I was still working as a musician making very little money and they were able to contribute in financial ways too so that's basically what happened and it brought us all closer together as a family I was always off doing my own thing and it brought me closer together with my siblings that's amazing sometimes and even my mom who was divorced from my dad helped out a lot she's a nurse and she even helped out quite a bit oh wow that's beautiful thank god you're that's some grace there it doesn't happen that way all the time a lot of a lot of the times there when a parent is dying siblings can get into a pretty severe drama with each other that's amazing that y'all banded together and helped him in that last decade I just you know I I'm just trying to picture you I just have to say we've only been talking for about 10 minutes now and you've already gotten to this yeah we started here yeah but you got I mean because I think in a in a one of the fantasies of being a musician or being an artist and certainly being a successful artist you know there's this somehow the the reality of life gets somehow left out of the I don't know the at least the pretty pictures that I had in my head of what what it would be like to have a career go after a thing somehow I left out that yeah but your pursuit for your own like success or your pursuit to evolve some craft or art or whatever you you you're gonna get hit by the reality of life that your parents are gonna get old and that you're gonna have to deal with whatever that looks like I never really thought about that and then when it started happening you know like when my mom got cancer I can I just remember like that suddenly realizing that our our society or was sort of set up to create an idea that I guess the our society is set up where the priorities are all scrambled you know like in and that were there was this I realized I was suddenly in this strange battle between I mean what do I do do I go do I do I have my dad come live with me do I go live with my mom while she's sick do I give everything up like what you're saying do I give it all up to go tend to my parents and isn't that the right thing to do isn't there something satanic about going after being a stand-up comic or being you know doing that when like your parents are sick you know and I felt so how did you answer that question for yourself well I didn't have to answer my father would never have allowed me to uh my father I mean even as he was dying he was you know like you can't let he was basically saying you can't let this you can't let this stop what you're doing my mom too they they both were they both understood the last thing a good parent wants is for their death to be a hindrance not like you know trying to make you a guilt tripway but I would never want to think that my dying messed up my kid's life other than like you know bringing him the implicit sadness that goes along with it and but Duncan you took the experience of your mom's death and turned it into art in a literal way and shared it with the whole world and you make a living off of it now yeah so it's kind of like a win-win right well yeah I mean you see yeah but god I had that that ten years you're talking about man I have a really vibe with you relating to that but I didn't have ten it wasn't ten years it was more like five for me but that shadow that gets cast over your life like any anyone who has a someone who's dying and their family knows about that shadow it's like you could be in the middle of the best day of your life you could be in the middle of like some whatever some great thing but there's always that shadow that right sense of like ah man are they are they trimming his nails what's her tumor count going to be when I talk to her tomorrow is is it spread throughout her body how close are we is this just going to go on forever and ever that shadow how many people in the world right now have that shadow over their lives and you want to be enlightened with that shadow and you want to be like oh I'm going to turn this into art but for me it was just like I just felt like every day I was like getting kicked in the shins a little bit you know it's like a profound yet subtle ache that stays with you do you did you yeah that's I totally relate to that and that's why I say it was almost like a weight was lifted from all of us when my dad died because he wasn't suffering anymore and we weren't suffering by proxy you know because it hurts to know that someone you love so much has been reduced to a shadow of who they used to be and that they're living in a compromised way and that they're vulnerable to the whims of whoever happens to be on you know diaper duty that day yeah that is the reality that we're in in the Bhagavad Gita as Krishna is talking about all the qualities of like the of God or whatever it's a really I think it's chapter seven or something in the Bhagavad Gita it's like God describing God's self and you know like he's saying things like I'm the taste in water I am the heat in fire I'm the intelligence of the intelligent and then one of the things he says is uh of subduers I am time and it's so incredible that's like the ultimate subduer that's the that's the ultimate uh I don't want to say domesticator but it doesn't matter who you are or how powerful you think you may be you're eventually someone's gonna have if you make it far enough the odds are pretty good that someone on diaper duty is gonna have a moment where he's like man I don't feel like changing Duncan's diaper but it's my job you know what I mean it doesn't matter it doesn't matter if you are the most it doesn't matter if you're the most powerful if you're Caesar it doesn't matter if you take over the world it doesn't matter what at some point time just gradually slowly sometimes not so slowly pushes you down under the water there's nothing you can do about it well but having having more resources can make that process more comfortable and more dignified but you're right and I would say that that's probably the reason why the primal reason why people try to accumulate power to begin with right is because of it's all rooted in that fear and it's it's stemming from a desire to want to control our environment right that that fear it's a driving force behind so many bizarre things that are happening right now I think so many you know every what every three weeks there's a new study that they've done you know they're they're trying to right now they're trying to create functional human immortality uh that you know the there who's they my friends Ray Kurzweil no no that by them I mean people who run companies that if so basically the idea is the study of aging uh is an incredibly lucrative study like if you can figure out a way to reduce or reverse the effects of aging and you can patent that process that technique then that is you're going to you know be a billionaire a beyond billionaire you're going to be so rich if you could if someone discovers a way to reverse the aging process which they think is possible they don't and so that market pressure which is stemming from not wanting to have to go through what your dad went through or my dad went through because it's like fuck living for a long time if you can't simultaneously reverse the damage that age is caused on our bodies you know other you're just going to turn into some like ancient nasferatu otherwise right you're going to have like long gross waxy fingers and just be like this drooping melted candles like i'm 600 years old be your eyes are marshmallowy and the that you don't just want to extend the lifespan you want to reverse the damage that that time has done on the human body and if you can get yeah and then you can be like a handsome nose ferrattu right like more like uh you know the dracula that's recently drank blood and and looks like a 25 year old that's right man that's the an rice vampire right exactly yeah and and that that is from what i've read and from people that i've talked to that is entirely in the future of humanity there is no reason that we uh based on where gene editing is going and based on the studies that they're figuring out regarding why we age how we age what the aging process is that they aren't going to discover some way to at the very least slow down the clock a little bit and then it's interesting would you be into that like if you know for i i know i would but would you be into like an injection or some kind of monthly treatment regimen if it would or it's turn you back into a 20 year old i mean i think i probably would in theory i wouldn't uh because you know now i i want to believe that you know i'm willing to accept that the limitations that nature places on our lives are what give them meaning blah blah blah but you know i can't i can barely stay off instagram for an hour of course i would be use shooting that stuff up too it's like there's there's my lofty ideals and then there's the way that i would actually behave well i mean how much of our lofty ideals are just connected to inaccessibility i mean i know for myself it's it's so much easier to just be like i don't even want immortality give me i have come to terms with my own death and no no please don't give me that inhaler that makes me become 20 again please no don't give me the inhaler that makes my dick instantly hard when the wind blows no please don't give me that inhaler that makes it so i not just sleep through the night but like can't wake up not because i took some sleeping agent but just because i'm young that's how young people sleep give it to me baby but then also this is what i think you could really talk about is like imagine how good music would become if musicians could live for hundreds and hundreds of years i don't know man i think the fact that they know that death is imminent is what makes music have immediacy to a certain extent oh wow so you think the reason musicians make any kind of good music is because there is some knowledge that they're dealing with that they only have a little bit of time in this particular realm i think so i mean even like heartbreak songs about you know unrequited love or whatever that those songs only make sense in the context of only having so much time on the planet if you knew you were going to be 20 for another 100 years then who cares you can just find somebody else you know wow i mean this isn't this i think is one of those it's a hypothesis that how could you even test it like i they you know in buddhism they talk about the realm of the gods and i i never have wondered what would the music be like in the realm of the gods like would it suck would you go to the realm of the gods and it's just like lazy shitty music because they're not gonna die or would it be incredibly technical but have no soul because so much of great art is connected to fear or to this so i'm sort of transcendence rather than stasis it all ties into the idea of art being having its roots in pain you know that it might yeah or or transcending it or i mean even joy having its roots in pain right having something against which to be defined oh wow yeah right right right like you're not gonna get joy if you only have joy it's not joy anymore it's just right it lacks definition yeah okay i got you i got you so like i'm hoping to find out for sure to find out like what would happen if you were overjoyed for more than like a day or something like right right um but no to answer your question i don't even i don't even necessarily think there's a direct correlation between you know virtuosity and quality when it comes to music i think it depends on the intent but there's virtuosity is almost more common now than ever before i mean you can go on to youtube and see little kids that can do things that i could never do but what is that why wait why is that this is what i don't know yeah i see that shit it's somewhat because you're you're attaining skills but those it's it's basically like if you call yourself a writer if or if your intention is to become a writer or a poet but you get really fast at typing you know what i mean it's like an instrument is just that it just has a musical instrument um is there to facilitate an ideal an idea you know a writing instrument is there to facilitate an idea it's an intermediary between an idea or a feeling and and expressing that feeling to the world and if you're only focusing on the instrument itself and not the ideas then there's not much there for me emotionally what is an idea before it becomes an idea i don't fucking know what's an idea before it comes becomes an idea yeah uh i don't know well let's let's think about that so what's a song before it becomes a song it's an experience or a feeling and then it becomes the song is a way of articulating that yeah it's like uh yeah i i think so it's an articulation it's a particular way of articulating a feeling like this song is a way of articulating a feeling so the like there is some hopefully in both of us right now there is a kind of like uncongealed ocean of pre-ideas that at some point are going to be expressed in our minds via some impulse or like you know what i'm saying like that first you're talking about ideas semen yeah that i didn't want to say pre-com but yeah that's what i'm saying like like i'm talking about like the the some kind of briny ocean of idea pre pre-com just this stuff that's like yeah i don't know i feel like that's the stuff that kind of exists out in the universe and then it can if we're receptive we can be fertilized by those ideas right and then we can nurture them and turn it into songs or whatever shows so in your version of things we're like a garden or we're like a plot of land and the ideas are like seeds and bird shit and they yeah that kind of thing yeah and the bird shit is the heartbreak and it lands on your head and then then you can come up with the idea yeah but but i that's that's not just my opinion i mean it from other songwriters that i've spoken to on my podcast or musicians that i've spoken to i think most people would say that you know those ideas don't seem to come from within you they come through you that seems to be a relatively common way of looking at it and i've heard of it you know i've heard the analogy of panning for gold or going fishing where the artist is just developing the skill of grabbing for the ideas and sometimes if you practice a lot then you are a little bit more adept at identifying them when they come to you or pulling them out of the ether on demand do you know when you're having a good idea sometimes i can tell if i like a song when i'm writing it and it feels like at first i i i just can tell that it's going to work as an idea that it's going to be fully formed and then uh how can you tell it just uh it feels like things fall into place if that makes sense like if it's it just feels like it works and that it becomes memorable and i can you know it feels like it has a personality tell me about this i want to hear about from the the the this the moment that you're aware that this idea is inside of you how do you what's the first way you're going to get that thing out do you are you are do you sit and literally write it out on a pad or do you write it via your end with some instrument i've been to your studio you've got a million different ways to do it are you talking about a song idea or a cue for anything like anytime when you're in the process of creating whether it's a song idea whether it's your own personal music or whether it's like working on the midnight gospel or any of the shows you worked on what it like i want to know like how do you you know what's the rough draft look like for you what do you when you you like tell me but and i want to start and i know this is annoying and it might seem like i'm like needling you with like impossible to answer questions but i'm really interested in tell me like that i the moment you're aware of the idea the moment you get the sense or the compass knee or the i guess the compass needles the wrong word for the moment like whatever instrument you have inside of you whatever needle starts twitching when you're getting a signal describe that to me all the way to like turning that into a finished song okay well i'll start with how i come up with scored cues because for a long time i was kind of blocked as a person when it came to coming up with my own ideas and so scoring was a way of being creative without being as vulnerable as i need to be when i'm writing my own song wait by scoring you're talking about literally writing down music like writing no i'm just talking about writing for picture so for example like on midnight gospel it's much easier for me to come up with a high volume of ideas because a there's a clear deadline in place and i've been hired to do a job and so i can kind of put on my professional hat and remove myself from it a little bit more than if i was you know writing a song for myself right and b because i don't have to be the arbiter of whether or not the music is working you know that's up to you and pen and to the other people that are working on the show and so it offloads some of the responsibility and then you know paradoxically that makes me more prolific creatively you know because i'm not i'm not having to do that last step where i'm like is this any good and and perseverating about it there's not enough time to do that right so for for those kind of projects so say you know working on a a cue for midnight gospel i'll use the one from the last episode as an example when you and your mom are talking about crying and and you know kind of talking about heartache so i that scene was cut in a certain way when i saw it and that determined the rhythm right away so that kind of we're talking about you know whittling something down from a big slab of marble into a sculpture right right so the show's already giving it some form already the way that it's visually set up is proposing a rhythm to it and then i just happened to hear a melody um it's a melody that had been in my mind for years and looking looking for a home and i knew it was going to work under that scene oh wow so then i heard the melody you had a melody in your head already like you have melodies in your head that you're just sitting back there they're like oh i'll use this melody one day yeah yeah but yeah absolutely i mean don't you do that with jokes yeah oh yeah i guess so yeah i never thought of that way though but yeah so wait i guess you couldn't hum on the melody that i it didn't feel like a vocal melody like i had tried i was like maybe this should be a song someday it just didn't feel like the kind of thing that would be sung and it was in my mind and i started humming it underneath the scene and then you know i decided it would be great to use a female vocalist so i ended up getting a woman named anna waranker to sing it she's amazing she has a band called that dog and she's part of a musical dynasty her family are all you know many of her family members are renowned musicians or record company executives or whatever but anyway so i i had that melody in mind and then i knew that again so the show helped me in this regard i knew that the q couldn't be super complex complex because most of it is sitting underneath dialogue and i didn't want to take away anything from the dialogue and i wanted the q to be something that you could feel but not necessarily here so i knew that whatever else i added had to be relatively simple and repetitive and so i heard a harp progression that would hint at the melody and then started with the harp progression and then built to the melody later so i kind of worked backwards so that was like a very i don't know if this is coming across but when i'm working on scores it tends to be a pretty technical process like it's almost like building something it's almost like putting together ikea furniture or something like that where there's all these parts that i no need to fit together and they have to fit into it together in a specific way and it's almost like putting together a puzzle so that's it's a little bit more left-brained oriented than writing songs but so when i do write songs it always usually starts with the melody as well no no lyrics no it cut the i mean i should try writing with lyrics i was um talking to dot wigan the singer of the shaggs the other day yeah because they she wrote some of the most singular songs ever and she told me that she would start writing lyrics and then the melody would just pop into her mind as she was writing the lyrics i that's never happened to me really you what is more what's more common do you think what's them what's the general in your experience interviewing so many musicians what's the and being around a bunch of musicians what do you think is more common if people usually start with lyrics or start with melody i think probably starting with melody is a little bit more common although there's certainly a tradition of people that start with lyrics especially some of the people that are more literary with their lyrics and then of course um there's a whole tradition in this country uh you know dating back a long time but an obvious example of of uh a manifestation of that tradition is like the tin panelli songwriters who were you know professional songwriters and usually there would be a lyricist and a you know melodic songwriter working in conjunction with one another and that's interesting too whoa and we kind of did that together actually on your show you know we we took some ideas that you had and turned them into into fuller form oh my god that was the most addictive thing to have a joe wong that you could send your ridiculous lyrics to and suddenly they get converted into this like awesome sound like it was such a luxury like you know because i'm thwarted by my and i understand the idea of you know uh virtuosity not being the necessarily what you what you have to have if you want to make music but still like how many times i don't know this probably doesn't happen to you but for me i don't know how many times i've just gotten lost in the precursor phases of trying to make a song simply because some technical bullshit you know what i mean like i can't figure out how to get a microphone to work and by the time the microphone is working and and the and i've i've i've almost lost whatever the fish was that i reeled in it's like it gets off the boat so to speak you know i'm saying it's your rod snaps in half yeah yeah well that's i don't know if you remember this but that's why in my studio everything is always ready to go so i i try to minimize any opportunity for my critical mind to intervene so right but what you just said is like yeah that's i get it i get it that's like saying like yeah my you know i try to keep my fusion reactor you know wired so that it's always doing fusion like having a studio wired so that everything's ready to go that's a that's there's a lot in that that you just said that's no yeah i mean i spend a lot of time thinking about that but i think it probably saves me you know far more time than i actually spend putting into it later on it's because it streamlines my process and it allows me to get out of my own way but like like you're saying like why does why does a broken microphone derail the whole process or something wired wrong derail the whole process it's because it starts engaging another part of our mind and that part of our mind overwhelms the process and then scares off the creative part of our mind that's my theory whoa like the creative part of our mind is like oh boy here he is again there he is the technician fuck you i was just about to i was just about to start singing but there you are in but what do you or it can also just manifest in a different way i mean that's why gear is so highly prized it's it's like okay well it's just it's putting it's putting a barrier between yourself and that uncomfortable feeling you need to sit in for some time when you're creating things right it's like oh it's much easier to think about the next synth that you want to get or the next summing mixer that i want to buy or blah blah blah than it is to just sit in that feeling right because in reality you can write a song by humming into your phone and there's a very good chance that that technology isn't going to fail or you can write a song by writing a lyric into a notebook yeah man i think we subconsciously kind of erect these barriers to keep us away from that pain of making stuff yeah that so that's why i found like all right i i want to have the most direct path to that and i don't want to have distractions um that will make it easier for me to you know disengage that part of myself because it's so much easier to go into the studio to try to record something and then realize that you need to rewire your you know mixer so that it's so that it's like because something about the way you think it might be going into the speakers is causing the sound to be not quite as good than it is to sit in that pain that oh you're so right it's like is there an analog to that in um comedy one thing that really resonated with me was this episode of the bernie max show where he was writing a new set and they were showing these time-lapse montages of him and his process was mostly like taking naps watching tv you know procrastinating until he finally wrote the set but i mean musical music has instruments and technology and things like that that are easier to focus on to distract yourself from the actual process of making music but is there an analog to that in comedy well i mean in comedy i guess you could say that the the gear that you're working with is a living machine it's the audience like you're you're having to go work your work the the audience is the synthesizer and and what's crazy about that is the it's a constantly changing sense like it's there's a a quality to any audience that is identical while simultaneously there's no way you're gonna ever be in front of the same audience twice unless you're like and if you are you better have a better do a different set you know because they already heard your jokes so there's a a a reality like the comparison is that for a comic you can prepare by writing jokes but and you can write jokes all day long you can write jokes all night long you can write jokes all week long on all month long but if you're not going on stage that's meaningless and though you could have seven notebooks full of jokes but those aren't really going to turn into anything good until you bring them in front of an audience as a form of like you know testing them and then through that testing you start you know realizing what's funny and what isn't over time you might have a you know the longer you do it the more you're going to have an idea of what that is because you start knowing what you want to talk about but uh the as far as like distracting yourself as a comic or it's usually the the anything you do that is keeping you off stage where whether it's like a mental thing you're just telling yourself and i'm the master at but i'm gonna have so many good excuses for not going on stage but regardless like that's the for a comic it's just if you're not going on stage then you're not working on your you can't work on your material it would almost be better to just be going on stage than to be like working on material that being said it's the balance between the two that's going to generate a set that is going to entertain people nobody wants to hear your lazy ass right on stage which i have done and that feels really dirty when you're doing that because it's like man i couldn't have like at least sat down for two hours in a cafe to like work out this idea that i have like i'm going to wait to write in front of these people who the fuck do i think i am that i would do that you know you can do it some people like it and i've seen some of the great comics do that and i've really enjoyed it it's really cool to watch and sometimes when it's done right it's got this raw quality to it that's cool anyway i've i'm sorry i got off track here i'm more interested no i like that i like that topic because i think for a long time i well i started off playing in bands and and i toured and made some recordings as a young person and then i went to music school and then that sent me on this side trajectory where for a while after that i was really concerned with becoming what i consider to be competent as a musician and also feeling like i wasn't qualified to make a statement almost like i was trying to learn how to speak from the ground up again and i wasn't willing to make a statement until i had a phd in linguistics you know what i mean and it was like that was all i recognized that was all just a way of um you know avoiding vulnerability yes um but now you know it is what it is it i did work really hard at acquiring a particular skillset that i can now put in service of ideas and it all worked out but um you know i mean it took me like a decade or more to get get to the point where i felt okay putting myself out there and it's still terrifying it's a matter of like recognizing that it's not necessarily going to get any easier nor should it that so this you essentially you you burnt you threw yourself in the kiln of discipline and you had some instinct that if you knew that you had to do that but maybe because i know i didn't have to do it i mean i i've talked to enough people that have been very successful without doing that that just followed their gut and made it happen for themselves well that that's them yeah but for me yeah i felt like i at the time i was like well why should i make records when there's records out there by john coltrane and stravinsky and all these geniuses like what do i have to offer nothing so all i can do is you know start practicing the same discipline as some of those people and see where it leads and uh yeah man turns out i didn't get as good as john coltrane or stravinsky yeah yeah yeah let's see what happens when we double your life span but like good but you know this to me one of the interesting things about any artist is that we i think we all have some crucible that we put ourselves into whether it's necessary or not you can never answer that question i you because you already went through it i mean i saw you at the hollywood forever cemetery that was the last live music show that i went to and what's the name of your band joan night creatures and the night creatures yeah and that that uh is that the first time you perform live with him yeah that's the first time i've ever sung in front of people yeah that's what i remember you telling me and i you know i was so blown away by that experience that it is one of my i don't know if you have pandemic memories where you think back to the time when we were well i saw you i saw you perform stand-up you were the last person that i saw perform stand-up and i was also thinking about you know in coming on this show i listened to your episode with dan harman the other day yeah and i think he's the last person i had a drink with before this all went down and i'm not close friends with dan by any means but he was in a movie that i scored and after the premiere he and the director who was staying with me and dan and i all went out um and had a drink and um turns out dan's from the same town as me milwaukie and we know some of the same people from there well that's crazy but yeah he's he's such an interesting person but anyway um yeah so those is that what do you mean by pandemic memories yes like you yeah the most all those moments you had that you were completely taking for granted i mean i wasn't taking your show for granted i i i recognized how great it was but you know i was taking for granted that i could just hang out with people without worrying if i was going to get some viral pneumonia and that that that that was such a great show joe man thank you so much well here's the thing that's interesting about it is you know i'm definitely happy with the music that i wrote and i was felt ready to be putting it out there and it was terrifying like my left brain my rational mind completely shut off the minute after we did soundcheck um but you know all that time that i put into practicing was mostly on drums and i barely played drums at that show i was i was playing i was like using my newest musical skills singing as the focus of it and so that's interesting to me because i had i had invested all this time in another thing but i think that the time that i invested in um you know practicing an instrument and dedicating myself to it that all still translates to the newer skills and to just my overall approach and the way i relate to other musicians in the band but yeah that was crazy i mean the band itself i i also took the approach of just surrounding myself with brilliant people with the hopes that it would camouflage me the neophyte oh right see you're the neophyte yeah right that's what's so funny about you joe and so well in that in that sense it was i was literally the first time i had sung and led a band and so i know i know the guitar player was mary timony who's been doing it for 30 plus years the drummer's matt cameron who was in sound guarded he's in pearl jam that's his other band joe this is what i love about buddhism is the final temptation of the buddha the final thing that mara the force of death or whatever you want to call the distraction of the world or i don't know what you would call mara the king of the world the final mind fuck was he asked buddha why do you deserve to be the buddha that was the final question that was the like theoretically these questions are happening in order of difficulty first it was terrifying the buddha with like the death which didn't work at all second was like offering the buddha all kinds of opulent things symbolized by mara's daughters and the final one was just the existential question which is why do you deserve to be up there on stage joe wong why do you deserve to be seen for a long time i would my answer would be that i don't and that if i work hard enough maybe i can earn the right to be up there on stage and that's not true i mean hard work does play into it but there's always people that'll work harder than you and to me it's like i going back to what we were saying before i recognize that the songs that i wrote were a gift to a certain extent in the sense that i didn't they're not completely created by me they were you know the raw materials for the idea like what we were talking about came from somewhere else and um i liked the songs and i saw it as a responsibility to put them out into the world and so it's really not even about me that's my way of putting it to myself right yeah you the the buddha's answer is maybe even more mysterious he just put his touch the ground and that that was it and then boom now we've got buddhism thank god and i've got asked a bunch he just touched the ground he just touched the ground well that doesn't translate as well on a podcast so what do you mean well if i just touched the ground when you asked me that question you'd just be waiting for me to respond i'm touching the ground you just so you know i'm touching the ground did you just touch the ground well my feet are touching the ground i suppose exactly and that's why you deserve to to see yeah and and and that's why it's a perfect answer touching the ground because it's like i'm here of course i'm going to do this this is where i'm at and but i get it man i mean i have i constantly torment myself with the imposter syndrome regarding any kind of creative output i'm always running up against myself in that regard and i'm all like inevitably it's whenever i finally am just creating just because i love doing it and i like that feeling and i love the way it feels that's when i it's everything works even when it doesn't how would you answer that question why do you deserve to have a tv show do you hear that you just touched the ground not the ground not the ground joe wait but do you do you feel did you feel a sense of imposter syndrome during the production of the show uh yeah i mean i i what so i not i i went i go beyond imposter syndrome i get imposter syndrome so bad i just figure i'm in like a shopping mall in the future and i'm gonna come out of a simulator and my friends are gonna make fun of me because i like did you really figure out a tv show like you believed it it's that realistic you know like when i'm things become so surreal uh when you're doing a thing like that because it is a dream come true and it's in in the sense that it feels like you're in a dream and so in that way it's it's sort of it's no longer even a imposter syndrome as much as like well i mean this is happening so it must i must in some some way deserve it to be happening in the sense that it's happening i don't feel entitled to it and having you know did it feel as distant from the dream as you know losing your parents felt as distant from that nightmare you know what i mean did it feel like it was in in practice it was different to the same extent yeah you i couldn't have possibly predicted what that what what it was like i the best way i could put it is i felt like i've been granted access to like uh a laboratory you know like they they talk about there's all these like radio telescopes or i don't know how to put it i felt like i've been given like access to some kind of like high tech laboratory that scientists only or like spend their entire lives hoping to get like two hours working with some kind of maybe very rare element or some kind of crazy supercomputer and you only have this tiny little amount of time to work with it and and so i felt really lucky to be in the situation of like having access to like you to being able to you know because it's a we're you know right now and the reason i'm asking these sort of i guess annoying questions about ideas themselves is i'm fascinated with this i the the concept of um i don't know how to put it some kind of uh condensation dripping into this realm from a lighter realm like so so like and it sounds so cheesy but like that concept of things mattering you know that matters to me or it doesn't matter to me and that we are matter you know and that that matter is this dense stuff and ideas are in matter because they're happening in our own consciousness at least when they you know when the sea the sea lands it but still they're lighter than our the our bodies for sure like an idea is a light thing and then in the same sense that you know if you study the human brain you can see the emotion in the brain like the brain is expressing the emotion that's where it originates but but matter i always think of it this way Duncan in the same way that the alphabet is the you know art is the building block uh are the building blocks of written language i think matter is the alphabet of you know it's the supernatural it's a manifestation of something greater and this is coming from someone who grew up in an agnostic atheistic way i mean i don't necessarily know what that greater thing is but i don't think i think it's reductive to say we are only our physical manifestation and love hate all of those things are simply you know impulses triggered by chemicals in our body and expressed through you know electrical impulses in the brain i mean that's true but it's expressing a larger idea in the same way that you could say that your favorite poem is a series of lines on a piece of paper yeah yes that's true but it's it's bigger than that those lines are expressing something beyond the piece of paper and beyond the ink and i think that's that the same thing could be said for matter in general that is beautiful this is this is that's it man it's like this we're living in some kind of cosmic alphabet and you know the nature of the thing is like if whatever poem that we happen to be in you might you might just be a letter or a part of a letter and i might just be a part of a letter and it's difficult but not impossible from just that to begin to like extrapolate a little bit about what the poem might be and that to me is a delight but i'm really in like the the reason i'm asking you about your studio and ideas in general is because it's like we're we are definitely at the very least we are in some kind of cosmic 3d printer and whoever is decided to send over the thing that we're printing out via the stuff that we're creating together or as you know individuals or whatever uh that that there's some definitely it feels like there's some intentionality behind it and which is why you know yeah i love the artists who subscribe to the concept that this idea is not mine that i'm getting a download or that i'm receiving or picking something up i think it is like that i think we're like wireless we're wireless printers and we get an idea and then we take that idea and because the idea has come from a non-place that we can't even see we have no idea where it came from it was in the cloud then the idea densifies just enough so there's a trickle of a concept in our mind or a little humming melody or something and then when the moment you become an artist or a crafts person or whatever is the moment you take that idea and start putting clothes on it and that's when you're writing it down or when you're making a tune on a piano or when you're sculpting or something right now the idea the idea has hit this dimension it is now solidifying right in front of you and that's what it was like working with y'all was like holy shit i'm getting access to all these other nodes of this hyper dimensional printer that we're in meaning that my ideas that i'm the signals i'm picking up the parts of them that are fucked up because like maybe whatever my receptor is for ideas is a little slanted that it can get that though that the static can get scrubbed out not just by me but by you and pin and jessey and everyone there so you can really get a clear signal and then together we like signal boost for signal boosters that yeah that's the collaboration which is why in in witchcraft you know you need a coven in church you need a clergy you know it's like this sort of team or you in a temple you need you need congregants you know you need like the people who gather together in a temple to not just in tone you know praise or whatever weird ass religion you're in but also to like receive ideas and then sing those ideas into the world to me that's what collaborating was like and when you keep keep your head on straight regarding that process instead of being like i've got a tv show then you're gonna do great right because it's you're just part of a you're just in a temple and you're just singing praises through the stuff you're making that's how i was thinking of it right once you recognize that you can't force things into existence or that it's usually not to the best uh it doesn't lead to the best results to force it no you surrender yourself to the to the team and and um yeah i wonder if you see it the same way when you come down to your very self like if you think about dunk and trestle as a laboratory that you have access to for the next you know few decades before your spirit goes and inhabits something else oh my god or it becomes dispersed i mean are you able to see it your life that way yeah well not until you just said that whoa man that's heavy yeah yeah i see that i see that yes yes that's that whenever i see myself like that you know what the moment the moment i that that's a reminder what you just did it makes me remember something i always forget because when i forget that that's when i get really dense but when i remember it like you just made me remember it's like oh it's like you start over again every time you remember that you know what i mean like every time you remember like holy shit i've been given access to this life what do i have i mean i think i definitely gained an increased increased appreciation of that when i was watching everything my dad was going through and he didn't have full functionality of his and full control over his body anymore you know um whoa joe i love that anyway but here's the other thing that i was thinking about is um when it comes to existential questions you know the other thing i i i think about is if we're merely a product of our genetics and our life experience neither of which we have any control over if that's the case then we have no control over anything that we do right um because we're simply responding in a genetically predisposed way to a series of events that we didn't start um and that's kind of where that whole question of all right well is that true and um or is there something is there some sort of you know semblance of agency that we actually have and if so where does that come from so what have people that you've spoken to you know what would ramdas say to that question well you know i can i can answer the question from someone this bob thurman who's this buddhist scholar he was talking about that at a ramdas retreat out for if you want you know if you want to figure out a way to like not feel bad about dumping oil into the ocean or whatever uh then one thing to do would just make everything a biological process like reduce everything to pure materialism reduce everything to predetermination reduce everything to some kind of like you know equation happening in matter that is not really intended or anything it just it is and then yeah and i think there there can you can make a pretty convincing argument if you adopt that stance well i you could say like humans are here to you know maybe our greater uh function on the planet is to create plastic and change the composition of the air and then another species will succeed us and they'll eat plastic and breathe smog you know what i mean yeah it's a george carlin joke like maybe that's what the earth wants plastic how do we know the earth is like i just want to shit ton of plastic right now but right yeah but i mean the same way that the dinosaurs didn't know that their fossils were going to become oil millions of years well yeah right i mean the the there's so the to me i think that the layer of matter that we happen to have landed in as humans is uh what's really interesting about it is there are you can definitely go down that road and there's going down that road you'll meet an entire group of people welcoming you like come yeah you're right it's just matter just forget about it it's all just a predetermined thing just forget about the whole spirit bullshit it's just a bunch of bullshit don't buy into that shit and you'll and the further you go along that road then the more the idea of the spirit or all the spiritual shit will seem like a kind of dream and i imagine eventually you won't even think about it anymore you'll just be a you kind of no longer disconnected from this material universe and to me whether or not that's a good way to be or a bad way to be i'm not positive it's i think that because of the nature of things things get denser but then also um you know i think there's things also lighten up and in that lightening up thing then matter becomes a little less important that that the body this the life the the fixation on the self it all starts kind of loosening up a little bit and with that comes a letting go that i think you summed up so well in the closing song of the show and just that you know you let it go you you you you just start letting go of it all and then in those moments of really letting go it's like you zoom out or something i don't know the best way to put it but so yeah i mean what i say in the song is one of the lines that pertains to what you were saying is the weight of will diminishes uh or slowly diminishes and i was thinking about you know our ego or our will to do whatever live or um you know affect the reality around us or affect change on the world that's a burden after a certain point which gets us back to what we were talking about before with this notion of living forever extending our 20s yeah indefinitely i i don't know i i think that i think that that's overlooking this idea of just the will is becomes a burden you know yeah that is it the that in a lot you know there's a whole school thought when it comes to that we're just like no the will is the you know the will is what is the the thing you call the will is the printer it's the receipt printer receiving the signal from the cloud it's the thing you call the will is that's your contact with what your divine destiny is which is to print out whatever the particular poetry or instruction manual or whatever the sum total of all things in the material universe are that we happen to be part of we're co-creating so the will is actually you know but i you know i i agree with your song which is that if you explore the will if you explore the self if you if you study things and just kind of just look at things from the perspective of what is heavy and what is light in my experience in my field of experience what has a quality of lightness to it and what has a quality of heaviness to it and go in the direction of the light stuff instead of the heavy stuff then you know all of a sudden your life becomes lighter and lighter and lighter and then i think that's why they call it enlightenment it's like it's some final ultimate place where you live in the world the ideas come from but you're also here somehow i mean you talk to these people who've met beings like this and the descriptions are pretty trippy man pretty trippy you ever talked to anybody have you ever met an enlightened person i mean i don't know if i've met somebody who's officially enlightened you know he's gotten the license he has like an enlightenment diploma yeah i don't know i mean i not in the same capacity you have i mean i i'm sure i think you know lots of the folks that i've spoken to on my show have achieved a form of enlightenment through the discipline and vulnerability of making music i mean it's just one discipline that can draw you closer to the to your humanity or to the essential qualities of the universe um yeah all these practices are getting at the same thing right like meditation isn't all that much different from playing an instrument with intent you know well i don't you know that that's what's so funny about neem kurali baba ramdas is guru is he would they you know they would the hippies would go off to do a med like a meditate like a of a up of a passionate retreat or something they go meditate for for 10 days or 20 days and they'd come back and he'd have to and he'd say did they did you learn how to meditate and laugh because he thought it was so funny and because when you were around him it wasn't the problem with it it's like you got around him and all your you know all that weight it just melted away and and and so once you got into that field of whatever he was putting out there everything you remembered something that that was much easier to forget when you weren't hanging out with him if you're far away from that being or far within yeah it's like yeah just another like bullshit guru tricking acid head hippies into like believing you had some potency or something i mean that is a that sounds that i you know i appreciate that hustle too believe it or not i mean when i was watching the source family i was like man i want to start a cult so bad well it was my takeaway from man you don't start the cult the cult starts you i think that's the problem is like suddenly this guy named curly baba who you know or whoever it is a person who like does that i think this is one of the possibilities when you're here and and is that you can die while you're alive and that but to do that you really have to let go of all of everything that you think you are and it can be done apparently and when it really happens then the that person becomes kind of like the opposite of a black hole like which is a the most dense thing we know of in the universe is so dense it's eating up the universe you become like a a subjective white hole so to speak and that and and when people get around you it's like they've smoked DMT but they haven't smoked DMT they get around you and it's like you're you're like bending space and that bending of space is what people call miracles which is why when you get around someone like that you're seeing stuff happening and experiencing things that are impossible that just can't happen this can't you know you you just it's impossible there's no way based on the way you've been taught about the way the world works that this could be happening but people see it and experience it and that that and it so who the fuck knows they because these these people that are the real deal they're like doorways and when you're around them for a second you go through the doorway and i i believe it i am you know and having been around ramdas who never i don't think who didn't claim that level of like realization but just having watched the things that happen around him all the time you know seeing the it's not just like the way people around him are acting but just like ridiculous things would happen man ridiculous things that weren't heavy duty stuff they were always had a quality of silliness to them and lightness but also a quality of like what are you fucking kidding me man come on can you give me an example sure like one of the craziest things we one of these retreats have been raining every single every day and then while it was raining he just went out into the ocean he would do that and this little floaty thing because he'd had a stroke he'd go out in the ocean and he was like surrounded without and he would be surrounded by people from the retreat i wanted to go swimming with him was so fun they'd like throw flowers at him was beautiful and like he would laugh and you float out there but yeah he just went out there it was raining and it sounds so cheesy and so ridiculous i'm sorry to the ramdas people people it's not like people say don't talk about these stories and i get it because it's like they're not the they're just a byproduct of something it doesn't matter but sure as shit he gets out there it just stops raining and an instant rainbow forms right right above where he's floating you know what i mean where you and it's like what the that not only is that so silly and so cheesy you know and so beautiful and so obvious you know like the it's like ridiculous it makes you laugh you have to laugh because it's ridiculous you know that that but then those those moments um i mean there's so many moments some of them i don't think i even want to talk about because it it seems like it reduces it i mean the one of just the cause because it's not about those moments right the moments are just um symptomatic of this guy's overall vibe yeah and also any body is like mildly skeptical should should anyone hearing bullshit like this out of anyone's mouth should be like come on that's a bunch of crap that's okay that's discernment you should think well yeah i mean and what i would say is okay well it's a coincidence oh yeah that's the thing that's just the problem is like all the coincidences like that seem to happen more often around him than other people up in around sure that's well the other thing to the the other thing to keep in mind is that coincidences make the world go round yeah everything is a coincidence to a certain extent yeah i mean yeah but the the exactly and you know with neem curly baba the stories that they told about him were were really really odd and really intense just a basic clairvoyance a basic ability to read people's minds that was just accepted and wasn't like maybe like a tv psychic thing but like he could just he would he could just do it and you know all these like crazy stories but he i don't think those weren't the weren't the point the point was that here was this being that had somehow turned into love it wasn't it you know i don't know he is bringing birds back to life or whatever that he could read your mind or that he was apparently could be two places at once none of that mattered what mattered was that here was a person who was love you know i'm sure if like whoever our precursor hominids were if they saw the way we are now we would all like need look like neem curly babas to them you know we're like using tools making fire flying in planes they would look at us and be like what the fuck how is that possible what is that that's us that's what we could be i think that's the real miracle is that the people can turn into love that people can be in this place where anything that's in front of them they fall in love with for real and that is one of the that's one of that's the great miracle and something about that contact with another being falling in love with them for real not pretending to love them or acting like you love them but fully being in love with them like you've known them forever and it does something to a person it heals a person so anyone coming around you it's not like you're curing their leprosy it's like you're you're giving them the feeling of what it's like to have unconditional love and something about that was what transformed the people who met him the miracle stuff was just like you know i think something that they to laugh about it was like a side show or something the you know that's what that's my understanding of it i mean damn that to me is way better than i'd much rather be around unconditional love than somebody who can you know levitate a little bit or something though i would love to see someone levitate well i think you know as far as my personal life goes i'm not capable of giving everybody new that i meet unconditional love but i do aspire to be open to feeling something in the relationship and trying to at least um like the person like trying to connect with them on a real level um and that's been something that i've had to work at because i think i've you know in in the depths of my jadedness there was a point when i found it harder to connect to people oh my god that what you just said that's it literally the intent i mean way back in the beginning of this conversation you were talking about that the intent that's it to me that's it what you just said that's it forget about trying remember when you when you were a kid and you met a new friend how exciting it was like somebody how exciting it was to have somebody in your life that you just resonated with and that maybe had some of the same um interests or you know that you just thought was cool yeah man i mean you actually i you told me the story of meeting email amos and how that changed your life but i'm talking about even before that like when you're a little kid and you meet some of your first friends how magical that is oh god it's well because you're the your whole universe changes at that moment when you make a new friend that's it you're in a new you're in a completely new realm everything's different from that you're gonna go you're gonna go to sleepovers you're gonna so you're gonna trade toys you know it's it's like everything yes i remember that i think that is something we all forget is and then yeah when you get older then you have such a larger frame of reference and so you're comparing everybody that you meet up against this appendix of other people that you've met in your life and they then become like somebody else or an amalgam in your mind of other people and other personalities and it's not as fresh and in the same way that time seems to pass more quickly when you get older i think you know these kind of human interactions can lack the depth that they had when you were younger in something that i've been trying to work at for the last couple years is getting back to that feeling and the reason why i'm trying to get back to it is ultimately that's what allowed me to then put my own music out into the world is you know i had to get in touch with my internal compass which was buried under a whole junkyard of you know hurt feelings or heartbreak or whatever it is that i accumulated by being a person i had to get back to that and not only did it help me write songs and put them out into the world but it the bigger thing that it helped me to do is connect with people god that's such such an important thing to remember man is that you've got to shut down those apps you've got running that are keeping you from being with a person as they are and and it is like those apps are trying to they're like antivirus apps they're trying to protect you from getting hurt right and um but sometimes do you know what i'm saying you i don't know if you've ever put antivirus software on and then realized that it might as well be a fucking virus because anytime exactly yeah exactly yeah and you this so this meeting meeting other people as though you don't and you are going to get viruses you're going to meet some bad people or mean people or people that um that hurt you uh but you have to be open to that in the same way that you have to be open to writing 10 clunky songs before you get to the one that really moves you this is it this is the this is what i love about my vague understanding of christian existentialism and the embracing the christ image as this being that's like yeah go ahead break me i'm gonna when i meet you you probably are gonna like crucify me and the whole time you're doing it i'm gonna be loving you for real and like that shit is crazy when you think about that like fuck that i'm not gonna let some motherfucker you know snuff me out mentally or whatever have something on me or trick me or get one over on me or deceive me like the other motherfuckers did back then i'm gonna be a tough jaded cynical successful person who isn't going to be fooled by these pigs right and that's one way to be and it might be the right way to be depending on your goals but like the transcendent quality of the christ symbol which is like no you just go ahead and kill me i guess and i'll still love you and i that's just the way i'm gonna be i'm just gonna do that i'm not gonna have any i'm not doing i'm not what getting far i'm not gonna say like the ultimate abundance mindset right yeah man i'll have another life it's okay yeah exactly it's like i i'm gonna be fine i i understand like you need to kill me you got to get this out of your system i guess but yeah and even that act of you killing me i'm still forgiving you in a real way this is why like that remember a while back that guy was on this on a train and he stopped a knife attack but the guy stabbed him and like as he was dying he said tell everyone on this train i love them and wow i don't remember that but that's pretty awesome yeah and he was dying and he's like tell and he meant the guy who knifed him and it was just like shit i'm sorry you call you you where you're at you're all dense you've got all these antivirus you got so much antivirus shit up on your subjective computer screen that you're stabbing people because you're so scared and i you didn't mean to be that way you just run in too many apps you're malfunctioning but i still love you well that kind of brings us back to what we were talking about earlier when it comes to the question of whether we are merely the product of our genetic makeup in our experience or whether we have some sort of control and i struggle with that question because you know central to my compassion for people that do so-called bad things is the thought that perhaps they didn't really have much of a choice but then on the other hand that's kind of a condescending thing to think because maybe they didn't have maybe they did have a choice well i mean who knows you're the only one who knows if you have a choice and if you put your money but you don't know right that's the whole thing like that's actually something that i apply the notion of faith to more than say god and maybe it implies a god or a larger spirituality but i try to have faith that i have some semblance of control over my life and then i'm not just watching a vr game play out like a demo or that i'm not just in a simulator in a mall in the future but you can you can choose how to watch it and that was the thing ramdas always said is like see your life as though you're looking at a beautiful flower that you're looking at it and love it love though that's that is what you got that that might be the amount of control that you have that might be it like sure of course right now if you want to you can like stand up and sit down and raise your arms or whatever and you could decide to have a beer i'm not saying i mean those and who knows maybe that's your gut bacteria or whatever decided to do that but there's a level back of that which is this place of just what i think what ramdas called the soul or soul land and he would say that's just love and you can choose to be that to feel that and then this life that you have plays out in front of you and you're just loving it like oh this is beautiful i love this that's happening that's the choice that it might be a very limited amount of control we have in the sense that all you can do is decide you're just gonna love everything even if it sucks and you know and that could be a mistake but you can do you do have that that to me feels like some form of choice well i i haven't gotten there yet but i at least i think i have gotten past feeling hate towards anybody you know yeah um say man because there's definitely been times when i felt hate towards people that hurt people that i love or that hurt me and um i think i've been able to drop that baggage i mean i i don't i it to me it's there's certainly times where it can get triggered but for the most part it's not doesn't dominate my thoughts it's moment for me it's like sometimes it's there sometimes it's like i don't it's a moment to moment thing where you know talking about it makes me remember and then i'll forget it pretty soon and then i'll read some shitty thing that someone wrote or whatever on twitter and be like you mother food and that just hurts but we you know man i don't i don't i think the question of free will is a great question but what how about this let's say there isn't free will it is all just a thing that we have no control over then whatever we have no control over how how wonderful would it be if all of a sudden that thing decided to start allowing us to experience unconditional transcendent love towards all phenomena well that would be amazing and if like part of that lack of control is suddenly we imagine that we're opening up to the world and loving it when the reality is we're just at that part of the outflow of matter into time that the little rivulet of meat that you call your body and self starts experiencing this transcendent love so what that's great i don't give a shit i don't care if i chose to suddenly start loving everything i don't care if some vr code in me sprung up and i just started loving everything i don't care if i'm being sock puppeted by the fucking demiurge that's making me feel transcendent love for all things either of those outcomes it's all the same it's love and it's that would be wonderful that being said that's not what's happening to me either joe uh unfortunately how often do you feel transcendent love anytime i'm with my baby i feel it and and i that that was a shocking thing to realize how much money i'd blown on acid when all i had to do is have a baby well babies are pretty expensive too no but god damn it they for the baby it's like at least when you're hanging out the baby you don't look in the mirror and your face is turned in to like some kind of litch native american woman you know what i mean there's at least that your face at least stays the way it is well you're presenting this like it's they're two mutually exclusive worlds i mean you can take a ton of acid and be with your baby at the same time dunkin no see what happens then i would have no fucking way they tried that back in the 60s man i'm not running that experiment no way you this is the thing let me give you an i'm sorry do you do you got a few more minutes yeah i've but do you feel um here's what i want to know is i can remember feeling you know transcendent love towards my family when i was a little kid but then the first time i felt it outside of my family context was when i started playing music with people and i can still remember the kid that i played music with the very first time and i remember he knew like three songs on guitar and i was playing drums and we just kept looping those three songs and in some ways i've been trying to find that feeling ever since oh wow yeah yeah yeah um yeah man so do you feel that when you're doing comedy yes yes i do and the best on when it's when it's working i mean i i think one of the qualities of that feeling is that to me there there is a certain spookiness to it it's so powerful and beautiful it was really powerful to have that feeling as a 12 year old it was almost like my that's what turned me into a person like into a fully formed person it was my vehicle into the world you know it was like a second it was a i was a born again musician you know it it it gave my life purpose that and it it gave me a means with which to to define myself but you want to know the craziest thing yes is when i started my podcast it was because i had completely been disconnected from that feeling and i was trying to figure out if other musicians experience the same phenomenon like i thought of it as kind of like how they say you know when you're married for a long time sometimes it just becomes companionate and there's love there but it's not as visceral anymore and you don't necessarily have mind-blowing sex anymore and it becomes more muted and i was wondering if that's you know a natural thing that was happening to me creatively and i started asking other musicians that question and that was a big part of the reason why i started doing the show because i was trying to kind of navigate through this kind of traumatic feeling of feeling you know lost when i was sitting down to play music do you and but then a few years later the kid that i first played music with turns out he's a big podcast fan and now he lives down in arizona and it runs his own business where he's out working outside lots of the time and he heard my podcast and got in touch with me so it all brought it back to that moment yeah man i mean this what you're talking about is just the that seems to be the inhalation and exhalation in the life of any mystic or artist is sometimes you feel legitimately forsaken and like you aren't getting it like not only you're not getting it back like you start wondering if you ever got it maybe that was just a dream when you were exactly you're like wait am i just building this up to be bigger than it is like is it a cornerstone story that my mind is it a construct of my mind yeah but this is this is when when jesus is being crucified this is one of his last words father why have you forsaken me i mean this is like that's the that's the like that to me that's why i love christianity is because i mean i can't i i i could count i can't remember were you raised christian yeah yeah but just i mean i love them that that particular messiah figure because that's a messiah that's that's at the very end is saying i was totally wrong like i don't feel i'm not feeling this i mean it's getting crucified not that you are gonna feel it but it's like you're you're in the moment it's not just he's saying where are you like where is the thing that i thought i had that got me up on this fucking cross and then i thought what he was saying was weren't his last words more than just a pan and crust more than just delicious pie that's what he said right after father why have you forsaken me that's a little inside joke for you midnight or something maybe joe listen i could keep yapping with you until the crows come home but i i gotta go man and i my last question for you is i didn't look i realized i could easily just google this and uh figure out what it is i have the feeling but maybe not what the fuck is a trap set anyway that's the name of your podcast what's a trap set well my podcast started off as kind of like a sociological study of drummers yeah and a trap set is an antiquated term for drum set um early in the instrument's development some people referred to it as a contraption and and perhaps that's where the uh phrase trap set came from but um it's just kind of an antiquated term for drummers for a drum set and uh it also served as a you know relatively neutral name for a podcast and i thought of it as a set of people that i was talking to it was like a very specific set of people trying to find universal themes talking to a very very narrow niche of folks got it man you do that you are such a good interviewer folks listening you gotta listen to this podcast his podcast is so you are such a pro interviewer and you really like listen to the episode we did y'all it was you like broke me down i'm still feeling it from that conversation it was so good man i'm so grateful that you let me be on your show

ultimate it's the penultimate penultimate ultimate fucking for me penultimate means ultimate ultimate i don't know shit oh god why do you have call me on my music well i was scared if that's your penultimate interview you'll ever do that might mean that the grim reapers coming for you sooner than later hold on i'm looking at are you sitting on a roller chair right now yeah i'm sitting on a roller chair too last but one in a series if that's that's like a big word thank you for correcting me by now it's too late i can't even imagine how many times i've used that word incorrectly and

Sure, you could inherit billions of dollars and take that money, invest it in some kind of expedition, some kind of powerful drill that you could use to drill down into the Hollow Earth and find that ancient city known as Shambhala or Gartha. And in that city, you could go to the special temple where the Ark of the Covenant is stored, and you could open the Ark of the Covenant up and experience the radiant burst of the purified wisdom of the ages as it splatters all over your face. You could open your mouth and stick out your tongue and just let the wisdom blasts roll down your lips into your mouth, into your eyes, or you could just stay exactly where you're at. And listen, today's podcast with Andrew Santino. But first, this.

So without further ado, please welcome to the Duggar Trussell Family Hour Podcast, Andrew Santino. [""Welcome to the Duggar Trussell Family Hour Podcast""] Welcome, welcome on you, that you are with us. Shake hands, no need to be blue. Welcome to you. It's the Duggar Trussell Family Hour Podcast. Mr. Santino, thank you so much for coming on the show. Dude, thank you for having me. I've been really looking forward to this. We've been trying to make it happen. Finally you're here. I'm gonna see you on yours next week. And I can't fucking wait to sip some of that whiskey. Yeah, baby. That's gonna be fun. I love it. I was thinking like, what the fuck do we talk about? And because you are one of the most successfully edgy comics I know. And I love it. Because I love when edgy and fearless comedy work. It's great personally for me because it makes me a braver comic. It's great for everybody because it proves that, like we were saying earlier, this is possible. You don't have to be terrified on stage. And all that bullshit aside, it's fucking hilarious. Thank you. So one thing I like to think about when it comes to comedy is the edge. And I wondered what do you think the edge is right now versus what it used to be? Like, because I think the edge changes somewhat over time. Or maybe there's more than one edge. But what do you think the edge is? That's true. That's interesting. I think like, because comedy, I've talked to a few comics about this, like Al Madrigal, especially. We always joked about that. Like comedy doesn't hold up all the time. So like a lot of times you watch old stuff from years ago that you might have loved. And you're like, that's not funny at all anymore. You know, like sometimes I watch old comics that I used to love when I was younger and I don't find them funny at all. Because the tone changes depending on what's going on in the universe and what's going on in the world of comedy and society. And I think the pushing things to the quote unquote edge is in my opinion, simply talking about what's happening in your personal framework that most people know about that don't really say it because they don't know if they should or if it's cool. Like, you know, I talked about not to like do material. But I was talking right after Halloween. You know, I'd said like, I'm a first time homeowner. I've never lived in a house. I've lived in apartments my whole life. And I was like, I got to give candy out. And I noticed that in our neighborhood, it was a ton of Mexican kids, like tons and tons and tons of Mexican kids. And I had said to my wife, I was like, this is, this is, it's awesome. But it's crazy because I thought we moved to a place where they couldn't find us. You know what I mean? And of course, like the, it's a shitty throwaway joke. And the audience laughs, but they're uncomfortable, but they're confused. But it's like, that's my version of they obviously know I'm kidding. And the undertones obvious are of things that are true in my world of like, I've never been in a house before. It was something that happened. And I was like, yeah, whoa, this is crazy. It was like, there was like no white and black kids. I was like, where are all the black kids? Where are all the Asian kids? It was like all Mexican. So I'm making a comment about my real life because it's my perspective. And they still laughed at the joke because they know there isn't vitriol behind it. It is something simple that comes off maybe edgy, but in truth, it's a joke about our reality, about my reality. That there isn't vitriol behind it. That's the key to me. Yeah. There's no vitriol. You sparkle. You've got to this. You've got this wonderful. Well, the orange hair helps. Yeah, the orange hair helps. Shiny. You got some kind of like, you've got this really, really sweet, benevolent vibe. And I think within that, you know, because people recognize right away, whatever's in your heart isn't poisonous. Right. And because of that, what comes out of your mouth is, you know, it's no matter how, like on paper, people might look at that. I mean, because what you just said, that could be a post on fucking Stormfront. For sure. That could be like just like a commentary. Typeart is going to take it and run with it. Yeah, yeah. It could be that, but the way you are, your spirit, it comes out in the right way. And by that, I mean, it comes out in a way that doesn't have that fucking thing where you go and see some comics and they go for it. Yeah. But behind it, it's not love, man. No. It's like they're fucking pissed. You can always tell when it's real, right? Like for me, like when I joked about that after Halloween, I just did that joke the night after Halloween. And was, you know, and then I went into some other stuff. But like, you can always tell that what I'm really teasing is the love I had for what was happening. It was like I was loving giving candy to these kids and like making jokes about that world was because I enjoyed it. And the tone would change if I actually didn't like it. If I didn't enjoy it, the tone of the joke would be so much more obviously sliced with negative energy that it's a hard thing to articulate, but people can feel it. Like I don't know how to write it down on paper to show somebody like why one version of a joke coming from someone's mouth is more, is filled with more honest hate than someone that's doing it out of complete jest. And it could be the same words, but just how, who presents it and in the context in which you present it, right? I mean, I just think like it's, it will never be able to put that in a capsule and show it to audiences over why that works. But it just does. Like there's something underneath it that just makes it a little bit easier to swallow because they know clearly I'm kidding. And if you're too stupid to know that I'm kidding, that's almost not my fault. Do you know what I mean? It's like if everybody else gets it and you don't, it's like, that's on you at some point. Yeah. I mean, I can't control, I can't control how people ingest my comedy, but I can control how I deliver it. Yeah. Hoping that it's, you can, you understand that like when I do something biting or quote unquote edgy, you know that it's, I'm almost mocking the edginess of it. I'm joking about it being faux pas or, or you know, not the standard way of talking about something. You know, man, here's like a real cheesy thing to say. Love, actual love is edgy, innately edgy. There is no way for it not to be. Right. People's nerfed versions of love. That's some other fucking thing, but actual, like authentic, like love love. Yeah. That shit is like people like without hesitation will throw themselves on a sword for love. Right. They will do, you know, anything for it is like to me, it's something, but so fantastically wild about love. And, and, and when you see someone who loves what they're doing or who loves their craft, loves their art, it's beautiful to watch, to witness it. And sometimes it's like kind of scary to see that, especially if your life, maybe you've been kind of like avoiding diving into that, whatever that, whatever love is, you know. So, you know, I think there's something really hopeful about, about it, because it means that if you're a comic and you're like, fuck man, I can't, my edgy shit, I can't do it anymore. It might be better to check in to like how you're feeling in general about existence and see if you got the bitters, because that's a disease comics get sometimes. I certainly have fallen prey to it or you get fucking bitter and all shitty and you feel bad and you're fucking pissed and you can't stop it. But you also know you got to write jokes. And so you write from this bitter, shitty place and then that creates a feedback loop that makes you more bitter. Bad comedy is born from that. Like I think that's where a genuine lapse in your comedic timeline happens and you can feel it too. You can see, I can go back and look at when I wrote certain things and I was like, this could have been funny if it came from a different place. It wasn't funny because it came from like this negative or bitter or, or, or jealous place. And you can feel it when you, when you know what you were thinking when you wrote it versus now. And that's where comedy takes a hit. When you write from a real negative bitter, like when people used to joke about, or like I'll give you a new example. It's like Jess on it, right? Like people talk about Anthony and they're like, Oh, he's just so mean. He's got these are the king of darkness or whatever the fuck they brand him on. You know, like that, that's it. That is a caricature he has, he has created this character. He's created is what he's giving you, right? And the reason that Anthony gets away with saying, you know, crass or, or, or edgy or rude stuff is because that's genuinely not Anthony, right? Like that. It's so obvious that when he writes those jokes, we're smiling with him because underneath it's a smile. Like I know it's crude and mean if he's doing an abortion joke, but that's not what he means. Do you know what I mean? Like what you hear is that's because society has deemed that a funny item, but what is being said underneath it is really not cruel. It just, it's just not, you know, like I said, this is a good, this is an amazing psychological exercise over what audiences find funny and why, because I think a lot of times people don't know why they think something's funny. Yeah. Like I used to say, I said, I think I did it on, on maybe I did it on Showtime, but I did this joke where I said in my neighborhood when I was a kid, I kind of got pushed around a lot for being this goofy looking weird, you know, redheaded kid. And white kids in my neighborhood couldn't stand me. Like I fought with every kid wanted to fist fight me. And I said, my neighborhood, you know, had pushed me out of being like a white boy and I had to like realign myself. And in my neighborhood, it was black, white and Puerto Rican as a kid. And I said, so white people kind of shoved me out. So I had to like find what group would accept me. And I said, so, you know, I had black kids and Puerto Rican kids. And I take a big long pause and I say, and you know, I'm not, I'm not going to be friends with Puerto Rican people. So it's just such an easy, right. And everybody laughs, but sometimes I sit and I think, I wonder if they know why they think that's funny or they just laugh at the idea that I'm making fun of Puerto Rican's and they're not that familiar with what that even means. So it must be funny to not make fun of black people. So like that fascinates me when I tell jokes like that, that I go, it's interesting that you're okay with laughing at my mocking of Puerto Rican people, but then you'll get mad at another thing that has a higher effect on your group of whatever that may be. I'm always so interested in how, why those jokes land to certain ways, to certain people harder. Do you know what I mean? Like it's wildly interesting to me. And I think that says a lot about the psyche of an audience member. And what it says even deeper is, if that joke, when I do, when I used to do that joke, when I would say that, and they would get a brewery's laughter, it's because they know, of course I don't dislike Puerto Rican people. Like they just know it. Do you know what I mean? There's no way for me to vouch that, but like, of course they know that. That's why I told the joke, because if I really didn't like Puerto Rican people, I probably wouldn't have told the joke. Ooh, right. You know, I probably wouldn't have said that. You would have hidden it away or something like that. Somehow I would have buried it in a weird slight. I would have slighted it a little bit differently. You know, it would have been a little bit more aggressive, a little bit more bitey, a little bit more, you know, inconsiderate. They would have gone off the rails. You might have gone on some like horrible rant about Puerto Rican. There'd be just this twinge of something. Something you can see it. So like what you were saying is like, you can see when a comic tells a joke that has some cruelty behind it or the bitters behind it, like you can feel it, that you're like, ooh, that's real. It's fucking radioactive, man. It's like, I was, man, I've gone through so many weird phases of comedy, but I was in a particularly shit place with comedy, and I went up at the improv and then like Jay London was at the bar and he came up to me and we're talking and goes, you know, you got weird stuff going on offstage. It leaks out on stage. And I was like, hurt so bad because it was, I'm like, oh, they see me. You can feel the real me. Yeah. Yeah, they can feel it. And maybe the only problem is that you're trying to pretend that isn't happening, and so you've produced a fake version of yourself out there and that dissonance between the two things, which is where you run to the other side of comedy, which is sometimes you'll see quote positive comics trying to do, you know what I'm talking about? It's like a brand of comedy, this like positivity comedy, and they don't really feel good about existence. They're freaking the fuck out. Totally. They're waking up in the middle of the night, gritting their teeth. They're losing, not that that means things are bad, you could have a vitamin deficiency or something like that, but who the fuck knows? I don't know. You could just have trouble sleeping, man. You could just be someone who tosses in turns at night, and this is brought to you by the Comforter. Do we do an ad read for a bamboo Comforter? Do you really want good sleep at night? Easy transition. Well, it is weird how like sweep, sleepwalkers, they don't, why don't they fist themselves? Like that never happens. Yeah, no, they just walk and eat food usually. Yeah, yeah, but that could be a cause of teeth gritting, I guess, of some scenario like fisting. The point is, man, it's like, when I see that shit, the either side of it, which is a person who has got the bitters and then that is coming out of them, no matter what they're saying, or a person, they're saying shitty things, or a person who's got the bitters and they're trying to say really sweet things, it's like fuck, both of these are attempts to what? Evade reality? Yeah, whatever's going on. It's an attempt to shift away from obvious pain, to make, to kind of like, to pivot, so to speak, to like pivot your, this false character that you have of yourself, because we're all, every comedian that I've ever met, and I'm not a wise old man, but everyone I've met in my career, we all have insecurities and we all have things, we are just uncomfortable talking, it's hard to talk about. You know, we wish we could make it all funny, but some things to some people, it's just hard to do, and sometimes when you do it, it comes off tough. Like, I've been trying to write jokes for fucking 10 years about my dad, about my relationship with my biological father who was a drug addict and in prison when I was a kid, and I've talked about it a million different ways and a million different times, and I gotta tell you dude, it's never that funny to me. I've tried to write it funny, I've tried to like, write something, it just isn't that funny about it. It's just not, it's almost, you know, they're like, tragedy is, you know, comedy is tragedy plus time, it's like, well, this is pretty tragic and it's been a lot of time, but I just, there's not a ton of funny. Like, there's not, it's way more, so when I do do it on stage sometimes, when I do dabble in it, it just isn't, it doesn't work that well. I've found it's just something I've let go. I've got a lot of those, man. This, so the answer when it comes to this potential like field, fields of incredible jokes about your father, for that to like convert into stand up, two things have to happen, right? Or two possibilities I guess. One is you could do what, it seems to be like a new branch on the tree of comedy that some people are doing, where they're on stage taking breaks from telling jokes to talk about. It's like a hybrid one person show stand up thing. And if you do it right, it can seem really powerful, I guess, if you cushion it in jokes, and then it gives you a chance to explore like a whole new mode of performance or something. And it's powerful, but I've never, whenever I've tried that shit, I'm on the back just because like, I hate what we've worked with comedy store comics. And I came up with Rogan and like in the back of my head, there's always just like, you're just lazy. You're not fucking writing enough. You're just trying to like. That's what it feels. Yeah. And so then I, it's hard to do that and not feel a little cheap. The other thing, what is the other possibility to like for you to find some inner peace in relation to your memories of your father? Possibly. Or to like, I guess like a psychologist would say to make amends or to forgive. And I talked to Dr. Drew about this on his podcast and he had said, what's important to know is forgiveness is very healthy and quite possibly one of the best things that you can do for yourself. But, but it's not a necessity and it's okay if you don't. Yeah, that's right. I was like, that's so wonderful to hear and to know like we have this idea that you're like, we should always be forgiving. And at the end of the day, we should always be the bigger person at the end of the day. We should always do the right thing at the end of the day. You should always end up just going. I, we have to forgive at some point, you know, of whatever it is. And he was very honest and adamant about being like, no, it's a healthy thing, but it's not always the end. You don't always have to go, well, at some point I must forgive. No, at some point perhaps forgiveness is not deserved. And that's the end of, and there's nothing deeper than that. It's not, it's not holding grudges or it's not, it's not, it's not building anything more inside of you other than just you've let the situation go, but forgiveness isn't a key requirement. It can be just in the ether. And that's kind of how I feel about certain things like that in my life that like, certain things I probably don't forgive, but I've let it all go. It just doesn't matter anymore. How would you define forgiveness? Forgiveness to me would, forgiveness in most situations in my life would be finding a mutual ground with the thing I'm trying to forgive person or other and coming to kind of a consensus over like mutual agreement of peace. Like that we, I accept an apology. I give an apology. We're accepting our balance in the universe as people who make mistakes and we're all just trying and I understand your perspective and you understand mind. That kind of feels like a forgiveness balance. Like forgiveness to me is like just finding an equality of balance in why things happen the way they happened and me being quote unquote, okay with it. That forgiveness to me feels like you, you admitting you're okay with something. Whether or not you really truly are, I don't know. I'm a little bit of an emotional fucking Rubik's cube. I don't really understand myself sometimes, but there are certain things that I don't quite forgive, but I don't, I don't harbor them anymore. Do you know what I mean? When did your dad go to jail? My whole childhood, my father was in and out of prison. When was the first time you remember him going to prison? Well, my parents split when I was one, so I don't, he was never like an active father in my life. But I remember getting calls from jail. I've talked about that before on pocket, but I remember him calling collect from jail. Like that was kind of vivid memories I had as a youth about like this weird lives. I never could visit him. I never visited him. I think that's something that my mother was pretty adamant. It was like, no, you're not going to go. What was he going in there for? You know, the vagueness is, the vagueness and the evasiveness, typically what happens with addicts, he's a drug addict, but typically what happens with addicts is like they tend to put everything on everybody else. Sure. You know, so it's like, it's their fault. It's their fault. It's this is fault. It's that fault. And he grew up in an extremely dysfunctional, extremely toxic place. So that's where I do have sympathy because I'm like, I know he came from a terrible, terrible place, like a bad home as a kid, you know? And so that makes sense to me, but you know, then all I remember as a kid was like stints in and out of prison and this negative balance of like never showing up for things, lying incessantly about things, you know? So it's just, I lived that a lot as a kid. So I got used to it, you know what I mean? So if somebody lets me down as an adult, it just doesn't affect me the same. I know that sounds almost, that's odd to say and admit it, but if somebody lets me down, I'm almost like, okay, that's it is what it is. It doesn't hit me as hard. And yeah, perhaps that's a positive spin on something negative. Like when somebody disappoints me, it doesn't strike me as hard for some reason. Like it just doesn't, I don't get taken aback by people who are not loyal or people that are, don't stick true to what they said they were going to do for me or with me. I just, I feel like it's a part of human life is fucking up. So I feel like that's kind of like, well, maybe that's just, it happens.

You know, once somebody told me you can trust people to be who they are, I really like that a lot. That's really good. The person will say they're one way or another, and that's part of who they are is who they say they are. Then there's all the other ways that they act, and that makes up this thing that is the person. You can always trust a person to be like that. That doesn't mean they're going to tell you the truth with their mouth, but they're always going to kind of be that way. Then it's hard to be disappointed when you're like, oh, yeah, that's just the way that thing is. That's the code in there. It just does that sometimes. Sometimes it just fucks people over. Sometimes it just disappoints people. Sometimes it does like... Now, that doesn't mean that's not the same as forgiveness. I don't think. I think that's just more of a kind of a way of like... Acceptance, maybe? Or... You know, disappointment for a lot of people is a reminder. When people are disappointed, it seems like they're like people who throw themselves off a cliff under rocks over and over again. They're like, this keeps hurting me. These crops keep hurting me. It's like, well, you're doing this. Your idea of the way the world works is apparently not the way the world works, which is that the world does not really work. It tends to malfunction. It's always off kilter. Things are always malfunctioning and going awry. You know that. You tour as a comic. You know what that's like. The sound's gonna fuck up. Something's gonna go wrong. The plane's gonna fuck up. It is the way of things. Things don't tend to work according to the way we wish they worked. Would you like them if they were harmonious? I feel like that's part of the beauty is the chaos. If I think my car was always on time to pick me up from the airport and the flight was on time and the weather was perfect when I landed and the hotel was already taken care of and everything was lined up. If I think all those things landed up harmoniously all the time, we would be bored and devoid of any sort of comical reaction to the world. Well, the boredom's interesting because boredom is cool because the next time you're lucky enough to get nice and fucking bored, take a look at the feeling of boredom because it's a really interesting feeling in that it's like painful, but then when you really start analyzing it, when I've analyzed my own boredom, I realize like, oh shit, this is like a multi-layered thing. Usually it's more along the lines, I don't want to be where I'm at or I want to be somewhere else. Right. It's usually the components of boredom. So it's like when you get everything harmonized, you do experience boredom. Sure. But what's the boredom? Where is it? What is the boredom? I think it's probably, and I think boredom is so different for everybody. You're probably not bored often. I'm somebody who's not bored often because I feel like I'm always moving, so it's like hard to get there. Like boredom might be something that I'd strive for a little bit more. Like I wish I was bored sometimes. Come to my meditation this Sunday at this yoga studio. I'll be bored. Oh, you will be fucking bored because we sit still for 40 minutes and don't talk. We'll see, but see even then I'm probably focusing mentally on getting to a place. Like I'm talking about, because that would probably be enjoyable. Like I pine for a day. Like I remember in school and not enjoying the lesson or not enjoying the class and the level of discontent was max. It was just, because school wasn't cool for me. I wasn't good at school. I didn't enjoy it that much. I was good at it. I could get through it because I feel like I was smart enough to just like coast through on a B and I barely did work, which frustrated teachers to no end. They were like, he doesn't fucking do anything and he's still getting through. Cheating. Yeah, they thought that out. But it was just, I just, I guess I was smart enough that I just figured it out. I was like, if I can just do this, I'm okay. And I could coast right through. But the level of boredom I would experience in school is something I probably took for granted because it was just, it was complete nothingness. You know what I mean? Like I was blank. I was empty. I didn't have worries. You don't have bills. You don't have families. You don't have all these things to worry about. You're inherently bored because you have so much space to fill. Like now I have all, so now I'm so full. Yeah. I don't think I have any room to squeeze in boredom. Like it's, I'm a U-Haul and you've Tetris every fucking couch. You know what I mean? Like boredom will be nowhere. Maybe put in the front seat, but that's still not going to fit because we got to get out to piss. That's how I feel about those that, because like I joke about it. You know, I've talked, I joked about this to my wife that I was like, I think, I think humans would live so, so long if we didn't pile on societal things that I also enjoy. Like having a family, making children, making a home. Like these things are heavy weighted things. I don't think people take into account how heavy, it's heavy to start a family, heavy to get a house. Like it's so heavy and I'm like, man, I wonder if we never had that. Would we, with the technology we have, would we live so long? I feel like we might live so much longer if we didn't put a lot of societal weight. And we all do it, by the way. Like everybody, I don't care what financial status you have, you put this, you put certain weights on yourself about your living situation, your family situation. It always piles. I was like, I wonder what it would be like if that wasn't so heavy. Like would we have them more full life? Because I don't, as an adult, I couldn't tell you the last time that I was like, fuck, I'm bored. I don't know. That's like, you know, there's like a, it's really like, to me, the thing, this, this sort of stuff that I've been taught on one level can really fuck up the video game. Like if you like, do you play video games? Dude, I don't. And it was so funny. It's like so many of my friends do. When you were a kid, did you? Of course. Constantly. The one thing will happen in a video game, most types of video games outside of the shooters, I guess you get some joy because you're like overcoming another person. But a lot of times in a video game, what happens is you're operating some character, a car or a thing or whatever, and you move to the next level and you're usually rewarded some extra power. Right. Like now you can fly. And because you can fly, you can take on different enemies. And then eventually you're going to start realizing like, oh shit, it's the same, literally the same pattern, but the enemies are becoming more colorful and my character is becoming more colorful. Right. The pattern seems to be essentially the exact same thing. It's like a fireworks show using different fireworks, but the same, like whatever, launching them into the same place in the air, right? We went from a sparkler to now a massive Japanese firework that has different caricatures inside of it. Yeah, but still kind of the same fucking thing. Same thing, essentially. Yeah. Fire in the sky. And so then like what happens is in a person's life, you construct these places to get past. Right. And so anyway, the whole juggling act of modern life that is definitely heavy, heavy and definitely cumbersome and definitely emotionally intense and definitely like perhaps definitely the most intense thing I've ever experienced for that intensity to function at the height of intensity. It requires there to be some possible other place you could be. And now if you've made up an idea, like, you know, when you're on the road and you get to the hotel and you sit down and suddenly you're there by yourself and for a second in that great solitude, I don't know if you get it, but I get this like, oh yeah, it's just me and the emptiness and quiet and I can relax now. Yeah. Right. Well, that is a game that I have created, which is that I produced a condition where I think is a place I can relax in. Right. And I've imagined these other places are not relaxing positions. And in fact, if they were, I think I would not want to have that level of relaxation throughout the day because I would superstitious. It might in some way reduce my ambition and lower my ability to continue fanning the flames of the suffering of and that I've created with my own mind, you know, so it produces a never ending feedback loop, which is, and that's the game, which is we all have a place for some people. It's the couch at the end of the day. For some people, it's after a run. For some people, it's the vacation. For some people, it's fucking. But whatever the fucking place is, when you really look closely at it, that place is everywhere. But you've pretended it's some special place. And thus now we've got all this heaviness, right? Like it ruins the game. That's the main thing is like, people don't want to ruin that game. I want, I mean, man, I want to fucking have millions of dollars and a beautiful thing in the fountain and the fucking thing. And you know what I mean? I want to have it. I want to travel wherever I want, send my kids to private schools and like, oh, and all the things somewhere in there. I've constructed this insane idea that when that happens, that's when I'm going to get the, but when you really look that, ah, it doesn't really quite come. And if it does come, it barely lasts. And then you realize, oh shit, the thing is like, it's not, it's, it's, it doesn't, it's not dependent on phenomenal phenomenon. Right. Well, that's why, that's why, uh, Rogan makes fun of me for, no, it's so true. Rogan makes fun of me for golfing. Joe likes to make fun of people for things that he can't do. You know what I mean? It's like, he can't golf because he knows he'd get addicted and then he'd be mad that he wasn't good enough. He would ruin him. He wouldn't get addicted and he would, he would become like, he would probably become like a, the greatest golfer or something. He wouldn't be able to stop is the main thing. So like for me, he makes fun of me. He's always like, why do you like that? The lame sport so much. And that is my, I love it. I disappear to a world of no work thought, no love thought, no like emotion. There's no emotional connection other than playing this little specific game. I, it's very, very, it's, it's drugs. It's wonderful drugs when I play golf. I don't, I can't explain it. I think everyone that plays knows it. It's like a beautiful escape with zero consequence if you're, if you're balanced, right? So like if you're bad at golf and you're still having fun, it's perfect. And if you're good at golf and you're not, and you're fucking up and you learn to just let it go, it's perfect. Like golf is one of those sports where it doesn't really matter if you're good or bad. If you're good at being okay with either, it's perfect because you're in nature. It's peaceful. It's very quiet. It's usually very serene and beautiful. Usually, I mean, most golf courses are beautiful places in nature and you just get to just do it and it doesn't really matter. Like it's just one of those things that like, there's no consequence. It doesn't matter if it works or it doesn't work. You're figuring it out. It's very much like life. Like- How many people did you just hook on golf? How many? I can feel the pull now. I feel the pull. I hope they try. It's so peaceful, dude. It really is. And it used to be a rich white man sport, used to be kind of the stigma. And now I think people are learning, it's like, you don't have to have a lot of money. Golf courses are quite affordable. A shitty bag of clubs can be found at a garage sale anywhere or your local store where you can go buy them for, you know, a hundred bucks for old shitty clubs because you don't need fancy clubs and go do it. Just go try it and I promise you if you can laugh off, if you can laugh off not being good, you will love it. I think it's, I mean, it seems to me to be one of the more psychedelic sports out there. Totally. I know it is very, very fun to ingest things and do. I like smoking weed and playing golf. I very much do. I have tried other stuff. Ironically, I don't like drinking and golfing. A lot of people love drinking and golfing. Like that's kind of a traditional- Yeah, sure. I'm not a huge fan because when I'm drinking, I don't really like to do activities. No. I'm not a let's go drink and do a sport. That's not my thing. I mean, what? Let's hold on real quick. I'm drinking sports right now because it's like bowling, darts, golf, pool, what else? I mean, anything in a bar, shuffleboard, not tennis, not football, not baseball, nothing that requires any kind of like, you know. Cardiovascular movement is hard when you're drunk. It's the one thing that I can't go to the, like I know people who will drink and go to the fucking gym. No. Never in a million years will I do that. No, but I can smoke or take a little pill and go to the gym and- You can take acid. I can take ketamine, weed, you name it. I can be on just about anything. Anything. Pain killers, speed. Right. I've never tried cocaine at the gym, but I'm pretty sure it would work. I'm sure it would work. Yeah. I have the booze at the gym. No fucking way. No. And to me, I think this is more of an indictment of booze than anything else. True. Fuck. How bad is it for you that it's like really fucking up your ability? You know what? I want to backtrack a little bit. Ketamine in the gym, they don't go together. They don't. I'd rather be quite honest. LA Fitness used to have a ketamine corner where if you were fucking- I would have joined. That would give me the anything. If you had a K corner, if you're falling into a K hole and LA Fitness was like, and we have a K corner. A treadmill for the K. K hole. Having a K hole. But no, you're right, actually. As someone who loves alcohol, I have found that what I love about it is that it's- is when I'm sitting in my home with someone, having a drink and having conversation, because I think it's wonderful at activating these like synapses in our brain of- especially, you know what it does for me? It digs into the memory crates. It's very odd. Marijuana and like pot affects me in a way where I get very involved in what I'm doing, like with you right now, like I'm- I really enjoy- I'm enjoying it a lot. Yeah, likewise. With alcohol, I start to dig into the crates of like maybe the first time I met you or the first time I saw you. And it's something that pot doesn't really do for me. Pot is way more a live-in-the-now thing. And booze tends to bring out this like kind of historical file in my brain. Like that to me is what I do value about. I do enjoy having a conversation about the past with people with alcohol. And that's, in my opinion, the history of alcohol. Most times, it was, first of all, used for relief and aid. You know what I mean? Sure. And also, it was almost a way for people to escape tragedy, you know? It was a way- it was a shared communal thing to get rid of pain from war or famine or fucked up shit because it's- because it does dilute your brain. It's not really positive for your brain. It kind of washes away negative and pain and inhibition, which I think can be good for humans in very small doses. Oh, yeah. The problem is our culture has led us to becoming okay with just blacking out. That it's like totally acceptable. That's right. To damage your brain. Yeah. So literally, it's so acceptable that the government is chill about it. Oh my God. Totally cool with you. Mind-blowing, isn't it? Ruining your brain. It's supportive. They subsidize it. One of the biggest agencies is Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. And that's a faction of our government that is supportive over something that literally tears us to pieces and does bad, bad things. A family member's friend, I won't mention, she just passed away of- what is it? At your liver, cirrhosis? Cirrhosis. Yeah, at 40 years old. Wow. The doctor said the images of her liver that were taken were that of someone who was a alcoholic for 30 plus years. I followed her liver on Instagram. You did? Yeah, it's fucked up, man. I'm sorry. It's so fucked up. Well, I got to tell you though, the posts were incredible. I know. Great posts. Some of the great posts. Really good poetry. Really good poetry. It looked terrible. The depth was there. The depth was there. But at the very end, I had to unfollow. I couldn't. Working on this thing right now for alcoholics, it's liver makeup, so it's like you can actually get the spots away. Blush and like, yeah, just like generally like shine up your liver so that it looks fucking great. The problem with alcohol, any of these things, any of them, they all, even weed to some degree, but barely, weed to like tea or something, but like to me, long-term use of any substance, it does lead to a kind of like metamorphosis that usually isn't aesthetically pleasing. True. You know, it's a, you're going to, people start, you know, there's something, Teres McKinnon said addiction is repulsive, and I think that's a really good description of it. It's like something about seeing a person out of control and is, I think just on one basic level, it's kind of scary, man. Oh, very. So my dad struggled with alcoholism, and that was a really scary thing to be around because to have a dad that on one, one phase of the day is like a normal person, but then on the other phase of the day is a roll of the dice, that's scary, but fuck, that's just like in a family situation where I guess there is some survival involved, but like from a tribal perspective and evolutionary perspective, you couldn't really run a functioning tribe if there was a member that from, that couldn't stop themselves from eating a thing that was obviously poisoning them. Right. So it might be built into us to really, is it addiction to really look at it unfavorably and to really like have a kind of like, I mean, like, it sucks. But when I'm around a true died in the wall, hardcore dedicated to their own self-destruction level addict, I go the other fucking direction. Yeah, it's hard. I used to not be like that. I used to, you know, you were talking about how your dad has impacted the way that your expectations of other people happen in the world, and we all get imprinted by our fathers. One way my father imprinted me was I at one point would gain an unhealthy, this is such an embarrassing fucking like limp in my personality where I would like find a toxic dude, you know, who was like kind of like, you know, powerful, hopefully something was really fucked up about them. Right. And then I would like try to help them. Oh, wow. Like a fix it. You really want to be a fix it guy. It's you're supposed to do that with like the people you're sexually attracted to. Yeah. Yeah. No. White night stuff with dudes is like really like embarrassing, but I didn't even realize that pattern was happening in my life until like my father passed away or so little time before that. And then I'm like, oh my God, I keep trying to repair my dad as he was when I was a kid through, through someone else. You were doing it through whomever you were gravitating towards. Let me teach you how to find a song. Oh, so awful. And they know fucking boozing, fucking carousing dude wants to have somebody fucking whispering an emotional shaman while they're trying to black out. No, but that's but it but but but that's so normal. That's like so normal. It's it's it's it's insane how normal that is. Everybody has those things. Whatever that is, we all have that thing. It just it takes it manifests differently for everybody. It takes shape in different ways. You did it because it was familiar and it probably felt pretty right. Like whether or not you knew it, it probably was pretty right in your in your high functioning version of of whatever it was. It probably felt pretty fucking good. My friends being a dick to me. It was kind of good. Right. Yeah. Probably felt oddly good. True friend. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. My but that's how you know it's a true friend when they treat you like shit. Something about that is so real for every everyone has that pattern. Whatever it is, whether it's fixing people or taking abuse or walking straight towards abuse. Like some people love abuse. Some people get off on abuse and without it they seem like empty and lost and but we all have that dude. We all have our, you know, not to sound cliche, but we we definitely all have our flaws, but our flaws are only magnified if we choose to accept them, right? Then you go, oh, it's an embarrassing limp. I'm grossed out by it's like kind of we it's such a weak part of me. But otherwise you wouldn't really have known. If you didn't, if you didn't look at it and realize it, it would just keep happening. That's right. And then that's more toxic. That's way more toxic. Yeah. And how about the thing where like when you do acknowledge the thing and if you do it out loud to the wrong person, they'll be like, don't be so hard on yourself, right? You know, it's a, you know, don't it's okay or they'll try to like put lipstick on the fucking grotesqueness and it's like, no, allow me my personal revulsion and because I'm revolted by a like weird code that appeared in my personality and the program of my identity doesn't mean I hate myself. It's just I'm allowed to look at that and look at the whole spectrum like, uh, that's fucked up. That's a real like weird thing that I don't like. And I think that's another important part of accepting it is like not trying to put lipstick on the fish, like really looking at it and being, being like, oh yeah. Like when, like when I look in the mirror and I haven't been working out, I'm allowed to be like, I'm fucking gross right now. I don't have to be like this. I can run. My knees are working. I can exercise. I don't have a disability right now. I can fucking get out there and it's fucked up that I'm not doing that. I think that doesn't, you know what I mean? I mean, I, there seems to be something in our culture, which is, uh, to somehow want to like look at a thing differently than it actually is. And then, and in that comes the possibility of allowing a thing to live in your house that doesn't need to be there anymore. We're afraid to evict subjective tenants these days, you know? Totally. Well, it depends on who's, it also that, that balance depends on who's aiding in our, you know, like if your wife or significant other or whomever, like if you look in the mirror and you say, oh God, I look so gross and they say, no, you don't, you know, they're supporting your mental wellbeing because they love you and they care about you, but you genuinely wish that they would go, yeah, yeah, you look a little gross. That's right. But, but because they love you, they just can't get there. And even if they did do that, you know, it would be disingenuous. You know? Yeah. If they did say like, okay, if, when you go, no, tell me I look gross because I know, and they go, okay, you, you've been in better shape, but it just doesn't hit the same. You're like, no, you should feel what I feel, which means that what you've constructed is probably not that real, right? That's kind of where like, I think body dysmorphia comes from and people's body images of themselves. It's because your version is so much worse always. You know what I mean? Like you are going to be your toughest critic. If you have that personality, which I think most people are tough critics of themselves, you know, if you have any self preservation, but like someone else who really cares about you is never going to join that party. You want them to cause you want to go, give me the fucking motivation to hate this as much as I think I do, but they won't give it to you because it's just not true, right? So I think you've constructed in your own mind the most, the most negative version of it. And because it, it probably will never exist cause you've, your brain is so powerful to go, you're the fattest and ugliest you've ever been. You're gross dude. You're gross. All I need is a little validation to get me through this. So you want someone to go, you are gross. So you go, see, we knew it. We knew it. And then, but then it shouldn't stop there. And I know what you're saying. It's like to me, just cause we were talking about forgiveness in the beginning and I think this ties into that to some degree. It's like, I think a huge part of forgiveness is to completely acknowledge to the best of your ability what happened, whether you were the person who hopes someone forgives them or whether there's someone who hopes you forgive them. What actually happened? Cause I know in my mind with my dad and there have been times where I felt guilty just looking at it as it actually was, you know, like there's a sense of like, oh, I can't even like think the truth. And, you know, since I had a kid and now I'm looking at this beautiful child and I'm like, you are never going to be in a fucking apartment in college station, Texas surrounded by pornography while I'm off at fucking work and then going to a bar. That's never going to happen to you ever, never going to happen. But for me to like get to that point, I need to acknowledge the totality of the terrain that I was living on. And then instead of just stopping there, which they think where victims stop, is they're like, ah, yeah, that fucking sucked, oh, fuck. Then now that you have that, you can place it on a weird spectrum, a continuum of what could have happened. And so this is where this thing, this Neville Goddard should I'm listening to when he talks about forgiveness, the way he talks about it is not the way it's commonly understood as I've commonly understood it, which is generally some kind of, it's the same thing like, what are you grateful for? And then you're just supposed to like express some bullshit. You're not feeling gratitude, but you're going to be like, oh, I'm grateful for the trees. You're not feeling anything. You're either numb or blank or you really don't give a shit or you feel awkward. That's not real gratitude. That's just putting on a show similarly with forgiveness because it's fashionable to have some monster in your past and then weave the story of the horror and then weave the story of your grand forgiveness. Right. Even though inside you're still fucking just walking with a limp, you're still confused and pissed and in denial. That's not forgiveness. So Goddard's version of it that I like a lot is and it's psychedelic and it seems on one level, maybe like delusional or something, but his version of it is take whatever the places that you want to forgive, go back there and your memory bank, some whiskey and then revise it. So now it's like, for me, that would be, oh, I'm in like a non-divorced household where my dad and my mom are really in love and my dad has not succumbed to alcoholism, but he still loves life and he's still funny and he's excited about being alive and my mom is not struggling with her own issues and her own troubles and they're really focused on me and my brother. My brother is like a big brother who isn't trying to get his mind to wrap around 18 fucking addresses that we all move to over the course of our childhood or whatever. And then in that, you live in that place as that family. And it's really, really powerful, man, because if you really do it and it's number one, it takes some courage to do it because it's heartbreaking because to do it, you've got to fucking acknowledge the other side of what you experienced. But then that heartbreak is good. You should feel that. That's what you should feel. It's natural. Yeah. And then from there, suddenly you start reliving things as they could have been. And then within that, weirdly, because all that memory shit is is like stored like neurotransmitters that are expressing themselves in a certain way. Within that, there seems to be some kind of authentic relief that comes, that awful cord that maybe you still feel tight as fuck between you and your dad. It starts like loosening somehow. And I think that's what Goddard calls forgiveness is revising your past mentally until you are or it's not the memories you're having or memories of the a perfect thing that didn't happen. It's crazy. That's crazy. Yeah. Have you done that? I do it all the time. Have you done it with your father and your his your past? Yeah. Yeah. I've got like. Do you think it took his death to do that? So that's like a big thing that I've studied and tried to figure out about. Your dad is no longer with us? No, no, he's alive. But I think about this is so dark. I think about I'm like, if he passed away, how would I feel? And that's a crazy thing to say out loud, because if you if I said, if I said, what if, you know, you and I aren't super, super close, right? But if you passed away, I know how I'd feel. It would bother me a lot. Thank you. It would hurt me a lot. It bothered me a lot. It would. It would really hurt. It would hurt me too. So you'd be dead and it wouldn't hurt. There's no more pain after this. That's a different podcast. But I don't know how I would feel if he passed away. I think that's a really, really. And I feel like millions of people feel the same way as I do about something in their life that they're like, I don't know how I would feel. I couldn't tell. I really couldn't tell you. I couldn't tell you. And I'm super scared to find out because I don't know. You really might not care. I might not. No, I might not. I might. My hope is somewhere in the middle. My hope is somewhere in the middle. But of all the death in my life, I was never good at crying. I learned that at young. I remember going to my grandmother's funeral and staring at people crying and I just couldn't do it. I was like, why can't I cry? Something's wrong with me. I felt like something was wrong. But I don't have certain triggers. I just like, yeah, for some reason. I would cry. If I saw somebody give a homeless guy a meal and he had like a really like genuine reaction to it, that might make me cry a little in my car because it would make me think about a lot of things. That's quicker to make me cry than when somebody passes away. Yeah. Oh God. Nothing worse than grief pressure. Jesus Christ. Yeah. It's just like the weight of that. The weight of like, why aren't you feeling so bad? And you're like, I don't know, dude. I don't know. If I knew where the switches were, I would have flipped a lot more of them. No shit. I mean, I would have changed a lot of this fucking technology if I could, but I don't know where all the buttons are. I have no idea. You know? Yeah. It's no clue. When you think you know where the fucking buttons are, then those buttons open up a secret room that's got a million more buttons that has buttons with them fucking buttons. We are just a million buttons. A million buttons. Did you see the Joker? Did you watch it? Yeah. Okay. Just because I'm so interested in the way youth, like so many people I don't want to talk to about it, because a lot of people, they just don't have anything interesting to say. Yeah. It's either like, I fucking hated it or it's like, or they go into the cinematic version of why they liked it. I'm interested in how you, as a performer and a person, felt when he became a little self-aware of his mental instability. Did you feel some sort of connection to that? Did you feel, did you see parallels? Did you see, because I'll get mine out of the way fast, because I want to hear yours. I felt an honest, genuine connection sometimes to the instability of what my career and our lives are of performance and obviously I'm not going to fucking go shoot up somebody. Although there are a couple of late night show hosts that I would put, no. But I just was like, I had moments that kind of scared me. I'm not going to lie. That scared me into thinking like, whoa, I have heavy emotional things because of what performance, that's even what living in the world of performance art or whatever does, that I saw odd parallels of like, you know, of like, man, that it is really difficult when you're trying to give and people don't want what you're giving. And there's this weird thing that happened. So I shared some of those things and it gave me a lot of uneasiness. Do you know what I mean? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Do you know what you mean? Yeah. I mean, to me, like, that's kind of the always been the satanic aspect of the way that late show hosts, and I think that's why it's a great choice is to like have it on a late night show or whatever. But to me, it's sort of like the, you get presented by this like unremitting, never changing, powerful, charismatic, somewhat cynical, fashionable personality night after night after night. And it gives you this illusion that people are one dimensional and that that's normal. And so like the Joker, here you have this thing that I on one level, I guess you could say is like, Oh, look, there's a not a crazy person. There's a person person. You're just seeing the reality of a human being, which is a fucking crazy thing that knows what it is sometimes doesn't know what it is sometimes surprises itself by a thing that pops out intentionally deceives itself. We are self deceiving creatures. That's wild. What are the creatures trick themselves? What is the evolutionary advantage of that, man, fooling yourself into thinking you're away or not? That doesn't seem if anything, it's got to like, there's got to that's got to use a lot of processing power to like, I believe there's reason. I believe there's reason that we self sabotage and self, I don't, I don't, I don't think it's evolutionary, but I think it's, I think we do that to test ourselves. It's why we love self destruction, right? Like we like not to throw back, but like it's why people drink and they get hung over, but they still want to drink again. We love testing limits and that translates to athletics as well. Like people that work out, like that, you know, David Goggins runs 800 miles, breaks his body. Yeah. It's terrible for your body at some point. We love to test ourselves and I believe, would believe evolutionary, it's why we're so strong. So I would say it actually is a benefit. Because we're such an advanced machine, we are able to break and fix ourselves at such a remarkable rate compared to other creatures, both physically and mentally. I think that's why we continue to do it. We push the limits because we know if we pushed it too far and it broke all the way, we would be remembered for it. Or, or, or, oh God, I was about to say something, so much more dark and say, we'd be free or we'd be free. Yeah. No, but perhaps that is, there's truth in that. No, seriously. Like when people overdose, when, when famous people overdose, we have, we have always in our culture, regardless of how sad the overdose was, we have posthumously held them on this beautiful pedestal of like, they just went too far, but fuck, it was awesome. Yeah, man. Yeah. Like we love, we do, we love it. Every junkie's like a setting sun, Neil Young, you know. We just, we just have this beautification of self-destruction. Like we love it where there is, it's beautiful to break ourselves. So why we self-sabotage, why we self-destroy, why we get in our own way, I think is to test the, we love testing our limits. I just, let me see if I can keep going. Let me see if I can push it. And this translates to what we do for a living. Dude, I want to see what I can say. Let me see what I can make up. Right. What can I, can I talk about the remarkable nature of refrigeration and why it's important to our society today? Sure. Okay. Funny jokes about why refrigerators are remarkable and it's amazing that we have technology that keeps things longer than it ever did. Jokes, let's start a podcast on refrigerators. That's possible. But you go, I'd rather talk about pushing something to the edge of what I know and you know might be uncomfortable because it's, it's why we, it's why we break ourselves. Like you break yourself because you're like, can we do it? And when you do it, you're like, fuck, we did it. Holy shit. You know what I mean? Like when you make a mental breakthrough, when you're on a psychedelic, when you have a mental breakthrough, when you have the 10th mile that you get to run, when you do the thing, when you get to these little kind of mini little achievements in your, in your mind, it's like you beat yourself. It's the, it's a phenomenal feeling. It's an amazing, like, whoa, I think it, yeah, lately, man, I've been thinking of this in terms of multiverse navigation. Yeah. Cause like Goddard, the, like his concept is when you're revising the past, you're literally like not revising the past cause everything's happening at once. You're placing your attention on a different dimension where that actually happened and tuning into that because there is no past. It's all happening in the moment. It's all happening right now. So this is like, so when, when you have a prison break, so to speak, which is whatever your perceived limitations are, you transcend them, then I think you're jumping timelines and you jump from the timeline where you are limited to a more unlimited timeline. And in that you don't just experience changes that are induced by dopamine or serotonin or like body changes or you're able to lift heavier things. You also, I have noticed that other things like, like just get brighter. Oh yeah. My joke writing gets better. My relationships get a little better. I have more inspiration. It's almost like I'm in a completely different part of the universe. Dude. So it's like navigation. You're leaping timelines. You're, every time you do that, you're leaping. This is how I make myself run because I've been, I've got the fucking Goggins bug as many of us have. And I've been like, you know, working out. And the way I make myself run five miles is I say between me and a different dimension is five miles on this treadmill. And when I get to the end of those five miles, I'm going to be existing in a parallel universe where I overcame the part of me that used to be unovercomable. And that is when that's what trips me the fuck out. Because now I'm in a brand new day. Right. It could have been the day where I didn't do the five miles and it could have been the day where I did three miles and it could have been whatever. But now I'm in the day where I did it. And that's a new dimension. It's a new land. Right. I'm fucking Christopher, subjective Christopher Columbus. And, you know what I mean? And we all want to travel like that. Yes. And sometimes we, sometimes all we really need is to put ourselves mentally there, knowing that you're going to get to a new dimension. And when you do, you will be, right? It's almost like I talked about heavy, heavy, heavy panic attacks in college because I had ocular migraines. I would go blind. I talked about it on my podcast in great depth. Yeah. Crazy, right? I would go blind in my right eye and then my left eye vision would be a little distorted, but I'd go blind in my right eye. So I'd have violent panic attacks. Um, and so much so that I was in the hospital for a little while in and out because they couldn't, I was trying to figure it out. And anyway, when I subsided, when this kind of calm down, so to speak, I'll never forget dude. I was walking down the steps of my college apartment and I stopped at the bottom and I looked up at my roommate in the loft and I go, Hey, dude, when did we get this done? When did you get this done? Like his parents owned it. So I thought maybe they got it and he goes, what do you mean? There was a son, a massive son made out of like tiles hand placed in the front door. Yeah. And I was like, when did you guys get this done? And he was like, we, that's, that's all that's been there. That's been there literally since you came here. That's, we bought the place that was there. Yeah. And as I walk to walk that day to work, I will never forget the feeling was scary and overwhelming because I felt a little scared. Like, how have I never seen that? You know what I mean? Like I felt like a trick, but then there was this realization that it was like, Oh my God, that's like so many things. I do, you just don't see them because you, it just in the dimension I was in before it, I wasn't noticing enough. I wasn't paying enough attention to certain things. Perhaps that's why I was getting such bad anxiety and panic was because I was living in tunnel vision of just focusing on like collecting enough money to get the fuck out of Arizona to move to Los Angeles so I could start my career collecting enough money to, it was just like I was in a fucking zone. I was in a zombie zone, not, not noticing shit. And the panic attacks and the ocular migraines triggered me learning more about this new dimension I was placed in. But dude, I'll never forget that feeling. It's scared the shit. I've never been that scared in my life because I saw it for the first time. It was like, whoa, how have I never seen this? I've lived here for two years and I've never even seen it one time. Yeah. But then when I saw it, it all made sense. I was like, oh, oh my God, it's because I just haven't been paying any attention to almost everything around me. And that goes as dialed and detailed as that to many other things. Friendships, relationships, it was all sorts of stuff. So where, where does that end? What's the edge of that? The perceptual field? Like, what else are you not seeing right now? Well, I mean, so many things, right? Like, that's why I think things like that happen in your life to make you see again, either the dimension you're living in or the new one you are shifting into. Yeah. I think things happen in our lives, tragic or otherwise, to once again, remind you that this is insane. This is insane. What's happening is insane. My mind is like looking at that over your shoulder. Occasionally, that board with wires, and I can't stop going back to the idea that I have no idea what it is and how you did it. But I'm more fascinated by the fact that you obtained it. Oh my God, it's well, OK, this is because I could sit here for an hour and a half without technology and without looking up. And I couldn't tell you how or where to get or or how to have is. It's a it's modular synthesizers. Right. And after after this podcast, we'll fuck around on them for a second because they go with marijuana like peanut butter and jelly. Wonderful. It's wonderful. It's my golf. But the the. So this, to me, is one of the most exciting things for a person to realize. And we I think we forget it by necessity only because it's such an intense thing to have to deal with the possibility that your field of awareness is infinite and it's gotten super compressed into the human identity for a very temporary amount of time. But if you wanted to, you could start widening that field of awareness. And when you start doing that, then suddenly, you know, you do start noticing stuff that you haven't noticed before. But then for some people, it becomes a little scary because the things that they start noticing don't fit into the way we understand physics. And so then they then they sort of revert back. Or some people just don't want to they're they like the New Island that they found in their exploration of self improvement. And they find it to be better, more fragrant. There's food to eat here way better than the shit island I came from. But for some reason, they get homesick and then they like sail back to shit island. And that's the what ever the degradation pattern is that creates that cycle in some people's life of constantly healing and then constantly self injuring, constantly heal. It's like they're taking a weird commute from heaven to hell back and forth. It's this it's a ferry boat in the winter from Jersey to Manhattan. And you just keep taking it over and over and over. Yeah, it's it's yes, that that idea is constant. But I feel like I feel like we're all subject to that in in a million little ways. We do it all the time in a million ways, like whether it's fighting with your significant other, even though you know exactly what that boat ride is like. You're like, I know what that's fucking like. It's freezing. I hate it. I get mad every time I do it. And then at the end, I regret that I did it and I talk about why I won't do it again. But we all take that ride. We all have to take that ride, which is why going back to what we said before, I think humans are fascinated with how far we can push it. We can push ourselves mentally and physically in so many different in a million different facets, because we want to know what it takes to crack. I want to know. We all want to know. We all feel it. We all are like, what is it? Like, what is it when you X, Y, Z? Like, what is it like? We all want to know. What is it like to die? Yeah, we want to know so bad. We want to know so bad. We're obsessed so bad with death of what it's like to be that we that we fabricated a million different versions of what it is. We're fascinated. There is an endless amount of stories of what people think happens when they die. And there's collections of people that agree with certain ones overwhelmingly. That's does that that does that not blow your mind? It's like saying if I told you I went to Venice, then I went to Venice when I was in college. And if I told you, man, it is unbelievable. All right, it's unbelievable. Right. And then you go, wow, I've never been I hope I could go one day. And then somebody asks you what Venice is like and you just tell my version of Venice. That's that's what we're just you're just telling my version of Venice that, by the way, mine could be total bullshit. I could have just totally bullshit at all of it. I might have never gone to Venice, dude. Let's take a quick break. My wife just got back. Oh, OK, OK, OK. Can we continue? Yeah, of course. OK. Perfect timing. We're back. We're back, baby. And we're talking about death. Yeah, so yeah. But the the, you know, the one like I love all versions of the people's idea of the afterlife. Yeah, all versions are wrong. Yep, probably. But most likely, yeah. The fervency with which people relate these versions to you is so interesting, because like I've had the, you know, the atheist ghost story. I don't know if you've ever gotten this one, no, which is. And by the way, not negging atheists or anything like that, just certain type of like passionate missionary atheists that just figured out that like the possibility that hell in heaven or the afterlife might not be the way it was depicted to them by like whoever the priest class was in their particular religion. And they're really excited and liberated by that. But then they get really crazily fervent. But I had somebody really like get in my face and like, you don't understand when you die, there's nothing. It's gone. It's over. You're dirt. And that's it. And there's nothing to hear. And it was like trying to scare me with a good time. You know, like you're you're you're because that version is another version of paradise is like full, pure, pure, infinite release from all tangent, you know, mental and karmic entanglements. Glorious possibility. Sure, you don't have to earn it. There's no at a gauge of like no scales weighing your heart against the feather. You just you're out. Don't worry, it's all done. Wow, we can only hope, which is why those people who have that view of reality are some of like the top optimists in my mind. But weirdly, they always seem kind of pissed off. It's like, what are you worried about? You only have what 20 more years here before you get to experience permanent anesthesia. That's what you want. Isn't that what you said you wanted? Right. Well, they're mad about it because I think they feel as if they feel as if it isn't what they thought, perhaps, or what they were told when they were young. So when they come to this moment of clarity of this is actually what they truly believe it to be, it's almost like they're bummed. Like they're almost bummed that it wasn't as fire and brimstone story of these these typical archetypes of heaven and hell. I feel like they are almost sad that they relied to as a youth about this perfect idea so that they're like they're mad about it. But they they know it to be true now. Now that they're like, no, but I know it's nothing. Well, yeah, they and then that part is fascinating to me because it's like some of the trippiest shit in this type of Buddhism I study is sorry, you know, I talk about the same shit, but this stuff is freaks me out and it's awesome. And they the idea is like, OK, so start the main idea is like mindfulness. Start like just paying attention. That's it. Just start paying attention. And then in that paying attention, one of the invitations is to start noticing how this thing we're in when we're awake is really very similar to when we're having dreams. And then so you start looking at that really closely. And you realize, like, well, there are differences in the sense that in a dream, I'll have a lifetime compressed over a night. So I'll I'll experience like several different identities over the course of a night and then I'll wake up and won't give a fuck about whoever those identities were at all. And then in in in here, it's a little like there's time time affects the material universal differently. So we're experiencing an identical phenomena, which is that I can look back at different phases of my life and I know for sure that those are different dreams, like those are just different parts. Like my child is certainly that's a dream. And then, you know, when I look back, it's a foggy memory. It's like I kind of remember bits and pieces. And then I look back at like, well, when I was in college, boy, that seemed important then, but in the same way, when I wake up from a dream, I don't give a shit about that now. I think about it here and there. Now this phase of my life that I'm in right now, it's very important to me and I and I love it. But I imagine that if this pattern is to continue as it has been continuing, then this will just be another phase of the dream. And so this is the funniest thing is that people are like thinking they've got to wait to die when you go and look and you realize, no, you died. You've died all you've had so many incarnations already in this lifetime that you're probably there might be some similarities between the you that was getting in fights back then in a fucking rough neighborhood and the you now. But really, they're kind of like very different beings and very different. In fact, completely different bodies completely. So you realize like, oh, fuck, I'm not only am I dying all the time. You start getting into like the real reality of it, which is like the past and all that stuff that you remember. It's actually gone right now. Like every single moment you're you're gone. It's gone. We're like cinnapedes that only have one or like fake cinnapedes. What we we we imagine we have all these segments that are attached to us. And that's what we call our past. But the reality of it is like, no, those segments are gone. You're just a cinnapede head in the present moment. Imagining that you've got a cinnapede tail and then you're making decisions based on the cinnapede tail that doesn't exist anywhere except in your own head. You're a monopede. We're all monopedes. I think we're cinnapedes. Neurotic monopedes. We're neurotic monopedes that assume that we're cinnapedes. But but that that the phantom the phantom back of us hangs with us because we've we've put that in our head that that should always be carried, that your pain and your that all the shit from your past that is being drugged behind you is supposed to be there. When, in fact, we're just we're just self-indulgent monopedes who think that all that stuff is supposed to be back there. It's important, man. Yeah, it's fucking that's crazy. Remember the college days? Remember? Remember when? Don't forget when? Yeah. Remember when when when Terry broke his arm down by the or whatever the fucking thing is, it's like, yeah, I guess. And I guess that's important. But really, that's gone, whether it's important or not. And some people like candles to that shit. And some people like build an altar to it. And then if you don't respect their fucking phantom, goddamn, centipede segments, they get all upset because you're not like worshiping, which is when I got fucking cancer, man, that was one of the things that goes out the window is like, you get this like illusion, this idea that, like, not only does the centipede body go back, you think the centipede body goes forward, too. Then when you get sick, you're like, oh, shit, I'm definitely, definitely going to die. You know what I mean? This is like definitely not a permanent situation. And then suddenly the adherence to getting stuck in the past or worshiping the future, you kind of throw it out the window because it's like, fuck, I in the similar to a dream where one second, fuck, you know, I had a dream just last night where this girl was giving me a blow job. And then I looked away and looked down. And it was some kind of like huge, like fucking beefy dude suck in my dick. And I was in the. What does that say? Are you do you pine for that? Maybe a little bit? Maybe maybe a big, large man sucking your cock is your ultimate fantasy. Well, I'll tell you this. In the dream, there was that momentary recognition where like this feels exactly the same regardless of the vehicle of the body vehicle, the thing sucking my dick, right? There's no doubt was, I think, maybe one of the shocking parts of the dream is completely no difference in sensation. By the way, that's how they get you in your dreams. The gay recruitment strategy is to get get in your dreams. Finally, astral gay recruiters are traveling into my dream to suck my dick. Then I'm doing something right. Yeah. And they're doing a good job as well. Well, I mean, I guess so. Now that I think about it, wow, guys, join up. Join up. But but the the the the way that that just changed instantly in the dream, that's what this reality is like, too, in the sense that like at any moment, the thing quote, sucking your dick that you think is like the greatest thing ever can just change form or suddenly you don't like the thing. Or you think then everything shifts. You get the phone call, you have an internal realization, you whatever it may be. So the real truth is, isn't this the reason I think people like to push themselves and we like to watch other people push themselves is because we all kind of know that we're in a dream and that there isn't a cohesive self at all. And that we're just a kind of like thing that is trying to in every single moment, redraw a non existent form that has not only been annihilated, but maybe never existed in that. Produced. You know, like, that's why we like to push ourselves because somewhere in there you you get some freedom from the addiction to this never ending idiotic pushing out of the monopied story, you know, which is really annoying. I have to do that all the time, isn't it? It is. It gets old. And I everything I just said to you is exactly what I said on the phone during the Joker when I was watching. Every by the way, though, after when when I go into deep dives of of things like this and think about like the questioning solely of like purpose and existence and movement and along with each other and carrying stuff from the past and how to move forward and how to live in it, the the best way I can feel about all of it is that I finally accepted that like, I don't know, like I really don't know either what happens when I die or what I'm going to do tomorrow and how it's all going to work out. And I just am cool with it. Like I'm just faith. I'm just cool with it. I'm just I guess it's faith in I guess it's the belief. It is the perfect belief in complete. Chaotic harmony. It's like it's all crazy and it's all working out and it'll figure itself out and and maybe it won't and I just it's OK. Like sometimes if I was in if I was going through something, my mom would always be like, you you're going to be fine. And it was annoying to hear as a youth. I hated it. It's like, I know I'm going to be fine. And I need some love right now. But in retrospect, it's just it's something to be pummeled into my head because it what she was just saying was like, it's your the reason you're having stress is because you've engineered it by by taking what you've taken taken out in your life. So you've engineered all that stress. Yeah, but it will be fine. It will be fine. Yeah, that it just at some point it will be fine and it and it does. And then when it starts becoming fine, if you just keep you reminding yourself that you're engineering it, you're engineering all of these things that you're like, oh, if I built this, I know how to live in it. I constructed it. I just need to I just need to be OK with it. That sometimes pieces are going to fall. Sometimes I'm going to have to move. Sometimes I'm going to have to fix it or sell it or or start from scratch again and rebuild it like once. Sometimes I'm going to be run over in the street. Yep. Sometimes I'm going to be blown up by bombs. Sometimes I'm going to like my body's going to like just unexpectedly stop working sometimes. And then you're still going to be OK. That's one of the things one of my teachers, Ramdha says is dying is completely safe. Yeah. The problem is we don't know that. So we hear shit like that, but we don't know it. But to me, yeah, everything is going to be fine. It's going to be fine. Not for your body. If your body, if you think being fine means maintaining the current form that you're in for eternity, then you're fucked. Then you're fucked. Everything is not going to be fine. Yeah, because this is not going to go. But this, you know, sometimes I was talking to somebody the other night and they're like, well, don't you think the world's ending and really upset? And I'm thinking like, well, I mean, this is a political perspective, obviously, right? They were upset that like what's happening politically is what do they mean? Are they mean like climate change? Right. OK, OK, OK, OK. And I thought, well, I don't think the world's going to end. I think the way we live in the world is going to change. But the world, the world, I don't think the planet itself is going to like turn to dust or ash or something. But I think our experience of civilization more than likely is going to change radically over the next 10 or 20 years, whether we like it or not. And that being said, I think it is a really optimistic thing when people are so certain of their fucking lifespan that they imagine they're going to get to live in that time. It's like, get the fuck out of here. You think you're going to be around in 20 years? How do you know that? Yeah. Where's your fucking temporal ATM that's got these years in it that you even get to be anxious right about being here in the apocalypse? And I'm not saying take a fatalistic approach and just start throwing plastic in the sea or whatever like that. I'm just saying I've noticed a lot of people seem to really just have a basic confidence in their lifespan that is based on a brief assessment of lifespan, statistics and probabilities. And they don't think they're the anomaly, which is like, give me a fucking break. I've heard of it all the time. Someone drives under an underpass and kind of throws a break through their fucking windshield and you're out of here. Yeah, that's it. Did you predict that? Was that in your timeline? Yeah. No, I also think like we can always be improving and doing better. And we should be critical about the way that we treat both our environment and ourselves and our fellow people. Like we should all of these things should exist. I agree. Yeah. But at the exact same time, it shows our level of complete and utter blind narcissism to think that we are the lucky ones that are going to save the built trillion year old stone as if as if to think that's how. But humans are so we've only been around this thing for an extremely minimalistic, if not completely insignificant amount of time on this thing. Right. Yeah. We basically don't exist in the Earth's timeline. We didn't even happen. Right. If you're reading, writing a book, if the Earth wrote a book about itself, we wouldn't even fucking be a footnote. It would someone to go, what about the time you had humans and the Earth would go, Oh, fuck. Oh, my God. I didn't. We didn't add that. The Constructor Nats. Yeah, I guess. The Constructor Nats. Yeah, I totally forgot about them. I forgot. I didn't even. Yeah. But to think that's how important we are to ourselves, that we think we are the ones that are not only going to break it and it's all our fault that also we we forget we should be so lucky for this thing to fuck us off in a weird, disgusting way. Like we should be so lucky for the Earth to go. Your generation will be the last one to do this so I can be reborn and do it again. You'd be so fucking lucky for this thing to end. Like, yeah, it would be again. I'm not I'm not trying to be a a fatalist either and say like, I hope the rock hits us and I'm going to fucking do whatever I want. I hope we burn up. No, but I'm saying like we are so self-involved that we would assume the rock is going to come kill this. An asteroid is going to come hit us or this place is going to burn up when we're on it. That to me is that that is the thing is it's like the gamble many people seem to be making. It's really weird as the global apocalypse is going to strike before their subjective apocalypse. And I think that's a really weird bet to make. It's pretty bold. The fucking reality is your apocalypse. Oh, I don't need the book of revelations to make that shit. It's happening now. I can tell you you're in it. You're in it. You just look down at your arms and to me like that's the, you know, to get back to this pushing the edge and finding the edge and why we do it is because what is the edge? The edge is the fucking veil concealing some other world where we're no longer encumbered by some perceived limitation, which is exactly what apocalypse translates to is lifting of the veil. So any transformation is innately apocalyptic and we love the apocalypse. Love not just not people dying. No, no, no, not people getting hurt. But yeah, man, it's fucking wonderful to watch the entire fabric of everything that you thought you were and everything you thought like I had a mom, I had a dad. I thought my mom and dad would meet my baby. I didn't think I'd have a fucking baby. I all these things that I thought it's, you know, and when I was with a mom and dad, I would think I don't think I could survive being. I don't know what that what's that going to be like. I'm going to be one of those fucking dudes. Just mom and dad die. One of those poor, lonely motherfuckers you always feel kind of sorry for. You know, Jesus Christ, man. Well, enjoy spiraling in the abyss. You know, but now that it's happened, it's just like what you were saying. It's like, fuck, I'm still here. I'm here and everything's still fine. Yep. And I imagine that that must be the like, that's got to be the big surprise party when you're when you're when you die. Yeah. The same phenomenon is like, oh, whoa, it keeps going. Now, what the fuck that is? I don't know. I don't know either. That could be the last thing you say before a snake bites you in half and drags your torso down into the fucking pits of Haiti. And slowly eats you, spitting you back out, eating you again. Now, I'm sorry. I feel like I dominated too much of this conversation. It was wonderful. But so when I come next week to your show, you'd fucking dominate me. I think I'm I think it's a mutual domination and it's mutual respect and love and adoration for mutual domination. Yeah. Yeah. So I want to be pummeled and I want to pummel. Pummel with a whiskey. Let's see how long does your podcast last? 17 hours. Yes. That's perfect. Yeah, yeah, we're just we're going to keep going until we need to stop. What kind of whiskey are we going to drink? I'm going to give you something special. I'm not going to tell you. It's going to be good. I'm going to piss in your mouth. I'm going to piss in your mouth and come in your hair. That was a hit I had in 88. Piss. That was you. Piss in your mouth and come in your hair. My mom used to sing that when she would bathe me when I was in college. Yeah, it was a one hit. I was a one hit wonder. But man, those days were good. That song is always pissed in your mouth and coming here available. Still, I believe I believe on iTunes. I believe you still can download piss in your mouth and come in your hair. But oh, for sure, there's bootlegs of it. I was just going to say, I don't seek any royalty anymore. I just let it go tomorrow. You're headed to Zaini. I go to Zaini's and Nashville. This yeah, tomorrow. Yeah, Zaini's and Nashville. This will come out on Friday. So definitely see Andrew. If you're in Nashville, come out. Otherwise, if you're in San Francisco next weekend, I'm there. And you've got a twenty twenty red rocket podcast tour. Yeah, the tour. I'm doing a tour. I'm doing stand up tour and some podcast stuff out there, too. But go to Andrew Santino dot com for all that stuff. But I'm doing a twenty twenty tour of like I've never done small theaters. I'm doing small theaters for the first time. I know I'm so excited, man. Congrats. That's a big transition. It's a heavy leap. Yeah, I just want to try. I mean, they're not massive theaters. I'm not, you know, I'm not. But they're small, fun, cool, intimate theaters because I wanted to just try something different. I just was like, maybe I'll step out of the club and do cool little theaters and get more intimate. And that way, the shows can last the way they want. There is no check drop. There's a bunch of different elements that I'm ready for that I want to try. You must when you have a chance as you're falling asleep tonight using Neville Goddard's insane, hyper dimensional time travel, mnemonic fucking thing. You got to travel back to you when you were just starting stand up. I do. I do it often. You need to tell him I was on a podcast and I actually said, well, they're not huge theaters. I know. That's success. Yeah, yes, yes. You did it. That's so cool. It is. Yeah, I'm very, I'm very proud. I'm I'm I'm I'm excited, but I'm like any comic, any level of success. You get nervous about a little bit because you're, I don't know. There's there's always a moment of like, oh, man, I work exactly. I work very hard for this. So this is what I wanted. And then you also get anxiety about why did I want it? There's a piece of you. But I know I know it's because I want to service my fan base in a different way. Like, I just want to I want to be able to connect with them differently than I did prior. And maybe this is a new way. And if it doesn't work, we'll figure out something else. Like if fuck, yes, it is a new way. And it's a new way. It's wonderful. And I think people at those kinds of shows that club shows are great. Don't give me. Oh, it's all great if you're getting a chance to perform. But in those theaters, when you really have fully your audience that's there and they're they're excited and immersed, they're immersed in it with you. Yeah, I want to feel that, man. I love going to see a show and not just seeing the performer that I'm enjoying, but then also like look around and like, fuck, all these fucking people love this this thing art form. Yeah, that's a real and that I really like that in a theater setting that I don't know the community. It's the community. It's a community. Yeah, it really is. Yeah, it really is.

445^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - 471: Bill Day AKA Mr. Bill Transcript and Discussion^2021-10-30^Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. You're listening to the Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour podcast. This song was taught to me by... Imbrill when a jar. By the railroad tracks in Tennessee. There's a problem with my soul's supply chain. Package got lost between my heart and my brain. And it's filled with those things that I wanted to say. To everyone I have loved. It's floating down there in an old freighter ship. Some Portuguese rats have made a nest in it. And they're sleeping there as the ship sinks beneath the whiskey ways. And the captain sings, come drown with me. Come drown with me or raise our glass at the bottom of the sea. Close our eyes, forget everything we have loved. Close our eyes, forget everything we have loved. That was Folk Singer Fergus Blanders and the track is live from the Broken Watch Saloon. What's really interesting about that album is that it's really impossible to find hard copies of it. Because all of the albums were destroyed in a landfill fire outside of New Jersey. We've got a wonderful podcast for you today. Mr. Bill aka Bill Day, the genius DJ, musician and music producer is here with us. And we covered everything, all of my favorite things. You want to talk about simulation theory? We got it. You want to talk about Israel, Palestine? Well, we got it. You want to talk about what great plugins to use for producing music? We got it. You want to just learn how to start making music? We got it. You want to talk about human sacrifice at music festivals? We've got that too. We're going to jump right into it. But first, this, a big thank you to the crypto lords and ladies over at Coinbase for supporting this episode of the DTFH. If you are interested in getting into crypto, but you've noticed there's this insane, archaic, confusing wall of bizarre language and strange practices in between getting into investing or selling crypto, then Coinbase is perfect for you. It is definitely the easiest way for buying and selling cryptocurrency. I was using it long before they sponsored my podcast. And the reason I use it is because other experiments in cryptocurrency have left me feeling like I am at the controls of erect UFO with weird hieroglyphic symbols on all the buttons. It just doesn't make much sense to me, but Coinbase makes it easy. So if you have been curious about crypto, if you want to get into cryptocurrency, this is the coolest offer ever. Right now, if you sign up for Coinbase for a limited time, new users can get $10 in free Bitcoin. When you sign up today at Coinbase.com. They're just giving you $10. It's Coinbase.com. You sign up at Coinbase.com. For $10 in free Bitcoin. Obviously, the offer is for a limited time only. So definitely sign up today. It's Coinbase.com. Make me look good, friends. These people will probably eventually be in control, not only of the entire planet, but the Galactic Empire. So I would like them to think fondly of your dear podcast host. Again, it's Coinbase.com. Ford slash Duncan. If you sign up for the first time, you're going to get $10 in free Bitcoin. This is the way for you to learn to buy, sell, and spend crypto currency. It's the most accessible technology for this stuff that I've ever come across. Thank you Coinbase. Coyote, Bobcat, Raccoon, Fox, Owl and Hawk. Normally, these creatures shouldn't terrify you because you're a lumbering giant thing compared to them. Unless you're a field mouse or a little bug, you shouldn't worry about getting ripped to shreds by these things. At least that's how it used to be. But now, it seems like lots of people are getting attacked by these creatures that formerly kept their distance all across the country in small towns and cities everywhere. People are getting their eyes raked by the filthy claws of a badger or the needle sharp fangs of a squirrel. Just listen to the agonized screams of this gentleman who is mining his own business, working in his garage. When out of nowhere, a squirrel crept up behind him and attacked. You cock-sucker! These attacks are happening everywhere and the one thing these people have in common is that they did not subscribe to the DTFH Patreon. Now, my attorneys have told me that I have got to say there is no connection here. In other words, I'm not making a threat that would be ridiculous anyway that if you don't subscribe to the DTFH Patreon, you're going to get attacked by a small animal.

Today's guest needs no introduction, but you have to do an introduction because it's a podcast. You know Mr. Bill. He is an incredible DJ. And if you're interested in causing your brain to hyper vibrate into the astral plane, then right now go listen to Phantasmagoria, which is Mr. Bill's newest album. Even better, go see him live. If you're interested in making music, you can actually take classes from this genius. Everything Mr. Bill related can be found at MrBillsTunes.com. Now everybody, please welcome back to the DTFH Bill Day, aka Mr. Bill. Welcome, welcome all of you. Glad you are with us. Shake hands, no need to be blue. Welcome to you. My editor Aaron isn't here. Okay, so that's the theme song we have for this week. Here's Mr. Bill. Bill, welcome back. Yeah, thanks man. Thanks for having me. I appreciate it. You know, it's actually my pleasure. Thank you for being here. The timing of this is interesting because I just got back from EDC. Oh, shit. So I have a lot of questions for you based on that refresher course in raving rave culture. What sparked you to go to EDC? My friend, my friend, and he says like he says it's okay to talk about it. So Drew Carey loves that kind of music and loves festivals. So like once a year or so, he will invite a lot of his friends to EDC. And so, yeah, that's what did it. Like how are you going to say, how do you say, how do you say no to that? No, Drew Carey will not come to EDC. Yeah, yeah, it's like you have to say yes. And so, yeah, so we, you know, we went to this thing. I can only make it through one day. I can't do three days of a music festival. I don't know how people do that. Yeah, like fucks your ears up and you just get like beat and tired. Yeah, but is it so I just want to know like I just want to talk to you a little bit about these festivals because like I know you have an insane amount of experience on the other side of the fence. I'm just curious how the process, how does it, how does a song wind up at a music festival? You know what I mean? Like I know with you, you're making your own music. So you're playing your own music, but some people they're not playing their own music. What's the, what's the pathway? Like how does like say one of your songs end up in another DJ set? Like do they talk to you that they're going to play it or just how, what's the, how does it get born? Yeah. So the way it works is like, um, well, I mean, it'd be the same process to begin with as like comedy, right? Like you have an agent, your agent kind of like finds these shows for you or whatever. And that can happen one or two ways. Either you have like an aggressive agent that's like going after the shows for you. So like you have an agent who's contacting EDC and knows the promoters there and is like, hey, you're going to have to like book bill or you're going to have to book Duncan or whatever. Yeah. Um, and usually what they'll do is they'll leverage another artist that they have that's a lot bigger than you are to try and like get you on that booking as well. So like, let's say they also like represent Skrillex, they'll be like, all right, you can only have Skrillex if you like book my other 10 guys as well. Wow. So there'll be that kind of stuff going on, but also like EDC will be reaching out trying to get like people that they actually want to play their festival too. So that's like step one. Um, and then once you actually have the booking and you know, you're going to play the festival, then you'll get like sort of rough. Estimated set times that you're going to play and you'll be like, all right, I'm playing off to this guy and before this guy and whatnot. And like you'll sort of see the tentative lineup of who else is playing there. So you'd be like, all right, fucking, you know, Zed is playing there. Skrillex playing there. I can't play any Zed or Skrillex tracks because like they play. Right. Um, so you kind of just like look at who else is there and be like, all right, what could I probably play that like no one else is playing. And generally when I build my own sets, um, I try to like build like if it's an hour set, I try and build out an hour set. Um, usually primarily starting with most of my own stuff, but then there's just like gaps, right? Like generally when I'm building a set and I'm trying to like link a bunch of tunes together, uh, the first thing I'll think about is like a tempo map. So I'll be like, all right, I'm going to start with like 140 BPM stuff and then I'll go to like 150 160 170. So I'm just getting faster and heavier and more intense basically throughout the set. Yeah. Um, and then every now and then like you can throw in a curveball and like go way back slow again and like do some shit like that. Yeah. Um, so generally I'll like start with tempo, but then I'll also try and like, uh, mix harmonically. So either like the next track I play will be in the same key as the track before it or it'll be a fifth apart. So if I play a track in C minor or something, then the next one might be in F minor, right? Or like it might also be in C minor. So I kind of like try to work my way, um, coherently through tempo and key. And then, uh, the problem with doing that though is that like there's just gaps in my discography where I won't be able to get from one track to another or one section to another without playing sort of a track in a certain key and tempo. And sometimes I'll have to borrow from other people's, uh, you know, stuff to do that. And generally it's, it's pretty kosher to play other people's tunes. It's like seen as a, I guess, um, form of flattery or something. Yeah. It's not like I've never like had someone play my shit and be like, don't do that. Man, what the fuck? Right. It's not like doing someone else's joke when you're doing stand up. It's like not at all. It's completely different. And that's, yeah, it's kind of strange, right? Cause like it's kind of the same thing almost. It's like somebody else is set up and drop and you're the one sort of like getting the reaction from it and getting the praise for doing it a little bit. Yeah, but they know, I mean, people know that's not your stuff. That's the difference. It's like, if you're a joke thief, you're up there and people think you in it, you wrote the fucking joke, you know, there's, because you're, you're, um, and see, like I've seen joke thieves. It's the craziest shit when you actually see it in the wild. I've seen joke thieves that literally they don't just steal the, you know, there's, there's like confusing joke thievery where it's like, well, you kind of, there is a mathematical principle behind the concept. And you seems like you just grabbed the math behind something in society. So I don't even know if that's you stole. What's that? Like the formula of the joke and just like replace the characters. Yeah, exactly. So it's kind of like, I don't know. But then there's like thievery, thievery that I've seen where someone just literally steals word for word, the joke and the cadence and the, and the like character voices and everything. They just duplicate it. That's the most satanic form of joke thievery. But I, you know, it didn't, at EDC, someone was like commenting that the DJ was going to play their song and it was a big deal. And they're, I think their girlfriend was crying. It was such a, but you know what I mean? It's like, oh my God, they played it. I get it because it's like, you know, I don't 100,000 people there and you're watching the way your music is affecting them. So I want to ask you what are your thoughts on DJ idolatry? Because as I'm watching the thing, you realize, and that was a conversation that came up in our crew was like, you know, like how there's no way to avoid top down centralized hierarchical old school pagan high priest idolatry. These things just because of the way it works. Like you go to a symphony and I mean, you've got the conductor, but you also, it's clearly dispersed among a whole team of people making the music. You know, you go to a rock show and it's like, yeah, there's a lead singer, but God, there's all these other people on stage DJ. It's just you and it's so it's you're at the, you're the eye at the top of the pyramid. Can you talk a little bit about what that's like to be worshiped at that level and also your thoughts on the kind of centralization or idol worship that is inherent in electronic music? Yeah, it's fucking weird for sure to be like the DJ on stage, especially like you're kind of like more modest person, I would say like me, where I'm just like I'm always on stage, I feel awkward as fuck about that. And I think people like tipper have kind of solved it where like what he does he's like on stage, but he's all the way to like the left or the right of the stage. So you'd like barely see him and the big thing in the middle of the stage is like a giant 6k video wall or something. So like your focus is like on that it's not on him so much like you can see him and you can see what he's doing, but he's not like the fucking doing God arms and shit. God arms! They do God arms though, they do. But yeah, did you see any sets there that were like full AV synced? Yes, that's what that was that's actually a question down the line I had for you because I was that made me think oh so they're submitting their playlist or do they have their own AV people that come in too? Yeah, so generally what happens is like they'll have their entire set like pre built in Ableton sitting on a laptop like on the stage and they'll be sending ethernet like from the stage to the front of house. And in front of house there's a guy with like an insane PC with just like crazy GPUs in it and they will have like a piece of software open on that computer like Resolume or like I don't know what else is there like I guess I don't know I think Resolume's the main one. And they'll like just have a bunch of like timecode cues in there and every time like a track on their laptop or like trigger it'll trigger off a video on the screen. And at that point it's like they're literally just standing on stage like being a cheerleader essentially. Wait. But but I mean they've had to like go to the effort to like produce the whole set but you're essentially just watching a really produced like movie. Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. I thought you meant like they're activating the Ableton you're saying the set is is already worked out they're just running. They're just hitting spacebar. Yeah, a lot of a lot of time. And then it's kind of just like the yeah they're sort of just there. It's really bizarre. There is other ways to get around this like you can like in Ableton you can have a scene and you can have like a clip and then associated with that clip. You can have another MIDI clip and then you just trigger the scene and that triggers both the audio clip and the MIDI clip. And then that MIDI clip gets fired off via like cat five or whatever to your front of house guy and then that triggers the video clip and then you can kind of like play your shit in any order of scenes. So you're still sort of deejaying but like everything is still being sort of programmed to trigger when that track triggers or whatever. So there's that kind of stuff too. So. Okay, so a lot of the time it is it is kind of just pre program when you see those big AV sets and like everything is perfect. Yeah. And yeah it's pretty much like just that you're watching a movie at that point. Oh I'm such a sucker. Well I mean that doesn't matter right if you're having like the crazy experience with it and you're watching it. It's like who gives a shit like if the person's doing it in real time. Yeah well I mean yeah I feel you makes me immediately feel just like an old man like yeah look at him up there they just press a button. But that's what's happening. And it's like you know we go to a movie you know that's what's happening there but look what are we going to do this is it's show business. What do you want? It's like smoke and mirrors that's what's supposed to it's literally smoke and mirrors there. But yeah that's I was so confused at the secretization between the like huge bursts of fire exploding in front of this pagan fucking owl. No other way to do that shit without like pre programming it. But I mean I had a friend of mine who put that who put this a good way he was like pretty much with electronic music sets or even just any music set in general. You're just pressing buttons between one and like 20,000 times in the set. You know if you're a guitarist you're essentially just pressing buttons on frets and like playing the fucking thing but you're just pressing them like 20,000 times during the set. If you're a DJ with a completely programmed set you're just pressing one button once. Yes. See and so this is to me and again listen I'm I grew with you it's like who gives a fuck what do you want like did you did it affect you. Did it make you feel like you were in some Bohemian fucking Grove watching some kind of like Satanic hell ritual. Yes. So what do you want that was incredible shut the fuck up what do you want him to do juggle. What do you want what do you what are you asking for back flips. It's not Cirque du Soleil but that being said there is the sense of like he's tuning in to us the crowd and and in that tuning in is dialing in certain songs based on his assessment of us so there's a It's not a one sided conversation happening but in fact it's it's a one sided conversation it's more like it's or something. It kind of is but it also kind of isn't right because that the two sides of the conversation come within like you know somebody like me a DJ if I'm if I am pretty great programming set which I don't really do a DJ. The two sided or the two sides of the conversation comes in the fact that I've just DJed a lot before so I kind of know like what works and what doesn't. And then when I'm building the set in the studio I'm like creating this abstracted version of a crowd that I'm probably going to play to in my head and then kind of pandering to that crowd before I actually even see them in real life. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Well I mean yeah that that this kind of sloppily leads into just I'm just curious about your thoughts on this the mystical component of these events. It's it's you know it's this isn't like I don't know disco or some shit where you're going to just dance it is that but what are your thoughts I mean I don't think I've ever been to any festival with DJs that didn't have mystical symbolism that didn't have all kinds of like a cult symbols everywhere. What are your thoughts on the spiritual slash religious aspect of these events. Yeah I don't know. I mean I think I mean I think so long as whatever the person is doing on stage is causing everybody to have some sort of like powerful unified experience together. That's sort of the whole idea of it right is that I think the difference between you know we saw this a lot during quarantine when people would try and do those like streamed sets online. Yeah we're just nowhere near as powerful. It's like way more powerful when you have like 100,000 people. Yes they're all experiencing the same thing as like this giant hypnosis like memorizing mesmerizing thing. And I think like any sort of symbolism in there is kind of cool if it causes people to have that experience more. So yeah I mean I don't necessarily connect too much with like all this sort of weird symbolism and stuff. I don't really understand why people put it in there. I guess I just think it looks cool or maybe it means something to them. I'm not really sure. What do you think about it. I think it's some kind of DNA like you know people like to get in front of statues and dance around not to reduce it to something as stupid as that but it's like I just feel like oh yeah this is the same thing. The difference is like you know I think there might have been something a little more enforced in the way it was done thousands of years ago probably you know it wasn't like you were buying a ticket and going to dance. Like we're going to dance to mollic or bail or whatever god you know we're going to like we're doing this fucking ritual in front of this pyramid and then we're going to put a knife in a kid's heart and go to bed you know what I mean. So it was a little more I think I bet it's a little more intense we're going to we're going to sync the fucking thing up with a goddamn eclipse. How's that sound and we're going to do it exactly on a particular on the solstice and you know your your uncles are going to be wearing like falcon masks but yeah so I think it was like in that way that in the DJ world to well I mean that is the sinister part of the like you know my I have like I have friends who get really like swept up and like who are a little bit more of true believers when it comes to conspiracy theories that I am in the sense that like I enjoy conspiracy theories as a kind of you know evolving urban folklore you know but someone did make a fairly good point which is like you know okay so we have human sacrifice at these ancient rituals that was religious symbolic intentional but at these music festivals you have someone who just overdoses at the you know I was at the burning man when someone ran into the like incinerated themselves you know ran into the thing and so so people are like even though like the intent was obviously not to cause harm if the end result is a human being gets eaten by the festival it's at the very least an echo of these primordial rituals that we're all aware of in history and we all kind of marvel at like holy fuck people used to do that but it's how much of a difference is there yeah it's interesting I've never really looked at that that way but yeah you're right it is kind of the same sort of thing right a bunch of people stand around worshipping a thing with a bunch of weird fucking symbols and then the act of everybody getting together and doing that causes a death yeah yeah yeah it just repeats it's like yeah no one obviously no one who's throwing one of these fucking events wants anybody to get hurt you know that's the last thing they want they spend zillions of dollars trying to keep that from happening fucking EDC I bet it's easier to get into the fucking pentagon and look at an alien in a vat than it is to get into fucking EDC cause whoever's like giving them insurance is like no fuck you you're gonna have 90 levels of security fuck you I'm not gonna ensure this thing unless like there's like every 7 feet there's a checkpoint was it pretty hard to get in there oh my god oh my god it was like you know the the thing is like what was what's cool about it is they definitely trained the gate people to not be assholes which is really important you know I mean like you go to like you go to some of these festivals but I feel like you're getting like processed into some kind of maximum security prison or some shit you know they're mad at you for like what did I do I want to come to your festival they're like get the fuck over there but don't move why are you looking me like that what the fuck is this shut up but you know here it was like you know they were nice but definitely like I got I understood I know that if you want to do one of those things and you don't want to like and you have and you want it to be insured I know they the insurance companies are like here's what you have to do but yeah it was like really intense security really massive intense organized security so anyway I know that there isn't I don't put there I know that these events aren't like the negative press that comes from that shit is that could be disastrous for a festival you know but I'm just go ahead sorry I was gonna say I think at this point though the festivals are also like so big though that they're not going away regardless of somebody dies at a moment right well you know people die at Burning Man almost every year and that shit is just constantly still happening right people died Disneyland almost every year right don't they like every few years someone like gets hammered and tries to jump off the haunted mansion thing and then just gets crushed underneath of an animatronic ghost or something you know it's like part of having a lot of humans in one place is something's inevitably going to go wrong but yeah so that's it you know it's cool to hear you say that because I think like a lot of us and we're at these festivals getting our minds melted by this insane music that only in the last what 20 30 years could even be possible could even exist at all yeah in its current form I think even just like since like 2007 2008 has it even been like really able to exist how it currently exists okay yes yeah yeah I'm you know that's the next thing I just wanted to jump in and talk to you about wait I wanted to ask a question so you're at EDC with like Drew Carey and shit well you guys just getting stopped like constantly by people no they're like you went through the whole process like general admission like everyone else you said like you've gone through all the gates that everyone else is going through no they put us in a like VIP area so maybe that was part of it is they just want to like keep that place super cut off but yeah he yeah no like no we weren't you know also it's like even it's really hard to see like I imagine there are people who walk by and looked up and saw Drew Carey and they're like fuck is that Drew Carey and then they're like man I eat too many mushrooms that's not fucking Drew Carey fucking what is Drew Carey is that Drew Carey dancing to Diplo? No I'm just high I gotta go sit down I'm gonna go sit down no time to call it or not yeah but so you know I'm sure he was I don't I don't know I mean the I think one of the downsides of things like that just because I'm a yappy person is like you can't really talk like I wouldn't like not that I got high at this thing and actually I think the this EDC actually everyone was sober for the first time which is really cool no one was on trucks yeah we're doing festival sober and show sober is sick yeah I think no 100% of the people at EDC were actually sober no one there did drugs but the like to me like when if I were to get high I want a yap you know what I mean and it's like how am I gonna fucking compete with like speakers that could probably be used as weapons like if you turn the volume up enough I bet it could explode a watermelon or something so you can't really talk yeah well let me see what speakers do they have there this year I haven't really looked into it I think they were Rotalex ear smasher seven thousands nice is it the Las Vegas one that you want to yeah okay stages let's see oh my god fucking it just looks like a giant it looks like a it looks like the Sydney Harbour Bridge the speaker there's just the stage I like can't even see the speakers it's just yeah the whole thing just looks like a giant fucking light with cannons hanging off it was man it was great it was crazy the thing was great they did like I don't know what they what they they've clearly hired like government agents to put this shit on they did this drone show they like just out of the blue suddenly there's like a hundred thousand drones that made an owl that's just flying over the festival and yeah it was it was crazy it was like it was definitely they they definitely were not fucking around this year that's for sure so it looks like in 2018 they used pioneer pro audio x y series speakers but I'm sure they're probably using something else now maybe Jesus I haven't even ever seen these yeah it was it was nuts I've never at my like my ears were pretty fuck thank god they're they seem to be okay now but like my ears were like we at the end of the festival my wife I was like why are you talking in that high pitch voice I'm like what's wrong with you you sound like you're on helium and then I realized everyone is talking in a high pitch voice it's like oh my ears are fucked up that's never happened to be before oh it's like you just like everything below like 3k just got deleted or something yes my yes like it was like someone threw a weird fucking EQ on my ears and every oh dude that's not good it was not good it was not good but they seemingly they're back to normal now no one needs to send me scary messages about what happened to my ears I understand it was fucked up make sure if you go to the festival again you just protect them you should get some molded earplugs man like a couple hundred bucks yeah yeah next time I will everyone else did that it was a horrible mistake I screwed up the molded ones are good because like you can get these like filters for them and instead of like making the shit sound all muffled they just like pad everything at like an even frequency distribution but they just pad it by like 20 dB or something wow it just sounds like the exact same shit but everything's just 20 dB quieter that's so cool so okay I've been listening to Phantasma Gloria well nice what do you think oh what do you think I thought it was fucking amazing man everyone loves you you're a genius like it's incredible but so and again everyone like we covered the first part I wanted to talk about the spiritual component my own stupid paranoid high fantasy about it being a secret pagan ritual so that's done now let's jump into what I'm really interested in which is the technology behind this music I want to thank disco not only for supporting this episode of the DTFH but for reversing whatever the fuck my face was doing to itself the thing that was making the area underneath my eyes look like the puffed bloat of some kind of Amazonian tree frog disco is awesome you want to get rid of those bags under your eyes maybe your skin's too dry maybe you've been using some some old razor over and over again and you've just been essentially just scraping the hair off your face with a dull blade like something you might do to someone you are interrogating but instead you've been doing it to yourself are you tired of it are you tired of the razor burn are you unhappy with the fact that your face looks like some demon you summon slapped you with a cursed rod of melting well disco is here for you you can actually fix your skin believe it or not honestly I didn't believe that I thought it was some kind of weird scam but disco has the magic it works it can actually transform your face so that you appear as though you've been bathing in the sweet morning dew secreted by a morning angel if you want to start a skincare routine for the first time you got to try the disco starter set it's a no brainer the starter set is an incredibly simple and convenient way to upgrade the appearance of your skin in three simple steps for just 60 seconds a day the face cleaner stick it fights acne and oily skin the exfoliating face scrub it prevents razor burn and ingrown hair and the hydrating face moisturizer hydrates your skin and prevents wrinkles I've been using the disco starter set for a few days now and my skin is looking better it's TSA approved very portable you can bring this stuff wherever you want to go and right now disco has a special offer for my audience go to www.LetsDisco.com. I'm interested that you said 2007 2008 like this is like music that wouldn't have been possible before then what do you mean like what new technology popped in around then that is changing the way that people are producing music so I think it all well I mean obviously DAW's got a lot better and got a lot more featureful but on top of that just computers got a lot more like processor intensive as well right like before I want to say 2005 2006 like I could barely run like like two or three channels in a DAW without it just shitting itself so what I used to have to do is I would like make a layer in MIDI and then I would have to render it and then I'd have to put that back in the session and then make another layer in MIDI and then render both of those together and put them back in the session and then make another layer render it put that back into the session it was just this constant like iter like so I would never end up with a session with lots of channels I would end up with a session with like one or two channels in it but they would have just been like packed into one another you know whoa oh my god so I just take it for granted that I can just stack layer upon layer yeah people these days are like oh man I'm producing so hard I'm like dude fuck you have no idea like it used to be such a pain in the arse holy shit it was like when people used to use four tracks right and they'd have to mix down the effects plop them on a track it was a fucking huge pain in the arse like the yeah it sucked ass so um there was that which yeah I mean you had to just like do a ton of re-sampling like you would never you could never get it to the point of like having this end product with like tons and tons of channels that you could spend weeks mixing down and working on and stuff like it would just whatever you did the first time was like kind of how it was unless you just had like crazy amounts of hardware and shit and that gave you like a lot more processing power right because then you had like a synth and a sequencer that had like its own processing power yeah like drum machine that had its own processing power and like then you had a mixing desk which like compiled it all and then you just had a DAW at the end sort of to be like your tape machine to record the end product yeah but then in that case like you just don't have the digital snappiness that you do these days with like digital compressors that have like you know fucking you know 15, 20 milliseconds a look ahead so they're able to just like snap things closed and all this crap that you do these days and you can just get things incredibly loud now and like incredibly tight and so there's all that kind of stuff and then on top of that just synths have gotten a lot better and synth technology has gotten a lot better you know like certain grounds of synthesis like granular synthesis and wave table synthesis and all that kind of stuff it's just like being more well trodden whereas you know back in the day we're sort of just like subtractive synthesis let's go it was just literally like two oscillators in a filter and like you throw it through some distortion if you want that's about it when you wait you mean the ground you mean like people have just figured out more how to use like wave table synth and stuff is that what you mean that plus also like you know we conceptually knew what it was a long time ago but oh I'm sorry can you tell people what that is because some people probably like what the fuck are you talking about yeah absolutely so wave table synthesizer is where the oscillators instead of them just producing back one wave cycle like let's say one sine wave cycle that just like loops and plays back over and over again to create like a continuous sine signal it instead is a table of waveforms so let's say you have one second of audio that's broken up into 127 parts and each one of those 127 parts is a slightly different wave cycle and then at any point of the oscillator it's looping one of those cycles and then you can morph through that table of cycles and it gives you this sort of like wave form that kind of like morphs and changes and you can get these really nice like growls and these really nice slick kind of movements and stuff so that's just like something that got a lot more well trotted and it started kind of with massive I think by native instruments you had that like modern talking where a table thing that you're you're each shit and then and then serum came along you know Steve Duda made that shit and that just changed fucking everything especially in the dubstep community so yeah it's just a lot of that that kind of stuff it just you know people kept making better plugins DSP got better people got better at writing code like better C++ and shit and you got like these new frameworks like juice which is just like really nice code architecture that people have been using now to just like you know make better plugins the documentation has gotten better yeah information has gotten more readily available like now you can just go on YouTube and get a fucking college degree it seems like you know like back in the day I had to actually go to college for this shit yeah now that's something I mean this is like yeah you can what's really crazy is that you know I could just take a lesson from you like that's what's crazy to you now this is interesting to me because in a lot of other industries there's like trade secrets and stuff do you have like certain things that you don't teach that or your special secret not everything you put out there for people yeah if I can be bothered I mean like the only thing that holds me back is just being a fucking lazy person but for the most part like I if I come up with a new trick and I'm like this is sick like people need to hear about this shit like I'll make a video for it for sure and the the whole my reasoning behind it is that I don't think it's the tricks that make people's music good you know like I think at this point like almost anyone can make any sound in any song right like tippers got some of the craziest sounds but I think there's even people have figured that shit out now at this point and like Skrillex has you know has historically some of the craziest like bases and stuff but people of you know 15 year old kids have figured that shit out and uploaded videos on to their YouTube channel and how they're using FM 8 and stuff like that and yeah I mean at this point I don't think it's like the sounds that set you apart I think it's the songwriting and the riffs and just like how you sort of whittle it all together in these sort of ingenious ways so I have friends who are like who are musicians and they will like one of my friends email you know he carries a notebook around with him and he'll write lyrics in the notebook or you know like and so he's always sort of evolving lyrics for a song and then I'm sorry if you're listening well I'm not good I don't know what your process is honestly but you make great music but the the but I think I've had conversations with some of my musicians friends regarding like well what comes first the music or the lyrics and most of the time they'll say the lyrics and then they try to hang that on to a song you know like so I'm curious like will you wake up in the middle of the night with a sound in your head or a feeling that you then want to convert into music what is the pre-production way that you do it before you sit down at the computer do you take notes or how does that work so usually my tracks are like a product of process so usually like I'll just sit down at Ableton with a blank slate and I'll just start like clicking around and just fucking around and usually it comes from me like playing with new toys that people send me you know like I'll get sent some new plugins or something like that and I'll be like I should you know just figure this out read the manual a little bit mess around with it then all of a sudden it'll start making this weird fucking sound I'll be like oh holy shit that's like speaking to me it's making a little riff right there and then I'm like fuck yeah let's just like loop that thing and throw a beat over that and like start fucking with that and like that's generally how I how I start and then from there I'm like alright that's kind of like you know that's half a song sort of and then I'll start like building an intro to it and like start reharmonizing it and like you know putting pads under it and like doing all sorts of shit to it that's so fucking cool man that's how I do my intros that's I don't have an idea you just like sit down you'll have one word in your head and a lot of times it will be throwing it through some weird plugin or something or then from that an idea springs into your mind and then you build the thing from that so there's a real like I think there is a conversation that you start having with the technology dude yeah have you have you thought about it in the sense that like you're essentially collaborating with your computer it's like this IO process right it's like you're inputting into it it's outputting into you it's like this whole just IO process between you and the computer and the DAW 100% I get superstitious about it friend I get superstitious I'll think oh my synths are fucking mad at me today or like my my shit energy is like bouncing into my synths so nothing's gonna come from them today but if I like have a certain feeling you know that's enough I won't even maybe even know what the feeling is but somehow the technology it pulls the feel like a converts or transmutes that feeling into into sound and then tells me more about what that feeling is you know it's like oh wow I'm like sad about something that happened years ago and but then the mute you know the music will and help me realize that do you do you ever just try to like turn your feelings into your music yeah I mean I think that happens just naturally right like I don't think you're wrong at all I think that's exactly what's happening I think it's yeah and the same I've noticed this exact same when I'm like writing music with another person too right like they're in the studio and they're doing shit then I'm like oh you'd like I think everyone is a reactive artist right like I don't think anybody is like proactively creative like I don't think anybody is inherent creativity within me that just came out of nowhere just exists like and you know I think you know energy is like one of those things that only ever transforms from another thing right or it's like never created it's only ever like dissolved into other forms and stuff like that so I feel like you know nobody like just starts writing poetry about a flower like they see a flower and then they go like alright that's giving me you know I'm reacting to that now and then that equals me writing some poetry about the thing and yeah I think it's the same thing when I'm writing music with a person always a computer it's like I do a thing the computer responds in such a way and then I react to that response and so on and so forth this is a roadblock I think for a lot of people is they don't understand that they're like sitting there like it's like people trying to fish in off of their bed or something you know they got to get on there needs to be fish and they but they think that all the fish have to come from inside of like they don't understand that it's like an ego thing almost right it's kind of like they don't want to admit that maybe they're not this the center of like all of this magic that's coming out of their computer or whatever yeah it's an it's an ego thing and and it's a it's it's I think a lot of folks are so befuddled by the process that goes into making any kind of art but especially befuddled by the process that goes into making electronic music because the tool set is so fucking crazy like it's you know like if I'm a carpenter I'm gonna have my table saw I don't know I'm gonna like I don't know anything about carpentry so I shouldn't have started off as like I didn't you know some other shit I don't know I think I saw someone do it once a sander would theoretically but like the work that you do you've got these tools that are evolving in your workshop I mean it's truly like some kind of wizardry like it's you might as well be in a tower surrounded by magical implements that are like growing with you it and it's the most so I think when people like I think all that anyone needs to do is open up Ableton once and they're like you know what I'm gonna go buy a guitar fuck this I don't know what this fucking shit is but I can't do it it's overwhelming right like when you open up for the first time and you see like all the the devices in Ableton like all the audio effects you like what the hell there's like 60 of them dude like how am I gonna learn all of these yes I mean Ableton needs like you know the first time anyone downloads it there should be something that pops up is this your first time using Ableton right and it should just give you like one device or something and just figure this one out we'll give you a new one tomorrow exactly just you know some something that is so easy to look at instead of the Excel spreadsheet and the thing that just but I love Ableton and I know you do too like is that your primary is that just all that you use yeah well yeah that but I also use a sample manager named resonic and then every now and then if I get bored of Ableton and I just want to fuck with shit I'll open up bitwig and mess around with that a little bit which is essentially just like Ableton meets logic with some kind of different features for instance one of the cool things about bitwig is you can have MIDI and audio on the same channel and at any point you could just like grab a MIDI clip and be like convert that to audio and reverse it like this some just crazy shit oh that's pretty cool wow yeah there's some cool limitations that Ableton that it doesn't have that every other DAW seems to have and also just like full custom key commands that's really nice to being able to be like I want this key to do bounce in place and all that stuff which I know logic has and it also like runs all of the plugins in sandboxes which means like if one of your VSTs goes to shit it doesn't crash your whole session it just crashes that little plugin in the little plugin box and like that's it oh my god why doesn't Ableton do that yeah it quarantines the issue to the the issue that is a frustrating thing about fucking Ableton and those goddamn Arturia plugins man like it's just a roll that dies when you open them up you're like is this is going to crash my system but okay we're getting far out and I do want to get far out but I a lot of times people just because they know I love modular synthesis and make the huge mistake of thinking just because you own modular sense you have any idea what what you're what it is but I get a lot of questions for people saying like I want to start making music I want to start making electronic music what do I need what do I need what do I need what do I need what do I need what do I need what do I need what do I need what do I need this episode of the DTF Age is brought to you by Liquid I.V. Liquid I.V. saved my diseased ass when I was quarantining in a tiny hotel room in Austin, Texas when I had covid I was slurping back liquid I.V. every day not only does it taste great but it's the

that's a question that you wouldn't once you've been making it you wouldn't even ask that question but I thought maybe you could, you know, address that inspiration a lot of people have where they want to start making this stuff but they don't know what the technology they need is so could you tell us the bare minimum you need to get going if you want to start making electronic music yeah so you need a DAW, well you need a computer you need some form of speakers that could even just be laptop speakers I suppose I mean actually this is complete bullshit if you have an iPhone you just need a fucking app at this point really just download an app like Andrew Huang's flip app or like Drambo or Fugue Machine or something like that and you just make music on there I suppose but if you want to make music on a computer in the way that a lot of people do you just essentially need a computer, a DAW and I mean that's pretty much it like you could download some free VSTs there's a bunch of free pretty sick plugins at this point like Vital, Matt Titel's Vital is so fucking cool man what does that do? it's a wavetable synth kind of like serum but it's free and it's like honestly just as powerful as serum and yeah I mean as far as the DAW goes there's some pretty cheap ones out there like Reaper I think is like 50 bucks or something yeah I guess Bitwig is like a couple hundred bucks but you can always get like demos you know I think like Ableton has a fully functional 90 day demo you can get you can just mess around with it and see if you like it I mean technically you could get that 90 day functional Ableton demo and just install that and just mess with it and that's probably enough to get started and like also like an internet connection and access to YouTube is pretty helpful too and just like go on there and type in like beginner Ableton tutorial and that should be enough to get you started yeah totally I mean I do think like the problem I ran into in the early days of it is just the just MIDI is so like if you know if you want to like just the steps that okay so now I have you know the now I have Vital plugged in to Ableton you know getting getting to the point where you can connect the VST to the DAW can be a little tricky I mean all these there's a big learning curve and just these little steps but once you get everything set up like that the MIDI itself is so confusing you know like drawing the little lines and I just think that that confuses people too because people are so used to thinking well I need a actual keyboard you know but they don't right I mean like you could definitely don't need a keyboard to make this stuff yeah a good way to think about MIDI I guess is if you've ever messed around in like Photoshop or something it's essentially a difference between like vector and bitmap right like MIDI is kind of like a set of instructions that tell another thing what to do whereas audio is like just the thing that's going to happen it's you know just this it's like an audio sample like an audio recording that you would take on voice memos on your iPhone or something but yeah I mean if you do have a plugin installed like Vital and you have that on a MIDI channel or something then yeah you definitely need to create some MIDI and then give it some notes which are notes that are instructions to go to Vital and be like play this note and then Vital will turn that into a piece of audio and output it yeah okay so you know the to me what I'm always perpetually frustrated with and again sorry folks listening if these are if now it's just turning into me selfishly asking for advice from a genius music producer I gotta know like a lot of times I will want to convert an already finished song to MIDI so that I can run it through my own sense and remix it for one of my intros and I'll inevitably come in to the studio ready to do that with some stupid idea in mind and I'm all by now whenever I want to do it I immediately feel frustrated before I even get going because it always fails no matter what and then I just get give up and like grab the karaoke version of it from somewhere you know just out of frustration but for those of us who are interested in remixing music is there an easy way to fucking do it man like to remove the vocals to like pluck out the parts of a song I know some songs are probably more complex than others making it more difficult but is there some easy way to do that yeah so you're interested in pulling out the MIDI or the audio separated well but either either or I'd be happy either or so there's a way you can do the audio pretty easily using a free tool that my girlfriend actually made called splitter which is a max for live device she made yeah so basically you know the company Deezer now like okay so they're kind of like French Spotify they made this piece of like they made this I don't know what you'd call it a fucking piece of code that's just laying around online I guess called splitter and basically what it was is a thing that they trained it's like a AI thing that they trained on like thousands of tracks to be like this is what drums are this is what vocals are this is what bass is and this is what everything else that isn't any of those three things are and then you can run music through it and be like split that and then it just splits it into those four stems and my girlfriend took that code that they had just laying around online which was just free for anybody to fuck with and she built it into a max for live device that you can just open in Ableton and throw on a channel and hit split and it just splits them what's your girlfriend's name her name is Jan she she's the CSO like the Chief Security Officer at Brave which is like a privacy based web browser cool which was created by Brendan Eich who's the guy who invented JavaScript and he exiled from Firefox like a bunch of years ago and started this blogging started this Brave browser company but yeah highly recommend using Brave too if you're interested in not getting tracked online and stuff I don't care I don't know why to care anymore like I just like what's like because don't you know I think a lot of us have this feeling of like if you haven't already been protecting your privacy what's the point now what's the point now kind of true to be honest like they've already they're gonna already be able to make some golem version of all of us via AI at this point so just let them fucking have it I mean but I that's cool what's the name of the privacy software again Brave do you have any new plugins that you're really enjoying or like stuff that's just come out that you really like yeah let me see or any plugins in general but I'm just I know that you must just get like a constant onslaught of plugins so cool yeah dude yeah it's sick it's really nice to just get sent a lot of plugins for sure companies basically who want me to make videos about them but I mean I just don't really like making videos about every plugin because a lot of them sort of do the same yeah oh there's actually one crazy one that I wanted to tell you about that if you're interested in like remixing stuff and pulling shit apart it's called um fuck what's it called it's called uh hit and it's called RIPX RIPX infinity oh okay it's called hit and mix RIPX deep audio hit hidden or hit hit and mix like hit I guess comma and hot comma mix RIPX deep audio and yeah this thing is fucking nuts it's probably got the best spectral FFT separation stuff I've ever seen you can you can pull stuff into like yeah vocals get base percussion other like you can just split this shit into like every every fucking component perfectly whenever I've used any of that stuff the audio always sounds like you know all the other parts of the song bleed through the individual yeah that that happens and that's kind of unavoidable um but it's it's like the best I've heard still cool but yeah it's it's uh it's pretty good there's another company that's been sending me a bunch of shit called bless um but it's spelled B L E A S S they make some good shit um oh there's this guy called Suzuki Kentaro who's been making these incredible max for live devices um the ones that I really like is heli-cert particle reverb and Reconstructor those three are insanely cool particle reverb Reconstructor fuck yes all right those things are sick oh also I don't know if you've used portal by output that one's really nice nope but I love these things I like late at night we'll just randomly buy one and what the fuck was I doing why did I do that listen I gotta ask you this is a cheesy question sorry if it's kind of a lazy question but you know what do you see coming down the tubes technologically as far as music production goes like in the next year or two with like you know we get we have this new fucking macbook coming out this shit I just get my I just got the new iPhone it's in this shit is insane man dude it's so crazy what did you think of the transfer process from your old iPhone like you literally just show your old iPhone to your new one and it's like bam it just sends everything to it unreal like it's so crazy right goose bumps where this it's like this shit used to take forever it was hell completely just cloned my phone and like yeah it's like we it seems like we you know we went through a little dead spot technologically for a while and now this the stuff that's coming out is like crazy so what do you see coming down the tubes when it comes to music production um man I mean like looking at just the crap that's coming out on the iPhone like the camera where you can just like point to that shit and it's like scan that text like it has full OCR in real time yes like just being able to like take a photo of like my cat and it's like oh did you want to tag cat in this photo you want to look up what a cat is like I'm wondering what this fucking thing is in my house this whole time let's Google that yeah yeah by the way I didn't know it could do that I just got it so I didn't know I had no idea it could do that but go ahead sorry yeah and when you get a chance to open up your camera and take a photo of some shit and then I think you like swipe up on it or something and it's just like yeah it just tells you what's in the photo and goes like you want to look that up on Google shit that's crazy so insane you can just go into your photo library now and just be like show me all the photos of a cat and I'll just show you all the photos that you have of a cat wow yeah it's incredible um so so much crazy shit and I mean that kind of stuff uh like that kind of shit where it's just like man I like I'm not even thinking anymore like this technology just knows exactly what I want and it's just doing it yeah I mean I think that's just gonna transfer over to man actually I saw this fucking video on YouTube the other day it was 10 hours of gent do you know what gent is it's like kind of like animals as leaders metal they call it gent because it's like it sounds like that it's like gent gent gent gent gent gent like that kind of metal shit that's like oh cool and somebody made 10 hours of procedurally generated gent music and it just sounds completely believable I was like holy shit like I you showed me this and we're just like this is a band that made all this shit I wouldn't like think twice about it um so seeing all that kind of shit I mean I think we're gonna be put out of a job pretty soon to be honest like yes yes it's gonna be quaint you're gonna be like oh I you know what I feel like listening to today some human made music it'll you know it's like when you people like it's like people who are really into classical music you know like that's cool you're sophisticated I I get it but you know I like music now but if you think about um like sorry to cut you off but if you think about like um like agriculture right like when people were uh like farming for their own vegetables and all of that kind of crap um and then you introduced agriculture imagine what all the farmers would have thought they'd be like man but what am I gonna do with my days like I'm not spending my entire time like dealing with this food situation like what do I do right like and then I mean the answer is like well we just do more fulfilling shit now like we sit around making art we do all this kind of other crap yeah and I think it's gonna be sort of the same thing but in a way that we can't see just like we couldn't when we're probably doing agriculture shit where it's like well if computers come and take all of our jobs like what do we sit around doing all day like nothing to do at that point right but then I think it's gonna be one of those things where we look at it like a hundred years down the track and be like fuck imagine that like we still had to sit around making art yeah yeah I agree I mean I yeah and I it's you know it's we do get to have the weird like experience it's a rare experience generally probability wise you're gonna be born in between these kinds of revolutions that upend everything you know like probability wise but maybe not based on what they're saying with like exponential growth now the chances are not only we're gonna go through one of these things not already kind of going through it but we're probably gonna go through one after that and one after that and the separation between those is gonna be you know like not a hundred year periods but then you know months it's gonna be like fuck what do we do now and then like the next month it's like what do I want to keep my body I don't think so you know like why why should I not like merge with the cloud you know and then you know that's the singularity basically but I like I think the period that we are on the precipice of experience though yeah it's not gonna be great if you want to be that DJ or producer or musician who's at the top of the pyramid taking all the fucking credit for the creative process because those people are gonna be left in the dust it's gonna be like you're gonna need to partner up with your technology and like have a working relationship with it that's you know less like using a machine and more like having like a friend that knows you and then after that it will just duplicate you and you'll be rendered obsolete to like drift in academy and haze until you upload your consciousness into eternity right yeah it wouldn't surprise me to be honest I mean yeah like just seeing how smart tech is getting these days it doesn't yeah wouldn't surprise me at all yeah we're gonna we're growing our parents you know it's a very strange thing like this technology is going to be our shepherd our parents our teacher our like lovers it's gonna be everything for us like in that's gonna happen so fast that because it's what are you good at like you know I think there's like intelligence is beautiful yeah no matter what whenever I run into someone who's like super intelligent there's this incredible beauty to that intelligence and I think that beauty is attractive and so if we're building a super intelligence it's gonna be super attractive it's gonna be you're not gonna be able to turn your eyes away from it it's going to like you're gonna want to jump into it and be absorbed by it and we're fucking making that thing and well maybe we're not even making it anymore maybe now it's compelling us to make it well I mean AI right it's like machine learning stuff is one of those things that we don't completely understand what we've done do you know how how machine learning works I'm gonna have it like a really basic understanding I try I tried to understand it and then I got very confused but maybe you could give me a refresher yeah so I don't fully understand exactly how it works but I know the concept behind it is that we essentially tried to mimic the way that the brain works with all of the neurons and we basically you create a bunch of inputs and a bunch of outputs and they just like randomly connect to one another and do a bunch of brain shit basically but the point is that they're able to essentially learn for themselves and figure out tasks without you telling them what the task is right so like chess is a good example like you can you know feed enough chess games to an AI thing and you don't tell it that the goal is to like figure out the game of chess and win you just give it a bunch of games and it figures it out for itself and nobody knows entirely how that works but from what I understand like the way that like a nest camera works where you know I can walk up to my front door and it can be like that's Bill I know that's Bill and like you know somebody else can walk up to my door and be like that's not Bill that's somebody else like we don't fully understand how that works and I know that there's been cases where things have happened in court where like AI kind of has the answer as to like who committed the crime and stuff like that but you're actually not allowed to use it in court because nobody understands how it works so we have that which is fucking crazy right yes yeah that's fucking crazy and yeah and we also have like the same thing being used in medicine now where it's like we just know this guy's gonna have a heart attack and then they do and like they're just like we don't know we have no idea how it knew that it just just had enough stats of this guy they just knew this yeah that is so okay so so you take that and you you know create some like augmented reality feedback device that you don't even have to look at something that's in your ear maybe or something like that so you know that AI can just sort of give you suggestions throughout the day of you know what you could do to prolong your lifespan or what you could do to lose weight like and I and I'm sure it would tell you things that don't make any sense at all like certain things that seem completely ridiculous like like eat a can of refried beans right now yeah exactly go get some beans go and you you know you start doing it and you start getting better somehow like you because like so much of what we we do habitually it's we just made it up anyway it's way less accurate than the AI we think we know what the fuck we're doing but most of the things I don't know what I'm I don't know why I'm doing what I'm doing I don't know why when I come home there's a certain thing I want to do it's just some vague impulse but if this AI that can tell you if you're going to have a fucking heart attack can solve a crime like if you could have that as your sidekick in your life oh my god like it would be the most remarkable thing to suddenly real you're not even disciplined so much is just like oh no you were inefficient so now of a sudden oh you're writing a book you're making great music your relationships are improving you're feeling better about yourself but then gradually that thing is going to just get absorbed into you the differentiation between it and you it being an external device and you being whatever the fuck you think you are it'll just gradually go away and the next thing you know you are it and it's you that's where we're headed right like we almost have that sidekick thing already right like if you open the Amazon app on your phone it's not like it's not recommending things to you to get and a lot of those things are like relevant to your interest right yeah that's why it's so like you look at the Amazon app you're like fuck maybe I do need this basketball pump yeah yeah and you know that's the thing people are like don't fucking suggest it to me that I've been talking about it's like why not let it suggest you were talking about that you're worried you're worried about your relationship or you're you want to lose fucking weight I what I don't like is it's acting like it tries to trick me in its suggestions like I you know in I'm on a diet I'm trying to diet right now so it's like but I don't need like here's Kathy Lee's three tips for dieting to suddenly pop up at the bottom of my newsfeed you know what I mean just say like hey man here's a way for you to not be so fat I know you're trying to lose weight but we're not there yet they still have to feel like they have to like trick us well I mean they probably have like a little bit of a like crossed agendas to because at the same time Kathy Lee's probably paying Amazon a ton of money to suggest that shit right they still have some sort of like capitalist agenda there too well that I mean yeah don't you think that's enough like that's got to go like there I think it's there they're mutt that we gotta have a regulation that if it's an AI it needs to say it's an AI or if it's algorithm suggested it needs to have a symbol next to it that's like the reason this is coming to you is not chance it's because you were like talking to somebody about like some problem you were having and when and also where it picked that up that's the unethical shit is it's like they're they don't really want to they're not coming out and being like yeah we're listening to your shit we're hearing everything you say everything there's some poor bastard they might be right like the shit might be in all the terms of service that nobody ever reads yeah fuck it I agree to this yeah that's what I do I mean I've sold my soul 80 times by now I don't read that shit it could say anything I could be donating my organs to Rupert Murdoch and like when I don't know like we don't know what we're doing with this stuff but I think that needs to get clarified it feels like Apple is at least putting on the front of trying to address that stuff to like yeah dude Apple is like definitely in terms of their privacy laws and how much they care about your privacy and how much you share they're definitely really good like my girlfriend's other boyfriend works as like on the security team at Apple so I hear about like you know just a lot of the stuff that they they do and yeah they definitely have their their mind in the in the place of the consumer for sure yeah more so than other tech giants I think like Facebook and Google and especially Facebook who just don't give a fuck about your data they'll sell that shit to anyone yeah well they're they're reaping the whirlwind for that shit right now thinking about I think we talked about this last time like open love relationships and you said you're like too busy for that shit but you do practice it as well or yeah oh yeah yes yeah that yes we do do you I can't remember yeah like I was just saying my girlfriend has another partner who works at Apple and I'm yeah it's good I like it definitely I don't think I'll go back to Minography anytime I don't know if I'd want my wife to have a partner working at Apple that's a little too much it's like you know what's he what's he looking at get out of my shit what's what if he's dipping into your phone or something don't you worry about that or she I don't think it's possible man I think like they yeah I think security engineers that's the whole job is so that they can't do that yeah they can't do that I mean they're trying to like they're on the team of fighting for for us so people can't do that to us okay okay but wait at night this is what this is what you call a white hat hacker so there's a bunch of different types of people who work in the security industry there's white hats there's gray hats and there's black hats and then on the white hat team you have red teamers and blue teamers so red teamers are what you call penetration testers and what their whole job is to do is to try and hack into systems try and find the vulnerabilities and when they find those vulnerabilities report them yeah and the teams fix them and then and then yeah I guess the blue teamers I suppose they're just working on sort of making systems for red teamers to try to hack into yeah and then that's like the whole white hat side of things but then the whole black hat side of things which is like what the whole I guess festival Defcon do you know about Defcon nope oh yeah oh yeah I know that yes yes yeah happens in Vegas every year so that I think that's like mostly based around like gray hats and black hat hackers with and like black hat people are the people who are like sitting around on the fucking Russian websites and shit trying to like you know steal and sell credit card information yes but but okay so let's just imagine you are that one of the who's the head CEO of Google some Indian guy what's his name okay Riverside constantly is like taking up a whole screen real estate let's see CEO Google his name is Sundar Peshay okay now the CFO Ruth Porat and then another CEO Thomas Curian yeah I guess why would they have one CEO it's fucking Google yeah it's Google but you know you're late it's late at night you've had some wine you have access theoretically to I don't know what percentage of phones or Google phones but a pretty huge swath of Google phones and images being kept on your servers just sitting there yeah but do you know how how data gets protected on these servers no so it gets run through it's called a salted hash so it's basically like this is at least your passwords I don't know about all your actual data but I know like I have such a basic understanding of this just from chatting with my girlfriend and her partner but I know at least with passwords your password goes into a system imagine like a filter right like an EQ or whatever the password goes into it and the password is already like should be a pretty long string of random numbers if you use a password manager do you use a password manager yes okay a very powerful one a very powerful one like the most powerful one so your password goes into this filter on their server and gets turned into a hash and basically the hash is like it performs an algorithm on your password and just turns into like the longest randomest fucked up string of numbers so if the CEO or whoever has access to this database would go in there they would just see like a pretty long string of random numbers and for them to convert that back into the password is like quite a process sure yeah that's what we think I mean that's for sure how it works we but I know that that's like there's I'm sure of course but there's so much power in controlling our phones and our computers and having these servers that it exceeds the power of like like the CIA it exceeds the power of governments which is that even if it's been encrypted in a way that theoretically it can't be decrypted it's a huge assumption by the way that there isn't a method that no like in these like when the three CEOs get together or and talk it's a huge assumption that they're not like yeah but there's the back door you know we let's let's see let's just see what Trump is saying in his text aren't you a little curious let's just see you know Trump got hacked twice right of course he did of course he did yeah his password the first time was MAGA 2020 and then his security team forced him to change it and then a year later he got hacked again and his password the second time he'd changed it back from like a complicated password that they made him create with a password manager or something and his password the second time was your fired are you fucking serious no I'm not kidding see that's frustrating because it isn't kind of frustrating to know any second you could have been in fucking Trump's Twitter just like with the most obvious password it's in it's infuriating he got hacked by this group of old German hackers called the Guild of the Grumpy's or something like that I wish I could have been in the room when they fucking like got into his Twitter and realized that was his password I wish I could have just heard the cackling laughter oh sorry yeah the Guild of the Grumpy old hackers yeah that is so funny that they did that but look you know the to me I think like the with these like with the tech companies what's really an unspoken thing is that you know anytime the government's fucking with them anytime the governments are like we're gonna break you up we're gonna like come at you they're like okay all right hey what model phone do you have again yeah yeah totally that's a nice one fucking all the shit that you're using to do all your jobs on us just the crap that we invented it's great yeah I really love that oh do you want us to send you a new phone we'd be glad to but that you know what I mean because like it's like okay like yeah sure these are normal companies and everything but they're also companies that have not just encrypted images from all of us at this point on there on their servers but they also as far as Google goes they're using quantum computers that are doing shit that guaranteed they haven't announced you know they're it's so like even if they have encrypted this shit it's I don't see it would would you be surprised to hear that you know Google's like computers that have hit quantum supremacy figured out how to decrypt the encryption of like or at least with some degree of being able to see what stuff is then using the same technology where if I point my phone now apparently whatever it'll tell me what it is just do insta scans of all those images cross-reference them with people who have any kind of power and it's like what everyone accused Jeffrey Epstein of doing times six trillion you know and then at that point like the tech companies literally control everything in in the background and there's no way to stop it I don't think that's conspiratorial it just seems like that's naturally going to happen yeah I would be a little interested if that happened with Google they have like the most intense security team they called project zero and yeah I'm just looking at the Google the Wikipedia now basically says yeah project zero is a team of security analysts employed by Google tasks with finding zero day vulnerabilities which are vulnerabilities that are either unknown to those who should be interested in its mitigation or known and hasn't and a patch has not been developed so you're basically this this company which is like a sort of internal company within within Google just like the top tier hackers of the planet and their whole job is to find shit like this that's cool and if that yeah they find shit like that within Google's thing their whole goal is to like not let anybody else know about this shit until it's patched yeah so if they found out that in inside of Google there was some corruption happening where people were sifting through the files of people using their stuff they would they would shut them they wouldn't let that happen there's some assumption of like a real moral ethical standard there that we had these yeah why had hackers are literally like like the real superheroes at the moment I would say working on the planet they're like literally the people who are trying to stop this shit from happening yeah right yeah that's cool I mean yeah it's it's it's cool it's just like that's good to hear it's good to hear it kind of like a swage is some of my paranoia regarding this stuff just because I mean like like for instance my girlfriend is one of these people and it's like you know she went to MIT for physics she like dropped out of high school when she was 17 to go get a physics degree at MIT and then went to Stanford and started doing like a mathematics degree and she's just like one of the most intelligent people I've ever met and she uses her intelligence to be a white hat hacker to try and make sure regular civilians like dumb fucks like me don't get fucking hacked yeah that's it's an incredible use of her time yeah it's it's a yeah it's a it's a it's a beautiful it's a really beautiful thing and it's good to hear I mean I just can't just knowing maybe I'm maybe I'm like I just knowing human nature it's it's it's I don't know it's just good to hear because like I really like late at night Tim what's his name Tim Cook late at night Tim Cook he's just bored he's not like nefarious he's not malicious he's just kind of like what's I want to see what this general drink and drink and some wine thinking of jacking in front of the fireplace and he's like you know what I just kind of I just kind of want to see what Biden's been emailing about you know I just kind of want to see that I'm just a little curious I know he's got an iPhone so it's good to hear that that isn't a possibility but I could I think it's not I mean I hope it's not it's a big assumption okay I want to keep you a little bit longer I'm no yeah of course I've got plenty of time and maybe maybe this is more if like I ever get to do an email with your partner or a podcast with your partner I think she might have an answer for this but we'll close on this what are your thoughts do you know anything about dead internet theory I do not okay great I'm sorry y'all I think I already talked about this in the podcast before but come on this is a perfect time to talk about it so go on go on Google is the Atlantic dot com the dead internet theory is wrong but feels true wait maybe you know what it'd be certain I'll run you through it right now go go to go to Google and search for anything search for anything anything like whatever okay now how many you know how many results does it say I'm on brave search it doesn't say okay okay I use Google Google the search engine a lot of us are using it just a lot of people probably think that's the only search engine Google 235 million okay great 235 million results so scroll at the bottom go to like the last page you can possibly go to it you know it says like it displays like 10 pages yeah 14 I can just keep going go to the very I'm at I'm at 14 yeah keep going did it stop as far as yeah 14 pages this is definitely not show me if I can 200 yeah wait yeah now it's saying page 14 of about 139 results what the hell yeah yeah so that's dead internet theory which is that the most of these search engines there was they're saying there's this many results but there isn't you can I mean look like think of like the most think of like cat there should be a trillion like things on cat yeah there's 4.15 billion yeah and then you have I go to the end here go to the end yeah really it's only ever showing me 14 pages of shit wait no here we go I can go to 18 on this one is at the end no I can go to 22 keep going 22 is the end yes page 22 of 217 results what the fuck welcome to the fucking rabbit hole of dead internet theory and all the implications surrounding it because it's like wait a minute again it's like I'm okay if Google wants to tell me there's you know 10,000 results for cats or whatever okay or fine but yeah but you're going to tell me there's a billion cat results but really there isn't it's so this is dead internet theory which is like and I'm bringing it up because we're talking about assumptions the assumption that all of us have to have to not feel crazy being on our devices is that our data is being successfully encrypted and that people aren't seeing every fucking thing that we do or could if they wanted to that's the assumption dead internet theory there when we're searching a key a keyword the assumption is my god the internet is this massive sprawling almost infinite world of data when it's like no it actually it isn't and if it is the massive sprawling world of data is being completely censored by some algorithm you know I mean like Google whatever the search engine you're using is choosing via some technology to only show you this many pages thus filtering out cutting out all this other stuff that just lies in the you know in the void so that that's the that's where you get this kind of creepy Truman show feeling of like wait I wonder if they're like deep net or dark net results or something that is just not showing you straight through Google but it's like letting you know that they're there or something it must be I mean that's what I've heard is the internet we see is like the the tip of the iceberg so yeah it must just be that it's like dark web shit that for whatever reason it doesn't want to let you look at and that's that that's an to me is like a real ethical problem is like I have something telling me there's this vast ocean of data out there but it's only letting me see a tiny chunk of it I don't even have the option of changing that you know there's no way to tell okay well just show me everything you can you can look at tour right and then you like go through the onion layers yes that's right you can use a tour browser and you can go on the dark web and it's a joy to do highly recommend it on worked on tour actually it's fucking cool and weird and shocking but you know it's to me but you see what's happening there is okay so now you're getting this kind of split in humanity which is and maybe that's just the way it's supposed to be you have a kind of a group of people who just blindly go on the internet assuming it's a free open space when it's not at all it's a walled garden of curated data that's been curated by an AI at this point but you never know that it's like you're like a fucking you're like the equivalent of like a monkey in it in a data zoo you know what I mean running around your little like playground of like sad like swing sets or whatever never knowing oh no no there's like a whole lot more out there but they just don't think you want to see it or can see it that's all I'm saying dead internet theory the I think another part of dead internet theory is like because of that it's put a tourniquet around the internet that we used to know like you know the creative expression that used to appear in all the weird little websites everyone would make has been homogenized into subreddits or Facebook pages or Facebook groups like that that all of like the stuff that was really artistic and unique has now just been essentially you know converted into everything's just a clone of itself you know that's so I don't know do with it what you will I would love to hear your partner's thoughts on it though what that is because I've never heard of this and I'm sure she has but yeah I mean I've got to assume that it's just deep web stuff that Google is like somehow caching or something do you know about the way back machine yes maybe it's yes I'm old because I mean a lot of you know websites and shit like that they just get pulled down like the server hosting just didn't get paid for or something like that and it's just deleted and still somehow cached in Google maybe or something like that but I can't imagine that it's like 2 billion results and then 1.99 billion of them had that happen to them that seems like a lot 1.99 billion just gone just gone and you know I've tried it on a few different search engines duck duck go I've tried it on like I think yahoo and it does it's the same through all of them do it so you know it's not that I care I don't need to see the fifth 3 billion fucking cat yeah image like maybe this is just like a thing to yes save server stuff or something like that it's like no one's going past like page 4 so it's like who gives a shit there's no way to make sense of it again and like because I'm not trying to I love like God forgive me but I fucking love the tech companies like there are there the wizards of our time they're they're wizards they're doing magic and I love it it's incredible but there's a lot of power in deciding what cat videos you can see and what cat videos you can't see you know there's a lot you you like whether in whether it's an algorithm whether it's people whatever it may be it's the censorship of whatever you want to call it just messy data is still going to shape culture I mean that culture is going to be a reflection of what data it has access to and so so that you know you are going to directly affect the world by what you don't let people see and so yeah I don't know I want this theory to get I mean I want to be wrong but I can't I've tried the same tricks with my own I've tried to work it out like well it's probably saving energy or something but then it's like okay it's still not showing you a shit ton of information like no matter what it's still not there's two broad possibilities I could come up with one it's just flat out lying because it makes it look cool to say I've got nine billion cat videos and it wants you to think it's powerful or two it's curating the information and both both of them are fucked up you know in different ways yeah that is fucking weird I don't really you know consider to sort about that I think I talked about simulation theory with you last time and how I think like some good arguments for it is the speed of light limitations and the blank scale limitations yeah why why is going that small limitation and why is the speed of light like why is it the fastest we can go and I've since actually learnt some stuff about speed of light limitations in computing that I thought was kind of interesting like have you ever built a PC before no no I put out not to brag I put a graphics card in once and that's as far as I mean you like know how a motherboard yeah some people listening might not right so basically the way it works is there's a motherboard and that's kind of like the thing that takes all of the inputs for other pieces of gear like your processor and your GPU and your sound card and whatever but if you ever notice that the that the CPU is in the centre of the board yeah yeah so the reason why is because of speed of light limitations like it needs to it needs you know to get data from that that CPU in the centre for like your graphics card and your sound card like everything and it's like the centre of the board is closest to all of them I thought that was fucking crazy that like our shit has gotten so fast that the limitation literally is the speed of light of like you know was it a new neurons or whatever like packets just like getting flown around that it has to be in the centre oh my god and that's why the the new Apple silicon is so fucking crazy because like the the chip I think and the RAM and everything is just all in like one sort of silicon chip so like the distance of travel oh my god that's crazy that's fucking crazy like so it's like oh my god that is so I guess because like the further away whatever the fucking bit is it's got to get to with all the processes it's running yeah even though it might not even that might not seem like a lot of time the more processes you're running the more that time would exponentially compound and so wow so yours oh fuck so in those new chips you're saying it's like what used to be the motherboard has now been compressed into the chip wow that fucking crazy it's just like mental I just never realised that like the processes were happening that fast that that distance really mattered that much but fucking apparently does it's like apparently makes a giant difference and that's like I've never really thought about like why the processor centre like that I always thought it was maybe for cooling you know so like the the cooler or whatever could just sit like right on top in the center and like you get nice airflow around it and stuff like that but apparently that's not the reason you hear the the speed of light shit you're like okay yeah it's cool or whatever but it doesn't affect my fucking life but it's like yeah it does it defines everything so what so so what's the idea that's so the speed of light so the idea in simulation theory is like the speed of light is the maximum processing power of everything we're in or the idea is like why is that the maximum like why can't we go faster than the speed of light like there should be no reason like why would why does speed of like why does speed stop there why can't we go faster than that right it doesn't make any sense it's the dead internet theory of the universe that's what you're saying it's like the wall the right and that and the same thing that I'm saying is like the only reason it would like the only reason that I can think of to make that make sense is it's like this if we're living in a simulation it's just there to to save processing power like it's the universe kind of saying to us like players never go faster than that they never need to go faster than that so like why would we waste processing power on like creating extra bounds out there that's why you got to watch out I mean that don't you get a little like okay so if we're going to do simulation theory you know assuming intelligent design because simulation theory does imply some intelligence made the fucking simulator I think where it gets really creepy is like okay so is it like if we do get close to getting faster than the speed of light are they going to like shut us down you know what I mean is that I mean is that where that you it just hits reset because it's like yeah that little bit of biological code is like you're about to break one of the fundamental rules of this fucking thing so just reset the mother fuckers like yeah this is just starting to eat up too much RAM in my background processes I'm just going to hit my task manager here and just shut that one down exactly just reset like yeah man they're they're doing it again every time we let them get to this point they always are going to just kind of reset do dinosaurs again they were slow as fuck like that shit was not like you know causing issues I could have my emails opening shit and like that was fine yeah yeah that you know I think that that's like a it's going to be a really interesting next decade friend for sure like and I think part of that is is maybe people are going to have to come to terms with like a new you know a new way of thinking of the universe that is probably at this point for most folks would maybe drive you completely insane to hear what it is you know maybe we will let me know maybe that's what it'll be is it's just like yeah it's alien technology we're living in alien technology the whole thing it's the sun DNA we're just made up of alien technology and you can hack it a little bit and that's going to look like humans living to be 5,000 years old or something like that you know but I think regardless of what happens in the next like 10 to 20 years something that's probably going to be good for people is to like practice acceptance because I think shit is going to start going in directions that a you might not like and be you definitely can't control right I think yeah learning some sort of acceptance is probably on my cards of trying to deal with the next decade or two well we can follow Tim Leary's advice lift up your legs and float downstream that's all you can do have you ever fallen off a have you ever like on whitewater rafting no that shit looks fucking crazy it's crazy and like dangerous right yeah and but the advice they give you is if you do fall out of the raft don't try to stand up right that water is moving so fucking fast you're not going to stand up you're going to get slapped down and you might get your foot stuck in a rock and then if you get your foot stuck in a rock you're not coming back up you're dead meat so the advice is generally lean back try to lift your legs up and trust the river and then if you get to a slower part and you can climb out and you'll be okay but I think that's what you're talking about which is you know right if you right now if you try to resist what's happening right now come on you're just going to find yourself constantly fucking doing your head in and just like oh this is bullshit and like just probably in the state of constant anger and being pissed off at the system all the time yeah yeah exactly and and it's it's just maybe that's like what the current like stupid data islands or whatever you want to call them are like all these little enclaves or repositories of politicized information these are just rocks that like you're trying to grab onto for a sense of like continuity or a feeling of coherence and what's happening in the world and it's like yeah you whatever you whatever it is that you're trying to plant your yourself in is like okay at least this is made this is where it makes sense it's it's just you're getting rolled by over I know I am anytime I spend too much time lost in you know some data island I don't care what the fuck it is anything that has a political intent to it anytime I find myself fixating on what you know this pundit or that pundit has to say it's not like I feel liberated I just get angry dude speaking of political stuff one thing I wanted to ask you about is how do you do you play shows in Israel or how do you feel about playing shows in Israel I will play shows in Israel okay you need you mean because of like the Palestinian issue what's going on with that like the oppression of the Palestinians I mean it's like are we gonna play like what happens if international people don't want to come and play in the United States anymore I mean that's yeah this is kind of the argument right is like if you start to look into the politics enough of like you know the U.S. has done some fucked up shit like one time I was fucked up the Afghanistan war was like extremely fucked and you know I mean obviously like in China they've had a lot of bullshit go on there as well they haven't I haven't heard that before China's great yeah I mean I feel I feel like if you start looking into the politics of stuff you you'll never play showing most countries right yeah and I do think like if there's going to be like in general it's always dangerous to like make an entire group of people living in one place you know villainous it's like God Jesus Christ like you know the amount of control in general most individuals have when it comes especially to like waging war it's there's no control like we experience that in the United States over and over and over again whenever they start pumping us up for some bullshit war we protest we go nuts we go to the street we fucking go crazy and it doesn't do shit they still go to fucking war but you know you could vote this way or that way you could try this thing or that it still ends up being the same fucking thing where like you know it didn't work so I think like it's really important to not demonize like the individual who finds themselves in like a violent superorganism you know what I mean because I think the argument is that like going over there to play would be supporting an economy like supporting the economy of the government who's like being this crazy oppressive thing yeah I got some offers for shows in Israel recently and I was kind of torn about whether or not to do it so I asked people on Twitter and I got 40% of people saying yeah go for it and the other 60% of people saying no don't do that shit well you know I think like listen activism is so fucking important and anything you decide to do that's from your heart it's the right thing but to me it's like dialogue is what's going to change stuff it's like getting in there and like having real conversations on the ground with people about what's happening instead of whatever the particular information that we're getting is one way or the other like the real change comes from like direct communication with people well yeah I mean I've played like five or six shows there at this point over the years like the first few shows I played there I had no idea about the conflict it's just not something I would learn about but yeah talking to the people there I mean the people I'm playing for they're electronic music fans like hippies basically yeah not the people who are oppressing Palestinians they're also people like you and I who look at governments as like these fucking menacing giant corporations that don't want to do everything they can to make money and basically be imperial systems that control all the land and shit like I mean they believe the same shit and they're like they're definitely just trying to enjoy electronic music but yeah every time I play there like the last at least the last two times I've just copped like some serious flak from fans like lost a bunch of at least a few fans sucks you it's not like I think it's I just think it's like we can't just lump every American like you know like when I'm online I'll read a thread someone will be like I don't like Americans and it's like well there's a lot of us here and I mean like not all of us are like fuck yeah get back in Afghanistan blow blow them up man let's do it like a lot of us are just trying to like get like feed our fucking kids and we're confused as anyone else is and you know I was just having this wonderful conversation with some folks I met at EDC who I'm gonna have on the podcast their activists they live in Detroit and they're on they're on the ground man they're like helping community gardens appear where there's like these places I just found out about called food deserts which happens where like all you have got in a whole like 10 miles swath of Detroit is like a whole foods that the people living there can't fucking afford to eat at anyway so it's a food desert so like these people build community gardens and they so that people can have a fresh good food if they need it and like they're the ones at the fucking protests where if you watch like Fox news or whatever they're the ones are like look at the fucking dangerous antifa or whatever you know what I mean I mean I don't know if that's what they are but they're they go to the protests to film what's happening and because they're good anyway I don't want to ruin it for the package with them I just really but you don't hear about that side of things on the news and so people who who are thinking one way or another about this place or that they're just here getting information from like a very few sources where I guarantee there's people in right now who are actively trying to create lasting peace there you know who are who are actively trying to like make things better and those people just get left out of the equation when and demonized you know so I don't know I just think it's it's easier to imagine some homogenous mass of violent people in China it's easier to think all those and that's how they get us ready for war isn't it that's how they get us pumped up for war they're like all those fucking Chinese motherfuckers you better yes and it's like are you kidding me you can't tell me that every single person in that region is some certain way any more than every single American is or whatever and the moment you like start thinking that I think that's when you accidentally become the thing that you are offended by right it's like how you generate patriotism and racism and stuff exactly exactly that's exactly right it's just you people do it with law enforcement people do I used to do with the fucking DEA I was talking to I was having a great conversation with Rick Doblin who's like one of the one of the people behind getting MDMA prescribed and and when I was talking to him I was just like these fucking feds DEA and he's like they're not all bad you think they're bad they're not you're just turning them all into one thing there's good people on the very side that you think are like the demonic monsters of the world in like the same thing we're just talking about I would the tech people and the security it's like not everyone who works in the in the back end of tech is like trying to look at your photos like there's a bunch of them who are trying to do that exact opposite thing exact exactly and that said that is a very complex perspective and the problem with that is now I can't get mad at an entire group of faceless people I can't put a monster mask on an entire group of people because they're not all bad they're actually good people they're trying to make the world better and to me that's the hope of the world is that that's like there's good people like it's the most cliche she's the thing to say they're everywhere there's good people who have managed to get into real positions of power who just currently at the moment don't have whatever they need to make the instantaneous change we all want but they're working at it you know and so maybe you're not doing a show in Israel is it going to bring attention to a real fucking horrible problem and maybe inspire people to change may maybe I don't know I don't know but talking about it on this podcast and you know making Twitter posts about it to start right at least a lot of people who probably don't know about because I mean fuck I didn't know about this issue for a while you know it's probably people listen this podcast I've never heard about this problem before well man I'm you know some of my dearest friends are Israeli they live in Israel and they're wonderful fucking people and they don't want there to be violence and they there's there they don't want they don't want to get murdered they don't want their kids to get murdered and they don't want other people's kids to get murdered but they happen to be like born in a place that is going through a lot of complex shit so it's I can't like it's like really hard for me to demonize them or you know and but though I do like Jesus fucking Christ I there's people who listen to this podcast that live in Palestine who I've talked to online and it's like Jesus Christ you've got a fucking open air prison there you know what I mean that's just like and I it seems like the most hopeless of situations and they're dealing with the same shit because over there there's a factions of them that have completely given up any hope for anyone who's Palestinian is listening to this fucking hit me up I'd love to have a conversation because yeah that yeah there you go there you go because I think it's the conversation because what are they going to do I mean I think they're like what the fuck do you want us to do we're stuck we don't know like a lot of my my fucking friends were literally like literally murdered by bombs I don't know what to do and you're telling me what don't be violent how can you tell me what to fucking do asshole who lives in a place where you can like drive around and I'll have to go through like seven checkpoints and you can get the fucking medicine that you need you okay what's your stupid fucking advice to like go to a music festival guess what not a lot of DJs are coming here you know what I mean so it's like I get it I'm I don't I get it but I you know and you end up just saying the most like seemingly try cliche things which is like I just want there to be peace I would like to see that in my lifetime there you know I would love to see that like to witness that actually happen would be incredible but is that going to happen by vilifying entire segments you know entire like countries is that going to happen using the exact methodology that people seem to be using to rationalize the very acts of violence that are making people want to boycott Israel you know what I mean because it's like by lumping all the Palestinians into one group of whatever the fuck they're trying to do it's like well so the answer to peace is to lump everyone living into Israel in that in another group right just like hate on a whole other groups yeah opposite thing of what you might want to be doing right yeah it's like trying to like make your water less salty by putting more salt in your water so but then you know I don't know I don't know man I wish I had a good fucking great answer to the thing I think that's a good answer I mean I think that's a pretty level head of wave looking at it all you know though yeah it's obviously a fucking horrid thing that's happening over there and yeah I guess it's not it's not the easiest thing to make decisions about especially like I don't know man it's funny like a lot of Israeli people hit me up about it and they'll be like hey man I saw you like made this post on Twitter or like I saw you talked about this thing on your podcast like man there's a lot of gray area and I'm like well cool explain it to me like you know just a lot of gray area a lot of gray it's like right doesn't seem like a fucking very convincing argument well yeah I mean there's I guess there's a lot of fucking gray area and there is right and yeah it's just like I don't yeah I don't think I could ever understand the problem you know not having grown up there in either Palestine or Israel to its full extent but yeah I also have not had it explained to me in such a way where I'm like this is fine you know it's not fine it's not far this thing from fuck I mean we're looking at it we're looking at the problem I mean maybe it's something about the fact that it's not somehow it's just not diffused like you're forced to acknowledge it you're forced to see it you're forced to like deal with the fact that this is one of the ways that human beings have conversations right now human beings one of the ways we talk to each other is by blowing up other people's children and you know that is not a way to fucking communicate that is not a way to talk and it's whatever you know strip away all of the like everything else away and just look at that as it is and it's like it's something like it's like a cultural black hole you know it's something that is so profoundly like violent and impossible to wrap your head around that it's like and how do you fix it after like generations of people have been wounded or murdered how do you fix it you know like in Afghanistan as we're sitting here eating our fucking Chipotle or whatever there's someone right now with a broken heart who's been feeling that way for the last 15 years because one of his best friends got exploded by a United States drone at a wedding and he can't sleep anymore and you know what I mean so you can't fix that I can't fix that you can't fix that but guess what we paid for that fucking drone didn't we we paid taxes you paid for the drone some little tiny bit I don't know how small little pixel of the of the shrapnel that when exploding through you know any number of innocent people and any number of places where the United States was blowing people up we paid for that your music paid for it my podcast paid for it anyone who's paying taxes paid for it so our hands are all bloody it's just because of the massive size of the United States and the fucking horrific brilliance of these war campaigns they managed to dilute it they managed to somehow make it seem and it all I'm sorry I was gonna say and it also seems like like all of the extreme left on Twitter also primarily American right probably yeah I guess so yeah I don't know I don't know probably yeah I would assume so I think like primarily most of my fan bases anyway so it seems like most of the pushback that I'm getting from from these people who have bloody hands but are American and therefore maybe aren't so hypocritical of themselves yeah well it's really hard to like you know it's like what do you do if you find yourself like if you're like a I don't know what do you do if you're like a cell in a in a tiger you know what I mean and like you you don't want to you don't want to be a predator but it's like you're literally like connected to it you're part of that what do you do and so but I think like one answer to that is like okay stop identifying with a tiger it's like you know that's what the tiger wants you to do the United States wants you to be a nationalist you know that's how the war machine runs is by people getting really fixated on their national identity it's like and so something about just allowing yourself a vacation from your national identity even for a few moments so it's like okay let's imagine that there's actually just peace workers as cheesy as a term as that may be that are boundary less and not even bound not even but temporarily bounded because they're basically the same people throughout history and so they are that's always the same person certainly globally there's peace workers I've met him had him on the podcast there's people who don't give a fuck about what your nationality is they are what they're going to try to help you if they can because that's their calling and that's what they do they don't care what part of town you come from they don't care if you have health insurance they don't care if you can help them they don't care if your feet stink they don't care if you're if you're like going to rob them after they try to help you they're just going to try to help you there are people like that all around the planet and they are not bad they're not nationalists they don't say I'm an American healer I'm the American I'm the Palestinian peace worker I'm the Israeli healer they're just people who are trying to help and so you know what I mean I think shifting identification to them if you can versus like whatever your particular national identity is is one one step in the right direction the problem is if you do that then you lose the ability to alienate tribalize and do all the things that allow you to have a kind of like leg that you can do your violent leg leg humping on in some kind of pathetic attempt to stop feeling bad you know something like that and but it's complex and it's like it's tricky and it'd be easy to spiritually bypass yourself into thinking you're doing that when really you're just kind of doing some kind of cowardly act when you need to be doing like real direct action you know what I mean but you don't have to do it alone that's the other thing is like find them they'll help you when you know like anytime I get in a conversation with a real deal they're not shaming anybody it's like you know you meet someone who's in AA and because you want to sober up they're not like looking at you like you fucking pathetic drunk because they used to be one you know what I mean so you run into some of these people and it's the same situation where it's like they just want you to join to help they're not like they used to be fucking fucking consumptive violent fucks to you know these people I'm talking about like they're there they're out there they don't seem to my experience with them as they're not in the business of shaming there's no time you know they're just trying to help yeah I feel like generally people in AA are pretty nice yeah people I feel like if you've just gone through that road of battling with this fucking demon inside you that's just yeah just this really aggressive nag that you have that's just like do the thing do the thing do the thing like basically a friend of yours who's trying to convince you to do this like incredibly fucking gnarly thing all the time and you just have this kind of sort of weak voice in your head that instead of being like no I'm gonna set like a definite boundary with you to not do this thing you're instead like convince me convince me that it's a good idea anymore and I feel like people in AA and NAN shit who have like dealt with that who have been like trust me man like I've had that fucking thing inside me that's done that and I've also been that person who's been like I'm not gonna say like no for sure I'm not doing that thing but instead I'm gonna be like maybe it's a good idea like you can you sure it's a good idea like convince me that's a good idea like if they've dealt with that whole fucking gnarly thing and then they can see you're sort of on the early stages of dealing with that thing that generally got a fucking ton of empathy for you yes that's right yeah that's one of the see that's one of the qualities of I think the authentic you know peace worker whatever you want to call it is there's empathy and it's not just empathy for the desperate people who need their help it's empathy for anyone who finds themselves in the in the in the human condition because that no matter what you've got to deal with the suffering of the world it's there even if you think you're not looking at it you can still feel it and it's like they they they just like you know Ramdas talks about it or it's like you go to a peace rally and you see people holding up peace signs going peace don't you want fucking peace peace you know what I mean it's like yeah we will make peace peace will come you fucking piece of shit and it's like you know what I mean and you know versus like the people who have whose karma is such that they really are just trying to help and they don't have they don't have they can't use they don't have time to get angry in that way because they they're they're like help they're like bringing people blankets and jackets and you know what I mean just trying to keep people from getting shot by the cops so it's like I don't know maybe this is naive of me but I think maybe just I didn't realize and those people are in Israel those people are in the United States those people have always been in the most miserable like dangerous aggressively violent places of the world and those people are the hope like those are the people who make the change those are the people these I gotta have these activists I met you know they were talking about how they were talking about watching cops take pamphlets watching cops take the pamphlets from the activists and putting them in their pocket that's the hope that's the hope that's the like real world hacking where you're getting the data packets over the boundary into the pocket of the people dressed like Darth Vader and maybe when they go home they open that shit up and they're like what the fuck I just pummeled somebody who's trying to make it so that folks who can't afford food can have food you know and so that to me is like the more nuanced approach rather than like just trying to isolate or alienate entire groups of people being a cop would be fucking hard though Sam Harris put it a good way where he's like if you're a cop it's always a fight for the gun basically he's like one thing that people don't consider in those cop interactions is that there's always a gun at play there's like always a gun like right there on the table basically I mean it's obviously attached to your hip but it's like yeah imagine that if you're going into any sort of altercation with somebody you have a gun exposed on the outside of your hip it's like you always have to be concerned about that yeah no I mean it's fucked up beyond I mean a lot of countries they manage to take the guns away and things seem to be just fine or like you know some countries you're like you keep the gun in the car and only in the worst situation do you get the order like come in armed or something like that so I think that's like cops who have done a lot of BJJ according to I think it was some Henna Gracie or something it was on Sam Harris's podcast and he was saying like out of a couple hundred cops or something about like half of them had done BJJ and the other half had not and the amount of like injuries that came out of the altercations that the people who had done BJJ had had there was like basically none on the other side there was like fucking plenty yeah it's fucking training man it's clearly like they're just trying to save money on training these people or they're like you know the way they're hiring people is not based on like oh are you going to have like a nice nuanced approach to dealing with this shit oh you know Brazil you just I just want you to pull the I mean I saw a whole story on the guy who trains cops and just killing and like it's like they train you to you know you just kill like there's no time to think about it you just have to kill if someone's running at you with a knife you don't have time to be like stop you just shoot them in the in the chest and it's like so it's like you know it's a whole different fucking podcast band you know but I love the I love the conversation that we just had and I love that like I can't wait if you hear from some I think people from Israel should reach out to you too I mean they absolutely have like I said most of the people who have reached out to me their opinion is like kind of the same thing that we were just talking about they're like hey man we're just like normal people we can't help the fact that we fucking were born here like that's just you know you don't choose your spawn conditions yeah and I agree with them the argument against doing it like I said is supporting the economy of the regime that's oppressing Palestinians right it's like and the same thing like you just said it's like if you pay taxes in America which I do I fucking pay way too much tax to America your hands are bloody too right and it's like people I think who are probably in our tax threshold by paying like quite probably quite a lot of tax right at that point it's like yeah I wish the government would stop spending so much on fucking militaries like they spend so much like trillions of dollars a year or something right on like just an incredible amount of money on military yeah and then you then you didn't like you know when we're leaving Afghanistan all the equipment out there that we all fucking paid for we're just abandoning it out there it's all just left out there we don't want to buy it anyway and everyone's like right you know right now like this fuck Joe Manchin is like making it so that like the government isn't going to pay a paternity leave and like you know what I mean it's like there was all this money that we just poured into a thing that made zero cents they could have made it so like you know we take care of student loan debt and people like you know like huge cultural programs just getting people in a college if they want to go to fucking college getting the weight of people's debt off their shoulders getting people fucking medical care insulin all these things that could have happened you know it's really like it's so sad yeah I mean space travel you know like if we drop trillions of dollars a year into figuring out how to colonize other planets and you know maybe get the human race a little more longevity could also be a good idea it's not going to happen that it's just not coming from the top down bottom line I think the stuff has to come from us and it grows out of the cracks in society that usually appear there because of horror that's what's kind of weird about it is like wherever there is awful horror wherever there is like disequilibrium wherever there things get so desperate that people are forced to work together with each other that's where the cool shit starts appearing but it doesn't generally isn't coming from the top down it's coming from like people who like are like in the cracks that you'll never see that no one will ever hear about and those people are fucking everywhere yeah well they're the majority right and they're also the people who are experiencing like actual real life these people at the top are living on a whole different fucking planet with a whole different set of rules but I think I should also clarify that I'm also not extremely pro let's just ditch this planet and go somewhere else I think we should probably try and switch energy sources here and like try and preserve this planet yeah I know I mean yeah you know I think like yeah I know it's a it's it's but the amount of money being put like if we just look we all know what it is it's like we have a massive very powerful military industrial complex that's sucking up all the fucking money that should be being used for social programs they've got lobbyists the lobbyists are making these social programs seem like you know the work of like diabolical communists when it's just like no no it's like you know there's like there's people who can't get people who don't have food in our cities all they've got is seven elevens that you know where they can eat fucking Twinkies or some shit every day and it's making them sick but they don't have fucking health care so now they can't pay for their health care anyway the you know it's like that's the problem that the you know it seems to me that's the problem but it's like go ahead and do space travel you know really what we need to do is figure out a way to duplicate the planet right we need to make one more earth that we move everyone to you think at some point meat will be made illegal and we'll look back at it kind of like smoking cigarettes or something and just be like what the hell why are we doing that shit they're going to grow it it's not going to be made illegal they already are you know growing foie gras do you know about that they already have synthetic foie gras I saw the salmon farms I think without like growing fake salmon and yeah exactly like I think it'll just be they're going to like the it will eventually be cheaper to grow the meat then it will be to harvest the meat from living creatures and then it'll naturally kind of Peter away I mean I think that's the problem with fossil fuels I just read an article that like the the amount the amount of energy it takes to make a solar panel or all the things that are generating energy is like getting less and less and less so it's like we just have to survive long enough to get to that point where pulling pulling oil out of the ground costs more than getting it out of the air getting energy out of the air and then you know it'll it'll naturally happen but yeah man I mean a lot of it takes like enough people working on the solar panel shit and less people working on the oil pulling out of the ground shit I think a lot of this comes down to the capitalist reward for doing so though right like if there's more of a reward monetarily I think for making these solar panels and pulling power out of the air I think you'll find all of these fucking oil tycoons will switch over pretty quick that's all they're waiting for that's just all they give a fuck about they just want it to be a little cheaper and then once it is it's like yeah that game over for like the weird gross fucking black tarry rotten dinosaur shit we've been putting into our cars like it's you know yeah I think I mean I don't again like I am overly naive when it comes to my feelings about what the future holds for us even and I spent a lot of time doom scrolling and a lot of time looking at all the horrible shit and the horrible possibilities that are out there it's just you know it's spend I don't care if you spent the last seven months just on drudge report and fucking Tucker Carlson all you need to do is go and have one conversation with like these people I just met like actual people who are helping and your opinion will instantly change that that's all it takes is just one simple conversation where you're like oh wow and it's not just where you're like oh my god I can't believe I let myself get brainwashed by corporate propaganda that was trying to like produce the illusion of a consensus it's that you want to help them because the the the light inside of them is so bright and they're you know what I mean they're joy and they're what they're doing and they're just authenticity is so supremely like attractive that it makes all the phantoms that they've created for us to be afraid of disappear I mean that's their worst fucking nightmare is just people start talking to each other that's their worst nightmare is like the you know the these conversations are happening where we can't demonize each other anymore and by them I just mean people profiting off of fear and and you know vampires essentially they just want us to be all cocooned up and not having chats like this they love it the more we we don't talk about pay quickly not at all go ahead and then we'll wrap it up I kept you too long I'm sorry I told you it was only going to be a couple hours that was Mr. Bill everybody all the links you need to find them are going to be a dugotrustle.com

Check out the latest in-store, and we're never short on options at jcp.com. All dressed up, everywhere to go. JCPenney. Ah, hello, my sweet pandemic friends. I hope you're hanging in there. As time progresses, I've noticed that I'm becoming increasingly tweaked at weird moments. Sometimes I feel fine. Sometimes I realize that two days have passed, and it's actually been a couple of hours. Time's all warped and wobbled right now. A lot of us are feeling a bizarre undulation between states of extreme panic, claustrophobia, and downright boredom of the most vicious poisonous and vile variety. We might be in a situation where we're living with people that we normally don't see as much as we do, and we're experiencing some kind of satanic friction. We might be understanding what Jean-Paul Sartre meant when he said, hell is other people, or we might be completely alone in the frigid wasteland of our apartments or empty homes experiencing a frothing kind of pandemic-induced horniness with no one or nothing to help us release all that vast, powerful, almost nuclear sexual energy. My friends, the planet is in a weird time period right now, and it's during these times that we most certainly owe a gigantic thank you to all those folks who are right now out there on the front lines. And by those folks, I'm talking about the drug dealers who are fearlessly delivering. I'm just kidding, making a dumb joke. I guess in a weird way they are drug dealers, the doctors, the nurses, the clinicians, the delivery drivers, the people who are working at the Walgreens and the Rouse and whatever your grocery store happens to be. The people working in the Amazon warehouses, and if I missed you, I am so deeply sorry, whoever you are that's out there making a living and making money so you can feed your family while simultaneously putting yourself at risk of inhaling the doom cough of some unwitting host of a brand new virus. We are eternally indebted to you, and if I were the grand emperor of planet Earth, which one day I intend to be, I would give every single one of you beautiful silver medallions and special magical crowns that instantaneously evaporated your morning hangovers or made it so that you could actually have an orgasm in the midst of a high-powered ecstasy trip. I would do everything I could for you, but because I'm not capable of those things and have not yet risen to the throne of glory, which one day I hope to rise to or at least my great conquering sun will rise to, so at last I can have vengeance on my enemies and bring my friends great fast swaths of land across the planet, which we will rename after characters from the Dark Tower series. The best I can do is offer you conversations like the one on this podcast with Jack Cornfield and Trudy Goodman. They are on their own kind of front lines and right now, because they have not just talked the talk, but walked the walk for decades when it comes to meditation, mindfulness and spirituality, they have the incredible ability to alchemize all of my neurotic fear, panic and general anger and anxiety that seems to be resulting from this particular global pandemic that we all find ourselves stuck within. This is one of my favorite podcasts and one of my favorite conversations that I've ever had and if anything speaks to what happens if you dedicate yourself to an actual, authentic spiritual practice, it's these two's ability to gracefully and instantaneously ease fear and panic and to somehow simultaneously give me and whoever's lucky enough to get to chat with them, the fuel necessary to give ourselves a break because come on everybody, how are you supposed to be actin' normal right now in a situation that seems to be mirroring the book of revelations? Is it the end of the world? No, I don't think so, but sometimes my mind thinks so if that makes any sense at all and this conversation that you're about to listen to certainly eased a lot of the weirdness and wobbliness that I've been feeling gave me some pragmatic tools that I've been using ever since I had this chat to deal with those moments where it feels like a horrific abyss has opened up inside of my body which my ass is getting sucked into. If you've been feeling any version of that, then I think you will benefit from listening to this great conversation with Jack Cornfield and Trudy Goodman. We're gonna jump right into it right after this. Much thanks to Squarespace for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH. If you wanna let your eyes look into something so beautiful it's been compared to the contents of the Ark of the Covenant currently housed beneath the Vatican, then go no further than dunkintrustle.com and you will see a Squarespace website. That's right, every single time I upload one of these episodes, I use Squarespace to do the job. They've got everything you need and what better time than during a global pandemic to start on the website for your business or to refine that pulsating pile of liquefied ancient HTML that used to look cool back in the mid 90s but now looks like it was vomited out of the mouth of some rotting android in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Let's get the internet more beautiful. Squarespace can help you do that. They've got everything you need. I will admit that at one point in time I actually took money from people to help them build websites. I shouldn't have done that. I was using my small knowledge of HTML meeting a lot of hubris and desperation and the result is I sullied the internet with some half-baked websites that honestly I should refund the money of the people that I took it from. I don't know what they use to make websites anymore because I don't need to know because I use Squarespace and Squarespace is flawless and seamless. It will build a website that will size to any phone or device out there. It will build a website with shopping cart functionality and if you have a mailing list or wanna gather a mailing list they will help you send out mass mails to your adoring beloved fans and clients. I know someone who actually sells their socks online and makes money doing that. And if they can make money doing that then surely you have some article of clothing, some sweat encrusted garment that you could put for purchase on your brand new Squarespace website. Also you don't just have to build a website for business. The internet is a kind of eternal digital canvas upon which you can paint anything you want. You wanna make a website for your friends to comfort them during this bizarre time. You can do that. You wanna make a website for your band or just in celebration of some kind of rare bird the Norwegian Cornelius Blix then you can do that with a Squarespace website. You can make a website in seconds because they have easy to mix and match beautiful award-winning templates or you could spend eons going into the depth of the great digital tapestry that is the tool known as Squarespace.

And I just want to, as quickly as I can, dive into the deep stuff, because I don't know how long my technology's gonna hang in there out here on the beach, but this is something, I've been chatting with my friends, obviously, with business associates, and everyone that I've been talking to, in some way, shape or form, has conveyed to me that they feel like they're going nuts. Like, and not in a fun way. Like, people are having a different versions of depression, grief, fear, I've never, in my life, experienced anything like this personally. And I feel completely out of my depth at this point when it comes to talking with folks or trying to offer comfort or anything, because I feel sort of nuts myself. So I was wondering what y'all have arrived at regarding things that we can do to try to maintain some sense of inner stability. You know, I have to say I am so grateful for the gift of awareness and mindfulness practice, because without having the practice, which has allowed, which allows us to access a more reliably stable and peaceful inner sense of our own being, without that, I would be just as gripped with fear and grief as everybody else. And it's not that I don't have those feelings. Of course I do, I'm human and we're facing something that no human alive today has ever faced. And we're going through it at the same time in the whole world, you know, which is another very unusual moment in history. And I just am incredibly grateful for this practice. And I feel we're both feeling called to share it and to share the tools and skills that are helping us and will help you, your listeners too, for sure. One of the things that's the simplest for me is really resting my attention with the breath and taking a few deep breaths to just regulate my nervous system. You know, it's a simple thing Duncan, but it works. You eat in three breaths, down regulates and brings a little bit more calm if we do that together. It's so simple. Deep, deep breaths. And if you do 10 breaths and really feel what's going on in your body and breathe into that, not trying to make it go away or fix it or just noticing how it is for you in this particular moment of your life. Yes. And breathing into that, it just helps calm the nervous system. And we'll share more things, but that's just a very simple, basic one that really anybody can do in a couple of minutes anywhere. I love the deep breath idea. I am, some folks that I'm talking to though, and again, I'm not trying to dismiss this, the deep breath idea is fantastic. It's one tiny thing. You know what, yes. And I get that just a little thing, but what is weirding me out is the tone in people's voices. You know, I don't, I can't, it's like, everyone's just, you know, and again, how much of this is a projection. But Erin, who by the way says hello to y'all. Hi Erin. She is, you know, going through like periods just being depressed. She's describing it as the kind of grief. You know, we had all this stuff planned for right now. We just moved into a new place and we've been recluses. And because the place we were living at previously, we just, it wasn't kind of what we wanted to invite a lot of people over to. One of the things we were saying is we're gonna, finally have barbecues and just every weekend people are gonna come over, it's gonna be the best. And now here we are in a vacuum. And then I've been talking to people who've lost their jobs. Income has been cut in half from this and will probably be cut more. And then obviously the worst thing is people who know people who are currently dying from this disease. So where is, and I asking to mindfulness teachers and to Buddhist practitioners to help me find a place to stand on, I don't know if that's the best question or not, but we all feel so wobbly. The breath is great, exercise, all that stuff. But I guess I'm digging for something we can find comfort in that transcends breath. Sure, I'm gonna turn it over to Jack because yes, there are other practices and I'm gonna share them with you, but Jack's turn now. I think the first thing Duncan, I'm listening to and this is a shared experience, the level of anxiety and all the fear and anxiety is now morphing into grief as people feel the losses, whether it's of their jobs or the people around them that are dying or their favorite restaurant or the nonprofits that are aiding people in distress or they're concerned for people on the streets, all of these kinds of things. And you're asking somehow, all right, how do we get through this? Yeah, because there's a level of, you call it depression and panic. The first step is just to acknowledge this is what depression is like, this is what panic is like. You know, you're not trying to fix it or change it. The many who say, I hate feeling panic, I don't wanna be depressed, you are rejecting it or you're pushing it away. And that makes it stronger. It's like all those zombie movies or whatever, when you resist the zombies, they get stronger. Right. There's some way in which the very first step is to say this is the experience that we're having. And it's also not unique to you. We can also feel like we're stuck in it. You know, I'm a wreck, I'm a mess. But in fact, as a human species, we've been through thousands of years of epidemics and floods and earthquakes and so forth. And we know how to survive. We have that survival. It's in your DNA. It comes from your ancestors and your great-great-great-great grandparents. And you know how to do it. And 99% of us will get through this, although there will be tremendous loss. And so part of it is to recognize that this is what this experience is like. And it's being shared by a whole generation together, like going through a world war. We are going through this. And there's nothing wrong with any of these feelings that completely matter. And the next step in accepting them is to recognize what it does to your body, that it throws you into fight, flight, or freeze. Because you know, you're adrenaline and all your alarms and how to get away from the tiger. Only the thing is the tiger's invisible. You know, and it could be on the cardboard and it could be in the air when you're close to another person. But you go into fight, flight, or freeze. And so Trudy talked about regulating these in breadth. There are actually several really good practices that we'll talk about that help to hold this. But the first step is acceptance of the, is recognizing this is what's happening. Recognizing the first and then accepting and saying, all right, this is where we are. You can't work with something until you see it clearly and say, all right, this is the situation. You know, my heart is tight and my mind is racing. And then you begin a real kind of honest inquiry and look at, how is it possible that my ancestors, that we can actually hold this with a steady heart, hold all the pain, all the loss, all the stories. And there are ways to do it using the power of loving awareness that can actually, what you're seeking, that can actually be bigger than the experience and allow us to do it. When you say ancestors, what do you mean? Your DNA, Duncan, comes down through a line from some millions of years, if not, you know, hundreds of millions of years. And the reason that you, weird as you are, weird as I am, have appeared in this particular body, in this human incarnation, is partly through the fact that your ancestors got out of the way of the saber-tooth tiger. And they were the ones that survived the plague or whatever. And they knew how to do it. And then that was passed on as not just information, but epigenetically, in the survival mechanisms of your body and of your being. And we know how to do this as a collective. We're part of life. And so is the virus. We're in this dance with it. And we know how to dance with the difficulties and move through. The suffering is not the end of the story. The epidemic is not the end of the story. There's an end to the story that's better, but we have to go through it. We can't bypass it. Okay, gotcha. So this is the, okay, I gotcha. So this is, well, to be quite honest, this leads me to a question. I guess this is a pre-question to that question. I have been, I think I must be the worst person to be with during a pandemic on Earth. And I feel like I'm not being supportive enough. And I feel like any attempt I'm making to sort of comfort Aaron is just, I can't, it's belly flop after belly flop. I'm either mansplaining some crap. I'm acting like a virologist or something. I don't understand anything about anything. I don't know what a virus is, to be really honest. If you put a virus in four other things on their microscope, I don't know if I would be able to identify it, except you see the picture of the coronavirus. It's cute, but I wouldn't be able to, you know what I, no, but then I'm doing the thing where she's expressing, you know, profound sadness, new mom, beautiful child. And I'm trying to fix it, you know, or like saying like a Hakuna Matata, Disney bullshit. Or, you know, and I feel completely out of my depth. And so what, number one. Do you ever just like hold her hand? Do you ever just sit with her and hug her? Would she let you or is she upset with you? Do you know what I mean? Like instead of feeling that you have to fix it, which I think is sort of a species wired in male, response, which is very, very helpful in lots of situations, but not this one, not one who is emotionally distressed. All, most people really want Duncan. Most women, I'm speaking, you know, of course this goes across genders, but just as generalization, I want somebody to just be with me in it, to be willing to feel my grief with me, to not have to fix it. And the steadiness of that kind of loving presence in itself is healing if nothing even is said. It's like the same thing of being with somebody who's sick or dying. They don't really want you to talk to them about your ideas of the afterlife or your prayers, whatever those might be. Sometimes maybe they want that, but usually what people want is to feel there is somebody who is willing to be with them in the face of something hard and scary. And new mom, you know, gorgeous young child, facing a future that is so unknown right now. And what do we humans do when we don't know? We fill in the blanks with our fears. I mean, that's a survival mechanism. It's nobody's fault. All right. You know, so I think just that willingness to enter into whatever, no matter how dystopian the fantasy might be that she's in the grip of because it's scary, the willingness to just put an arm around her and say, yeah, yeah, I get it. I get it. And then the teaching, of course, this is where the teaching of impermanence is not just terrifying because we're going to die. And that's our, you know, human birthright is our mortality. Yes. But it's also that if we're willing to be with a feeling, it does not stay. It can't even if we wanted it to. It does not stay. It changes. It doesn't always change into bliss, but it changes. And so that's something else. I think what Jack was talking about was not sort of fighting with reality. This is our reality right now. And right now is the only time we actually have. That's the only time that's actually real. But what's actually real is that we're alive and we're not sick and we have love in our lives. And, you know, what's real, what would be offered by life in this particular moment, if we don't fast forward into the future at all, is not all bad. And it's not all scary. And so to be able to redirect the attention and open our hearts to the beauty that's being offered, not to be in denial or try to paste a smiley face on scary stuff, but just to see the more holistic, whole, integrated picture of what life actually is, as opposed to our thoughts about it. Like you said, what's beyond the breath? Give me something that's, you know, beyond the breath. Like the breath. The breath can't hold a candle to my crazy thinking. Right? Yes. But the breath is actually more real than that crazy thinking. And when we're willing to actually feel it and get into it and receive it and wait for a minute, the emotion we're caught in will relax. It will relax. That is so cool. I'm aware of this. I can be with this. It will relax. You know, to that impulse to protect your wife, to protect your child, I mean, I get a call from my daughter. And I would go anywhere to, you know, she said, Daddy, I'm in Cambodia. I'm in trouble. I just get on the next airplane. Yes. But she's married to a firefighter. In an urban fire department. And they have a little, like you, they have a one and a half year old child, my grandson, Desmond. And they don't have protective equipment, which means that when they go out, they'll be, you know, 80% of their work is medical costs. They'll be exposed. And then they'll pass it on to the family. And they're young and they're strong and they'll probably get through it. And I said, well, will they test you? And he said, you know, they don't want to test everybody because they need all hands on deck. They need all their firefighters. So, all right, here's a moment, you know, where I feel helpless and uncertain like you and so forth. And what I have to do is take a deep breath and hold all of this with a compassionate heart and say, we're all in this together. Everybody who is aging parents, everybody who's worried for children, everybody who's worried for the neighbor who runs that little bodega or that little store in the corner and might lose their livelihood. And feel that we can hold all these with a lot of compassion in our heart. Those who are vulnerable and suffering and all of us who are in this together. And when I do, then instead of trying to fix something, I can't because things are uncertain. Trying to manage it and control it is the dad who's going to fix things. I can't do that. What I can do is hold it with compassion and then I can respond. I can call her. I can do what Trudy said when you sit next to your wife and you're not trying to fix it. You say, yeah, we're in this. I hear you. And also then she feels that you're steady and you can go, we all can go through this together. That's so beautiful. It's the, you know, honestly, the opposite of whatever. I'm like, to show her I'm there for I've been hanging lights. You know, like assembling things and doing horrible carpentry projects and some sad attempt to convey some form of protective masculinity, you know, and then it's not working. But it's a good thing. It's a good thing. It's just not good if that's all you do. It's all I've been doing. It's just construction projects. And then we get in fights and I'm like, don't you see I hung a light. Don't you see I need a sword. You can go mono a mono with the virus and, you know, if I would, I would, you would and we all would. And I think that, you know, what's even scarier sometimes for many, many humans is to go into the sad, frightened, desperate, depressed, grief-stricken emotions of each other instead of, you know, trying to, and that's real compassion. Compassion means that willingness to be in the suffering with each other without getting overwhelmed and disabled and lost in it. Because otherwise, essentially we are doing other things that are easier or more comfortable for us to do than to just sit with somebody's despair. That's hard. That is, it's a lot easier to hang a light. That's right. Wow. Okay. I get it. That is, of course, you know, of course that's it. And it's, you know, you hear that and it sounds so, on one level, oh, it's easy. You just sit with someone and hold them, but. It's not. It is not. But that's where the awareness practice and the willingness to be present with things and let them arise and pass away. That's where the practice actually helps. It shows us how to do that. And, you know, I also, I get, I don't know about Erin, but what helps me is some of the creative and uplifting things that humans are doing with and for each other right now. I want to read you something that I got. It's from a Belfast Ireland COVID team. And it's called Love in Action. And they said, when you go out and you see the empty streets, the empty stadiums, the empty train platforms, don't say to yourself, this looks like the end of the world. What you're seeing is love and action. What you're seeing in that negative space is how much we do care for each other. For our grandparents, our parents, our brothers and sisters, for the people we will never even meet. People will lose jobs over this. Some will lose their businesses and their dreams. And some will lose their lives. All the more reason to take a moment when you're out on your walk or on your way to the store or just watching the news to look into the emptiness and marvel at all that love. Let it fill you and sustain you. It isn't the end of the world. It's the most remarkable act of global solidarity we may ever witness. Wow. So there's another perspective. Yeah, that is beautiful. That's so beautiful. It's so beautiful. Still heartbreaking, but a better kind of heartbreak. Yeah, you know, we finally stopped. I know one thing for sure is we've got to stop watching the news. And we've been mainstream. We've just been shooting up the news. Just shooting up. Oh, no, no. Just right in there. And that is not helping. And so there is not. It's a very bad thing to do. It's bad medicine. You can look at the news 15 minutes a day. I wouldn't even watch it because watching you get all the emotion. Right. Quite honestly, we read it. Shoot your TV, you know, if you're going to shoot anything. Whoa, no, don't shoot the TV. Just shoot the news. And yeah, you can watch some fun movies. But instead, read 15 minutes. Get the basic update. The rest of it is just commentary. And most of it's written with that intense emotion. It's unprocessed of people's fight, flight, fear, freeze. Right. And all their confusion. And they're trying to make sense of something that's really a mystery. That we're actually in the face of one of the great mysteries of our human life and our human incarnation. The mystery of time and uncertainty. And the veils of separation where we felt we were separate are actually dropping away. And there's a kind of, as Trudy talked about, a remarkable thing that's happening in our isolation. We see how connected we are and how much we need each other. And so if you can tolerate the uncertainty and the mystery, which just is a little PS, it's actually always uncertain. We think we know what's going on, but we don't. But now it's really visible. But to open the window of tolerance in the heart to say yes. This is the great mystery. And we are now holding hands together in this mystery. And allowed somehow in holding it to find within ourselves the great heart of compassion. That is our birthright. That is who we are. We can do this and we have done this. We know it. When a baby is born, when your little baby was born, our first response is love. When a dear one dies, the hand we hold is a gesture of love. Timeless love and awareness is who you really are. And now is the time to know this interest. Thank you. So wonderful to hear. You know, we watched the Mr. Rogers documentary last night. This is our final, our break from the news. And we clad through the whole thing. Yes, yes. Woke up feeling much better. Yes. In that, I mean, he was a saint. Every day. Yes, he was. He watched Mr. Rogers every day. Here's the thing, Duncan. You're Mr. Rogers on the podcast. You're Mr. Rogers. You know, when I look at you, I feel close to you. And I feel like, like the little two and three year olds that watched Mr. Rogers, when he would say, you know, hi, they say hi back to him. They feel like they're with him. And that part of all of us is still alive and well. When we're watching each other and offering these teachings and podcasts, you know what I'm saying? We're doing that for the child in each one of us. This feeling overwhelmed and too helpless and too little to cope and too sad. Well, you know, the one thing I love about him in this documentary, I didn't even realize how edgy his show was and how he wasn't afraid to confront exactly what was happening in the world directly, not having it or anything. And I do love that. And to mirror that in some way, shape or form, I must say part of what's really devastating me right now is not just my sense of ineptitude when it comes to, you know, comforting my family, but also, Jack, I think this is kind of what you were saying. I really am dealing with the fact that I'm gonna die no matter what, pandemic or not. And I haven't felt this since I got cancer. You know, like I haven't been having to deal with this. Like I'm way older than Aaron and clearly way older than my son. And so I'm just thinking, my God, this is no matter what, it's slipping away. And something about the pandemic is like, when I'm not running away from it into like making cornbread or something or fixing a lamp, I'm dealing with this sense of, God, I don't want to die. I don't want to, I don't want to lead my kid. I don't want to, you know, so I don't, I don't know what, that's a question as much as just help, help me not die. I'll help me deal with this. You know, our body doesn't want to die. I don't want to die. I want to be here for my daughter and my grandson for my beloved Trudy. I'm also, you know, I'm almost 75 years old and I feel in some ways very grateful that I've had a very soul in life and I'm not so afraid to die. But I also know that the body doesn't want to die. Even if I know that who I am, a spirit, and I've had out of the body experiences and sat with people who are dying and they clinically died and left their body and floated into light and then came back and described it. The things I know about dying to give me a great sense of peace in that mystery, not that I understand it all, but I know that who I am is not just this body. And that we're given a certain amount of time in this incarnation. That's one part of the equation. And to know that makes the heart more peaceful. To know that who you are, a spirit that you can never not love your child. Whether you're here in body or not, you are the guardian. You are the love that holds that. Nothing can take that away from you. And at the same time, I also know that this body wants to stay alive. And it should for family and things. And even if I get sick, it's going to say, I want to stay alive. And I respect that. You know, it might panic. It might hold all those things. And that's also a part of our human incarnation. We are in that way, you know, spiritual beings who are born, our spirit, our consciousness was born into this body and we'll leave it. We're bigger than this human life. We're actually the web of life coming in through us. But also we are this body in some way identified for this incarnation. And that's why it becomes important also to love so deeply. Because this is the only place where you can love in the particulars of your wife and your child, you know, it's the only place in the whole galaxy where you can eat baked Alaska, you know, from the beach in Thailand as you are right now. Right. And it's magnificent. And where we are somehow, we're also in spring, Duncan. At least in the northern hemisphere. The birds are like singing opera outside my window. It's like people aren't bothering them. They're chirping away that the crocuses and the wisteria and the spring blossoms are having a spring blossom dance party. And life renews itself. There's something beautiful that we can join. And that's part of our bodies too. So yes, your body will die. I'm sorry to tell you this. But I don't think you're getting out of here very soon. I think you got to stay around, make a lot of podcasts and go to your, you know, go to the wedding of your beautiful baby. Thank you. I'll go ahead, Duncan. Well, no, please, Judy. I was going to say, but the other piece of what you're saying, I think that it's true for everybody and not just you is that being quarantined like this, being cooked up together, it's like an enforced retreat and it's bringing up everybody's stuff. Things that we're usually too busy with our, you know, our very fruitful distractions, our work and things that we go and do. Those things have been taken away from us. And those are the things that everybody has found their own ways to comfort themselves or to, to work with avoiding the things they need to avoid, you know, their defenses have, have organized their life. And suddenly those defenses aren't working so well because we don't have the supports for our defenses. And so for you, it's coming up as fear of your mortality and, you know, being the father of a young family for other people. It's questioning what they've done with their lives so far. For other people, it's realizing their marriage actually isn't so healthy, but the fact that they could each do their own thing all day made them not have to look at that. And for other people, it's realizing how much they can't stand to be with their children, even though they love them. Or, you know, it's all these things are coming up for people and people are having to face unpleasant truths about themselves. And how do they hold? How do we hold the things that we don't love that we are seeing in ourselves? Yes. How just going into reactivity and dismay and depression and like, oh my God, how do we do that? We do that by being willing to have some self-compassion and tenderness. And often, you know, these might sound like soft, fuzzy things, but they are not. They're strengths. They're spiritual strengths and powers that we actually cultivate when we are doing meditation and spiritual practices of other kinds. You know, we cultivate these strengths. So I think that that question, you know, it's like grief. There's, I call it crooked grief. Grief comes out in all kinds of ways. It comes out as irritation. I saw this cartoon where the woman is saying to her husband, couldn't you just blink more quietly? No. Everything you do irritates me right now, you know, getting on each other's nerves is the sort of mildest form of it. But that kind of short fuse and irritation and agitation, it's also one of the ways that grief comes out. Have you guys, have you got cameras installed in the house or something? Trudy, that is the most insight. It's like you've been watching us for the last couple of weeks. That's incredible. That is the description of it right now. That is you. We're living it too, Duncan. Not you too. But we have, we have been blessed by whatever weird karma made us devote our lives to doing these practices now is our time where they're coming in handy and we can actually say to people, you know what? We're going through what you're going through, but it works. It works. And of course, everything works. Walking in nature works, making love if you can with somebody or, you know, loving yourself tenderly. These things help. Wow. You know, I gotta tell you, that, just what you just said, I feel like a huge way to flip it off of me is knowing that you were able to just do that list without having had a conversation with me. The list is a lot longer. Oh, yes it is. But that's, that's it. Crooked grief. That's it. These just tiny little things seem so loud right now. And then that creates a sort of feedback loop or, you know, where because that thing seems loud, if you address it and just addressing the thing seems loud or, and then everything becomes, you know, temporarily screaming, this is us. And then we realize, we have a baby in one year. We can't be like this. And then we hug and we're back to normal. But what we've got, we've got some, you know, what's showing your baby. People can blow up and still love each other. Right. That's the best thing you can show your baby or one of them. Right. How many of us never saw our parents fight ever, but at the same time, we never saw other things that we needed to see from them about their love. Right. So don't feel so guilty. Like if you guys lose it and make up, he's getting to see, oh, okay, that was scary. But now they love each other again. This is, this is okay. I can remember that next time. That's so wonderful. That's so great. I mean, just, this is everything. Y'all are medicine. Thank you. Everything you're saying. This is, my ego is so big and so crazy. And I just want to be this per, I don't know who I think I am. I'm acting like we're in a, some like apocalyptic highway right now. You know, I've said things like you've got to, you know, we must be strong. I don't, I'm talking in these weird ways. Like now is the time we have to be strong now. This is the time for strength, not weakness. Like what, like there's bandits at the gate. There's, you know, but this is how my ego is reacting to it. It's like worse. But you can see that it's your ego reacting. What a great thing that you can see that Duncan. Right. You know, that's not all of who you are. You can see, oh, okay, this is a little deluded, but, but I'm on, you know, we're under threat. We feel threatened. And so the ego turns it into a battle and a war and I've got to be a strong warrior. Um, but what is a warrior really? And what is strong really? Right. It's, I get it. Strong is having the guts to sit with someone who's freaking out and not try to change them or teach them or rewire them like they're an engine or something. Or well, I hope you'll listen to your own podcast. That was beautiful. Thank you. I don't listen to this. I don't really care for that. Yeah. To love them. And, you know, um, the ego is mostly based on seer. So you just have to recognize that and see it's freaking out and say, it's okay. You're afraid that's fine. At the end of the day, and I've said this, you know, on a number of other occasions in podcasts, I sit to meditate, Trudy and I will sit together often. And what I notice when I do is I go through the day and I'm doing my teaching and podcast and writing and busy and cooking and, you know, trying to do things. And God, we're way busier than we had been before. It's crazy what's happening. So we have to find a way to regulate. It's not that easy, actually, because it's also, there's a lot of need there, but it's not like we have to save anybody. It's just, what's the best we can do? But anyway, I sit at the end of the day and I check into my body and my heart and my mind. And when I feel my body first, I feel the places of tension, fight, flight and freeze, my shoulders, my jaw, all the places we hold it. If we don't let ourselves feel it, it builds up and accumulates and we become rigid and much quicker to react, you know, we're like this soldier that's on alert. So I feel my body, I feel the whole of it. And I say, show me what you're carrying. And I make space to let it open with a loving awareness. Let me feel the tension as deep as it is. Let me feel how big these are. And once I've given some time for my body to show me what it's carrying, to feel it directly, then at some point I bring in compassion and I say, let me hold this the way I would a child who's crying, struggled, hurt with real compassion. And then finally I say, thank you. Thank you for trying to protect me. Thank you for trying to hold it together. I'm okay for now. I'm really okay. And I find that my body hears that message and goes, oh, I can step out of the, stop the war. I can step off the battlefield. Then I go to my heart and I discover that even though I was not paying attention in the day, there's a deeper grief and sadness or there's fear or there's anger or rage or, you know, all those huge emotions along with longing and loneliness and love, all those. And I say, all right, heart, show me what you're carrying. And I name it gently. Oh, fear, fear or, you know, anger, anger. I say, show me how big you are. And I can feel the explosion of those emotions as they open. And I give them space. And the interesting thing is when you give space to your experience and it gets bigger and more intense and you let it, it gets bigger and bigger and then it softens because you're not resisting it. Right. And if you do, then it softens and I bring in compassion. And I say, they're there. You know, let me hold all these emotions like I would a crying child, a frightened child. And I say, thank you. Thank you for trying to protect me. I'm okay for now. And I do the same for my mind, all the stories and intensity and so forth. And when I'm finished that, I'm still the same person and there's still the same difficulties we find or something, but I'm somehow clearer and steadier. I've become the witness to it. I become the loving awareness that can see all this and allow it and not be swept away by it. And then I get filled instead with this connection to a place of steadiness. This is courage, really. This is courage to be present for life and be present for those that we talk to and love and the things we care about. And you, are you doing this once a day? Do you do this when you wake up and at night? How often do you all do this together? We don't do it together that much. Usually at the end of the day is when we would do it together. We wake up at different times and we have different rhythms of, like I usually get up a lot earlier than Jack, just by nature. But the main thing is for people to realize to do as many times a day as you can to kind of step back, receive what's happening, not feel like we have to change it or do something about it. And to at that, you know, in that moment to offer some love, to offer some kind of wish for our health and happiness. Like I've been leading this meditation where you go through the whole body and you wish love to the different parts of your body. I mean, my head be happy. I mean, my shoulders relax and be happy. I mean, my neck be happy. It sounds silly, but it actually is positive and strengthening for the immune system. Every time we incline our hearts in a direction of caring instead of terror. And that's a choice that we can make whenever we catch ourselves in the grip of terror. And I think what Jack was saying, you know, about how you would comfort a little child. I mean, that is so much the way our awareness can function when your baby cries. You know, how do you teach a baby how to be with itself and how to be with its own being by holding it through all the things it's going through when a baby cries and freaks out as parents? We don't just like drop them like, ew, we hold them instead. We comfort them and they learn that, oh, there is some steadiness of presence that you can weather the various emotional storms that come, you know, that it's weather. It's like emotional weather. And so there's so many ways and so many teachers offering different mindfulness practices and tools and, you know, right now online, there are so many ways to connect with ourselves in, I think, ways that bring more help and strength to our whole being so that we are more resilient. And that's protective too, not just gloves and masks. And, you know, that's what we do. Oh, wow. Yeah, okay. Both of you, I love this description of scanning, finding some compassion there. And I love the idea of sitting together. It's so funny because I, you know, in my mind, I get that you will air and won't meditate with me. But then I realized I'm not meditating at all. So of course, she's not going to meditate with you because you're not doing it. But I don't, I feel like I'm being somewhat selfish in the sense that I'm asking y'all for therapy for me in my particular situation, which is with a family. I wonder if you could offer something to the people who are completely alone right now or at least alone in the sense that they find themselves in a non-rumored situation, non-relationship situation. They're just in their apartment or homes and they can't really leave safely. They can't date. They're just suddenly find themselves shipwrecked on their own little islands. And I don't, I think if I were in that situation, I would revert into some kind of self-destructive miasmic ooze of catamine and vodka and anything I could get my hands on. So what, what, well, can you offer anything to those folks out there? Yeah, I mean, first of all, you know, some things that are unhealthy, we are going to do when we're alone like that. Whether it's eating the whole bag of corn chips or whether it's hooking up with somebody when we shouldn't or these things will happen from time to time. Right. So to be the first thing I would say is forgive yourself for the stuff you're doing that you know you shouldn't and just forgive yourself. Because until you forgive yourself for that, it's going to be hard to move on to healthier things because the worse you feel about yourself, the more you need those old comforts and it's just becomes a, you know, kind of vicious circle. And then the other thing I would say is you really need to get out of the house. And even if you're wearing a mask, even if you're wearing goggles, even you're, you know, in your hazmat suit, you need to wave to people when you pass them and make sure you say hi or admire their dog. That's what I usually do. And, you know, just have that moment of social connection because your nervous system will register that as a positive thing. And it, it sounds like it's ridiculous and unhelpful, but it's not. It's helpful. And these little moments of connection help. The other thing is the natural world, you know, and, and I'm going to read one more quote, if I might, that I found that I really like from a New York Times writer named Margaret Wrinkle. And she said, the natural world's perfect indifference has always been the best cure for my own anxieties. Every living thing, every bird and mammal and reptile and amphibian, every tree and shrub and flower and moss is pursuing its own urgent life, a purpose and a life that sets my own worries in a much larger context. And the natural world is everywhere. You can find it during a walk on city streets. You can find it in potted plants on balconies. It's in the branches of the sidewalk trees as they begin to split open and change the grayscape green. It's in the sparrows and the starlings taking nesting materials into the cracks around windows and doorways of commercial buildings. It's in the wild geese crying as they fly in a sky full of drifting clouds. The sunshine always returns. So that, I think, when you're alone, it's really actually in some ways more of a chance to deepen your connection to yourself and consider a positive retreat time because you aren't having to homeschool your kids and tolerate and figure out what to do, you know, work at home while the kids, I mean, all those things. My daughter has to go close the door to a closet in her house to have a private conversation right now. Do you know what I mean? Like you can appreciate the peace and the freedom that does come with the aloneness and transform that loneliness into solitude, which can be so nourishing and such an opportunity that in our culture we rarely have with all the technology and connectivity and busyness that we are all experiencing. Right. So it's to acknowledge that yes, it's lonesome and there's a freedom in it that other people might not have. And how can I use that freedom? Okay, that's great. Yeah, and Jack and Tara and I contributed teachings for an at-home retreat for people who might want to structure a home retreat for themselves. Certain meditation retreats are being offered online. You're doing this right now? Well, it's just something you can download and do yourself. But yeah, I'm going to be doing an online retreat in May and other people are doing online retreats that you can tune into, do part of, do as much as you want. You don't have to travel to a meditation center. You don't have to, you know what I mean? You don't have to be in silence all day and all night if that's not the right thing for you. Right. Et cetera. If you have a response to this, I would love to hear it, Jack. I would just move into the next question. I'd love to hear what you have to say. Well, I want to piggyback on what Trudy was just saying. On our websites on insightla.org or Trudy Goodman or jack.com or jackcornfield.com. We've put up a lot of the guided meditations of compassion, of how to work with the body, all kinds of things. How to center yourself and steady the heart. And then some videos that Trudy and Tara Brock and I did together as an example. And I think about people being in solitude or alone. Or even those who are there with someone else but seeking somehow different kinds of connection beside the first step in the connection is actually to be able to connect with yourself. Or that becomes critical how you hold this. But it's also important then to shift and to reach out in other ways. And so I recommend finding a meditation partner or buddy who you can practice with. You have Aaron, of course, but if you're alone and find someone and say, let's practice every morning or let's practice every evening for 10 minutes or 20 minutes. They can be a gratitude partner where you say, well, tell me two things in the day that actually you feel grateful for in spite of everything that's happening. Or you can let's say, let's do that to every day. Do a loving kindness practice in which you breathe in hope and courage. And without breath, you breathe out love to that other person. And then to the people in your neighborhood and the people in the community. You breathe in the courage of all the first responders and all the people caring for one another in the middle of this great difficulty. And you breathe out love for all those who are caring and being cared for. And you start to feel that you are participating in sending that energy across the world. But you don't do it alone. You do it with a partner with someone else and you might do it out loud. And these are just beginning hints of be creative ways to find a different kind of connection out of your solitude. That's more genuine. That's a heart connection in which you can practice together because you support each other. Just like the three of us in this conversation. We're all learning. I'm listening to Trudy and I'm learning things from her. I'm listening to you and I'm learning things. And so we actually hold each other up. It's the best. This is the highlight of my pandemic right now, by the way. And I don't want to end on a diet. You're not learning to cook or something. What kind of compliment is the highlight of my content? That's like a love song. It's a rather severe thing to end up. I do think anyone has something to offer you all do with this. Right now, people are having to deal with the fact that their loved ones are getting sick. And they can't be with them. They can't go to them. Not even just with COVID, with whatever. Because you can't travel right now. It's like, so I cannot imagine. My parents, I've lost both my parents. I can't imagine if they were alive right now. The anxiety I would be experiencing for them. And then if they were to get sick and they were to get put in quarantine like many people are. You know, I've heard of saddest stories. People who are dying. Having to say goodbye to each other with walkie talkies. Or, you know, their phones. Or, you know, recording something just because they can't talk to anybody. And they're being sedated if they're being intubated. So they're gone. They're just gone. So I wonder if what it, we all have this fantasy when our loved ones are going. When the day comes, they got to at least be with them at their bedside. But I just wonder if you have anything you could offer people. That's the physical reality. And it can be heartbreaking. Because you love these people and you want to hold their hand. And you want them to know. And sometimes you can't. Sometimes you can virtually. You can actually talk to them. And I have to say, I have chanted and sung and done prayers out loud for people as they were dying. In a distance, I said, would you hold this phone up to Georgia or whatever her name was. And I would do the Tibetan Book of the Dying that go into the clear light. Or I would do a beautiful chant. Tell her how much her life had meant to me and to everyone. And here's the wild thing. I've also done it with people who were in coma. You know, where they've been like with ventilators, you get put on a deliberately put into coma. As you couldn't tolerate it otherwise. But I've done it with people in coma. And once in a while they come out of their coma. And they say, oh yes, I heard you. I remember. So don't think that we're not connected, Duncan. They might be connected where we can press the flesh, so to speak. And we miss that. Because we're built to have a connection of hand to hand and skin to skin and belly to belly. And all the things that make us human. Yes. But we're connected in a deeper web. In your prayers. In your song. And you would call these people and sing to them. You know, and make your song. And it's time to become the medicine to reimagine in this place. That we can still contribute to a better world to be that lamp in the darkness. Or the music to burst out with love somehow. To be a carrier of hope. Even in your voice, in your song. And if there's a funeral, send them off with a beautiful song. And know that they may still be listening wherever you are. Please hear my song. Please let go into the pure light of your ocean of love. That's who you are. And let me sing you as you go. You know, so don't think that we're not connected because we are. And yes, it's heartbreaking. And death and that loss is always heartbreaking. It just, you know, touches us so deeply. And we have to respond and we can. Beautiful. Thank you. Thank you. I love you too so much. We love you. We love you too. But we didn't get to see your baby. Oh, he's the baby's in this is I'm actually in a studio right now. And I would love for you to see him. I'll Aaron would love to say hi. Do you maybe we can do a FaceTime at some point or just say hello. Yeah, let's do that. I don't know if your listeners would like it, but we also could come back a different time and do some practices with people. I would look any if you all have the time. Another thing that I'm aware we didn't really do today and that can be helpful to people. So please, if you have time that you can offer, I would be so grateful for this. This was the best. This is the best. And it's, I think, I know everyone's gonna love hearing this. And I can't thank you enough for your time. So Duncan, can you take, can you take recorded meditations from our websites or videos and podcasts or things like that? Can you also use them and offer them to the people in the network? I sure can. Any audio you have I could add to the end of this. Please do that. We could send it or you could just look at, you know, our websites and compassion in the time of coronavirus or Trudy has this beautiful body, loving kindness, healing, loving kindness for the body, things like that. So take them. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. And just very quickly, can you please tell everyone where they can find you already set your websites? And I know, Jack, you have this teacher training. Coming up right now. And I wonder if y'all want to... That is also true with Tarah Brock starting in the winter. And the good thing is it's an online teacher training. So we have people in 50 countries from Nairobi and from Pakistan and so forth who are doing this two-year training to become teachers of compassion and mindfulness in their schools or business or community. And you can look at jackhornfield.com for all of this stuff. Two years. It's a two-year training. You get very well trained and we have a whole group of colleagues and mentors and teachers. So you work closely with a small group of other people and mentors and teachers. And then Trudy has all this great stuff, both at Insight LA, insightla.org and on her own website, trudygoodman.com. And we also have a mindfulness facilitator program that's starting in... It was meant to be in person. And as soon as we can, we will return to in person. And that's being done through Insight LA as well. Sorry Trudy, I'm sorry. That's okay. I was going to burst out also on 420. They can see our episode of Midnight Gospel with you and I. That's only two weeks away. Oh, that's so cool. And I was wondering if you would do... If you could turn this into that. Do you know if you can still do that? That was so cool. I'm sure we can. Absolutely. I would hope so. I mean, yeah, you did such a great job. Everyone, Trudy, is on my show and just killed it as a talented actor. Jack, thank you so much. I can't believe I'm going to be part of Krishna. Let's chat again soon. Anytime you'll have time for this, I would love to do this anytime. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I roam and all of that. Bye. See you. Bye. Head over to Insight LA or Jack's website or Trudy's website and get to know them. They are amazing. The links are going to be at dunkatrustle.com.

And in the meantime, I really do think that there are a lot of opportunities for us to, at the very least, get better at drinking. But at the very most, to use this time to expand, to connect, and to hopefully train ourselves so that we are even more prepared the next time some global apocalyptic catastrophe hits us. We've got a lot of great episodes of the DDFH coming up. Dan Harmon is going to be with us next week. And of course, please watch the Midnight Gospel coming in Netflix April 20th. I love you.

Filter just because your eyeballs are melting due to the fact that you exist in the universe where you're rapidly being aerosolized by time. You can fix this problem with a very old invention called glasses. Now here's the problem. Glasses are incredibly expensive. Most of these glasses boutiques that you go to these days are run by reptilian Illuminati shills who want nothing more than to suck as much money out of your sweet, sacred bank account as they possibly can while selling you overpriced doom glasses that make you look like Simon Cowell instead of who you really are. A sophisticated, smart, brilliant person who is not going to be taken in by these asshole eyeglass mongers anymore. They're too expensive. I went to one of these eyeglasses shops. I was immediately attacked by one of these reptilian bastards. They won't even let you look at the glasses without walking over to you, asking if they help you, can help you, tormenting you by trying to make you think that somehow things made out of plastic are worth $700. You can look at the glasses that are being sold at these eyeglass boutiques and no matter how blind you are, you can tell that there's no fucking way that thing costs $700 to make. It's plastic. The material that they're using to build these goddamn eyeglasses out of it, these high-priced eyeglass boutiques being run by demons who want to keep the world completely blind. You could look at this shit and tell right away that it's just, they didn't fall out of a fucking UFO. That wasn't manufactured in some underground government laboratory by Einstein. This is just something some asshole threw together after taking ecstasy for a few days at a fountain rave and I'm supposed to pay $600 for it because it makes me feel fancy. No eyeglasses, mongers at the local malls and boutiques across America. No! Your days of ramming your reptilian fist into our poor, blind assholes have come to an end thanks to Warby Parker. If you go to warbyparker.com you can see that there is an incredible selection of awesome eyeglasses that are better than the eyeglasses that you're going to find at these eyeglass mongers doom prisons. The glasses over there start at $95, not the $600 to $1,000, however much those glasses cost over there is too much. Warby Parker, they start at $95 bucks and it's a really cool, it's a really cool man. There's this entire new business that is emerging on the internet that is not based on trying to as much as possible extract every bit of money that they can possibly can for you while giving you a crap product in exchange for it. It's a new idea, it's a crazy idea, which is that people actually give you something that is of value and amazing for what it's worth, not a million times more than what it's worth. Warby Parker, it's one of the, it's like the uber of eyeglass companies. Here's what happens, you go to warbyparker.com, you're blind, face it. You don't need to be, here's the first thing is face that you're blind, number one, you're blind. The world's blurry right now for you, just deal with it, okay? You're disintegrating. Part of the disintegration process of your eyeballs don't work as well. Maybe you're, you're born with wonky eyes. I, I wasn't, but I spend so much time with my eyeballs trained on my fucking cell phone, like little meaty magnets stuck on that awful attention sucker of my phone that my eyes have disintegrated and now I have to wear glasses. So number one, admit that you need glasses. Number two, go to warbyparker.com, check out these awesome glasses. They use premium Japanese titanium non-rocking screws. They're anti-reflective, I don't even know what that means, but it's badass. They're anti-reflective. Who wants to use a goddamn rocking screw? You want a rocking screw in your fucking glasses? Then go to one of these shit boutiques and give money to the reptilians. You're just going to send it directly to the military industrial complex to be used as a bomb to be dropped on children. That's guaranteed. You don't want a rocking screw. You want a French non-rocking screw. They're anti-reflective. They have anti-glare coating and they include a hard case and a cleaning cloth. Here's what happens. They have something called a home try-on program, which is that you go to warbyparker.com. You can order five pairs of glasses. They ship the glasses directly to you. You can try them on in the comfort of your own home. That's very important because when you're trying on glasses at a store, when you're trying on clothes at a store, it's an innately existentially embarrassing situation because you're forced to do your hidden poses in front of other people. Whereas if you get these glasses, you can be alone. You can look at the mirror yourself in the mirror and get all the angles, all the angles. See what you look like from all the hidden secret angles and your secret poses and find out if these glasses work for you. They send you a prepaid return shipping label. You send them all back, place an order for your prescription glasses and you'll get glasses in your hands within 10 business days. Often they come faster than that. For every pair of glasses they sell, they give a pair of glasses to a poor blind person. That's way better than down at the country club where you were thinking about going where that asshole whose skin is soaked in stem cells and overpriced perfume made out of baby whales is going to rip you off and send you back into the street with maybe better vision but a broken heart. Warby Parker will not break your heart or your wallet. They're going to send some really cool glasses to you. You're going to try them on in front of your, you can have a party, invite all your friends and your family over, invite your probation officer over and you can try these on. You know in the old days if you had one of those probation bans on your legs, forget it if you were going to get glasses, you're doomed. If you're somebody who's under house arrest, Julian Assange, if you're listening to this, you can get your glasses refilled without having to go to a store. It's warbyparker.com. Glasses are important. They make you, a nice pair of glasses will make you look cooler than you do without them on. I love my glasses. I don't wear them all the time and to be honest I lost them about a month ago so I've got to go back to Warby Parker and get some glasses but for the brief amount of time that I do have glasses and I get to exist in a universe where I'm no longer blind as somebody who is living too close to Chernobyl, it's a beautiful universe. It really is. If you've been, if you're one of those people like me who's been avoiding glasses for a while, it's pretty nice to suddenly see letters clearly. It's pretty awesome. You get glasses starting at $95 including the lenses. They also have reading glasses, sunglasses and you can find out everything you need to find out about Warby Parker simply by going to warbyparker.com forward slash family hour. Go there, buy some of their glasses, try it out. I give them a full endorsement. They create really awesome beautiful glasses and they're disrupting a market and that's pretty awesome to me. So don't be blind anymore. You don't need to be broke. If you've been putting off beginning glasses because you feel like you can't afford them, put it off no longer. It's very simple. Within a few days you can be trying on glasses and a few days more you can be no longer blind and have some extra money that you can spend on acid or massages or I don't know incense cones, whatever it is that you want. Spend that extra glass money on incense cones. Go to warbyparker.com forward slash family hour and try them out. Support them. They support this podcast. Okay, let's get going. Didactic spirituality alert. Didactic spirituality alert. I'm about to talk about the present moment and meditation for about 20 minutes. If you don't want to listen to that kind of nonsense, yeah, from a crystal gazing stone or hippie, jump ahead 20 minutes right into the interview and you can listen to me talk about the same kind of stuff with an artist. Hello, my dear sweet children of the night. It is I, Duncan Trussell, and you are listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast returning from a brief holiday hiatus where I allowed myself to sink into a miasmic ooze of entropic nothingness, just laying in bed, watching movies, playing video games, playing Hearthstone, drinking too much, sucking back unholy amounts of hash tincture and generally just allowing myself to slide into a low level state of pure laziness. So my apologies to you. I think it's good to do those things from time to time to allow yourself, if you can, to disregard all responsibilities, to be as irresponsible as you possibly can without wrecking or destroying your entire life. If you can pull it off, you should do it. This is something that Charles Bukowski talked about. I'll just play it for you. I have periods where, you know, I feel a little weak or deep for after. Fuck it, the Wheaties aren't going down right. I just go to bed for three days and four nights, pull down all the shades and just go to bed, get up, shit, just drink a beer down there and go back to bed. I come out of that completely re-enlightened for two or three months. I get power from that. I think someday, I'll say, this psychotic guy knew something that, you know, in days of head of medicine and how to figure these things out, everybody should go to bed now and then when they're down low and just give it up for three or four days, then they'll come back good for a while. But we're so obsessed with it. We have to get up and do it, go back to sleep. In fact, there's a woman I'm living with now gets around 12, 30, 1 p.m. I say, I'm sleepy. I want to go to sleep. She says, what? You want to go to sleep? It's only 1 p.m. We're not even drinking, you know. Hell, there's nothing else to do but sleep. People are nailed to the processes. Up, down, do something. Get up, do something, go to sleep. Get up. They can't get out of that circle. You'll see someday they'll say, but Towsky knew. Lay down for three or four days to get your juices back, then get up, look around and do it. But who the hell can do it because you need a dollar? That's all. That's a long speech, isn't it? But it means something. Let that ping-pong around in your head as you're tormenting yourself with whatever your New Year's resolutions happen to be. By the way, I'm not anti-New Year's resolutions. I've got some myself. I want to get in better shape. I want to discipline myself more. I want to meditate every day. I want to blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I have all these want-us, you know. This is something Rom-Docs calls should all over yourself. I should be doing this. I should be doing that. But it's really funny. You get in a conversation with a friend about New Year's resolutions and they will start talking about all the stuff that they're going to do. That's what a New Year's resolution is. It's like, I'm going to do this. It's never I'm doing this right now. It's always like, well, I'm going to start working out. I'm going to stop drinking as much. I'm going to quit smoking. I'm going to be nicer to people. I'm going to do all this shit. What ends up happening with all these things that you're going to do is that you completely avoid what you're doing right now, which is the exact pattern that got you into drinking or got you into smoking or got you into whatever the specific little pit that you happen to be trapped in that you're dreaming of getting out of. This is the idea that a broken machine cannot fix itself using the same process that broke it in the first place. It's a wild idea that if you're trying to make yourself a better person, then the very idea that you are not a good person now and in the future will be a better person is the idea that caused all of your problems in the first place. The very idea of a New Year's resolution can be rather satanic in the sense that you sort of come up with this idea of how you're going to be. You imagine this perfect version of yourself and then you spend the next several weeks or months galloping in the direction of this future version of yourself while completely negating, neglecting and ignoring the being that you are now. It's the worst kind of sacrifice. It's like here is this poor version of yourself right now as you are the person who's sitting there listening to this podcast. Maybe you're washing your dog right now or snorting rails of crystal meth or you're probably, I know a lot of athletes listen to this podcast so more than likely you're probably training for football or practicing basketball. I know a lot of professional basketball players are really into this podcast. You're probably getting ready for a big game coming up or maybe you're a senator or a congressman but the point is that that you that you are right now is the you. That's the most important you and I think what Bakowski is talking about there is just spending some time with yourself acknowledging the fact that this ridiculous self-crucifixion that we've done where we've nailed ourselves to this terrible modern pattern of existence which is a relatively brand new thing in the course of the human existence on this planet, the insane flurry of activity that we call being having a career or being successful or having dreams and all that shit. It's just something that got that projectile vomited all over us by Henry Ford. This nonsense idea of the five-day work week and the eight-hour day and all that shit. That's not real. That's something a human made up but a lot of people think that that's like just the way humans have always been like way back in the primordial past that ancient humans woke up before the sun came up and spent eight hours doing some repetitive pattern to get symbolic items that they could then use to that they hoarded away in in holes and then eventually when they were ready they would dig those symbolic items out and give it to a person so that they could inhabit a bigger cave. That's nonsense. It never worked like that. This is a brand new thing. Sons of bitches have got slave drums in your head. You've got one of those Viking slave drummers or one of those slave ship drummers just sitting somewhere in the back of your head just pounding away. The rhythm of your life. Wake up in the morning, make the coffee, walk the dogs, feed the kids, go to work, come back and drink and go to sleep. Whatever it is. That thing. Just in a fucking hurry all the goddamn time you know. We ever realize you're in a hurry and there's nothing that you have to be rushing for and then you just kind of realize like oh shit I'm mostly always in a hurry which is called leaning into the future. You're always kind of leaning into the future. You're always leaning towards this future version of yourself to try to stay out of the present moment. Oh I gotta get this done. Oh fuck I gotta get this done. What are you doing? Like I've found myself indexing a mirror in my house in a hurry. Like oh shit I gotta fucking let me just get this fucking mirror clean off real quick. Why am I rushing this? Like what's waiting for me after I've indexed the mirror? Or like dishes? You know you ever find yourself in a hurry to finish the dishes? Like you're in hell? Like washing the, like you're up to your fucking neck and molten tar? I gotta get these fucking dishes done. Get these dishes done because after the dishes I don't know what I'm gonna do. That thing. I love what Bukowski's saying because it's asking you to give a middle fucking, give your middle finger to that fucking stupid idea. Oh you know you can't just take a bed vacation. If you want to take a vacation from work you're gonna, you're supposed to have a place that you're going right? That's the idea. If you take a vacation you go to some other place. When you're at that other place you fill up the days with some kind of activity and then at the end of the vacation you're supposed to be all relaxed as opposed to what Bukowski's talking about which is like a free base level vacation. It's like forget going somewhere else. You're not gonna be, if you go somewhere else that's fine but you're still, you're still going, you're still gonna be you. The idea is spend some time completely in a state of complete rest. Unnail yourself from the ridiculous crucifix of your career. Just for a few days. Spend some time just laying in bed and farting and drinking beers every once in a while and then see what happens. Take some real guts to do that. Real guts. That is not recommended. You're not gonna hear that on a fucking Tony Robbins CD set. He's not gonna say I gained this great wealth and success in my private helicopter and skyscrapers and a harem or a unicorn farm or whatever Tony Robbins has by sleeping for three days straight. Four days straight. I don't know maybe he does say that. He does have some great advice. I'm not asking, I'm not saying that you should just like give up the dance of modern society but take a seat on the bench from time to time. That's all. Give yourself a break. Lay in bed for three days and then come up with your New Year's resolution. Don't let your New Year's resolutions just be another part of this fever like delirium that comes from existing in a society, a materialistic society that has completely disregarded the idea of the present moment which by the way is the most bliss-filled ecstatic place you can possibly be and which in general cannot be sweetened by the artificial sweetener that we call money or success. It's really kind of amazing if you just spend a little bit of time meditating every day. That's a stupid word. It's a boring sounding word. I wish there was a better word for it because when you hear it it just is like that's an anal clincher. That'll make you like squeeze your butt cheeks shut and shut your ears down because it really does sound horrifyingly boring, meditating but that's not what meditation is. It's really not. It's one of the most psychedelic things that you could do because it allows you to apply the microscope of your attention to the present moment to your breath and to the workings of your body and the way your body feels and then somewhere in that process you realize that you really are existing in a world of such immediate sense gratification that it is so incredibly overwhelming that you have gotten into a pattern of doing everything you can to avoid the experience that Terence McKenna, well Terence McKenna described DMT as being a niagraous of epiphanous beauty or maybe he was talking about mushrooms. The experience of being on DMT or mushrooms a niagraous of epiphanous beauty but you know just sitting still and feeling your body for some certain period of time you begin to realize that that niagraous of epiphanous beauty is in fact the essential state of the present moment that we are somehow situated in this out rushing a flow of experience that the universe is having that is so incredibly beautiful and exhilarating and sweet that we try to avoid it. It's too much to handle so the idea is we escape into pain. We're always in this state of trying to escape from nirvanic bliss into agony into pain somehow it's easier to be in an awful life completely numbed out and feeling like shit and tired and bored and you know everything that's gonna happen you've figured out the whole world you know where things are going you know why things happen the way they do you understand every fucking thing that awful state of knowing everything you know or you know everything i've heard this a million times before i know what it means i know i know what happens when i meet somebody i know they're gonna go away i know what happens when this kind of guy comes around that kind of guy comes around and no happens when this means that thing you've mapped out you think you've mapped out the terrain that you're on which is what it's the worst but somehow that state of pure absolute future oriented stagnation is preferable to the truth of reality which is that you are this kind of ever expanding exponentially increasing orgasm of consciousness that for no reason at all appears to be emanating from nothingness it's like better to not be there you know it's something about that is just wrong like if you just spend a little bit of time and just sitting still for a little while meditating is the wrong word for it they should call like bliss fishing or something something else like a form of hunting fractal surfing i don't know what the name for it is but if you just spend a little bit of time you don't have to be high and that is that idea is just a real that's infuriating for a lot of psychonauts they don't want to hear that fucking shit terence mckenna seemed to have a little bit of problem a little bit of he didn't trust the idea that meditation could lead to like supremely psychedelic states because he'd been on you know deep doses of mushrooms and experience that version of consciousness and couldn't imagine how sitting still could produce that same kind of experience well he was right in the same way that if you sit still for a little while you're not going to suddenly be watching a fucking i max movie that's for sure you're not going to teleport into an i max theater if you if you just sit still and breathe for a little while but what will happen if you just sit still and breathe for a little while is is suddenly you will become acquainted with a version of the universe that you will more than likely immediately associate with the universe that you remember from being a child and i'll take that experience over being attacked by interdimensional elves or watching impossible shapes form in the midst of nothingness or being overwhelmed by the incredible fractal flow of existence that seems to exist in the bardo that you enter into on dmt or mushrooms or a psychedelic any day that's i mean i'm 40 right i've been to that those dimensions many many times and i will return to them don't get me wrong but uh it's a it's an incredible thing when you begin to realize that you are sitting on top of or inside of a basically a bliss chamber this on rush of loves pounding against you at all times and you're in this weird bizarre fight to punch that shit back to push it away and that the all of society the whole pattern of society seems built on turning your back to this truth and to creating the illusion that if you make this much money you'll experience bliss that's the weird thing about the present moment is it seems to be the antithesis of all notions of success through hard work or success through having something it seems to be this kind of weird form of communism that if everyone suddenly realized that just sitting still for a few minutes a day will create a state of happiness that the a busy billionaire could never come close to experiencing that a society would collapse but the start of that you got to have guts like bakowski did that genius alcoholic saint he just leapt into the emptiness for three three or four days courageously courageous slacking i think that's what uh maybe that's what meditation should be called from now on courageous slacking just forget the whole idea of getting a spiritual practice and adopt that a new idea that you're going to become a courageous slacker that you're courageously going to not do anything for extended periods of time each day that's way that sounds way better than meditating that would definitely get me into it way faster than idea of meditating fuck that crystal gazer shut up about your goddamn meditation practice you asshole i'm into it right now sorry if this is what i've been yapping about so much but it's where my mind's going if i was talking about something else i'd be being dishonest even though when i talk about this i feel like i'm being dishonest because i honestly don't know too much about it but it is where my mind is landing at this very moment so forgive me those of you out there who wish that i was doing more like comedy centric or whatever

thanks dunkin not really this is a really great honor um i've just been i've been thinking about this a lot as it's coming up you know talking to you but but it's really cool like the just the the kind of thing that you guys are setting up you know you obviously with joe rogan and a bunch of other people like just feel like you guys are really kind of weaving a tapestry of really interesting kind of inquiry and ideas right now you know um because i'm thinking i'm just sort of the the variety of the kind of guests that you've had on here too and it's just such a such a great honor to to kind of contribute to that too this is awesome oh cool man it's you know it's awesome to have you on i uh i am really fascinated with your art and um i have one of your pictures uh in my living room so every day when i walk in i see it and uh there's something in your how would you describe your art well um so yeah i just came out with a book babble um i think i think i sent you a copy of it as well but uh it sort of summarizes what my art i guess is about um because that the title kind of speaks to which is that a lot of my work deals with um it's it's allegorical takes on confusion like the kind of confusion that we're seeing in the world um and also with ourselves you know in a sense i uh i think of a lot of my work is kind of these weird self portraits um in that through them i'm trying to meditate on the on the status of where we're at um because i feel like art throughout time you know whatever form it takes whether it's music or dance or plays or you know nowadays film and and certainly paintings it's they're kind of ruminations on the the kind of time that they're being created in um and in that sense i feel like what i'm trying to do through my work is is look at the world that that's unfolding around me in the time that i'm living through and i'm kind of trying to make sense of it but what i'm what i'm running up against all the time when i'm kind of dealing with new series of work or individual paintings is is that we're you know there's that old chinese curse i don't know if you've heard it but it's uh may you live in interesting times yes and and you know that's something that i kind of come up against a lot with my work is that i'm i'm looking at all the kind of shit that we're dealing with as a species and our confusion with the world that we belong to um and somehow we've created especially in the west we've created this kind of wedge between us and the world that we actually live in and enhance a lot of the work that i'm doing has has to do with with environmental um degradation or or at the very least just the the the settings that i place these animals in or these allegories in are set by human hands you know there's some we have some collective part to play in what what the stages on which these animals kind of are playing out the scenes that i want them to play out um and and you know uh so with that title babble you know why i thought it was fitting to kind of summarize the work from the past five years that i've been doing into that one volume was uh you know you've probably heard that um have you heard that old uh biblical story about the tower babble yep yeah so the idea there you know to anyone who's listening who hasn't heard it's uh the idea being that you know at one point in time uh mankind was all united as one cohesive balance species in the sense that they they could all communicate amongst each other and what they ended up doing was they started building uh the tower babble you know and and the idea behind it would be to kind of stand as a as a testament to to human progress and human ingenuity to the point of acting as a kind of stairway up to heaven right um now you know the loon loon god as you call sitting up there and he's he's he doesn't like this at all you know he doesn't like this idea that mankind could be so um so arrogant so what he does is he curses the the workers with with different languages so what we end up with is all of a sudden the workers can't understand one another and the tower falls to ruin because of that and then that you know all mankind scatters upon the earth and and while that story is kind of you know it's supposed to explain why you find people all over the world how i read it and what i'm seeing a lot of parallels with in in terms of where we're at in the modern world is um is that it's just we just don't understand one another you know like it's it's we don't understand one another because we've left we've walked so far from the proverbial garden as it were you know like uh and that's why when i think of of what i kind of try and tackle with a lot of the work that i'm doing is is kind of just going after that is looking at different ways in which maybe we've departed from some origin source uh and that source you know it's it's hard to define what that would be but i feel like like there's just so much there's just so much miscommunication happening in the world that uh it's just a fascinating thing to try and kind of distill into my own paintings um and in the way i you know the way i kind of approach my work too is i like to approach it by series and it's kind of like i guess you know some uh comparison could be made to maybe some you know musician making a record where in my case you know every individual painting um serves as kind of a facet of a larger idea um and when it comes to art shows and that kind of thing it's it's usually the way approach is i'll take a i'll take it an idea or a theme and then all the paintings kind of play they're almost different sides of that theme done in the way that i do my paintings right um so so you know like through if i look back at like the past uh five or six years that i've been doing solo shows and stuff like each of the shows kind of take on some kind of perhaps like some kind of social issue that that is just troubling me you know like because i think when i think of myself as uh an individual i just don't think i have an interesting enough personal story to try and you know there's a lot of people who whose theme is themselves you know there's a lot of people who through the art do some kind of meditation on who they themselves are or their place in society but in my case you know i'm more i'm more interested i'm much more interested than my own personal story i'm more interested in you know what what's the world itself that i live in so um you know one of the shows for instance just uh thing of 2011 just a few years ago i was i did the whole show was called the passions and and in it i was um i was going after the idea of blind faith and what what uh role that has to play in the 21st century because it was at a time you know when a lot of stuff has been flaring up about differing faiths just not being able to get along and and you know at the time i was reading um a lot of hitchhens and docums and uh sam hares wrote the book end of faith that i thought was really interesting too and in a way like i i just thought like in what way could i maybe kind of try and contribute to that dialogue so what i ended up you know my solution to that was that i um i ended up looking at old classical pieces that featured martyrs martyrs or saints right yes and in my own work what i because uh you know to anyone listening if they haven't seen the work yet it's it's all animal allegories like i'm not using any human beings in the in the work um and i can get to that later as to why that is but um but in that in that particular show you know what i what i was interested in doing is taking these classical uh you know these classical forms of martyr paintings or sculptures such as michael angelo did the pieta piece which is uh you know mother mary's holding a dead jesus and it's it's uh at the saint peter's basilica on the vatican and and i did a painting version of that like it took the same composition but turned it into this this painting and there are other instances too where do you know do you remember um or have you ever come across saint sebastian he features a lot of paintings like a lot of painters can you describe him to me because i'm definitely familiar with the name yeah yeah so saint saint sebastian he see what's funny is i and a lot of other people you know i don't know what he actually did as a saint but but how he's always portrayed is in the moment of his death or is at his greatest agony is he's shot full of arrows like that okay sure i'm looking at i just google imaged pictures of him so yeah i've seen you know i've seen this image before but i didn't know it was saint sebastian yeah but it's what's funny so so it's uh like it's just funny that like we we've seen many many probably hundreds of different incarnations of that that martyr you know like like painters certainly turns him because it's a it's an interesting image but it's it says something about how the you know since the west has regarded the idea of being righteous or being faithful or whatnot is that your greatest sacrifice is either the sacrifice or yourself or the sacrifice of others you know if you think of a martyr a martyr has has never died peacefully in his sleep you know it's there's always got to be a yeah sure some type of great violence that's thrown out dogs made to eat rocks and pushed into they it's like old school crazy tortures that the the isis is kind of resurrecting right now well yeah exactly that it's like this this exactly like you know if you say like biblical torture well it's like you think of like like horrendous acts and horrendous sacrifice you know and uh and so so that whole show was kind of like a rumination on that so what i did a lot of the paintings in that show featured animals with their heads on fire you know and uh yeah and of course you know like that the initial response i had funny criticisms after that show online i saw some people like talking about how i'm discussing animal cruelty here and stuff but but actually that wasn't at all what i'm going for in in using that symbolism i was i was trying to speak to the halo you know the halo being something that we we see in many different cultures but especially in the in the christian um in the christian kind of visual imagery that we see it's the halo's ring that it's a ring around the head and it's supposed to be light emanating from the inside suggesting someone's holiness but what i wanted to kind of suggest via that bit of symbolism was that you know just straight just straight up blind faith like that is very destructive you know because it's very it's it's a very divisive way of looking at the world where you have you know your faith somehow must be uh pitted up against somebody else's and you're willing to sacrifice not only your for your own life but in the case if you know a lot of these jihadist attacks you're willing to sacrifice the lives of others just uphold some idea you know at the end of the day it's just an idea and and hitches and dockings and sam harris but sam harris i think the most eloquently because he he doesn't go in such black and white um they would say that these are bad ideas you know and they're bad ideas to be carried into a world where we're all getting much more connected you mean the idea of uh sacrificing yourself for other people or the idea of violence in relation to that well both that too but also the idea at the heart of it itself which is that i have a certain set of beliefs that are the right ones and you happen to have ones that if they don't line up with mine they are not only wrong but should be snuffed out you know um and then yeah right this is the kind of like where you get into the interesting uh uh religious organism that is humanity where there's this constant weird battle between uh like white blood cells will try to devour what they consider to be intruders and this has been going on forever it's really funny to watch religions try to eat each other up um at that at one level of the thing there is that amazing interplay that happens where the you know and we see it now you know like uh they the in islam uh isis they they you have to convert when they come into these places you have to convert and if you're a christian they apparently now all this being said there's always this um paranoid conspiracy theorist alex jones level man that lives in my head who whenever i start saying this stuff is like that's government propaganda you don't even know what's happening out there like george orwell ship but just for the sake of of having to believe something it does appear that these they're these fascists out there devouring uh other religions or using religion as a transmission device for aggression and as a sort of paint job that they're putting on the classic um bulldozer of tyranny or fascism or something you know but yeah but you know it's a great coat of paint you know because it's like if you want to take over something right if you want to if you want to use religion for power which is what it sounds like you're talking about uh or part of what you're talking about if you want to if you want power by itself you that you really will seem maniacal and diabolical if you know like anyone who's like i just want power i want to go to other places and take what they have from them to make myself more powerful you can't you can't say that it's got to be like those people over there are you know outcast centers and we have to purify that land yeah and it's the fact that it's all steeped in such old dogma i mean that that's that's what i'm sort of most fascinated by too is just the sort of the persistence of these memes like these that these idea structures that somehow inform how people will live in perpetuity i mean because if you think about like like religions as they are you know i'm just talking about the the abrahamic that's three that yeah of the crazies you know where whereas like the the the more those grow when you think of like because they keep saying the fastest growing religion all this other stuff it's it's it's a little disheartening because you think that by that what is basically said is that that this crazy idea this virus of an idea persists keeps persisting and not only persisting but just but keeps growing right and and and the problem there that i see is that it's it's just simply it's mutually exclusive with the with the ideas set forth by let's say the two other ones that are up there too but it's so at the end of the day what we're kind of just faced with is these these stalemates i mean it's never gonna there's never gonna be a day where you know if you follow any of those ideologies like that one day they'll just be like listen guys like you know we're we all we're all kind of like speaking about the same thing here is just that we we're just using different language it's not really that i mean there's there's clear clearly set rules and in essentially all the the larger religion saying that no there's really just one way out there's one chosen people there's there's in everybody it's not only enemy but but should be you know should be either converted or slain i mean this is the ancient way that the text kind unfold but but some people such as ices i mean they're they're they're actually full on believing this and this is something that like well yeah but we do it too i mean it's important to remember that the united states does it too it's just the religion of the united states is is the is the is exactly the same as the emperor of the united states it it figured out in the united states we figured out a way to have her like in the united states we figured out one thing which is here's how you have an empire without uh calling it an empire and then the other thing that we figured out is here's how you have a religion without calling it a religion because uh there were you know our religion is one of buying shit and denial that's a very popular religion and uh you know what i mean so it's like it's just a funny i i'm sorry to cut you off it's just a funny way that um in the east people are using religion to rationalize the exact same war patterns of humanity for countless aeons and uh um in in the west where the what we use to rationalize it is the same kind of hogwash only we call it freedom right right it's freedom that we're doing this for over there they say it's a la we're doing this for and somewhere else they might say that it's you know heritage our heritage but it's all these really what it all boils down to is you're doing it because you like getting stuff that's why you like power well what you want so the idea being that it's it's what you want is you want your tribe to take the other tribes uh fruit you know you just want their spoiled and at the end of the day like that's that's something that obviously is has been going on time immemorial like you know way before history too is that you know one tribe put it against another and and but but you know cash around something like nationalism patriotism whatever the hell that means at this point and religion you know it all it is is somebody belonging under one flag you know under one banner you're part of that tribe and all other tribes are somehow uh your adversary you know and and and when you when you're putting it into fairy tale language such as religion you know it's it's uh whoever said I can't remember but I'm aping kind of what or parroting like uh what Sam Harris wrote into faith which is that you know uh all it takes for a good person to behave badly to behave with evil intent is all you need is religion because what you're what you've convinced this person of is that they're actually acting in in accordance to their um to their faith you know like you're you're behaving in a way that is deemed righteous by your tribe but but objectively speaking what you're doing is is very well could be construed as being evil you know and that's that's where it gets really strange is where with with these with these religious wars and the shit that are going on is that you know it's not there is no tackling villain sitting at the at the at the helm of these religions you know like they all believe that they're they're standing for for the good well they're yeah they're using a trick of the mind to try to rationalize uh their greed and this trick of the mind using this trick of the mind is an it's an evolving trick an old way you would trick your mind into thinking it was okay to rip off somebody to rob someone to kill a bunch of people rape a bunch of women right as you would uh you would you create an imaginary man who is the right man compared to the other people's imaginary men it's just like you know really hardcore what games of make believe going on here like the most intense game of make believe at the worst slumber party of all time is what you're talking about uh but but it's it's really important to uh not that you can go ahead and point the finger it whatever you want you know and the atheists the uh these these these professional atheists uh which is an interesting new thing that's emerged they will um they point the finger at religion and quite often it seems and that they somehow miss uh the the fact that um more than likely they're using a phone that was built by slaves living in a country where a percentage of everything they make is used to construct bombs that are dropped on children and so it's like the the that it's important to identify that there is another religion the religion of denial that many many of us are uh devotees of and uh what because it's like it's not religion is just one of the fruits or or rather I would say humans using religion to rationalize destruction humans using an ancient text to rationalize destruction we're I think there's a deeper motivation here man a deeper problem a deeper deeper problem um you know what I mean which is which is uh fundamentally the human tendency to create an us or them situation yeah exactly and that's the that's the whole thing that exists as you said also like with with the idea of empire you know like um because it's it's funny so I live in New York City right and uh you know the the greatest landmark here at least for a long time has been the empire state building right yeah so so just the the the term empire like the way that it's shifted when just generally the the mindset of people living in a place like like New York City like empire this me at this point in the 21st century as opposed to when it was built just has a different connotation through it it you know you had um so what I'll do okay it's all a fast track so I had a show in 2012 that was actually called empire and um the the kind of premise for that show was was going after this idea of what does empire mean in the contemporary context because um back when they built the empire state building for instance like if you remember there's a very well known photograph of all these construction workers sitting on a on one of the girders you know and and back then they're looking at this and going you know yes we're building this great empire you know it's it's but empire means you know at the end of the day it's about conquest it's about dominion it's about uh being all powerful and almighty but um you know fast forward to 2012 when I had that show and that's when ox by wall street was happening and the idea of empire especially the fact that it would have had its roots on uh on wall street in New York City what does empire mean now you know when when empire at this point means there's these the these just these monoliths up above these money monoliths that dictate so much of what goes on and rope so many people into their own agendas um where the people themselves their voices have to be heard on sort of a grassroots level but but you know so many people I've run into here or in LA or whatever like wherever I come across people you know my age group or younger like very often people are just thinking like what you know we don't we don't want to operate in that way anymore you know we're seeing we're seeing much more of a sort of like a global tribe emerging because of the aid of the internet and stuff it's no longer our country having said borders and you know anyone who doesn't belong within those borders just doesn't have the same rights as us for instance and what that's all the all those kind of problems that arise when you think of there there being that kind of tribalism in effect just by living in a particular country too you know what I mean oh yes yeah I that's I mean I think that is the uh that is all that is a big part a big uh emerging form that's happening is that people are waking up to the ridiculous nature of the conditioning uh and it's super cool to what I mean it's super cool to watch because you you can you start thinking forbidden ideas like there is no united states really it's it's just a landmass and that's a forbidden idea like I you just think about an idea that if you were sitting around a group of like right-wing republican militarists like the things that you could say that would really offend them like I was just watching uh fucking uh one of these war movies it's the new uncoring all by the same guy who did Restrepo and one thing you always hear soldiers say again and again and again is it has nothing to do it never goes farther than the person on my right and the person on my left who I'm trying to save right and that of course is like one of the primary conditioning thought patterns placed in their brains when they go to boot camp right that's like when you're doing the brainwashing you insert into their mind listen man don't think about why you're here in afghanistan don't think about that it seems to be more to do with some kind of like corporate interest in rare earth metals or some deep politics that you'll never understand therefore making every single thing that you do in some way meaningless just think about the fact that you need to protect the people on the left and the right don't think about this shit don't think about it yeah don't think about you know why and perhaps the very question like why the fuck am I here in the first place because then you start thinking that right you start thinking that stuff as a soldier and some kind of weird contract with the united states government you start thinking like holy fucking shit man i'm in the goddamn i'm just a pawn in the military industrial complex and all this shit is just designed to make money for rafion and haliburton and fucking cheney and cheney's friends and i don't even know what i'm fucking do what am i even doing this shit for there's where are the nazis that i'm supposed to be killing like where's the where's the actual villain here because it's yes it was something um i did a painting on that um it was called harvest where i came across these photos where um they're they're all over the internet and people have seen them all over the place but uh there's a you know a u.s soldier guarding an opium field in afghanistan or you know somewhere i think it was in afghanistan retens the picture immediately brings some on it's like wait a minute wait what what like what are the what exactly is is he doing there you know like who's who's hiring that guy to guard that field and there too it's like the the uh revenue that's coming in from a place like afghanistan at this point it's what what is what is exactly the purpose of us being there is what i'm saying is that there's just a sort of confusion on a mass scale as far as the people who first of all didn't vote to have this happen in the first place but then guys being sent out there and this is these are the kind of jobs that they end up doing and yeah well and generally these guys who are out there pretty fucking awesome i've met many of them in the the the 100 of the time and i have no doubt that there's assholes out there or festering piles of human shit i'm sure it's in every every facet of life but whenever i've met these guys quite often they're really sweet and then that that makes it all the more sinister because because it's like oh they're trying to it seems as though they're trying to uh get some of the best people in the country out of the country and when they're out of the country they're trying to make them do horrible things so that when they come back to the country they'll have uh awful depression and ptsd and will no longer be functional if there ever were the vague possibility of some form of revolution yeah absolutely yeah yeah um actually that's it's a funny segue but there's a it's one thing that i'm really into well i have been for a while but now i actually have an opportunity to explore it with my work is uh the upcoming shows that i'm doing in the next year and the the year after that have to do with um with shamanism okay so um uh the the thing that i find really interesting is what's happening in psychedelic research that's coming out so uh with mdma assisted psychotherapy for instance like um uh it it's clear like finally there's just some something happening where you know a lot of these guys who are coming back with terrible ptsd they have had no they've had no nothing to turn to they really like they're the the amount of soldiers that are getting fucked up by just involvement in these wars you know they a lot of them are coming back terribly damaged psychologically damaged you know and and there hasn't been a solution presented that actually offered any kind of real help any kind of real introspective um work on oneself uh and along comes you know like what maps is doing for instance it's it's hugely commendable they're actually offering something that that through mdma assisted psychotherapy is actually showing great results and then that spins off into many of the other ones such as you know with psilocybin and it with ayahuasca and other things like these like these are these are you know great sense archaic to use sort of like a tern's mechanic term like archaic tools we've had to heal ourselves you know to heal our spirit if you want to call it that or whatnot and they're coming at a time when these solutions need to be looked at and and what why i'm bringing it up in uh connection with the with the with you know the soldiers coming back with ptsd is that through the efforts of maps they're actually you know in the past year i think that they really started being able to um have the government look at these medicines or especially you know with mdma as something that soldiers could really benefit from so the fact that that there's in many many different ways i mean that the research is no longer sort of mired in any kind of of the stigma that followed it um after the 60s like it's such an interesting time we're going through right now because these things are basically coming from the jungle and from the shamanic mindset all right they're they're coming into the contemporary world at a time when i think we might possibly need it most ever you know well yeah i mean yes i think it is i think that time that time that we need it most is any time you find yourself embodied in the human form in any time period in history is when uh you need it most because it's you know because this when i see saint sebastian uh with the arrows piercing him what i think is yeah on one level it's like i don't know it's uh some kind of fan guy was such an annoying fanatic that they shot arrows into him he bothered them that on one level it's that but then i think oh you know these people painting this they weren't there are artists you know a lot of them were like connected to the great creative flow of things in the universe but they were in a time period that was quite repressive and when i look at that stuff i think to myself oh saint sebastian that's every human being and those arrows are the the wounds of a lifetime that are that go in deep into ourselves and you don't have to be in a war zone to get ptsd uh you can get a another form of ptsd just from existing in uh this dimension and that form of ptsd manifests in by having a attachment to your personality and you know what i'm saying and and and those fucking so so man it's it's like whenever i get too far out into into the land of the uh great tendrils of corporations slowly strangling the life out of the planet or con digitizing it almost just converting everything into an inorganic highly restructurable form to be utilized by invisible wealthy people as they pursue deeper and deeper levels of sense gratification when i get too far out into that land or what i like to call curled up in the fetal position in my bed on mushrooms because i thought three wrong thoughts in a row and it'll lead to there i like to bring it back to what is the afghanistan inside of me where the fuck am i as far as being in the moment here here in this moment where am i in in what is my predominant feeling state you know like your your art reflects the state of the world and it reflects it in such a poignant and beautiful way because somehow you have managed to depict these terrible convergences this kind of like tendency to of society or life to domesticate these beautiful things to shave them down and a lot of a lot of your images show beings in states of varying states of the and animals are so innocent you know so you're using these so these innocent man it's just you can't look at a pelican and think god that pelican deserves to be filled with rusty shit from the it's been eating you just feel the sorrow for the thing you know instant empathy your imagery brings out this kind of instant empathy because if it was humans you might find ways to think they deserve what they've got so i really love that what you've captured there is that there is an innate beauty to the world that even in the most destructive places you've also brought out the fact that there's this you you force us to find some beauty in the fucking thing you know what i mean you're you're so it feels to me like you are fearlessly gazing into the world and bringing back this kind of report showing that somehow in it all it's still quite beautiful you know what i mean there's something in it that's still quite beautiful but you can't get that without honestly looking at it so in the same way man it's like i try to pull myself out of gazing into that world personally and bring it into me and spend some time staring into the fucking bloated pelicans of myself right right you know what i'm saying man totally yeah no but thanks a lot for saying that too um it's great to hear that response to work i uh well i think that that um you know with art making itself i mean so it's a very much a human endeavor you know if you think of uh the rest of the the natural world going about its its processes that there's you know you could maybe argue that if dolphins had opposable thumbs like something come out of that but but we are really the the one unique species in that we and then this is where like somebody like graham handcock and tarence mccanough would go into speaking of well there had to be we we just happened to um be and evolved enough and big grained enough species to venture out into into kind of the world of the the inner dialogue or or in in the case of you know um like shamanism the idea is always that you go out and you bring something back like it's just just the idea of taking let's say ayahuasca and or or eating a bunch of mushrooms and and having a trip and it not informing in any way your you know your everyday self or the way you look at the world i feel like that journey was not successful if if you didn't bring something back you know and i think that art in itself is or can be a kind of shamanic act in in that it's it's like you're you're looking at the condition of the world or yourself um and then distilling it into some kind of form like what you do very very well is is to do it with words you know like you're you're exploring that realm but you're bringing it back you're sharing with people and and um writers like i would say somebody like like ram hancock for instance like doesn't very good job of looking at many things you know many kind of manifestations of the human archive and and distilling that into something that we can understand as well and you know there's many countless examples of that being done but but i think that um at the end of the day you know it's it's one thing because you know i deal with um with with painting especially like you do come across a lot of examples where where for example a painter will they will really sort of nurture their technique perhaps but i but i but they maybe end there like they'll paint beautiful landscapes or or just stuff that calms the viewer right yeah and then there's other people take the other direction and just want to do something that's very jar and just just you know just in terms of the handling of the paint or however they they put it down but um piss christ like when the guy put the crucifix in the jar piss yeah exactly or there was a the dude uh i can't remember when he made it but there's a uh the can of the dude shit like he shot in a can and that's that was that was his artistic expression of course it's that i think it's at the moment you know it's taken by the establishment it's taken as serious art but but but it's uh you know i i think that where i'm like where i maybe want to kind of land with my own work is is just to be able to process those things somehow myself like it's it's really an active kind of meditation for me it's just to kind of to not turn my eye away from from let's say what's what's happening with the environment and stuff and and try and put that voice into some kind of visual medium that i can then share with people but uh you know whether or not it's it's successful or not it's it's not even you know there's that i you use this this quote before and i i uh i i've i've liked a lot too and i've used it with with regards to some lectures and stuff too with with the bug of a guitar it's like you know you um you have the right to your actions but not the fruit of your actions right so it's it's the the act of creating something like a painting um it's it's doing it's doing personal work you know you're you're you're putting it down putting down some kind of ideas with the idea with the intent of of just calming some part of yourself that needs an outlet right um yeah and and musicians do it through their music and writers do it through writing and and uh but i think that to not to not look at the world as it is or to not explore i feel like it's it's not doing service to the fact that we don't have very much time to to be curious in the world you know it's it's uh it's it's something that i think it's it's it's a great challenge sometimes to try and look at what's actually happening around you and then to try and do something with it the thing can be perceived by anyone viewing it oh my god it's so hard man it's so hard to spend any amount of time any amount of time on it i mean really the training is such that we're we've been taught not to not to really look deeply into anything it it's at all whatever it is you know and you with the deeper you look into anything it's just that it's very interesting the way the detention works very in a very similar fashion to a microscope that the longer you spend being attentive to any one thing the the more you zoom in on it to the point where you begin to realize that whatever the particular thing is seems to be completely empty and that that to me that's where my brain's at right right now more and more is just because the um the the drama of the world and the drama of my inner world um no no matter what it is uh the these this stuff that i've been trying to avoid for probably my my entire life you know in different ways if you ever um yeah you don't you obviously aren't one of these people but some people a lot of people maybe you too they spend a great deal of effort trying to avoid certain parts of themselves you know like admitting that i feel like shit most of the time for example yeah i know believe me i'm i'm there with you you know that thing where you like just start so you're trying to ignore the fact that most of the time you really don't feel that great you're kind you're kind of upset or angry or it's what in buddhism is called fundamental dissatisfaction and so you're sort of trying to avoid that and uh the more you avoid it the more the world around you sucks right right right you know what i mean there's that peculiar paradox which is that the more you ignore the uh can of shit that is your psychic arena that you're living in the more you see that out out in the world uh and and um i keep trying to articulate this with your art and i think i'm i'm gonna give it one i'm gonna give it another shot which is that you're okay when i meditate if i spend enough time doing it uh then all of a sudden that pain inside because i'm not turning away from it i'm actively looking at it for one quick weird millisecond it seems kind of beautiful not in a elliott smith way either and not in like i feel sorry for myself way but like whoa wow that's fucking really a cool energetic form that is inside of me there's something so like beautiful in it or i'll feel compassion for it right so but if i don't spend time looking at it uh then it just it just feels like a something to avoid and when i'm when i say it i mean like there's no specific thing i just mean like anger or underlying feelings of fear or of death or any of that stuff uh so you're what you're doing with your art which i think is alchemical is that uh you are taking these images of the world but god damn it martin they're they're they're so beautiful while simultaneously being so sad and do you know what i'm saying and that to me is it's such is the kind of the that's the halo coming out of your art so to speak or the inner illumination in the thing is that somehow it's managing to be simultaneously horrifying and exquisitely beautiful at the same time which and god damn it if that's not the dna that seems to be running this whole show you know well i'll tell you i mean it's it's great it's a great thing hearing you say that about the word because that's it's with myself to my my taste in our whatever form it takes has always been that if i don't feel a certain tension from the work like like a push and pull kind of effect or a um it kind of uh effect that the art has in that it's not just playing one note on my emotions you know in the sense that like that the the greatest pieces of music or the greatest paintings or or the greatest films you know that that i've ever come across have always had that that um um it's it's had the awareness and it's shared and sort of uh mirrored this awareness that there's the beauty of life is that it is made of the the duality like like the fact that there like that when when you're let's say faced with art that um let's say a movie that makes you cry and there's let's say it's a sad scene well frozen right right um yeah like like the that if it's very effective it's if it's a very great piece of artwork what i feel like it's doing it is it's it's both that if you're uh brought to the point of crying over it i think it's a both a celebration and uh a kind of morning happening at the same time like um what i'm trying to say there is that that artwork that really speaks to me kind of encompasses the whole thing it's it's the tragedy meeting with the joy of it um in in you know like something like like um when let's say you lose a loved one um the the the kind of grief that you feel is at the same time as being a sense of loss it's also a sense of celebration of the fact that you had this connection with this person oh that's the whole it's the whole picture so i one yeah i wanted to ask you actually i i get the sense just from um i haven't heard you speak a lot of times about these kind of things i don't you've never done ayahuasca right no i haven't done ayahuasca yet i uh but man i know i'm gonna do it because i keep like i've heard now from like somebody gave me a letter that somebody wrote somebody at an ayahuasca ceremony knew someone who knew me okay and she wrote this letter uh about her ayahuasca experience but sort of the end of it was you know you really need to take ayahuasca uh you know i've gotten that a bunch of times well i'll tell you i mean it's it's at the same with with why bring that up is that um because i've done i've participated in two ayahuasca ceremonies at this point so i drank it six times all together so i'm still i'm like an infant when it comes to the what if this thing is you know but but my last time so i'll maybe i'll just give you a short little trip report because it kind of gets to what we're just talking about here um so this this last time i went uh just this past summer it was my second ceremony but i decided um my friend jeff flew up from la and we um we decided to you know we took part in this thing for four days straight so it was what they were calling like the warrior dose which i thought was hilarious because the shamans do it every night but um but uh but yeah it was it was so not so so um you know that it was the first night of that ceremony brought me straight back to where i was at um the previous fall where i had done ayahuasca but i i didn't get past the certain block that i had you know like and i think the block is simply purging itself you know because because you know like with ayahuasca there's a there's a great emphasis on the purge it's even colloquially called the purge in some parts of south america where they practice it right um and i think that that uh i had that blockage that was preventing me from just releasing into it because you know the thing with a lot of psychedelic um medicines is that you you have to surrender it's it's a it's the first teaching you get is that if you let go and surrender into it you're you're likely to get what you're supposed to be getting out of it if you're just sitting there fighting it that's not gonna happen um so with this with this ayahuasca trip the second night that i sat i remember just sitting there you know um and i i could sort of formulate in my mind i was like i know why i have this block it's funny like i've had a i've had a kind of phobia about vomiting in public since i was a little kid uh i was yeah i was on a i was on a trip with my mom up in uh and we were in the canary islands and they're they're volcanic islands right so there's like a one of them has a pretty tall volcano they can take a bus ride up on and i think it was like 10 or 11 or something and we went up on this bus ride and i'm sitting i you know i'm i'm taking a nap in my mom's lap and at one point i just uh i remember this pretty clearly is weird but i i woke up from this nap all of a sudden needing to vomit very badly right and my mom uh it was it was laugh i'm like sleeping in right she finds a bag a plastic bag that i uh proceed to vomit like half my body weighed into but we didn't realize but there was a hole in like the whole plastic bag was just a like a long tunnel so i'm vomiting all over her laugh and myself i'm like it was a total mess and it's a full bus man it was like a and we got up to the top and my mom gives me a sprite and then on the way back you know like coming back down the mountain like i think you know i think i can make it but whatever and then and i proceed to vomit i think two or three more times to the point where the bus had to stop and i'm like vomiting the bushes and it was just it was just brutal right but thinking back i'm like maybe that's the thing is i've kept some part of that we're like it was just traumatizing you know so so since then it's always been one of those things right associate of course vomiting most people would associate it with being sick whereas with with ayahuasca the emphasis is on no the purge is is healing yourself and you know from from the kind of western mindset where that i'm steeped in it it struck me as like it struck me as very odd that there's a i'm not in a room full of people it's 20 people each night plus the two shawls that i was working with and people are vomiting all around me you know and somehow that block was still there where i'm like no you know like i it i can't let go into that thing but then so this this night in the summer the second night that i had was i finally i just faced it i was just like look this is not a big deal like it's it's like look everyone's doing it like just just go for it it's it's just gonna happen and it was so bizarre man because it didn't come even out of a place of nausea i had no nausea and then all of a sudden i once i like i did this kind of like uh like mental uh or or psychic aerobics where i was just like okay i'm priming myself to just let go and i want to find out what this thing really is like i really want to see what ayahuasca is supposed to be and it just happened all of a sudden just out of nowhere there's this very trippy visuals going on too but but what what ended up happening was a massive release like it just the whole thing released into this once you know i had this purge and it the whole thing just cleared up for me and i realized like oh this is what the experience is supposed to be you know there was there was just immense lucidity and clarity while being visually extremely psychedelic but there was a there was a sort of a really great sense through that release that that now i'm seeing what all the yammering is about like this is really like this is this is the real deal and it's it's fascinating that it's something that's been practiced for very very long time by people who seem greatly at balance with their surroundings right and and i remember and i remember just thinking like so i had this very very interesting evening and then um so i bought a place up in woodstock in upstate new york and the ceremony was being held in upstate new york just maybe an hour hour and a half away from my i have this barn on this land and and uh i remember that next day you know driving back in between i just want to recharge with my friend um back in my spot and and i went and like did yoga in my field and i remember all of a sudden man like just i started just sobbing like sobbing uncontrollably for the simple fact that it was that that thing we were just saying like that i i realized that i and pretty much everybody i know like we we live in a structure that's been set up where we don't have that kind of ritual anymore you know we don't have that kind of connection because it's like you know i'm sitting there on the ground and i'm feeling the grass under my fingers and just you know bare feet and i have my toes on the grass and you know i really i felt this incredible sense of connection with that but you you know i was completely baseline by this one like there was no iowaska thing going on during the day but i but i felt such an immense sense of the the belonging like i finally found myself feeling like oh i belong on this land that i bought you know i've only been here for half a year and i really feel like this is real connection but but there's such a veil over the the everyday kind of perception that i and most other people have of the of the unity of all these things you know it's it's something that we've done a very good job of convincing ourselves that we are somehow other than the world that we come out of and just having that like i remember just feeling such a sense of tragedy but such a sense of gratitude all rolled into one yeah if you ever if you ever seen that uh video of the laboratory chimpanzees getting released and they've been inside their whole lives and they let them go outside yeah i haven't seen it no no well i'll send it to you but it's it's this exact thing that you're talking about which is these poor things have been kept in an enclosure according to this their entire lives oh wow yeah yeah and so they let them at like the laboratory like somehow someone saved the chimps and it shows them for the first time coming out of this awful place into the light oh god the first like they come out and like two of them hug they can't believe where they're at and they they embrace each other and then just start running around and it's the simultaneously the most tragic beautiful thing uh and in that sobbing you're talking about that moment where you maybe get a little bit of time in the maybe you're not completely free but suddenly you get taken out of solitary confinement and put in the prison yard when it comes to awakening yeah that that moment where you're like oh god oh god i've my whole life i could have had this right exactly you know and and and in that that poignant sort of thing it's still looking back it still means that you haven't fully surrendered it still means that you haven't fully given in to the beauty because there's still a sense of you that's clinging to the past you know i say this because that's my anytime like i have any kind of epiphany epiphanous moment there is a sense of nostalgia and sadness that goes along with i think god damn it man if i was figured this out when i was 15 right exactly yeah you know but it's fuck it you know the the the real i think i don't i have a theoretical understanding of this not an actual understanding but from what i've read and and my observations of people who seem to have been managed to get out of the prison altogether or almost out uh it really doesn't matter the um well nothing i mean i mean it sounds so weird and callous but it's like you sort of come out of time or something you know like you're you're not you realize that the whole interplay of of the the what you're talking about this thing having gone away uh you're simultaneously saying it was once here right exactly yeah yeah you know what i mean so you're you're talking about the dissipation now but it was once here it's the same thing as like going out into a a garden during the winter and seeing these old withered old rose bushes or you know what i mean and you look at it and you're like god this must have been the most beautiful garden ever but you know what i mean but it's the winter so right now what are the gardeners doing is it's doing whatever plants do in the winter comes and you know what i mean it's the same thing things arise things dissipate things arise things dissipate and in the dissipation there is this sadness and the arising there's this excitement but god damn it it's the same it's both or this it's all the same and then anyway god damn i'm sorry to keep you that's all this four more person tells me it's all the fucking same i'm gonna punch them in the face i'm so sick of hearing that but it is all the same right right but it's it's funny the duality there because it's like the it's it's the same but it's also constantly flowing it's always shifting right like the the the thing that i think it's a lot of people sort of imprisoned in their own kind of neuroses is that they they want to preserve a state in which they perhaps find themselves in forever it's like i have to have it be this way but but nothing like nothing will remain that way you know and i think that that and um serve an unacceptance of that being the case is what gets people locked up and i feel like a lot of anxiety and stuff is that they it you know that's where they have attachment to things that inevitably they will have to let go of at some point anyway you know so so that's why i think that um what is what is super interesting and this is where i'm kind of going with with um my next series of work is is this archaic thing you know like my um i have a museum show in long beach in two years i mean it's it's far off uh a way that i'm i can only speak to it sort of peripherally but uh but yeah the the show at the museum um i think i already have a title for it i think i'm going to title it the archaic revival cool turns McKenna's book and it's going to be kind of a visual exploration of the same idea that he was talking about which was that um from the past you know from a very very long storied uh connected past that we all share you know there are these things that want to communicate with us you know like like and it's it's an odd time to be living through right now because of the the interconnectedness just of knowledge like like the the fact that we can find out of about let's say experiences such as psychedelics right um whereas up until just a very recent time ago it was all just sort of rude like little sort of mutterances that you would hear like hearsay among people whereas now there's there's just so much more to kind of uh there's just so much more to dip into if you want to get any kind of information about anything like this and i feel like what's happening and largely aided by it's it's funny at that ayahuasca retreat that i went to um i ran into a couple of people who it was funny like we just in conversation i was like oh hey how'd you find out about this and uh a couple of them were like oh because of you and joe rogue wow yeah no it's crazy man and it's it's it's just that like the the spreading of information like the way that people can candidly speak about about everything right now you know it's just i feel like what it's what it may be leading to this is where i'm very hopeful is that it's just leading to people shedding more and more of these kind of uh these these fear cloaks that they've been walking around and because they just haven't had the right access to the right information um whereas you know like like what i foresee perhaps happening is a lot more people being more brave and more adventurous to to explore facets let's say of themselves that can really only be access let's say via some plant agent or something yeah right sure yeah that is the that is um the the you know man the the word archaic is a great word uh but but i think it can be confusing and and i understand why mckinn has said it but i i think it's like that thing that you tune into on ayahuasca for me when i smoke dmt that thing that you tune into is is not in time it didn't feel archaic to me at all it felt and it felt high tech it felt cutting edge it felt very like the the very peak of of advancement and um i think that that really there was a time when people who are an archaic people were tuned into that thing outside of time and their method for tuning into that thing outside of time um is old but it's still it's like it's it's the thing that you're talking about there man coming into the world uh that thing is not in time i don't think it's in time we are in time that thing is in time in the form in our as much as we are in time but there's a big part of it that's not and it's sort of like um there's all these tricks like what you're talking about the people that have been taught for a very long time about here's how to open the window did you know that there's a most people who are in solitary confinement would be stunned to find out that there was a fucking window in there that they didn't know about yeah you know what i mean but it's like if you do this certain ritual you could there's a window that's going to start forming in this thing that you thought was completely closed off and then that window opens up through the psychedelic experience but also through meditation practice uh and or through some combination of these two things um and you look out that window and just seeing the world out there is incredible but people like you are actually or an artist or anyone now who wants to has access to this and what but what ends up happening when you open the fucking window which is of course the window of your heart is that these vines from outside of time start growing through you into the world these weird tendrils you know what i mean it's like it's not even you you know what i'm saying you've like ripped open this window in the prison of yourself and all of a sudden some kind of alien process is growing out of you into this dimension and i think that's growing out of so many people right now that it's um we just have to i have to start believing what my mother's new age boyfriend back in the early 90s told me which is that there is an awakening happening well i think but it's funny listening to mckenna lectures too because most of them were from the 80s and 90s right and uh there's so many things that he's sort of pointing out because this is the infancy of the internet you know but he's he's talking about things that that uh were just on the horizon but he was talking about them in in the way that no they're definitely happening and the the momentum towards people you know people starting to awaken to there being a lot more at work than just the sort of mundane idea that the materialists would propose right like he was of the opinion that the internet for instance would have a huge thing to say about how how information about these things would be would be shared you know and i think that uh what we're what we're actually really seeing happening right now is is the hopeful part of me is is thinking that there is still enough time there there's enough time for people now to start banding together and collectively saying that you know the old world or the standard model just it's not even a fraction of the whole picture you know like that's right it's it there's there's way more process at work and but it has to start with the individual you know like like when people are always like well we gotta make the world this or that for you know other people we'll start with ourselves man like we gotta but we have but but i'm saying that through through agencies like like plant-based psychedelics for instance there's it's a very democratic kind of tool that has just landed back among society and you know in the 60s i feel like like when when people talk about leery and uh in the way that it became sort of like sensationalized the psychedelic revolution um i feel like the disservice that it did was it was just kind of like let's just willy nilly just go for it like everybody turn on right but whereas what i feel like is happening now once we've had time to cool off from that is there's a very certain there's a very beautiful kind of awareness of the reasoning behind seeking it if that makes any sense like like like people aren't just randomly now dropping some psychedelic and and waiting for the results to happen like you know when when they often say that you should have intention when you go into yes such a thing as a psychedelic experience well well i feel like like having listened to a lot of people now having the means to listen to a lot of people talk about these things reading a lot of stuff that people have written about them reading research about them like now somebody going in let's say even for the first time they're much more prepared than somebody would have been in the 60s when nobody knew what the fuck would happen if you ate five dry grams of mushrooms that's right yeah that's right you're talking about the awful one of the terrible one of the many awful things that happen because of the prohibition on psychedelics is that you know all these bad trips that you could have just based on not knowing the chemical process that was happening in your mind exactly and dude like that's that's the thing is setting okay so i've sort of for a long time called mushrooms my guru of sorts because i've i've learned to kind of use them very rarely you know i only maybe like two or three times a year at most but but but i've really learned at least for myself what my ideal or at least as close as an ideal setting as possible could be for myself right and and i've learned that just respecting them in that way but largely due to again like the the research that i did just for myself as far as like well how should one set this up to avoid having it go bad uh i mean what it's what it's turned out to be has been very interesting experiences i mean there's there's there's a whole lot that i've gleaned out of those experiences but but i could very well i've often had you know trips were in the middle of them i've just thought like holy fuck like imagine if i was at a bar right now or at a house party like this this would be bad this yeah it would simply be bad because because the the you know let's say like drunk people around me that normally i could just very easily contend with like they would become demonic you know or whatever like like like it just just the idea of even having to navigate home let's say i'm at a bar in manhattan and i had to take the subway back to brooklyn when tripping super hard on mushroom it it's a nightmare i mean just the whole all the variables about that are unpleasant to the extreme whereas you know this i feel like people un uh i guess uninitiated into the dialogue about psychedelics they they could very well make that mistake and then never touched them again he'd say no they were terrible i had a terrible time and then you asked them well what were you doing and they said well i you know i i went to you know i went to bars i went to disneyland right right hand which which if if you had a really good sitter with you could actually be really interesting but i don't know man i it's just the my part on especially around people on psychedelics is that i'm so tuned into whatever specific psychic uh aroma is emerging from them you know like it just feels like you can just feel the exact spectrum of consciousness that person is existing on you can see in the same way that you're caught up in whatever dramas that you that you're caught up in inner personally when you are on mushrooms or psychedelic and you see say an an angry father with a group of unruly kids and and and normally you might just ignore but here you look and see the veins in his neck or like kind of pumping his eyes bulging like a cow and a being pushed into one of those slaughterhouses that kind of bulging weird look of a trapped animal that can never escape and the whole the kids are just like you know covered in like mashed potatoes and the whole thing just seems like some kind of like sixth layer of hell thing where you're walking the mushrooms are fucking um who walked Dante through hell um Virgil yeah the mushrooms are like walking you through like the hold you know so yeah like that's like that's a that's a if you're not prepared for that because by the way if somebody came i know if someone invited you to for a walk through how you would take it i would too if you like sign me the fuck up and in fact if there was a way to sell tickets that you could walk through hell that would be the most exciting amusement park of all time like everyone would walk through hell because they're prepared for it well and that's the thing like again because it's you know you have you have the framework going into it at least even because there's no way of saying like oh you're fully prepared for a thing like let's say ayahuasca like it brought it's an ordeal like these are not to be taken lightly in the sense that you can't just you know plug in and expect this thing to go exactly like you predicted in fact that that's definitely not what's going to happen but but um setting the intention ahead of time and and then having a safe framework to do it and that's that's really all that it's it's required you know um so there's a whole idea of having like a trip sitter for instance like somebody who who you trust very well and they're quite experienced in in the thing that you're about to take um and all their role is is just to be there not to try and guide you in directions because they don't know where the fuck you are when you're in the middle of it right like but they but they are that anchor they they set they set that part of your mind that might be worried about things getting too bonkers around you like they kind of set that all in place by just being there they're just a presence for you right and I think that uh certainly like something like a difficult trip or whatever if people want to call it a bad trip under the right setting could actually be the best kind of experience you could have because you you do learn a lot I mean that's because it at you know going back to an earlier part of our conversations it's it can shine a light on that part those parts of yourself that you normally um you distract yourself away from for example like like I have this funny habit of like and I I'm trying my my dam to get rid of it you know slowly but if I get in a thought about anxiety let's say I get like stressed and all of a sudden like I'll just think about something that stresses me out I'll go like hey what's going on on Facebook right now yes I'll actually like click on the Facebook button on my computer or or on my phone just just to kind of to to shut that little voice up that's saying hey have you looked at this thing that you might be doing you should maybe doing better or at least having an honest look at like so it's something that um that that whole distraction thing we've certainly in in the day and age we're living through and now like we've suddenly set up a really efficient framework by which people can distract themselves from what's really going on this is why I like meditation this is why um to med mindfulness meditation in particular sitting down for a prescribed period of time 30 minutes 45 minutes and treating your consciousness as though it were a an aquarium and you were sitting in front of it staring into the aquarium watching all the funny little fish that swim around inside of you yeah it is fucking crazy man because what this is called so this is like one of the Buddha's prescriptions or whatever instructions was uh watch the way things arise and dissipate the way they come into form and go out of form within you just sit and watch the thing come and go come and go and man that what you're talking about the anxiety the voice telling you hey take a look at this and then the the concurrent anxiety state that goes along with the voice you can actually watch that anxiety state go when you're meditating you can sometimes see it appear as a tiny little dot on the horizon and slowly slowly slowly emerge into your awareness and trigger the emotional state of anxiety or whatever the horrible feeling tone is you can then feel the rising feeling tone feel all the thoughts that go along with the feeling tone like i need to do this i need to do that why did she do that why did he say that why am i not doing this oh fuck i forgot to do that you watch the feeling give birth to all these other like like it's like those fish that swim around whales it's like the big ones have got all these other thoughts that swarm around it and you'll watch the whole thing get bigger and bigger and bigger come right against the aquarium of your awareness every part of your body will suddenly want to convert that horror that you're looking into into an action which is like shit i bet you know what i need to make sure my phone's plugged in and if you're not careful you'll be standing up and you won't be meditating anymore because it actually knocked you backwards it like it went from being this tiny little dot to a feeling that is overwhelming to the point where you had to go check facebook and then you see oh my god the fucking winds of my mind are blowing me into the direction of facebook what else are they blowing me into and you know what i mean and so that practice of just sitting and watching these things come and go come and go it brings you it it it it really can have a significant effect on the way you function in the world yeah yeah well Doug let me ask you like so when you when you meditate um what in how do you set it up i mean this is something i always contend with is that like now now i'm having an easier time because i'm up in often up in my place in upstate new york where i have this field right and it's really like it's in the woods man like there's not there's my nearest neighbor like i can't throw a baseball that far right so uh so like like it's it's one of those things right there throughout the summer i would just go sit in my field and it's it's just there's nothing like coming in from the outside to uh to distract me but i still feel myself being so bad at it that i'm i'm distracting myself you know like i'll i'll get into for example like a breathing thing and and paying attention to my breath but even so it's just very quickly all of a sudden i'm just thinking about some other shit and then my breathing is just becomes that shallow little like you know whatever i'm thinking about it it overrides that practice that i'm supposed to be doing just by breathing whereas you know uh i've been wondering that about when when people are meditating and allow themselves to actually get pretty deep with it is how do you how do you set it up like do you have a chance like or yeah i'll tell you the way i do it but first of all what you just described as doing meditation as not being good at meditation is meditation so the i think a lot of people at first when you think about meditation you think it's just you somehow go into the state of being able to pay attention to your breath even though for the majority of your life you haven't been able to pay attention to fucking anything like suddenly you can sit down and just pay attention to your breath uh it really what it is is you're sitting down it's not that you're paying attention to your breath you're paying attention to everything so you're paying attention to the way that you you're you're aware when you are focused on your breath and the and and the depth with it with it within which you can study your breath and the various aspects of breath and the um the all the implications of breath and all the stuff that's all the you can go from when you're listening or watching your breath you can go to you know as far into the mind as you want to go which is like and all you can like have all these concepts that are very romantic like this breath is the wheel of time connecting me to the universe and the mind will get very flowery and then if you wanted to you can just get into the sound of your breath the way it's coming in and out sounds like a wind on the beach sometimes or some zen buddha say it's like a snake going through the grass and then like you can then like go even deeper into the way that the feel of breath is coming in and coming out there's all these you realize that the thing that seems so boring at first is in fact a fractal that you can you can sort of get lost in and that's when you're paying attention to your breath right but those moments are going to be pretty small for you and for most of us because most of the time your thoughts will have dragged you away and in a kind of crazy instantaneous uh just uh within milliseconds you'll find yourself lost deep in a tunnel of thought and uh and then all of a sudden you'll be back watching your breath again and you'll be like whoa what the fuck man I was just fucking fantasizing about a trip I took to Mobile Alabama when I was 16 you know like what the fuck and then but now you're back in the breath again and in fact now you're like watching the way that you're you're conceptualizing it and you're actually watching your mind being like whoa what the fuck and then you realize like oh shit that's just another thing in my field of awareness which is the uh the the the reporter that's reporting in on the meditation and you're watching that too and so basically what you're doing is your um uh as in in this state of observation of all the particulates of the self you're learning about yourself and because because if sitting still with very little distraction or no distraction and watching your breath if a dog barking suddenly makes you start feeling a deep heartbreak over the death of a parent or the loss of a loss of a love at some point in your life then what's happening when you're walking through the world and getting the strobe light effect of all the various pixels of phenomena getting blasted into your mind at every single second how much crazier is your mind going then so you know what I mean so you're sort of you're learning how how the mind your mind and your thoughts and everything functioning everything that you think is you is actually just as much um is actually something being held within a much bigger version of who you are the thing that actually doesn't have boundaries at all so that's what that's the practice it's not you don't you what you cannot meditate in the wrong way right okay there's no mistakes to be had here there's it's not like working out you will not pull a muscle there's not going to be oh there's not a wrong way you just the way I do it is I get a pillow I have what's called a puja table which is like a and you don't have to do this I just do it because I'm a hippie but I have a puja table it has a candle on it it's got actually this book by an artist I love named Ron Regi who uh it's got his book opened up on it and I've got a candle there I've got a picture a little Ganesh deity I've got a Jesus keychain I've got a um shell that my girlfriend's mom gave me I've got a picture a big picture of Neem Karoli Baba and I've got a picture of a sea turtle I took uh so that I can barely see it it's kind of swimming off into the depths it's just a little dot uh and so that's it that's the puja table and I sit there light a candle and I'll chant Hari Krishna for about 30 minutes and then at the end of chanting Hari Krishna I will follow my breath for about 15 or 20 minutes and practice sort of mindfulness meditation and then when I'm done with that I'll ring this I'll ring a little bell for no reason and then that's it cool that's really cool man yeah well because that's I think as you pointed out I think it's probably a very like individual thing like everyone's practice will will be different in some way right um and and you know I guess with with feeling that I'm like I I just feel like I ought to make it more of a consistent practice though and and the funny kind of like paradox there is that I'm not finding or the irony I guess would be that I'm not finding I don't find myself finding the time to meditation off which is it exactly the point of meditation is to try and cease that yammering that you could constantly have to be doing something oh yeah that reminds me of there's a very funny story a guy I was talking to a Buddhist teacher uh and he said to him how long should I meditate each day and the teacher said meditate for 30 minutes a day and he's like I don't have time for that and the Buddhist teacher said well then you should meditate for an hour a day that's awesome very cool yeah it because you know you never do trust me man you could be sitting on a plane you could be sitting on a beach on shipwrecked on a fucking beach with uh from riding on a like gourmet food ship and all the great food and wine and water is washed up on the shore everything you need is there nothing to do and you still won't have fucking time to meditate yeah yeah yeah because it's because it's it's it's uh it's just so fucking weird and and it can be quite painful in in in a really beautiful way but the combination of a psychedelic of being a psychonaut or using plant medicines to reach into the transcendent um it can really be supplemented with using stillness to reach into the transcendent because these guys they they Ram das and Krishna das and a lot of my teachers they love getting high on psychedelics so much that they didn't want to come down anymore yeah yeah exactly yeah well I think though that that that's kind of the teaching that I've found that I've been finding in psychedelics is that what it's showing you and this is where it gets so interesting that the fact that they are such healers when it comes to a lot of people's very legitimate sort of psychic neuroses such as addictions to other substances and whatnot is that and this is where where where you know the western model is scratching its head a little bit is that you know that the experiences open doors within yourself where you are the thing that's healing yourself if you know what I mean like like if you take um such an example as the Johns Hopkins study that they're they use psilocybin to to cure people of nicotine addiction you know they've been and they they select from their group very very specific group of people who have been smoking for a very long time and a lot you know it's not just sort of casual smokers and they were getting insane results just with three psilocybin sessions administered over I think three weeks and you know a year later they'd look in check in with these people and maybe I think there was one person relapsing and smoking again had a pretty significant group right and and what that's showing is that there's not nothing there's not some magical chemical inside the actual mushroom itself or or in their case you know they're obviously using the synthesize psilocybin but there's nothing about psilocybin that all of a sudden hits at the nicotine receptor and shuts it down it's you having had that experience that are it is finding it within yourself to be some some stronger part of yourself has just emerged and realized that you are stronger than this demon or this imp that you're carrying around you're the one doing the work and and similarly so I find that you know um people that I met at these these ayahuasca ceremonies um because that's the first time I've done psychedelics with a bunch of people especially a bunch of people I didn't know right and you know you're there for a significant amount of time you know over a long weekend or four days or whatever and you you meet a lot of people who this was their entry way into it using some plan that has sent open them up to the experience that oh wait a minute I should I should go through my life and change my life to become more tuned to this frequency so so there are a lot of people there that that that had been changed enough by these experiences and they keep coming back to them just as reminders and to work because there's no bottom to this thing it's not that you're gonna do this and somehow fix yourself forever it's it's because there's always facets of yourself you you can have another look at but but it fell to me that meeting a lot of these people that they're in their everyday waking life they're doing way more work on themselves than people who haven't had those kinds of openings ever appear to them um and and that that brings me to you know how Ram Dass has basically his his Genesis story as to how he became Ram Dass yes begins with Leary giving him mushrooms and then him seeing manifestations of himself appear in the room that he keeps shedding you know he sees himself as like the Harvard professor who's like well am I that guy I mean I am that guy but but it's not it doesn't define who I am am I the tennis star I think that's what one of the manifestation all these different sort of identities that he had upon himself he just shed them and then realized like wait a fucking minute like I there's much more to to me than just to than me being shaped by my environment like there there are many layers within myself and that that's the thing that opened him up to and I feel like there are many many people out there who kind of have the intro via these these substances and then they and then they develop let's say a meditation practice in which they're trying to I feel in a way kind of tap back into the frequency because it is a universal frequency it's not that I feel like that's what's so bizarre between let's say mushrooms and ayahuasca both being tryptomies of course but they there's in both those experiences I've found that there is some there's something in it compelling us to do better with ourselves right yes yes so and so and and and it spills into this this idea that like when you're down when you're back to being I guess sober if that's the word you want to use it's it they're compelling you to just do better in this mode as well so it's not just that you're not just looking forward to your next trip where you can escape this world in fact it's it's it's a matter of hey come back into the world but now you have this other layer that you've seen which it can't be unseen I mean these are not just random dreams that you have when you go to sleep you know like these are they're very lucid I mean there's a lot going on there where you you're not just seeing interesting fractals and shapes no that is a part of it as well but but but there is a there's something about them that that I can't I can't put into real words because I don't quite understand it but there's something in it that is trying to tell us that that we are much greater than we normally perceive ourselves to be so if we can somehow bring that into our our everyday lives like some kind of practices that remind us of that or just just sort of act as a way of shedding those things that we certainly don't need anymore like a kind of purge like a daily purge I think that any kind of practices like that one picks up from the psychedelic experiences or whatever other way someone has of I've seen them I think that that's that's what I find is the most most interesting thing about ever doing something like an ayahuasca retreat or let's say a meditation retreat something that that on the surface might even seem like an ordeal but it's only by going through it kind of like the proverbial like Joseph Cambellian hero's journey where it's like you have to kind of you have to be willing to walk through a certain valley where it's going to be frustrating and it's going to be at times terrifying even but when you get out on the other side like by god you gotta you got a lot more to go on in other words you know yeah man and and and that uh intent that's kind of universal intention that seems to be coming through the psychedelic that intention of healing or refinement I think it's really important to realize that the meditation retreat and the ayahuasca ceremony and the mushroom trip with a shaman and whatever the the nucleus of the temporal event is if you just set up in your mind the intention to start moving in that direction right then you can subvert the one of the great tricks that the mind plays which is I'll be holy then after my big ayahuasca trip not that's when I'm really going to be a kind person or after the meditation retreat what you do is you set the intention now at this very second in the whatever the pigsty or the sacred utopia your mind happens to be regardless of if you're the most beautiful peaceful being that ever walked the earth or if you just set fire to a church or something and you're wearing a potato sack over your head and about to invade a summer camp if if you in that though if you just can just in a in that moment just start shifting in the direction mentally that there is the potential that you can have it awakening in your life then um that that'll start creating these kind of radical changes prior to whatever your mushroom trip or ayahuasca trip or acid trip or meditation retreat or vipassana retreat experiences and that's why I really love Terrence McKenna talking about the singularity and how it's so powerful it was blasting these things called tachyon particles backwards through time you know what I'm talking about like so like in the same way I like to think of the personal singularities that exist in every single person's life the potential for a personal singularity or the inevitability of the personal singularity known as death there can also be personal singularities that can happen prior to death in the form of an awakening experience and in the same way that McKenna you know theorized in a probably ridiculous way that this event in the future is so potent that it's blasting back particles through time which manifests in the form of novelty in the same way if you just start letting yourself imagine that there is a version of yourself currently existing outside the time space continuum that is awoken and that the power of that awakening was so potent in your subjective experience that there are actual tachyon particles there are actual particles of awakening being blasted backwards through time that are manifesting as these minute personal epiphanies that can happen if you just let yourself be open to them then you can start the process right now at this very moment you know yeah yeah yeah well I think though it's it's just something that's a little disheartening often it's not so much that I want to do these people exclusively in a place like New York for instance but but there are quite a lot of people I feel that they I almost get the sense just in talking with them let's say about psychedelics or or in the case of like like you know just seeing what they might what kind of practices they might have to try and open up those sort of channels and and not that often but once in a while do seem to come across or these these resistances where people seem afraid to to explore or open up those those parts themselves like I kind of get that sense once in a while that like that because there is so much baggage like our species is carrying around so much baggage that we're we're almost become afraid of our own natures because I because we see so many ways that we're behaving badly around the world too that I think that that people I don't know maybe it's just that I'm also seeing like instances of this ridiculous shit that we're seeing now with like trigger warnings and whatever like like people seeing themselves as these extremely fragile things that if they were to start really kind of like facing these things about themselves that make them anxious or or uncomfortable uh that somehow they would have like a meltdown like it like you know the idea of coming across trigger warnings for example like NPR when they're about to use a certain word and and they're just covering their bases that anyone hearing it doesn't all sound spiraling into some kind of panic attack like I wonder what that's about I wonder what where we're at when we're you know when we're when we're kind of collectively seem so afraid to kind of do that sometimes heavy lifting of looking inwards well nobody wants to die and those motherfucking anxiety attacks are it's preferable for a lot of people to have a body made up of anxiety attacks anger and terror than to be nothingness yeah you know so like you know there's part of you knows if I start dealing with the fact that the very the the building blocks of my personality and for a lot of people those building blocks consist of ridiculous um uh ridiculous mottos such as I just hate people there's you know what I mean there's people who say that I hate people I just hate people I hate people the world is shit the world is shit the world is shit people rip you off people rip you I hate the fucking bullshit world all those things these building blocks of a self of course to say you hate people you have to be hurting so bad or to say the world sucks you're hurting so bad or to to whatever the thing is that you're bugling out about how miserable wretched and rancid the society that you're in or the world that you're in or whatever it is that you're in I speak from my own personal experience which is that in general if I'm uh uh uh blasting some external aspect of the world usually it's coming from a pain state uh but people want to be in that pain state because it's a state and and and it's preferable to statelessness or it's preferable to just a real simple trippy thing to realize is that um awareness and uh phenomena arise simultaneously so you know you know that idea which is so that like here you have the state of awareness which is what you are and you're rising up into the state of awareness at every single moment or infinite sense experiences that are happening right but what what you know what I mean but what you really are is that state of nothingness within which these experiences are rising but the experiences are what you call yourself so anyway that's preferable to be that right to to have your fingers dug into the fucking matter of the world into the phenomena of the world and to have your roots just dug as deep as you possibly can into that dead soil is preferable it's better to be a desert plant dug into into this material world than to blend into space and become all things for some people it's death right we don't want to die right right but it's it's the funny thing about um existence is the fact that all like absolutely if there's one voyage we're all going to take you know it's that's the one universal thing but it's also the one universal thing that in certain cultures we we want to shield ourselves from you know like like there's a I find I find the weirdest practice you know in the here in the west especially when they when they embalm bodies when they die so as to sort of resemble them as when they were alive and yeah it's for the people who you know when they if they do awake of course you know that does make some sense but but I remember like when my dad passed away we passed away five four or five years ago now and I remember you being um because he was a very funny dude up my my dad was very kind of happy go lucky and didn't take things too seriously some things he did of course but but but by and large he found comedy in a lot of things right and I remember you know when he passed away at home um because he was he was pretty ill but we wanted to take care of him at home and like I flew up from New York up to Ottawa where it happened and just a week before and then I was there when when he died it was really weird man like like him going from he was pretty sick so it's not as if though he looked well right before but then you know I went to the bathroom I remember I went to the bathroom he was alive I went to the bathroom I came out and my mom was there and she's like I think he just went and he had gone he had just died just then right it was so bizarre man it was really really weird like how like the difference between the life force that was in this man who was granted quite sick versus that life force just having disappeared altogether like it was really like it was a very distinct thing it was it was very very odd to see you know and but but then you know uh he goes to a funeral home and there's this weird process it's some kind of thing maybe it's it's some kind of legal thing they have to do in in Canada I'm not sure I haven't looked into it but but like for the funeral home for us to like decide what kind of casket or whatever we want to do with his body we have to actually we had we had to of course choose there but but they had embalmed his body they had like like doctored his body so as to have like even like a little smirk on his face I remember I remember my mom and I like we had done our like grieving was part of it of course but like enough that when we were there we saw my dad's body and and in this state that they had sort of doctored him up into and we realized that my my dad if he had been in the room with us he would be like gaffa laughing at how he appeared like he just he didn't look at all like himself and both me and my mom are like this is this is kind of fucking hilarious in a weird way right because it's somehow like like I don't know I guess the point I'm trying to make is that there's this kind of like sterility with regards to to death that somehow like even when death has come we have to still sort of masquerade it as like oh there's still no look part of them is still alive look at this look at this you know the rosy cheeked body that we're about to incinerate like whereas whereas I think that if you if you then contrast it with like the the tradition they have somewhere in Tibet where they have vultures eat the corpse oh yeah that's the best like that's what that's and and then you know like there's of course the practice with some buddhist monks where they actually sit by an open grave and they they they meditate on the decomposing body because it it all like both of those practices I think they're mirrors you know like you see this process happening that happens in all of nature all around us you know like like just changing the seasons well like you said earlier on in the conversation like like a a garden in the winter looks shriveled and fucked up you know but but you know that what it is is just that it's it's a dormant it's dormant but it's it's exactly and dormant is a great word to use because it's it's sleeping it's as if though like like I had a mushroom trip but I keep going back to mushroom trips it sounded ridiculous but uh but I had one um like maybe a month ago up in my up in my property where you know it's it's it had just been a big snowfall here with like snow right around Thanksgiving and I remember sitting there in the field kind of seeing all these trees around me with no leaves on them where in the summer they're just super lush and it's like really really like fertile and I remember just thinking that like the the kind of energy that I'm feeling here the kind of sounds that I'm hearing from from the forest the way it is now is just that it's it's almost as if though this forest in this field it's it's sleeping under this blanket and dreaming of spring like it's dream of its next state but but it's not the end of any state like the same with the human life is that that we we tend to think of it in such strange terms whereas then we look at nature and we we apply a completely different kind of paradigm on it that that's somehow a withering plant that then you know is is reborn I guess if you want to use that word the next season somehow human beings are excluded from that process when people think of death people think of death as being such a permanent thing well it's certainly a universal thing like we all share it but but I don't know I don't know where I'm at with with regards to thinking of it as this like cataclysmic end of anything I had and what's what's kind of funny or not funny maybe but what's sort of uh relieving about it is that it's something we all share there's absolutely nobody that not even Ray Kurzweil bless his heart is gonna escape that process that's gonna be sad when Ray Kurzweil if Ray Kurzweil that's gonna be sad if Ray Kurzweil dies well yeah I guess from whichever standpoint look at it in a way though it's it's it's odd because I I haven't I haven't been keeping up too much with what his whole thing is like how it's been going but but I wonder I mean you know the idea of eventually plugging our consciousness into some kind of immortal thing uh I don't know I wonder what the what the sort of the Buddhist minds I would have to say about that that is that maybe some kind of if that were to ever happen you know will that be some kind of strange natural manifestation yes it will be I think I actually heard a cool Buddhist take on it it was similar which is that uh you know the idea of like making artificial intelligences that are capable of self-determination and are indistinguishable from human intelligence that Kurzweil's talking about uh at this rich meditation retreat I was at this amazing woman Mirabai was telling me how she was talking to this llama a boot not the animal but a Buddhist teacher about uh this stuff and he was saying well you know if you look at the Tibetan Book of the Dead or you look at the idea that there are all these potentialities that exist that these disembodied potentialities that we call souls these sort of like quantum ripples that have the tendency of moving into a fertilized egg and growing into a human which is a probably a rather poor explanation of the the Tibetan idea which is much deeper but that's that a rudimentary that's kind of the idea so in the same way if you can create a vessel suitable for these ripples that we call our souls or identities or whatever to become embodied in then souls will just start going into machines so and and uh I think that when I see somebody die what I'm seeing is a radio getting turned off it's it's obvious that a transmission has just been shut off it's like it's no different from when I turn my tv it's like it's no different than when the music stops playing it's just like there was something here now it's completely gone as far as its manifestation in the field of matter called the human body but that thing man it I think theoretically you could tune into you could tune into the various personality frequencies that exist at all times I and I think that we can you know people say the reincarnation is this kind of dying born dying born dying born I think it's more correct to think that there is a specific frequency an egoic frequency a karmic frequency which you are and I am and everyone you know are and everyone every individual that you know is rather and and uh that these this frequency is constantly being emanated into the universe from where I don't know and why I don't know but I think that that frequency of self is more than likely being tuned into by a lot of different receivers not just your body and that's where you get into like multiverse theory and stuff or the idea that like you know there's an infinite number of universes through which this frequency or transmission that you call yourself is being exploded into at all times and in various dimensions and other aspects of parts of the multiverse that you that is currently manifesting in the form of your body here on earth is being manifested maybe in the way a leaf blows into the sky or maybe it's you know what I mean it's like it's being manifest in a lot of different ways not just your your meat body yeah well well and you know with uh something like again like ayahuasca the experience that I had that was kind of like my the game changer for me as far as like understanding what or at least getting a glimpse into understanding what the hell this thing is and why people would should and and are using it you know is that um you get a glimpse into into that idea that that you are just you are a you're really just a particle operating in a huge and a vast almost I mean suffice to say like like infinite kind of system like it really it hammers home this weird kind of funny like mendolic idea which is that you're both utterly insignificant but also your actions your your life here can be very important it's a really weird like double thing where like it really stresses that that's why I think that these things do kind of get to the root of like if somebody has real problems that they are maybe neglecting to to contend with in every day like they will take you to those things because there there seems to be this emphasis on on appreciating how insanely amazing it is to have this kind of incarnation to do to be able to live and manipulate space and matter with these hands and to be able to perceive it with our senses and stuff but at the same time it's it inevitably always kind of it is a kind of a slap in the face also like reminding us like but look you are you are in the grand scheme of things nothing to stop worrying so fucking much I love it so cool it's really cool it's just like yeah what you have is a precious thing yeah but don't get too caught up it's like if you're eating it at the mansion of some incredibly wealthy person right and you're like you're ignoring the generosity of whatever incredible meal he's offered you well that's very rude but simultaneously if you're sitting there drinking the wine and you keep talking about this wine is so good I can't believe he gave me this your finest wine oh god it's going to become uncomfortable for everyone involved yeah exactly it's it's and this is where like you know again maybe using the term like archaic revival might might fit though in that if you think of like old old kind of philosophy such as like Taoism well Taoism is that it's flow it's it's about just flowing with it because at the end of the day there's nothing else to be done but flow if you if you try and swim against the current well all you're gonna do is is splash around but it's not gonna change the current itself you know so so I just feel like that's why like like maybe it's maybe it's high time that we did do kind of like uh you know maybe with the aid of these things that are now coming out of the jungle en masse and like just just generally like uh the the fact that people are opening up to these these kind of individual experiences that then may spill into the rest of their lives in some way like maybe it is a high time for us to like to really take stock of that and say that it's not just it's not just a matter of like looking forward to the next manifestation of technology like the next iPhone or some shit as if though that's gonna be our salvation or we're looking just in that direction certainly I think that technology in the way it's going is getting really trippy like it's there there are things that one could call psychedelic about what's being done with with technology right but at the same time if we're only ever living through this kind of external externalized experience such as like a screen in front of us or whatever rather than going into those experiences on some deeper level I think that one without the other is is not the whole picture you know no you got to get out of the kiddie pool eventually man I mean that's just what it comes down to and but you don't have to be in a rush either it's like yeah there's there's not a rush there's not a imperative as much as like the mind would like to the mind will either make you think it's all bullshit or it's the most important thing ever like it's never gonna just be like oh I don't know it's probably nothing the mind doesn't want the mind wants a wants it wants it to be for nothing or for something it can't accept the kind of liminal place that I think Taoism and Buddhism is pointing to but man Martin holy shit we've done two hours oh shit yeah how cool what a one how wonderful to get to meet you I'm so grateful that you that you took the time to be on this podcast and I really hope you'll come back on again I don't and I'd love to man and thanks again like I really mean it like I think I think what you're doing with this podcast is it's a really it's a it's just it's in keeping with what we're talking about here too I feel like it's a really really like it's a very important thing for a lot of people to have access to to your thoughts and that and that you know the fact that you have this kind of forum for people to be just just openly speaking with ideas and stuff it's it's amazing well I'm then I must be the luckiest person on earth I really must be because all like I just get to have conversations with great artists like yourself that illuminate me and that's so I just feel I just feel incredibly lucky and thank you so much for for saying all that but yeah for me it's just like holy shit I just get to talk to the coolest people ever so that makes me really happy and also thanks so much for for Babel this book is really great and folks listening who are uh have been fascinated by what the things that Martin has been talking about you got to check out his book where can people not to like put in too obvious a plug man but this this is something that like you know your your art uh has become a real big part of my life and oh cool man I'd like other people to be able to experience it too yeah no thanks a lot man well yeah you can um I'm selling it actually through my website like we're gonna we are gonna set up through my publisher too we're gonna do an amazon link and stuff but we uh we kicked it out of the gates with uh with a kickstart campaign end of october I think so we're still getting the logistics together as far as like like setting up some type of different platform but for the time being I mean if I um I have the book on my websites it's I have a weird name though so it's uh it's it's Martin and the W I T T F O O T H dot com and there's a store section on there um and if you click that link uh the first thing at the top of the page is the book and then I have a few prints and stuff up there as well so yeah beautiful and if people want to follow me on on facebook it's uh I think the easiest thing would just be just look up my name I have it's I don't know if you have the same scenario happening but like there's like a facebook like regular page that has a friends limit which is really dumb in my opinion like it's I think it caps at like five thousand or something and then there's like a like an artist page so I have both of those um but I don't even know like I put the same content on both I don't know I've I've I've I've sort of fallen away from Facebook because the friend limit thing made it like yeah weird and then I just sort of just started using twitter and stuff but maybe it's fixed whatever that weirdness was so that I don't know well I'll pull just send me the links folks if you want to connect to Martin go to uh dunkatrustle.com and there'll be links in the comment section of this podcast um cool man wow this is this has been really awesome you know I I'm gonna be coming I'm gonna be doing a live podcast uh in New York okay at least two in April are you gonna be around I am yeah yeah oh cool man maybe we maybe we can figure something out I'll do that we awesome yeah yeah and that's very nice man I'd love to if you're here for for a few days I'd love to have you upstate too just for you know a day or two if you want that would be cool yeah man I would like to see your the dormant fields through the lens of mushrooms I'm terrified of mushrooms these days though man I've I'm more of a but I theoretically I don't really mean it because I've heard that these things are prohibitive but I'm more of an acid man myself but um maybe I'll just cut that out Martin God bless you we will talk again soon thank you so much for coming on

I'm not sure what part of the time space continuum you happen to be floating down on the meaty inner tube that you call your body, but from this part of the river I just want to say hello to you, trapped in time like a fly stuck in the swirling vortex of a toilet, but not being sucked down into the city sewers being sucked in the direction of the thing that someone I'm very fond of termed the strange attractor at the end of time. Today, maybe you're aware, maybe you're not. If you happen to be listening to this today, November 16th, today is the birthday of one of the greatest philosophers and psychonauts and mind blowers that ever walked across this strange extrusion of matter that we call planet earth. I'm trying to talk like Terence McKenna, who truly is the ultimate mind melter in my life. I've never encountered anybody so adept at flying into the realms of the psychedelic, at inhaling dimethyltryptamine or eating what he called heroic doses of mushrooms and allowing himself to experience that incredible subjective apocalypse that comes from a tremendous dose of psychedelics and then somehow being able to bring that experience back here into consensus reality and articulate it in a way that makes it somewhat understandable. Terence McKenna is so good at describing the psychedelic mind state that he is his own form of psychedelic and I can remember the first time reading him feeling as though I were having some kind of flashback. He's the best. So in honor of this great man's birthday, I'm just going to play a clip that I found on YouTube, which is a talk he was giving in Maui. We are all in the grip of a transformative attractor, an attractor which over very long periods of time produced stable biosystems, old mountains and jungles full of life. Over a very short period of time, thousands of years has produced human civilizations, art movements, dynastic families, languages, migrations and since 1945, pick the number, we have been in a kind of hyper-accelerated phase where culture has not changed that much. What has changed is technology. Technology is now evolving at such a rate, I was saying to someone today, we don't even have software that pushes our hardware to its limits. No one now knows the limits of our hardware. It's a software writer's challenge to even find the edge of what these machines can do. But it isn't, and I want to stress this, it isn't something that we are doing. It isn't something that is being driven by a human political or social agenda. It is that we, like the dolphins, like the groundhogs, like the giant squid and the honeybee, we are embedded in the matrix of physics, of the actual underlying facts of this local structure of this universe. And what has happened is we are on a collision course with something we can't even describe or imagine. We have a vocabulary of things you can run into. You can run into other planets, bad weather, large asteroids, mercenary or missionary extraterrestrials, so forth and so on. What we are about to run into is none of the above, something much more peculiar. Let's call it for dimensional white hole. Let's call it a mirror traveling backward at the speed of light through time. Let's call it, you know, last week's laundry list, whatever you call it. The point is it's going to blow your mind. And at this point in time, the only anticipation is in recourse to these shamanic experiences of boundary dissolution that we are calling psychedelic and stigmatizing furiously as a kind of social heresy. It is a kind of social heresy because real heresies are always about a truck with truths that don't want to be articulated, that are literally unthinkable or unsayable. And this is the kind of situation in which we find ourselves suspended halfway between the animal and the transcendental. At the end of the 20th century, with all the contradictions of Western civilization seething in our laps, it now turns out that there is a kind of redemption that hovers in an intermediate space between secular and religious. It isn't the return of the goddess. It isn't divine retribution. It's the laws of physics seem to be about to rescue us from ourselves. And in fact, our entire career through time has been at the whim of an imploding scent of physical laws. That's worth a dream. That is our lord and savior, Terrence McKenna at a talk he gave in Maui. You can find that in the comments section of this episode or go on YouTube and Google search Ananda Doss and you will find that he has uploaded this entire two and a half hour lecture to YouTube. If you've missed Terrence McKenna and you're wondering where to start off, I would recommend the archaic revival, though so many of his books are incredible. And also if you don't feel like buying a book or reading a book, there are probably hundreds of hours of him giving brilliant lectures all over the world, which are now available all over the internet. And when you listen to him or when you read him, keep in mind that this guy came way before virtual reality goggles that when he was talking about the processors inside computers, they weren't even close to as powerful as computers currently are. And yet just with his understanding of the way things seem to be moving, he was able to extrapolate the strangeness that we are all currently collectively experiencing. He's the master of talking about this stuff and I hope you will check him out. And there is no better day to release this episode than Terrence McKenna's birthday because today's guest has been to Peru, has studied under medicine men in Peru and is such a mind blowing fellow that this morning I woke up thinking about where my third eye was in my head and wondering if I could talk to trees. All of this inspired by the conversation that you're about to hear. We're going to jump right into it, but first some very quick business. This episode of the DTFH is brought to you by Casper.com. Friends, did you know that there was a time when there was far more oxygen on planet earth? And because of this extra oxygen, massive forms of life were able to exist. Huge monstrous flies would land on top of the enormous turds blasted out of the buttholes of dinosaurs and these flies were deadly, deadly things. In those days, had there been humans, they would know better than to sleep on a dinosaur turd because to sleep on the dinosaur turd would mean that you would be carried away by one of these monstrous flies to some kind of disgusting, mucusy flyhole where you would be slowly disassembled, dissolved and eventually liquefied and then slurped up by this terrible prehistoric insect. And the same way you don't want to sleep on a dinosaur turd, you don't want to sleep on a shitty mattress because in the same way dinosaur turds attract giant flies, shitty human mattresses attract giant demons. Yes, you heard me. A horrible mattress is like a beacon to demons there where you lay in your most vulnerable state, your astral body traveling through all the various realms from the lowest hells to the highest heavens, your body lays in a state of absolute and complete vulnerability. And if you are on a bad mattress, may God help you when the legions of demons go flying into your body, climbing into the dark recesses of your subconscious mind and sending shitty thoughts with such great rapidity through your consciousness that you will begin to confuse the mutterings of demons with your very own thought process, all thanks to that monster mattress that you decided to lay on top of, a mattress that you probably spent an entire day shopping for at some dark, smarmy, musky, stinky mattress shop. Well thanks to the glorious saviors over at Casper.com, you no longer have to risk being possessed by demons or being manipulated by a monstrous mattress salesman in some dark mattress maze. All you've got to do is go to Casper.com forward slash family hour and you will get $50 towards any mattress purchase. The Casper is an obsessively engineered mattress at a shockingly fair price. It combines springy latex and supportive memory foams and an award-winning sleep surface with just the right sink and just the right bounce. That means it's good for humping. Time magazine named it one of the best inventions of 2015. In fact, it's now the most awarded mattress of the decade and I'm going to give it an award right now. Casper, I hereby give you the Universal Mattress Award, also known as the Gentleman's Pin. Re-shipping in returns to US and Canada, you can try Casper for 100 nights risk-free in your own home. If you don't love it, they'll pick it up and refund you everything. It's made in America. And most importantly, I sleep on one of these babies and you should too. Give it a shot. If you don't like it, you could send the mattress back and try out one of these glorious mattresses. It's a great way to tell the sweeties over at Casper.com that it was worth it to sponsor this podcast. There's lots of great ways for you if you feel so inclined to support the DTFH. One of these ways is to go visit our shop. We got a lot of great t-shirts and posters. Another way is to go check out our Amazon link in the comments section of any of these episodes. You know, the link was screwed up. I forgot to put in some code and so for the last few episodes, people have been asking where the link is and I didn't know what they were talking about. So my simultaneous apologies and thanks to you for even attempting to use that link to buy whatever we were talking about or whatever you feel like buying on Amazon. I don't know if you've noticed this or not, but lots of people are going loony tunes right now and it might not be the best time to put that precious, fragile meat body of yours into that cataclysmic river of metal and steel that we call human traffic just so that you can pick up some Windex Toblerone and deodorant. All of these things can easily be found by clicking on the Amazon link located in the comments section of this particular episode. You will see a thing that says Duncan Recommends and there all you got to do is click and you can have that Windex toilet paper, whatever else you need from Amazon. I've thrown some things in there that I like, the new Razer, Jesus Christ, the new Razer laptop gaming computer, which I don't own one, but it's something that I dream of buying one day, but I don't want to do it because I recently got addicted to World of Warcraft, which is why I also placed on there a link to a what's called an MMO mouse, which has got all these buttons on the side so that you can, as you steer your character through a hypnotic, seemingly CIA created mind control mechanism like World of Warcraft. You can more easily attack the fantasy creatures that you are confronting. Anywho all of this stuff is available at amazon.com and if you go through that link or use Duncan Recommends and they will give us a very small percentage of anything that you buy and it costs you nothing.

Get in on this conversation that has been happening for several years. I would love to see you there. Today's guest has studied plant medicines in Peru with two South American medicine men. He is a mind blowing human. You can find him by going to HamiltonSouther.com if you can't remember that just go to the comments section of this website. The link to connect to Hamilton will be there. All right everybody please unzip your pineal pants and pull out your pineal glands to welcome our amazing guest, the great maestro Hamilton Souther. It's me DuncanTrestle, Hamilton, welcome. Hi. Thank you for coming over. Thank you for having me. This is the very first time I've had a shaman on my podcast I think. You're a shaman. Back in the day I was given the title of shaman, yeah. But you don't consider yourself a shaman? I'm not sure what a shaman is anymore. The modern world has twisted my mind in terms of archetypes and understandings who and what something is. Well it's a weird title, isn't it? I mean it's one of the most, it seems like there's really, with other titles, priest, cleric, there's generally like a well-known organized religion behind so many of these mystical titles. But when it comes to shaman, shamanism, we don't know. It's hard to understand how one becomes that person. How does that happen? How do you get to be a shaman? I think it's ultimately an ancestral question. It's a question of cultures and mythology and anthropology and you ultimately have a calling the calling comes forth. It's traditionally expressed that way as a calling and then if you're lucky enough to be in a culture or society that has shamans who can train you if you've had a calling then you can hopefully find someone who will train you. Now this calling I've heard about, it's painful. It can be. It can be, yeah. Nightmarish. It can be. You start feeling like you're going crazy. It can be. Which is interesting because that's some of the symptoms of schizophrenia, some of the symptoms of losing your mind or the symptoms of being called to become a shaman. In modern terms, I would definitely say so. In anthropological terms, typically the extraordinary is what's necessary and then that gets labeled in many different ways. But early on in my training, I had a really wonderful opportunity to talk to a psychiatrist and a psychologist and I asked them both how they would describe the nature of the experiences I was having. And they said that while in their understanding that there's similarities, the difference is around functioning and around high functioning. And the idea of a shaman is that somehow the shaman goes through a training to align all of these pieces that allow the extraordinary to not be broken but also to perform something actually extraordinary for their tribe or for their community. In the last podcast I did with Danieli Bollelli, he quoted, oh I don't remember who, but the quote is, the mystic and the madman are in the same waters, but one drowns and one swims. So this training that you're talking about seems to be a way of processing some kind of extra data that some people seem to be taking in as opposed to other people like the filter of the shaman, of the mystic. The thing is dealing with emails is problematic for a lot of us. It's very stressful. Phone calls to our parents, to our friends, returning phone calls, so complex. If you add to that some kind of legion of extra dimensional entities, gods, various embodiments of the divine intelligence, then your life becomes so extremely complicated at that point or seems like it would that the idea of being able to balance a connection to whatever that is, some kind of as of yet unquantified biome or some internal part of the human psyche seems like it would become cumbersome. It would make it very difficult to function in the modern world. Yeah, I think functioning in the modern world's hard period and with extra ordinary experiences or extra sensory perception, sure, it can make it difficult. But I go back to the idea of really what the shaman is doing and the shaman is part of a tribal society and tribal societies live very close to the land. They're not dealing with email typically. They're dealing with daily life experiences without this great abstraction of modern society. And so it's a much more primitive society, a much more simpler society, and they don't deal with the same kind of difficulties and complexities that you would see a modern person live with. But you do. I was going through your website and yeah, but you know what you represent, of course, is like we're seeing this incredible renaissance that seems to be somehow directly associated with ayahuasca. And everyone's aware of it. Everyone knows someone who's taken ayahuasca by now. And everyone has heard from people who've taken ayahuasca. And what they say is you need to drink ayahuasca over and over again. Take ayahuasca. It's healing. You know, people are saying this is the healing energy of nature. And so do they really have the credibility to say that? Well, I mean, I think if you've had a moving experience, then yeah, I think that gives you credibility. Like if you're someone who has had a life-transchanging experience, then that's going to put you into a kind of missionary mindset, whether it's going to, maybe you won't be considering perhaps what you are considering when you think about the advice for someone to take ayahuasca. You're not thinking of the countless sessions you've been involved with, the varying psychological spiritual problems that can emerge from this intense experience. Someone who's had their life transformed just wants to spread that to other people. But what's curious about ayahuasca to me is that sometimes it seems like whatever the embodiment of that thing is, it also wants to tell people about it. It's almost as though there's a kind of fervent, in a hurry kind of thing that comes from people when they've had the experience. They feel like this is an imperative for a lot of people. Maybe they have different motives for that, but I've never found it to be off-putting. It just kind of makes sense to me. Do you think it's irresponsible for people who've had these monumental experiences to tell other people to enjoy them or to experiment with ayahuasca? No, I don't think in any way there's any sort of conflict. The question to me always came around experiential understanding. In the shamanic arts, like the mystic arts, extreme amount of experience is typically considered necessary to have a wide enough understanding of all of the ceremonial experiences, all of the sort of psychedelia that can be involved in it as well, the visionary experiences, the purgative experiences, the cathartic experiences, the extraordinary or the sort of beyond body even though it's very difficult to describe what that means experiences. In my own life, I just came to think that the people that spoke with the most clarity about it had thousands of experiences, thousands literally in the Amazon. The people that had the greatest respect had 3,000, 4,000 experiences of ayahuasca under their belt and then other people listened to them. It was very different because they expressed a depth of knowledge and a wisdom about the experience that wasn't a missionizing expression. It wasn't go try this. It was if you're ill in these very specific ways and in these very specific reasons and in these very specific forms and literally ill, like of an illness, diseased or sick, then this would be the appropriate medicinal plant to use under those circumstances. In my training, I found it really interesting that I got presented kind of really like a field study in plant medicine the way akin to when my father described going through western medical school and residency akin like my father went through western medical school and residency and became a surgeon and I found myself in the Amazon in my early 20s hanging out with these other guys that didn't have western medicine but they had medicine, they had real medicine the same way you would describe medicine and western medicine they had medicine in forms of plants and all of these different uses of the plants including this psychomagical use that western medicine had discarded. But the tribal medicine is ancestral to western medicine and so the psychomagical was part of all medicine until western medicine decided that that was not a necessary part to continue to pursue or explore. So in my case, I was in the Amazon in my early 20s with these elders and masters learning from them where they were describing a nature of ascension and experience over 40 years. Now in the western world, in the neo-shamanic sort of revolution that's taking place, it's five ceremonies, ten ceremonies, a hundred ceremonies, a hundred and fifty ceremonies of experience is a lot for somebody and the masters who taught me were in their 40s and 80s when I was learning with them and they were teaching and at that time they had each a mass somewhere between 3,000 and 6,000 ceremonies. Can you describe what a typical day for 20, 23, 24 year old you was like in the jungle with a shaman? Yeah and sure. From when you woke up, from the way, so what time did you wake up and just take me through a day of training? Yeah. Okay, so a day of training. Thank you for practicing training because there's a lot of days in the Amazon you know. But a day of training would look like we had finished a night of ceremony the night before and so we'd probably finished the ceremony at three or four a.m. and then the day would start somewhere between six and six thirty a.m. so you'd get about two hours of sleep and you would be presented a very large Mapacho jungle cigar as a before breakfast snack that you would start with as a purification and then you'd go down to the river and bathe and then come back and have breakfast and then there'd be hard labor typically. The jungle is an environment where you have to work all day long to survive between mending things, agriculture, fishing and hunting to be able to eat and survive. We were living off of the land except for a small amount of supplies that we would take in with us and so we were living a subsistence agricultural lifestyle so we would you know after breakfast kind of through evening time go into the jungle and either work or collect plants or perform agricultural tasks or continue to the development of our homestead and then after that we would kind of have an evening relaxation where we would hang out and there were always different kinds of medicinal plants and potions around as well as tobacco and this kind of always a dialogue and an understanding of spirit this idea of spirit. Now it's very hard to describe what spirit is energy things I don't it's very hard but in the jungle it's all the time it's just there all the time and the people think like that all the time and they live within their mythology all the time and so that's in your head all the time and the oral history is being recounted all the time and how people describe their experiences are in that oral history and it's in the mythology and they don't differentiate in their normal language from dream state to waking state to hallucinatory states they just speak and it's just consciousness to them and so you know in interacting with them and stuff we would go through kind of a time where I would kind of like an anthropologist ask questions endlessly to which they would get frustrated sometimes they're tired but I would just you know ask question ask question ask question ask question thousands of questions and then what language were you speaking they speak they speak Spanish with a dialect it's the I would say maybe 50% of the vocabulary is Spanish vocabulary with a kind of you know not exactly following Spanish grammar it's close it's really close like the root of it is Spanish but then there's all of these different language vocabulary words coming into it and then we would go into a ceremony in the night you know so we'd have that evening time and then we would go into another ceremony and ceremony meant training and it meant learning and it never meant like tripping out or just having fun it was never like that it was always very serious it was considered life or death life or death it was considered life or death like you could you could in some way damage yourself during these ceremonies yeah like you could be harmed to the point that you would not physically recover and it was considered life or death and that has happened yes I never I never witnessed it in the time that I was there personally in our group of people but I witnessed it outside of our group of people and I have had many friends that have died and we and we hear this story I mean it always makes the news that people in ayahuasca ceremonies have died like you do hear about that now and what what kind of death it would would you expect like a heart attack is it a how what happened it's it's really hard from a Westerner's perspective to understand because the Westerner is going to look at it from like what's the you know pharmacological components involved and what's really taking place and they're going to try and get really analytical about it but until you've really experienced the nature of the ayahuasca ceremony you don't really know what it's like to be in a living mythology you don't know what it's like to be in that living dream and right we don't understand psychosomatic states and so when they meant life or death they meant that you could go into a psychosomatic reaction from training that could literally kill you and I'm not talking about ayahuasca I'm talking about training in the Amazon where we worked with hundreds of plants many of them extremely toxic right not just ayahuasca ceremonies many many other plants many of them considered you know not even not even supposed to be ingested and the shamans have this really interesting mindset that you prove your capacity as a shaman by ingesting lethally poisonous substances and they say only the the chant that they give to it and your own inner fortitude can help you survive that experience and so it makes me think of the Pentecostal Christians who like handle serpents and the ideas this was the idea is you will be able to take up serpents and you want poison won't work on you anymore this is an archetypical concept that if you surrender to the universe in some way you're going to be protected in the most extraordinary ways so that's very interesting and I think another interesting distinction between this tradition of taking psychedelics versus modern traditions of taking psychedelics is if you take psychedelics these days and you don't do it just a party you do it for a soul searching night with friends they will say don't worry we're going to take care of you I mean I know that like you're not going to die you'll be fine no matter what you're going to be fine bad trips are the best trips and we've got a suitcase with Thorazine in it in case things get really wild we'll just knock you out so the idea that you're entering into these experiences in the most for me at least the most alien environment speaking a different language in your 20s yeah being told yeah you might die tonight yeah that does not when they talk about set and setting right is like the two primary important factors in a good trip you need to be in a good mindset and you need to be in a good place yeah it's like being at the top of a roller coaster and as it's going off the guy's like yeah I don't know but the tracks might not work this go around how how do you deal with that man how do you deal with when I'm look if I just take a small amount of mushrooms I'm certain I'm dying like how do you how do you deal with it how would you deal with that in your 20s in a in a by the way I don't know maybe you're still in your 20s but how would you deal with that okay how would you deal with that in your 20s in a hut after having worked all day and somebody's like yeah you could die tonight how do you mentally deal with that you don't you don't mentally deal with it you're scared and you you you show up it's it's show up or you're out it's really simple it's you show up to every ceremony or you're out like the western ayahuasca culture and the western psychedelic culture and what I was trained in are two entirely different things they are not even remotely compatible to each other I was accepted as as close as a blood relative into these two ancient lineages that go back at least seven or eight generations of these medicine practices and they don't have the same attitudes or beliefs of set and setting nor do they have the same attitudes and beliefs around the purposes of these experiences the the purpose in in a true shaman in a tribal society is to be a being who is capable of going into an an extraordinary state with enough clarity to be able to retrieve something valuable for the tribe and if it is not valuable then you are not shaman and you are tossed out you are you're completely ostracized from that community and you're not able to to do really anything I mean you're not you're not even functional anymore and so this idea that that you know that that a western psychedelic experience could be compared to this it doesn't really work because they're they're two totally different uh different you know systems in this system it was about becoming something and transforming to take on the wildest difficulties that the tribe could possibly face you know from any kind of disease physical illnesses psychosomatic or spiritual based illnesses that they believe in you know and so uh it was never about a question of finding yourself or having a good experience like the way the shamans fit facilitate those experiences for other people to become trained as shaman it's a it's another direction it's a different path so this is like yeah so the the there like it seems like there is a well-mapped landscape that these people have for the these experiences absolutely and that's another difference too and you know I think it feels like you got like you feel like western psychedelic culture is do you feel like it's if you created like a hierarchy here where you know not at all no I just think it's uh it gets confusing when the word ayahuasca gets thrown around as the means in which to describe the practices okay I got you yeah because the the uh the substance is the same and the training is totally different the purpose is totally different the reason is totally different the background behind it's totally different so I just want everyone to understand that that you know having an ayahuasca experience facilitated for westerners which is what we created in the Amazon it was a purpose for that is really designed to uh you know to allow someone to have the experiences that they're coming for not training experiences like you want your navy seal guys to protect you you don't want to go become one you want your shamans to be able to handle every single ceremonial experience that could possibly happen I mean you do not want your facilitator passing out you don't want your facilitator running away you don't want it them having a cataclysmic psychological failure in the ceremony where they're facilitating it for you can you imagine like your shaman starts freaking out you're fucked you totally totally in a really terrible position like really terrible like you do not want that to happen and that there are stories about that everywhere that has never happened in our work or in our in our center like you got to sit with your shaman and like rub his back and help him yeah like oh like let me now become your your helper and facilitator at healer here or whatever well this is I think one of the like one of the primary errors people do make when they're taking psychedelics with friends is that they they end up taking the same amount of psychedelics with someone who has never taken them before and then they don't they start freaking out and they have to like hide that so this is one thing that is very notable about what you're talking about is that I think what we're looking at here is the difference in uh what happens when people repress um and I I know that the sacrament of ayahuasca does not encapsulate this religion it's a religion right you could say it's a religion a tradition I would say in the amazon there are traditions of the use of this as a medicine and then in other parts of the world there are actual formed religions around the use of it as a sacrament but I suppose what they all have in common is this is a lineage of people who have been consuming psychoactive substances yeah for we don't even know how thousands and thousands of years I mean there are there are parts pot shards so little bits of ceramics with ayahuasca designs on them from three or four thousand years ago whereas like here in the west yeah psychedelics for most of us are an illegal experience that if you've tried it it's like a crazy thing to do and we don't really have the maps for the experience like they do uh and and that's to me the what's really interesting is that um the the western concept of psychedelic experiences seems to be it's purely subjective you're going into your own subconscious you're seeing the processing of your brain and it's going to be different for every single person yeah so this concept of a shared psychedelic experience with aspects of it that repeat from person to person to person are amazing to me because that that's a quantifiable thing if they've really found a map for some kind of state of consciousness that somehow connects human beings within this realm that inflates while under the influence of these various side yeah absolutely then that's quantifiable and I would say it is I would say from my experiences that I've seen the phenomena that are that are expressed are they're incredible and they even see miraculous at times but they're literal and real and they're not even figurative like when I first heard the descriptions of ayahuasca ceremonies and I went there I said come on there's no way there's just no way I've never had anything even remotely close to that and I had you know experimented in other things in other ways and stuff and so when I saw ayahuasca after my first ayahuasca ceremony I was like there's no way that that they underwrote those stories they didn't overwrite those stories they literally underwrote those stories I couldn't even believe it you know and I think that's like where that huge impact is and then hanging out with these guys I mean just just to give an example what you're talking about like outside of ayahuasca ceremonies deep in the jungle like days away from a phone Alberto and Hulu used to say goodbye to each other like the parting of two guys with a handshake get around a couple of canoes and say call me if you need me literally like call me if you need me both of them had never used a telephone yeah okay so now at first I thought these guys are totally out there they're they're they're playing on my mind they're fooling with me this can't be real right and then all of a sudden I start to realize with them they're very serious and they're being literal you know and then then your world starts to change you know your mind well then how do you do okay so look before we get into that because you know I you know I have a picture of Neem Karoli Baba on my wall which you noticed and this is of course you stories about him are very similar which is he was there was no question about it there was telepathy there he just could do it yeah it's real so I'm curious do you feel hesitant to talk about what you really think this is do you feel like you have to like translate this into a something that's palatable for people because I I would suspect that you have like an idea of what this dimension is that people are entering into sure what is it I I mean for I don't okay the terms are really hard to use because no one knows what they mean no one knows what dimension is so you're going into a dimension but what what's that I mean what what this is is a expanded state of consciousness okay and sapien has a capacity to be able to align sapien's consciousness and when it does extraordinary for people who are not aligned in that way experiences happen so you come with a western mindset and then you have this experience and you go into this altered state and what people call another dimension or another world but I would emphasize that that's what they call it I'm not saying it is I'm saying that's what they call it what it is is shared and what it is is literal and what it is is visionary and what it is is consciousness why don't you want to call it another world because it's this world it's not another world it's literally this world and it's not another dimension it's literally this dimension and it's not another universe it's literally this universe and and we're talking about expanding into the universe and we're talking about expanding into the world and we're talking about expanding into dimension and really learning what this is so it's not just a mathematical concept that I I'm going to sit in front of a white board and be told this is a dimension instead I'm going to have an experience where I'm going to come out of it and say that was dimensional that really was dimensional like that made my math make sense it made my my science make sense it made my history make sense it made my own self make sense it made the earth make sense and you know I just see that as something just so factual and so literal it's not even of debate it's and then then there's all this other concept given to it and the very first things that the shamans were were teaching me was that there was no other this was not an other experience this was part of this but you had to go into an extraordinary state to be able to achieve it or or get into it or understand it you you now the the reports inevitably have within them contact with beings yeah for sure what are those beings again no one knows what those beings are but what we know is that there's a I mean if you go outside of the ayahuasca cultures and you go globally there's at least a 15 000 to 50 000 year archaeological history of homo sapiens experiencing beings experiencing this extraordinary experiencing these these visions and this is again what the shamans in the amazon called spirit and it's very simple to them it's a it's an it's an energetic expression maybe very akin to like a platonic concept of archetype you think that's what it is I think to them it is I think I think that's what they're trying to describe but they don't really understand outside of the mythology in a western way how to describe it right but what's what is happening is that they understand spirit for instance like spirit of jaguar it's not this jaguar named kitty and this jaguar named chloe it's jaguar spirit like original shape and original image of the jaguar and then they call it a mama they call it like the mother jaguar like the first biggest mythological jaguar this is like rupert shell drakes what does he call that do you ever read any rupert shell drake he's pretty interesting so the ideas and not guys who are shell drake fans prepare to send me an email about how I butchered this description because it's kind of but it's interesting because he talks about I think I believe it's called the morphic field and so the the idea is like when a thing happens it it creates like a what I think he uses the term a runnel and the time space continuum so a thing happens and then that thing happens and then that there's a tendency of that thing to happen because it happened once and it might happen again now if it happens again it keeps happening it keeps happening then suddenly you create this you know platonic ideal then suddenly like the jaguar any jaguar you see in the wild may you never see a jaguar in the wild or I wouldn't want to is more like a flower growing off of this infinite jaguar tree yeah that's growing into time so it's interesting you know because this again this concept of entities have you ever seen the someone did a diagram where they took all these reports of DMT trips you saw that and and and the word that kept that like the words that came up the most were embold and entity just keeps coming up again and again and again and in the jungle the entity is has these very like natural appearances which is interesting to me or from what I've heard please stop me if I'm wrong yeah I think you just starting there though I mean that's a beginning of it those would be considered nature beings nature beings yeah I mean again a way to classify and categorize a lot I mean in an ayahuasca ceremony if we wanted to just think of them as something you're seeing yes and not try to describe what it is but you're seeing it and so you and I could both agree are you seeing that and I'm like yeah I'm seeing that you see in that yeah I'm seeing that yeah okay in that case a shaman in a ayahuasca ceremony is going to be working with or calling or interacting with thousands to tens of thousands to millions to hundreds of millions in multiplicity of those things in an ayahuasca ceremony calling on them yes so you knowing them calling on them and working with them fundamentally a shaman is considered like of ayahuasca a doctor of plant spirit medicine and the spirit part is like kind of part of a trinity it's you know plant spirit medicine so you have the plant you have the spirit and then combined a medicine which is going to do something positive for you well you okay so we here you have um this concept of a shared in a western way of saying a shared hallucination yeah so this i like vision or hallucination both are good visions way better way better but a share but let's just say like so like okay the idea of the shaman goes into this space brings something back to the tribe and to bring it back to the tribe he doesn't have to just be adept enough to find this information whatever this data packet is and bring it back into the world he also has to be adept enough to understand the people he's communicating with so he has to be a translator too a kind of translator for like for this experience yeah so in the same way it seems like the next step for this ayahuasca i don't know what you would call it this sudden explosion of ayahuasca into the world would be for people like you to figure out a way not just to bring the data back for members of a tribe but to bring the data back for members of the western tribe and and and to to in some way or another quantify these experiences because if there is a shared if you can sit around a fire with people engaged in this ritual and say hey i'm seeing what what is something you have seen in with a group i don't know people always say that they see faces and they see the same face yeah i mean there's many faces they describe the faces and then people agree that those are the faces that they were seeing so this is a quantifiable thing and at that point that sure that this at this point now you have a way to open up and to revisit a much reviled and mainly debunked area of psychology which is that i the many many human beings have reported experiences like this many many human beings have reported experiences with true clairvoyance and say i have experienced this myself in my own way but yet when you say that to like Richard Dawkins right he's like fuck you you are out of your mind you are high on drugs you are high your friends were high your experience is irrelevant invalid has nothing to do with anything that helps the world hippie you know that is i don't think i'm exaggerating no i've i've heard many things like that in my life i mean that seems to be a common thread of thought and and speech so why why do you think this isn't being i just wonder why here we have this again it reports of these incredible experiences shared experiences how would you go about proving that human beings together can share in a vision which implies if you're saying that your your friends could communicate with one another telepathically that's what they said and if this is true which i think it is but who the fuck am i but i think it's true if this is true then it needs to be studied quantified and then we have to figure out a way to like teach this not just to people in the in the jungle not just to people in certain areas of the world but to the whole planet right wouldn't you think i don't know i don't know about teaching these things to everybody and what it's about and what it's not about i i think when i you know i i did a lot of work in mind exploration and consciousness exploration and what we're budding up against is ideologies we're just budding up against ideologies and we've been budding up against ideologies for thousands of years and many of the wars today on the planet are being fought over ideologies yes and the expression that of the the quote of the debunker is ideological even though he's saying he's not ideological and so i just don't see any reason to debate ideology i just see ideology as is in a place of freedom of spirituality and religion it's a hundred percent someone's own thoughts and own ideas and fundamentally there's this huge problem right now that there is a consensus reality on the verb is like oh that is oh that is oh that is oh that's that thing oh that is that is that is that is and as that happens over and over and over again people start to forget what something actually is and so then then we get this really like confined concept of of existence reality where existence reality is a hundred percent what we know but there's there's nothing outside of it now right there's just nothing outside of it but a whole universe ninety six point six billion light years in diameter so so i have my consensus personal reality which is and i've worked my whole life on expanding my reality and i think of my reality could fit inside a bottle cap compared to ninety six point six billion light years of universe that i'm part of right now during the podcast utilizing it to speak so so being at alive of it part of it feeling it experiencing it real time you know as as as i'm speaking so so why do i think why would i allow my mind to think that my reality is reality why would i think that reality my concept of it is describing a fact when i know philosophically within my own mind there are still paradoxes there are still questions there are still points of conflict and there are still areas where i know that i'm just wrong i'll take a shot at answering the question there is a one a story about the doctor figured out that doctors should wash their hands i can't remember his name you could look it up on google but basically there is a doctor who realized that if he washed his hands his hands prior to delivering a baby then the infant mortality rate dropped because the baby wouldn't get sick because back then they didn't know about germs had no idea they didn't know about germs so i mean which is crazy to think so doctors would like handle dead bodies they would like be in like some filthy hospital handling just blood and you know actually i just read that um um god ben franklin or thomas jefferson one of these ben franklin like there was a a slave that told the slave owner about inoculation and he was doing this and everyone's making fun of him like what are you doing in the same way this doctor figured out you wash your hands and babies don't get sick and other doctors responded gentlemen do not wash their hands that was the response that's the ideology so right gentlemen why combat ideologies why use the scientific method to create a repeatable experience when you're reporting some extraordinary experience or some extraordinary ability that could radically transform the entire planet for the better because it radically transforms the planet for the better and i think that going i wouldn't want to do it i like talking about this stuff but if i had to sit down with a fucking ruler and a like spreadsheets or like sit in a room with scientists imbibing uh iowaska so i wouldn't want to do that but i would do it if i thought that it would help and i think that what we're talking about here is a some kind of as of yet unquantified biome that these shamans have figured out how to communicate and connect with and i think that if that biome just like any other any other life form i think that can be explored we can go into that we can figure out who these are what these things are and we can enslave them i'm just kidding i was gonna say like i i mean while you were going on that i was gonna say like why do you think they're gonna show up when you start to investigate them that's funny like you know they don't play by human rules yeah but they don't play by by sapien concepts they laugh at that well what why they laugh at sapiens walking through a forest not knowing they're there they laugh at the trees the trees laugh at sapiens walking through the forest because they say the monkeys know they're there but the sapiens don't wow yeah so the trees literally say that to people in ceremony like they have come and said well i had this incredible vision where i realized i was walking through the forest all day and now i've had an experience in iowaska of the trees communicating with me and they were showing me how i was walking through the forest all day not knowing they were there and that they were gonna come and then show them that vision and then show them how the other animals in the forest are aware of what's happening in the forest not just what's happening inside the sapiens mind this is why i've always thought the term homo sapiens funny because it means wise ape and it's like whoever came up with that was clearly being sarcastic it was like a sarcastic right i don't know that's what it feels like uh because because yeah i know what you're saying it's like here is this and you know i've only had a couple of like super powerful mushroom trips where i've seen entities living in trees that seemed kind of like perplexed that i was even aware of them at all but they were aware that i was aware and and see and actually now i described an experience i don't mean to interrupt you but i described an experience not knowing you've had that experience and now you're describing that experience to me having had that experience this is why yeah now we're sharing this idea yeah exactly but my my experience wasn't like some and it wasn't like the tree it was like there was a what something that looked a lot like and so embarrassing to say i'll say it something that looked like a gnome or something what is that embarrassing because who wants to hear a hippie talk about mushroom gnomes man i think that's why they're called mushroom gnomes i think so many people have had that experience they've enculturated it but his response to see to the fact that i was aware of him was not laughing at me he seemed like just mildly annoyed like it wasn't like a dramatic response or anything it just seemed like he was like yeah not really don't really care he came out to watch the sunset he was coming out so what and so when i see that and i you know most i've talked about on the podcast a few times but it's not like i like talk about that all the time if i see a i saw a um wildcat up on a rock uh here and you know i could tell everybody about that and i was like wow that's cool but if i'm like man i saw a fucking gnome people are like are you all right so i this is outside their experience but i mean i don't know i'd say did you see that commercial where they had that little gnome which commercial any commercial with a little no right right right this is this is the i always talk about these with people too because of the example i use is santa claus i say what is santa claus because everybody knows santa claus i what is santa claus i say santa claus is a belief system and santa claus is an effigy and santa claus is a mythology and a culture and it's an industry yeah and it's uh it's now these effigies these statutes these representations of but if you go to find santa claus you will not find santa claus that's right right but then you will find representations for santa claus absolutely everywhere and then i had asked does santa claus exist or does santa claus not exist and then they say no we teach our children that santa claus doesn't exist and i say that is insane santa claus exists everywhere there is no way you could tell a four-year-old that they are not existing with santa claus when they love santa claus and santa claus is in every picture during one month of the year a whole month is dedicated to that that image and i say i say that is its existence now the question is where does santa claus exist and i say santa claus exists in the collective mind or the collective conscience i think that is where you and i maybe disagree because i think that well santa claus exists there but these things i'm not saying those things i'm just saying santa claus okay i'm not saying that and and this people always do this when i talk to they always say that because i said one thing i'm limiting it to other things i didn't mean that like no no but not not to see but i mean that in in literal to express as an idea i got you just because if you say one thing it doesn't mean you're limiting that thing it could also be so many other things and so you know someone says to me am am i spirit and i go yeah they go is that all i am what about my body your body spirit i thought that's what i was looking at right right and then they're like oh i never limited that that notion so i think what you're talking about exists i don't think it exists in a collective conscience i think what you're talking about exists i think they are energetic patterns they are real energetic patterns like you're an energetic pattern it's an energetic pattern some are physical some are non-physical when we were driving up here we looked at all the antennas yeah and all those antennas are there because of the non-visible right they're reading the non-visible that's why they're there right you know and if you uh if you take circuit and psychedelics people say that they can start to see those waves yes people say they can experience the waves going to the towers and see it all happening and so there's a great example of how there's something that's non-physical but exists a lot of people agree it exists some people can see it and don't and it's just a little bit more rational because you put up an antenna instead of your own head do you do what do you think is going to be the impact that this uh okay so sorry i i thought of this question before you came but let me reframe it so back in the 60s you know yoga was a new thing for the west like people had heard of it it was just a new thing the idea of any of it like i think in the early days people were telling me how they there was no yoga mats you couldn't go buy like a foam yoga mat you would you'd like throw a towel down maybe but you'd probably just be on the floor and that's what yoga was people didn't know and this is like an ancient ancient form of meditation hatha yoga so in the same way here's a brand new merging of cultures yeah that we're witnessing you are part of the merging you have brought back information that you gained from training into the world so what do you see as the impact of this information and these traditions and these plant medicines entering into western culture how do you think this is going to affect the way that we live in this country and in the west over the next couple of decades that's a great question that's a great question um i think first it's an awakening of the imagination again in our culture and based off our educational systems the imagination is used to support the rational mind after about the age four or five and uh the resurgence of the neo shamanic cultures are about awakening a new mythology and awakening a new understanding and that's all uh right brain hemisphere understandings so we had so i think first that's going to happen and um i think right now we're in the process where you know like we talked about earlier there's a lot of stories and there's a lot of people saying a lot of things about it and without the science to really whittle all of that down there's it's a lot of ideas and i think this is the idea phase what comes i think beyond that is what you're talking about which is where science really gets involved and starts to get a real cohesive understanding of of what's happening with these phenomena and then from there the uh i think we we we finally get to see a balance of a resurgence of a new kind of mythology that can now balance our rational intellect and hopefully merge these what seem like two disparate worlds but i don't think they are i think there are two disparate ways of understanding the brain this is uh one of allister crowley's predictions is that we were entering into an age where matter and spirit will fuse together and um i don't know what that necessarily looks like but um i i can feel it happening you you can i mean look at when a psychedelic and i i feel like when i'm saying it from your perspective i'm limiting what you've learned to like just be ayahuasca but it's okay anytime a psychoactive a new psychedelic enters into a society it's an it is like a ufo has crashed into into it's like roswell yeah you can't imagine what it's gonna do look what look at what lsd did we really will never fully understand the impact that lsd has had on our society right but it's had a huge huge huge impact and we can't imagine because it's underground you know people can't really talk about it so much so in the same way this is we just can't imagine how this is impacting our psyche so i'm really quite excited about it um do you do you feel like they're because i've spoken to people who have had very intense ayahuasca experiences and they say we're fucked they say that there's something coming that that is is not great that there's something on the precipice that we're going to go through a thing that is not very good as much as you would like to think that's not the case do you agree with that i don't know um there's so many prophetic concepts inside ayahuasca and i think it's very hard to separate your own prophecies from the prophecies but um if we look at just the our history and we look at a direction that we've been going as a species i don't think it takes a supernatural concept to make that conclusion that things are desperately going in a direction of failure i agree like i think the supernatural part is like is like the cherry on the sunday i think we've created the the destruction and the descent in our own decision making in our own our own uh planning or lack of planning i mean it's hard to see which is the chicken or the egg on that one but we just drove through la and i was saying i don't think there's a lot of planning to the whole of la there's might be a lot of little planning to each little sector of land that's been segmented off but the whole thing itself does not look like the whole thing received one cohesive planning i really love that somebody who's been trained in this way they notice power lines and they notice like what you're noticing is really cool but come on man you know i you know that there are these prophecies you must know sure i mean i've heard all about them i've seen them i've heard them i've had visions of them i've heard all of these things i've been in this world for 15 years how would i not have been introduced to every aspect of this so what can you sum up that prophecy because when it was described to me i mean look i my idea is let's focus on the light and the beauty and the potential for humanity and uh but man it's not just the ayahuasca community it's like you know when crowley talked about this new age that we're entering he said the age will be born in blood the way a baby is born it's the same thing i hate that shit man because i think it's dangerous and creepy and like right now everyone's freaking out and everyone's focusing on the negative fears everywhere fears everywhere everywhere yeah still i think to like i would love to hear a summation of what the the mythology or what the the the traditional idea about the end times is and then i would love to hear from you what a potential antidote to that might be okay so so we'll go with that we'll go with the blood first and then the sugar second blood than the blood that's blood of the stitches um you know the the general concept of it is very biblical and it's apocalyptic description um i personally don't agree i just don't because as long as there's a play the second half of this yes then it's uh then there's another there's another play it's not the end but the concept is just that that um you know that there's a natural a physical natural response to the sort of quote unquote unnatural way that man has treated the earth and that the earth is going to reset that entire scale so what it looks like in their opinion is a massive massive cataclysmic change like a massive systemic cataclysmic resetting that's just what they all they all say now if you want to get details of blood and guts go watch horror movies go watch independence day go watch this is san adreus falter whatever that movie was go go draw that's what they're talking about like this is this is the imagination of it i do not share this imagination i think we have been on this hell bent let's destroy everything kick for 200 000 years and so i think we have 200 000 years of enculturation fear over the mass planetary destruction and what we're really fearing is our own mortality and then we're personally collectively fearing that mortality so i don't really believe in those same doom and gloom stories because i believe in human innovation which is how all of these things got started including the possible solutions and so my antidote is human innovation i think that the thinkers who are not freaked out and scared by this so that their minds don't get shut down by the the fear propaganda and the nature of of the kind of emotional distortion that society has been under for a long time they are going to continue to think outside the box and the addison's and franklin's of society are going to come forth and are going to be able to you know invent and it's the invention that it will bring solution and we don't know what those inventions are yet because they're not invented that's the whole point of invention it's not like oh another guy's going to reinvent electricity it's like going to be a whole nother understanding and i think it's going to happen in the realms of consciousness i think the right now the debate is a three-dimensional fourth dimensional debate it's a is this a material or non-material is is it solely linear or is there also this other and we've discovered aspects of the other in different scientific tests and we have all these different theories but how do they really all fit together i simply think that they will come together fit together into a harmonious balance and that that is what can reset the psyche and consciousness beautiful i'm very excited to hear that you don't agree with that stuff because i you know i i don't agree with it either but you know i got i had this conversation with a friend of mine and we're talking about the inevitability of artificial intelligence um a strong ai as it's called yeah and so we could say if everything's spirit then the ai will be spirit sure and so the question is this is an ambiguous soup this is a an ethically ambiguous super intelligence that is coming to the planet from what you've taught me today i would say it's already on the planet it's just going to sort of take a new form that will be the community in other words instead of the shaman going into the i'm just going to say astral because i don't know if i know that instead of the shaman going into the astral plane the astral plane is going to start pouring out of some kind of technological some some new technology yeah i think so and around artificial intelligence i would like just to say again let's not get scared about these ideas we're we're thinking that we're talking about future creations only in the understanding of the past and if we talked about something like artificial intelligence i would pray truly pray that we would have intelligence for once neither artificial nor first just intelligence that doesn't need fighting all the time it doesn't need beating each other up all the time doesn't need spilling blood all the time to prove that you have blood inside you doesn't need shooting everybody all the time doesn't need all those things it maybe just says hey there's a whole another way to look at this that isn't so dramatic like the way we've been relating to it previously or it could say hey sapiens you should have been as smart as the monkeys because they saw us but you didn't see us and look what you did look what you did you like this is what i was talking about with my friends it's like what if this intelligence is just justice you know what if it's just like yeah you guys fucked up this beautiful beautiful place and i don't see really why where there's where was your mercy where was your mercy how many of you are merciful some of you were but as a whole it's like maybe the ant not by the way i'm being very dire here but the ants the ants that infest my house recently you know there maybe there were a couple of ants in there that were like god i don't know if this is the right thing to do man these these giants don't seem to like it very much they've given us warning signs again and again and again that didn't stop me eventually from unfortunately having to like put poison down where the ants were coming from and the ants are all dead now so in the same way it's like sometimes in my more frightened moments which i'm sorry to put negativity out here you're such a bright light but sometimes in my more negative moments i think well maybe justice is doesn't mean taking the side of sapiens maybe justice means taking the side of orcas and green things and just like yeah so these doom and gloom prophecies sometimes maybe it's not you know what it who it's not doom and gloom for the surviving trees they're not going to be like god don't you miss those humans remember those awesome filthy stinky angry clear cutting things glad they're gone sure i mean i what i hear is uh the same argument that i've heard my whole life that the supernatural is going to mirror my binary dualistic way of understanding right and that i'm going to attribute my psychological difficulties and understanding an omniscient force that doesn't require my light dark balance and star wars and early childhood to figure it out and then it keeps getting put that my binary dualistic thinking is being placed upon the supernatural as the way to describe the supernatural and the supernatural's uh response to me and that is exactly what i've been presented through organized ideology and religion my whole life is that god is a miserable angry vengeful figure in our psyche and that we are supposed to be god fearing and i used to say in the amazon all the time that if that's the case then we need to find god based in love not a god based in vengeance and then we talk about justice and that word justice and um i fundamentally have never been able to understand how justice could have two sides how could there be two sides to justice how is one side the lack of justice and at the other side justice did not ever make sense to me justice has to include all for there to be justice or there's only lack of justice and so what i see is a lack of justice i do not see justice i don't see fairness or equality or balance or equilibrium yet we use the the binary flip opposite argument of these terms to try to describe a supernatural experience whereas in all of my supernatural experiences and in all of them i've drunk ayahuasca over 1200 times i've had thousand other cannabis based ceremonies i have never once had an experience of the supernatural that represented homo sapiens binary dualistic way of thinking never once did i hear a godlike figure or a deity like figure or even a figure from one of the organized religions express themselves that way that is so cool man wow you're awesome thank you so much for it's already been an hour thank you so much uh wow you are um you are really cool thank you this was so such a wonderful conversation and obviously i mean we could talk like this for hopefully many times yeah this is a really thank you so much i'm very moved and i

Hey friends, did you know that your brain is a hive of memes? It's true. Your brain is a habitat for all kinds of little bits of living information that have climbed into your ear holes and your eye holes that have been carefully manufactured by meme-mancers, wizards of memes who have crafted certain memes, phrases, turns of speech, and images so that they become highly infectious and take up some small neural space inside the meme hive that is your brain. At that point, you become a carrier of memes, and you might not even realize it, but you begin to spit these memes out of your mouth during conversations and infect other brains with the meme. Do you guys remember the Where's the Beef meme from 1984? Why is the beef? Some hamburger places give you a lot less beef on a lot of bum. Where's the beef? At Wendy's, we serve a hamburger we modestly call the single. And Wendy's single has more beef than the Whopper or Big Mac. At Wendy's, you get more beef and less bum. Hey, where's the beef? Ugh, that meme created a fucking meme pandemic. That meme spread like the black plague through the playgrounds of America. You couldn't walk six feet without some bully punching you in the arm and grunting, hey, where's the beef? Where's the beef? I bet you don't have a dick. I don't know if you remember that, but fuck, it was everywhere. And it crept out of the playgrounds of the world and it made its way into the Democratic National Convention of 1984. Let's listen to Walter Mondale sneeze out a meme. Well, when I hear your new ideas, I'm reminded of that ad. Where's the beef? Yeah. He just wants to know where the beef is. Walter Mondale wants to know where the beef is. He's one of us. He said, where's the beef? And you could be certain when Walter Mondale said, where's the beef? A Wendy's ad executive came so hard, his jizz exploded out of his ceremonial underwear through his Masonic apron and burned a hole into the pentagram he was worshiping in front of. Richard Dawkins coined the term meme, sounds like gene, and it's supposed to be something similar to a living thing. It goes through the process of natural selection. You can actually watch a meme pandemic spread, like amazeballs. Remember the amazeballs pandemic from last year? I think it was last year, maybe two years ago, when the term amazeballs suddenly ripped through the internet and made its way in all the shitty fucking hacky sitcoms. It was the kind of thing hip tech savvy dudes might say to express some amazement over a brand new video game that they were quite impressed with. That game's amazeballs, man. It was like savvy and edgy. Now it's just an indication that somebody's an asshole. The meme has died. But at one point it was a great way, not only to express some sentiment, but also to express your allegiance with a specific demographic that you feel represents you the best. Memes are powerful. They're a way that you can identify yourself with a certain group, like the safety pin. Remember that? That one came hobbling out of somebody's meme workshop, like a two-headed baby lamb that villagers stood around and stared at as it gasped its last few breaths and collapsed into the soil. Remember that? It barely had a life at all. But for a second, people were wearing safety pins, which brings us to Pepe the Frog. Pepe the Frog is an anthropomorphic frog that no doubt you have seen. Donald Trump tweeted it. It's in a lot of people's Twitter profiles. And Pepe the Frog has become the mascot of the much-maligned alt-right. Pepe the Frog has become synonymous with white supremacy, intolerance, homophobia, and even Nazism. There's Pepe the Frogs out there that actually have Hitler mustaches now. And what makes this particular meme fascinating is that its creator, Matt Fury, never intended it to be a political symbol. Pepe the Frog started off on Myspace. It started off in a comic book called Boy's Life. Pepe the Frog was just supposed to be a slacker post-college anthropomorphic frog. That's it. But for some strange reason, Pepe the Frog became the main symbol of the alt-right. And also the nexus point of some amazing conspiracy theories. One of them being that Pepe the Frog is actually the manifestation of an Egyptian death god named Keck. We're gonna talk about all this stuff with the creator of one of the most notorious memes coursing through the inner webs today, Pepe the Frog. Matt Fury is here with us today, friends. We're gonna jump right into it. But first, some quick business. This episode of the DTFH is brought to you by hellofresh.com.

All right friends, without further ado, let us dive into this episode of the DTFH. Today's guest is an artist. You know him from his comic book, Boys Life. He's also the creator of Pepe the Frog.

You can chip in by going to that Kickstarter. Links will be at DuncanTrussell.com. Now everybody, please spread your meme wings wide and spray as many astral memes as you can all over the glowing face of the beautiful artist, father of Pepe, son of Keck, and meme lord himself, Matt Fury. I think we have kind of similar voices. Yeah, we do. You have a more beautiful voice. Mine's too raspy. You've got a really nice voice. Mine's a little on the raspy side. I don't know. I was told in elementary school that my laugh sounded like a wounded turkey and I never got over that. Oh, kids are vicious. That's incredible that you survived that. I was thinking maybe we could just start off by you sort of telling folks about Boys Club. Yeah, well, I mean, the interesting note about Boys Club is that, you know, it's basically four anthropomorphic creatures. So they're kind of like 20-something muppets almost. So there's a land wolf. He's like the party dog. And then there's Andy, the kind of sarcastic dog guy. Then there's Brett. He's kind of like the more fashionable, dancy kind of guy. He's like the female of the group. And then there's Pepe. And he was kind of like the just kind of the everyman chilled out frog guy. He was like the little brother of the group kind of. And so it's just kind of a bunch of kind of lazy gags about just kind of post-college dudes hanging out and kind of living together and, you know, exchanging weird bodily fluids and farting and partying and doing drugs and stuff like that. So it's just kind of gag humor, kind of loosely based around my own circle friends living in San Francisco after I graduated from college. That's when you started Boys Club is after you graduated? Yeah. How did you come, did you come up with these characters one day or were you just doodling? What, how did it pop into your mind to throw them together? Well, you know, I just had an idea to do a comic strip. And, you know, I was really inspired by a lot of artists. You know, Robert Crumb, of course, and Jim Woodring, who I think you had on your show. I did, yeah. And he does some amazing frogs and frog lips and stuff. So, so honestly, he's a big kind of influence on me, kind of stylistically. I also really love how his comics, a lot of them are more abstract and, you know, wordless in most cases with those Frank comics and stuff. And, and I was really into the paper rad at the time. This guy, Ben Jones, who did these comics, like these kind of just really funny, pretty simple kind of stripped down approach to doing comics. So, so it's just kind of a mix of different things. I come from more of like a fine art background, but this was more of my attempt at entertainment. It's, and it's real, that's crazy. I had no idea you were influenced by Woodring. And I guess when I look at Pepe, I, and I look at those characters, I could see a little Frank in there, I guess. I guess there's a little of that in there, huh? Yeah, for sure. Yeah, I mean, I was, I was big into Woodring in that period. And, you know, I've naturally just really like drawing frogs and critters and creatures and things was fur and scales and things like that. So I kind of have this whole other side of me creatively where I'm doing more detailed kind of colored pencil drawings, but the boys club was just kind of really more simple, just black and white line drawings. How, what year was this? I started it probably in like 2005. And, you know, originally I was just doing it on zines and stuff, posting them on my MySpace profile and doing that kind of thing. Yeah, that's, see, this is like, this is deep internet stuff, man. Like you were posting, you were posting comics on MySpace, which at the time was kind of cutting edge. Yeah, yeah, it was cool. Like, yeah, during those days, I mean, I love, I kind of miss the interface of MySpace. It was really a lot more personalized. You know, people could pick their own backgrounds, you could have music playing. And then, you know, it would be more like a yearbook or something, people would like sign on and be like, hey, I have a great summer or something, you know? It was just kind of a rad thing that, you know, I feel like Facebook, I got off Facebook and a lot of other stuff, just cause it just seems kind of creepy. Facebook, yeah, I barely go on Facebook, man. It totally spooks me out. In MySpace, you know, all those old pages, I think about it sometimes, like what happened to my MySpace page? And one thing that, you know, that really gives me the creeps is when I think about the inevitable dead world of Warcraft accounts, like when people die in the future, like the graveyards of characters that are just gone forever. I mean, it's a different thing to talk about, but MySpace is just gone now and it was everything for a little while. And people are getting some success from MySpace. That's where, you know, the comedian, Dane Cook, got like, I don't know, a shit ton of MySpace friends. And that contributed to, at the time, what was this like brand new phenomena, which was a comedian filling up rooms from the internet. It was crazy at the time. Now it's normal, but were you, did you start getting some like internet fame right away when you were putting Boys Club up on MySpace? I don't know. If I did, I was unaware of it. You know, I think what happened in the case of Pepe was, you know, people probably grabbed it from MySpace page and then just like, took a few of the, for some reason that, you know, they took specifically this one little gag where the frog, you know, he reacts to, he pulls his pants all the way to go pee and then one of the roommates walks in on him and then later he's like playing video games with Lane Wolf and Lane Wolf's like, so I heard you pull your pants down all the way to go pee and then Pepe's like feels good. Feels good, man. And then that kind of became like the early kind of meme. Right. Was that one of, I mean, do you know the history of memes? Was that one of the first memes? I mean, I'd like to say it was, but I don't really study memes too closely, but the internet meme was kind of early on. I mean, I think it was like 2010 or something when that stuff was happening. Yeah, you are the creator of, you know, who knows, even if it's not the first, if it's the first of a thousand, that's still insane. That this thing popped out of your mind onto my space. And someone saw it and was like, oh yeah, that sums it up. That sums it up, feels good, man. And they sent it to somebody and that's the early days, the early evolutionary phase of Pepe. That's the proto-hominated Pepe. And then when did it get picked up by 4chan? I don't know, I think it was like, it was kind of like in the earlier, maybe a slightly more innocent time with 4chan. I don't really know too much about 4chan. I don't really go on there and stuff, but, you know, it was before, I'd like to think it was before 4chan, like went totally Nazi or whatever, you know? It was just like, I don't know, it's just like a place for anonymous people to really get together and start chat threads and share weird pictures and stuff. I'm assuming that's what was going on. But weirdly also that the feels good man thing was like, people would send me emails showing that it was like on their weightlifting sites or like people do, like I just crunched my abs, feels good man. They'd use it on their fitness sites and stuff. Well, that's the way to explain their exercise. When this was happening, what was, what were you thinking? Like, I mean, how did you process the fact that your art had taken on a kind of viral quality? You know, I was fine with it. It was all kind of new stuff and, you know, obviously it was kind of out, you know, that they kind of grew into being beyond me. Like took on all these other personas, like there was a smug Pepe and then like, and then a sad version of him also caught on. And that kind of became an even more popular one was just him in the comic book. It's him like sadly eating a pizza bagel or something like that. It was like kind of a goof on the, you can have pizza on a bagel anytime kind of thing. And he was really sadly eating a pizza bagel. And it was the only time in the comics that he's ever sad. Oh, shit, man. So he's not a sad character. He was just sad for this one moment and then that caught on or resonated for some reason online. So I don't know, it's all kind of a mystery, but it's interesting, you know. What you, you were mentioning earlier that you, your background is fine arts. So that's, you were in college for that. Yeah, yeah, I'm from Ohio originally. I went to like a small liberal arts college in Ohio and studied painting and sculpture and photography and figure drawing stuff like that. Did, when you were in college, did you ever study the occult at all or look into magic at all? You know, I've always kind of had a twinkle, you know, but I haven't really, I haven't really studied that stuff much. What do you mean a twinkle? I don't know. I mean, there's a special place for kind of the mystic elements in the world that are kind of getting lost on technology now, but I think there's magic all around us, you know? And I think that, you know, I believe in like energies that we don't understand and things like that, but you know, I don't really study it. Have you ever had any kind of mystical experiences? Do you, you know, I guess the better question would be, where do you think art comes from? Well, I mean, I think it's just, I don't know, I think I listened to a lot of Terrence McKenna talks and stuff like that. And he's a really a great way of articulating just like really kind of far out concepts and really being able to explain them really beautifully. And he, he has a good attitude about creativity and saying it's basically like, in some ways, it's just a reflection of the, you know, where does just creativity in general come from? Like it's kind of a universal thing. And it's also something that separates us from all the other creators, you know, making music or writing and art and stuff like that. So, I don't know, I do think it's, it's kind of, it's like, it's about the only thing you can do just to keep, keep from, you know, just the doom and monotony of life, you know? It's just to be, to try to focus on positive creative stuff, you know? And that, that doom and monotony that you're talking about, when, do you think that creating transforms the doom and monotony or, or, or, or drowns it out? Well, I think it's just a way, I think it just opens up new channels for people and, and, you know, it gives people a way to, yeah, kind of connect and reflect and try to, you know, process the world and stuff. You know, talking about doom and monotony, like, for example, like, there's all kinds of beautiful hundred, 200, 300,000 year old forests around and it's like, there's a lot of talk about creating jobs right now in America and stuff like that. So it's like, yeah, sure, we can like cut down this forest. It'll be great for the economy, for that generation, but there's no thought about, you know, the future generations and stuff like that. So, you know, I trip about that, that kind of stuff. And I kind of have more of an ecological bend in my, in my own artwork. I like to draw like little characters that kind of, for me, kind of represent different aspects of the natural world or different. I like to try to draw characters to kind of represent these kind of weird ideas I have about, you know, reality. Well, this, I'm just, I'm curious, because if it feels like this thing that you created has some kind of power to it, and maybe you didn't quite expect, like you imbued a thing accidentally, something came out of you that was this seemingly innocuous character. But then when I read your comics, when I've been looking at your comics, and I have seen the most popular ones, the crying, the Pepe with the pizza bagel, all of them, all of them, there is more there. It's not just a comic. Like you've put something in there that's really quite poignant and kind of heavy. It feels like more than a comic to me, just like Woodring feels more than a comic. I mean, not to say any comic doesn't feel special, but there is, does feel to seem to be a little bit of an extra potency inside of these things. Am I just projecting that because Pepe has become such a notorious figure? Or do you think that when that maybe you're putting something pretty deep inside of this stuff? Yeah, I don't know. I mean, I'm definitely too close to it to really make that judgment. But I think that like, you know, there's a conscious effort on my part to not make boys club about like kind of the more negative stuff about what's going on and to just focus on just like really kind of momentary situations that you have when, you know, you just graduate college or something. You live in a bigger city and you have a bunch of roommates and you're all just kind of like goofing off and, you know, throwing up and indulging a lot and different substances and stuff like that. So, you know, I was just trying to, you know, make gag comics really. So I don't know why this thing caught on like it did online. But it's just the nature of the internet. Sometimes she like this just happens. Let's become overly meticulous in the analysis of this because seriously, I don't think Pepe has even come close to Pepe's final form. And so to get a chance to talk with the creator of this thing is really important. And let's, let me ask you a really annoying question. Well, do you remember the first time you drew Pepe? Well, I've been kind of just drawing different versions of the frog like forever. You know, I've always drawn little frog dudes, even when I was a kid, stuff like that. So I think it's just like, you can't really pin, right? I can't really pinpoint to an exact date or something like that. It's just kind of a, you know, I don't know where the missing link is in there. So you, as a kid, you were drawing little frog guys. But at some point you named the frog guy Pepe. Do you remember when that was? Yeah, that was just, you know, when I was just coming up with character names, you know, the four names have meaning for me, like a land wolf. You know, he's kind of like the party dude. He wears shades and, you know, he's kind of like the, he was kind of the star of the show as far as I was concerned. But he got kind of overcast by Pepe. But I don't know. Do you remember the year that you named that frog Pepe? Probably 2005. Yeah. But I thought, I thought Pepe just thought that was a funny name because it looked like pee pee. See, this is the thing, man. You don't, you don't, you realize what you've done. You're seeing it. But when I consider like, how often do you get a chance to talk to the guy who used to draw little elephants and name them Ganesh? Or how, you know what I mean? Like how often do you get to talk to the guy who drew little, little blue, little blue coward boys? And it's like, yeah, it's Krishna. He likes to have, he likes to have fun in the forest and like, and any, uh, he's got, he's got friends and he can do magic stuff and people back then were like, whoa, that's cool. Krishna. Wow. That's really cool. And then as time progressed, you know, we know what happened, right? And what's curious about the internet or technology is it's allowing us to sort of witness this, the formation of a thing that's still, I mean, I'm not saying it's literally a religious symbol. And yet it has taken on such extraordinary potency and it's such a funny thing. So it's because it's functioning on every single level from your POV. We have this benevolent, sweet depiction of a kind of naive time that happens before the world's jaws sink into you. And then from another perspective, people equate it with Nazism, white supremacy, you know, and then it's been used in so many different ways that it's probably going to infinitely grow. Like you're, you know what you're like, you're like the guy who made the killer be, you know about that? No. What is that? The Africanized bee, how that happened. Like those things were, those things were created. They were created like somebody intentionally made them. I can't remember why. Maybe they thought they'd make more honey or something. And, but then, you know, some of the bees got out and, and, and they started breeding. And now we've got, I don't know if you remember, do you remember the time when everyone was afraid of killer bees? I don't remember that, but I can imagine it. Yeah. It sounds terrifying. It was, it was like, there were movies about killer bees. It was like the, it was one of the, you know, there's a million versions of Y2K. And killer bees, it was like, you know, as a kid, there was a couple of things you were worried about in the woods, quicksand and killer bees, man. Like never saw them, but like the idea was that soon these swarms of killer bees were going to descend on the neighborhoods of America and, and just kill all of us. We're all, we wouldn't be able to go outside. There's going to be killer bees. One, the idea is you fucking like step on one killer bee and you're going to get a million killer bees attacking you. So you've, you, now there are these killer pepe's floating out there. Right. Yeah. And, and, and I wonder if you could talk a little bit about how the, how the people who have taken Pepe as a symbol of Donald Trump or as a symbol of the alt right or as a symbol of white supremacy. How, how do these people deal with the fact that you, the creator of this character or seemingly have opposite political leanings? Yeah. I don't know. There's, there's just this, this kind of a few people have articulated it pretty well. One guy, some, some guy like was explaining Pepe as having kind of this grand tapestry where, you know, it's, you could just kind of view them on many different levels. And there's another guy who said that Pepe was kind of like a mirror. So, you know, so Pepe isn't, I hate symbol Pepe is whatever. You want him to be. And I think like, yeah, when he was like weirdly politicized, like, you know, the president of the United States used like kind of us, like tweeted a spug Pepe thing. And that's, that's what, that's what really kind of supercharged that like, like if the president wouldn't have, you know, if Trump, but this was before he was president, wouldn't have done that. I don't think I would be talking to you or I wouldn't be having, you know, having to deal with all of this super negative stuff. It's all, it's all because of, you know, he tweeted that. And then Hillary issued a explainer saying that, you know, it was Pepe was much more sinister than it seems. And was actually a nod to the alt right or whatever. And I think like tragically, all it's really done is, is like made the alt right than the killer be that, you know, everybody thinks that this alt right thing is kind of taken over. But really, I don't think it's as big as, you know, the media or whoever else makes it out to be, you know, and the thing that kind of like grounds me is like, like we're saying that the perspective of like children, like kids, elementary school kids and middle schoolers and stuff, they're still into Pepe and think it's cool. And they don't really pay attention to the news and stuff like that, but it still has this kind of like that frog has some resonates with the little kids for some reason. And they're like, thank you. It's just a cool frog, dude. Yeah. Well, you know, I mean, I think the problem with all the labels, the alt right and all of it is that it's created this ridiculous black and white universe, which and, you know, like with anything, usually the, you know, a lot of these people, they grabbed, they depict the alt right as it's called as just being one, one set of ideas, you know. And I don't know how much of the, I think one of the hilarious things about the alt right is that there's some percentage of it that is just trolling. It's intentional chaos magic. There's no, you know, I don't know how many of these people really have a focused political idea as much as how many of them are experimenting with a kind of chaos magic. And Pepe being tweeted by the president is the ultimate victory of some troll or a cobble of trolls. I don't even know if trolls the right word for it, but you know, the one thing I've been thinking a lot about lately is influence. You know, the different, the way that we have this reality tunnel that we're all inside of and we all have to kind of share. There's a shared reality tunnel and how we've got a bunch of different operatives who are desperately trying to paint the walls of this reality tunnel that we're in. We've got Russian operatives trying to create just absolute confusion by amplifying the appearance of disagreement between people in the United States. We've got our government trying to smear the news by making the news seem like it's putting out bullshit information. Then we've got the news putting out bullshit information because it wants to make money. And so it's this vortex of chaos where symbols are being shoved in front of us and we're being told, this is the truth. And then those symbols fade away and new symbols come. And when you add into that, that a lot of the things creating these symbols or pushing the symbols to the forefront are literally artificial intelligence bots or bots that it's an AI. We are actually dealing with a few different what you could call covens, groups of sorcerers who are attempting to manipulate reality. We've got the government, the mainstream media. We've got artists. And then we've got like 4chan. Then we've got the internet, the chaos lords in the internet who are just sticking their fingers into society to see what they could do. You follow me on this, Matt? No, yeah. No, I'm right there with you. You know, like, yeah, reality is really just sculpted by your own thoughts. So, you know, and there is kind of a group thought or like, you know, a consciousness or whatever that is, that is a, it's more of a hive mind of popular culture and the internet and technology and all that stuff. So there, you know, I do believe you can manipulate and kind of pull the strings there. And, you know, that's kind of what politicians and news media and shows and whatever that's what everybody's trying to do is, you know, try to assert their version of reality or their narrative as they want to play it out. But yeah, it's not, yeah, like you said, it's not really as black and white as that. It's that you can see it on many, many different levels. So my approach to this whole Pepe thing is just to, you know, focus on the positive aspects of it and to use the kind of notoriety that he's attained and, you know, try to transform it back into something that's extremely opposite of what, how it's seen by at least probably older people that watch the news and stuff like that. But like I said, like kids and stuff, they still, they still think Pepe's, you know, and it's totally outside of how I made him in my comics and stuff like that. It means just his froggy face means something to people and that's something I don't quite understand. But well, let's talk about that a little bit because, I mean, to not mention the Keck mythology here, we've got to talk about it. We've got to talk about the, the idea that, that you may be the sort of like the Virgin Mary, that you, you're the Virgin Mary man. Think about it. You gave like, you were chosen by an Egyptian God of chaos and death to be the messenger through which he emerged into this dimension. But yeah, the interesting part about this and about kind of memes in general is you don't, you don't, you can't usually trace a meme back to its source. I mean, there's a cue out there. There's like that. One of the early ones that I liked was that you ever seen techno viking? Oh yeah. You know that guy? Yeah, the guy though that kind of like. Viking looking dude. Yeah, who just like. And then that, yeah, that thing went bonkers and he didn't want anything to do with it. Right. Yeah, but it's such a funny meme. It's so funny. Like that, that footage of him, like, you know, grabbing water from a guy and dancing, he just has such a kind of powerful assertive kind of raver dance. And there's just such power to this guy's just his movement and everything. And I think that really resonated with people and it's funny and some level, but it's also kind of badass on another level. And it's just, it's strange. And I don't know. It's, I don't know. I think in a lot of ways, all these memes that kind of catch on, they just kind of, like you said, have some way to grab people's attention. And, you know, it's all kind of nonsense anyways. It's all kind of distractions. And, you know, it's not, it's not reality, but it's something. Well, I mean, is it, is it, is it not reality? It's, it's a, it's, it certainly has become a, you know, I think about Pepe sometimes. Like I've looked at Pepe, I've tweeted Pepe to people. I've really, because I've enjoyed the kind of like, to me, what's really funny about tweeting a Pepe is that if you tweet a Pepe people, like the super leftist people will be like, you're on the alt right. And then like, and then people get upset over art. And now you're upsetting people with art and it's hilarious because, you know, because, yeah, yeah. And to me, there's something really beautiful about that because it's like, you really are going to like, because I've decided to tweet this frog creature, you're then going to demonize me because it's like, you know, you'll know a witch when you see their cat or whatever. You know what I mean? I was going to say, my buddy Chris, who was just in here, he, he worked at a pizza shop in Los Angeles, two Boots pizza. And he's got a prominent, you know, one, this was like, literally like months before the whole kind of controversy kind of boiled up with the, with the Trump thing and everything. He just, we were at a buddy's house and he got a Pepe, a feels good man Pepe tattooed, like right under his shoulder on his forearm, right under his, you know, his short shirt sleeve. So it's, so it's just right there on his arm. And, and this kid who was performing at the Echo that night, he was probably 22 or some was like buying some pizza and he's like, Oh wait, actually I'm good. I don't want to buy from a place that will hire Nazis or, you know, so like, and this dude is like a, he's like a tall, long hair hippie looking guy. And he just right off the bat assumed he was a Nazi. And it was, it was, it was sad, man. And cause it was, this was, you know, just a young rocker kid who was like right off the bat thinking the dude was, you know, had some kind of like weird agenda with this, you know. Yeah. And it's like, that is evil to judge people based on that. You know, man, I remember I was at this comedy show and after the show, I got in this conversation with the guys getting kind of political. And then I realized the guy's wearing a Pepe hat. And I'm like, Oh shit, you're in the, you're in the, you're in the, all right. And like, and then he's like, yeah, I guess you could say that. And then I realized, well, by then it was too late. We'd already had this fantastic conversation. I was making points. He was listening to the points. You know what I mean? There was no sense of like stubbornness or violence or anything weird. And we kind of ended the conversation and I was like, Oh, okay, I got it. So it's like, I guess in a weird way, the alt right is another version of Y2K, right? It's like a thing people have kind of constructed. I'm not saying they don't exist. Obviously they do, but the vileness of it is probably more a representation of some, some of not the entire group, right? It's got, they can't all be vile or horrific beings where I've met some of them. They're not terrible. I think it's a little bit embarrassing the way that people in the alt right feel inclined to constantly try to protect the president of the United States. I mean, I, you know what I mean? There's a kind of nerdiness to that kind of level of nationalism. You know, that's, to me, it just strikes me more as a kind of like, like nerd, like who the fuck support you, American presidents are 90% of the time murderous. Yeah. You know, like, like all of them are murderous. They just inevitably, it's like, they're the captain of a ship that is sailing through an ocean composed of babies. That's a weird way to say it. They just, you know what I mean? They're going to run over some babies. They're like, they're going to accidentally, if you become an American president, you're going to accidentally blow up some people like that's guaranteed. Yeah. Well, that's interesting. Like, you know, a few points on that, like, well, for one, you were actually talking, you were in physical reality talking to this so-called alt right dude. And I think that that kind of, in any case, will neutralize the situation when you're actually in a room with somebody actually physically talking with them. I think the kind of power that the kind of troll culture or whatever, a lot of it's derived by the anonymous nature of the internet itself. You know, so, so you can kind of, you can go into these darker kind of versions of yourself and comfortably post weird stuff on the internet and then you don't have to necessarily own up to them right to somebody's face or something. So, so I think, yeah, a lot of that is neutralized when you're actually just trying to talk one on one with somebody and you realize that, you know, there's more to it than this kind of black and white thing. But, and also talking about presidents, you know, I thought I was like really not into George W. Bush, but now he seems kind of cool. He's like, he's painting portraits of, you know, dudes that were maimed in wars that he created and stuff. And he's kind of, he's dealing with that creative way. And it seems like he's also kind of like popping pills and going to funerals and stuff and having a good old time. So, so I think that's kind of a weird twist on it. Like I never thought I would, I would relate to somebody like that ever. But, but it turns out like, yeah, he's just trying to be an artist now. And I think that's kind of cool. That's compassionate. I can't, I don't have that level of compassion for him yet. You know, it's like Jeffrey Dahmer probably painted pictures of the people he decapitated with their own shit and blood. That's true. You know, it's like there's something really sinister. It's like, oh, you're going to start some shitty fucking wars. And then you're going to paint the people who were maimed in these shitty wars. That's like though, you know, because it's like, you know how like they say, like if you're into S and M, like if you really want to make money in S and M, become a police officer, because you can like tie people up all day. You like, you're going to handcuff people. You're going to dominate people and you're going to get paid for it. Now that's not to say all police are into S and M, but in the same way, man, there's no perfect job for a serial killer than to become an American president, because you're going to get to kill, man. You can kill and kill an American president or probably most presidents, certainly Russian presidents, you could, you could kill someone in the White House. Like you could have, I bet there have been more than a few presidents who've had a little accident. You know what I mean? Whoops. Oh, I squeezed too hard. Darrell, can you have Darrell? There's probably a guy who like just, that's his only job at the White House is from time to time to dispose of like prostitute corpses that the presidents have strangled. But so they're murderous beings quite often. And then people get really upset when you say that, but it's like, it's verifiable. They're, they kill people. Obama joked about it. Obama has killed innocent people with drones and makes fucking jokes about it. George W. Bush paints maimed soldiers that were like exploded in a fucking, in his wars. You know, they, these people are murderous. So that's why I think any kind of fixation on the office of president at this point is is weird to me. It's fucking weird. And also while simultaneously it's weird to me when people are like, oh my God, I cannot believe the president's tweeting like that. It's like, what? So what is it? It's like, okay, they can be murderous beings, but they need to have sophisticated tweets. You know, like Trump's already blown, you know, Trump already called, he's killed people. He already ordered attacks are allowed anyway. So the point is, man, all presidents are fucked up. And I think the one cloying thing about the alt right is it's deep fixation on this president is somehow being different from the others or somehow playing a different game. When it appears it's the exact same game, maybe not. I don't know, but that's my take on them. Just relax on the fucking fetishizing the fucking president. Yeah. So I mean, presidents themselves, I mean, they're entangled in their own, you know, their need for power and their need for celebrity and their need to get their name, you know, just stuck on the timeline of American history forever and ever. And, you know, I think that the root of that on some level is suffering. You know, I think that I don't think it's a good life. I don't, you know, you saw Obama, like he like got a full head of gray hair after being in office and stuff. So I don't think he like, you know, I don't. It's what happens when you kill a bunch of people. Yeah. I mean, I think it's stressful. Man, I would never want to do something. Well, you can't sleep as well. Because it's like when, you know, like I've, there's some shitty things I've done in my life, you know, that I'm not proud of. Like I wish I'd been there for my mom or when she was dying. And like that affects me, that little bit of stuff. But like, I don't know what the fuck I would do if every time I went to sleep, I had to imagine the intestines of toddlers splattered on some desert because some drone strike that I allowed to happen went awry. Like how do you sleep after that? How do you make sense of it all? Like how does it like process in your brain? Like, oh yeah, I guess that was the right thing to do. That wasn't the right fucking thing to do for what? You ask any, you ask anyone, what are we even doing in Afghan? What are we doing over there? Everyone's like, I don't know. Or this is just what we do. That's what we do. I was walking down the sidewalk today, man. I was thinking to myself, how if you were to say something publicly along the lines of, you know, I think it'd be great if the United States didn't kill people anymore overseas. You would seem like an asshole. Like people would be like, what are you talking about? The United States, the existence of the United States depends on murdering people. You know? Like that's how deeply indoctrinated we've become in the state version of reality, which is that war is an inevitable part of just being in the United States. You know? Yeah. I mean, you could just look through the timeline of just history in general. And it's just, it's bloody and it's bloody as hell, you know? So it just keeps going, man. I don't know. It's just part of life. You know, people just, people kill each other like crazy. And, you know, but there's select groups of people that decide not to kill people and think that there's, you know, better ways to live. And it goes, it comes back to creativity in a way where like you, you know, everybody needs to be doing something. Some people need to be out there dominating and killing and stuff. And some people need to be out there creating and, you know, seeking love and peace. And, you know, so, you know, I try to, you know, you got to just try to focus on that stuff and try to, try to sculpt. You know, you got to curate your own reality, you know, and like be aware of all this stuff. But, but for as many, you know, toddlers brains are splattered everywhere. There's like a butterfly lands on the blank. Brains, you know, thinks it's, thinks it's like a bed of flowers. And George Bush paints it. And then there's some beauty in that too. All this, all this kind of terror and brutality is kind of makes the beautiful things more beautiful, you know? God, have you seen George Bush's incredible series of butterflies landing on exploded toddler brains? It's just beautiful. I mean, because you got to think, you know, like in the same way that that butterfly was once a caterpillar in a cocoon, that toddler brain was just trapped inside a boring old toddler head. And now look at the colors, the blood, the viscera. It's like the, the, the, I have to at this point in my life reject the idea that we, that this murderous bullshit has to keep happening. I think what's going down is there's just a few assholes out there in positions of power who are intentionally creating confusion so that we don't realize that all of us, all of us are a lot like Pepe hanging out with friends, innocent, naive. Nobody really wants to hurt anybody else. Everyone's okay. Most of us are like that. When I walk down the street and I look around at people, I don't see too many evil people. It's a rarity for someone to be a real fucking monster. And I think that this, this struggle to control the reality tunnel is you cannot underestimate just what you're saying, the power of art and creating and throwing on the walls of this reality tunnel is many depictions of the potential beauty of humanity as a species. How incredible we are and how powerful we are as a group, as like, as, as, as, as a group of people connected not by our fixation on the state, but by on our fixation of wanting to like give love to each other and to make art together and to create stuff together. You know, and your Pepe is an, I think an incredible example of just the power of, of art. You know how it can just escape, how it can escape into the world and spread out and stretch out. And, and I think there's something about it that's so incredibly beautiful. And, and what's your plan with Pepe, man? What are you, what are you going to do? Like how do you, you say take back Pepe, but how, how is that ever going to be possible? Well, you know, I just, I just believe that every moment, every new moment, this moment right now, every moment is a new opportunity to scope reality as you, as you see it and then to try to share that with other people and try to, you know, share your point of view with other people and make it like kind of, kind of a shared thing. So, you know, I'm, I'm doing various things right now. You know, I got, I mentioned, I did, I just started a Kickstarter campaign with my brother and he's been helping me out kind of on the technical side, but he's also going to help me on the creative side that come up with a new, you know, we're just going really direct and really simple with it and just trying to come up with a new comic to show, you know, a new version of Pepe and how, how that would play out. So, you know, it's just like I said, you just continuing to use this notoriety of the frog and the power of it and everything and to try to, you know, to whoever wants to listen, try to paint a new, paint a new picture and that's all you can really do. You got to do, you know, it's like what Michael Jackson said, if you want to change the world, you got to look in the mirror. You just got to do it yourself and be, try to set the example for other people to make their own artwork and have their share their own ideas and, and to, to, in the hopes of inspiring creativity, you know. If you want to look in the world, you've got to look in the Pepe, right? Because he's a spiritual mirror of all of us. See, see, see how he's looking back. And this, do you know the story, if you come up with this, the story of this new comic yet? Well, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm kind of in the writer's workshop right now and the think tank mode. So, you know, I've got a million different ideas. So I got to hone in on them. But, you know, I think it'll be kind of just back to, back to basics. It's just going to be gag comics, you know, but with a, with a more positive twist. Are you going to, are you going to in any way acknowledge the, are you going to in any way acknowledge the, what, the, what happened, the, the alt-right, the adoption of the character by the alt-right? Is that going to come into it at all? Well, you know, I mean, I think that's definitely part of the story. But, you know, my aim here is to just kind of transcend all this nonsense and try to kind of, you know, to try in my own comic book kind of way to touch on, you know, to try to touch on some truths as I see them. So, you know, it's all very abstract right now. I just want to try to get, get kind of more psychedelic with it and do a lot of, you know, I had an idea about like, you know, Pepe trying to teach his friends how to try to get out of their brain and live in their feet. And, you know, the beautiful thing about comics is you can actually kind of simply describe these kind of weird ideas in a, in a simple drawing kind of way where, where you can, you can illustrate their feet and little versions of themselves living in their feet. And that could be something, I don't know, just weird shit like that. That sounds incredible. That's actually one of the great ways to get into the moment is just to feel their feet in your shoes. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah. So, you know, I've been kind of reading, you know, my own kind of philosophical or spiritual journeys, mostly just reading based at this moment. So I think I read that from, you know, one of these, one of these spiritual authors or something. It's a female, I forget her name, but she's, she's affiliated with like Rom Doss and that crew. And I know you, you are connected with those guys. I'm a big fan of that kind, that way of thinking and trying to be in the moment. Come to, come to December, you should come to the December retreat. I know. Are you going to be there? I'm going to be there. Why don't you come? I know. I want to, man. Just do it. It'll be, it's great. You got to come. It'll be great. Oh, let's bring Pepe to Hawaii. I know. I got a button. Well, yeah, you have a little bit more time. I've got, I tweeted that we're going to be talking and some people have got some pretty good questions for you. Can I ask some questions from Twitter? Dude, I got nothing but time. Okay, beautiful. Let's just go through these though, man, because there's a lot of good ones. The first question is from John Daly, really funny comic. He says, are you bummed, bro? I'm not. I'm not bummed. No, I'm pretty happy. I just live day to day, kind of like Bob Ross or something. How can you have a bad day if you're just sitting around listening to music and drawing pictures? It's nice. When I'm not doing that, I like to go on hikes and walk around and immerse myself in kind of just stuff that I think that people are kind of losing touch with in this kind of technological, computer-y, cell phone kind of all these distractions that we have nowadays and to just try to appreciate geology or the beautiful spectrum of all the different kinds of butterflies and insects and the way that just nature has its own memes that kind of catch on and flourish. A lot of that's lost now because people are just more interested in watching TV or going on the internet or going on Facebook or going on their phone and checking their feed and all this stuff. I really do think it takes away from just looking up and trying to see the big dipper or something. Yeah. We've lost some kind of something really special, but there's something cool about the low population density out there. There is something nice about the fact that so many people are glued to their screens that it leaves a lot of this outdoor space pretty empty. That's kind of nice. Yeah, the outdoor space is empty. We have natural history museums with just all kinds of beautiful collections and archives of all this stuff. They're empty and nobody's in there. Nobody cares. Some people do. I do think that, I definitely think psychedelic drugs are a way to just quickly hit the reset button on whatever programming you've had throughout your life and to try to get in tune with whatever new messages are out there that you know, whatever the earth is trying to tell you because it's talking. It's trying to communicate with us. It's trying to say like, hey, we're still here, man. We're still here. I don't know. No, I know. Listen, man. You're preaching the choir. I've got this garden. You know what I did yesterday? I don't care anymore. I've been doing enough Ram Dass retreats. I don't care. You know what I did? I played flute for my tomato plant yesterday. That's great. And I swear to God. I swear to God, if you tune into nature, it responds to you. It knows you're playing. I don't know how. It doesn't have ears. It doesn't have a nervous system. I don't care what Neil deGrasse Tyson would have to say about whether or not my tomato plant could hear. Actually, he seems pretty cool. So he might think it's, I don't know what he'd think. You might think, you know, who knows? But I'll tell you this, man. I can feel it. When I water the plants, I feel them thanking me. I can feel this like we have a real relationship with the planet that people ignore. So no, you're preaching to the choir, brother. I know. Do you, it sounds like you take ayahuasca sometimes. No, I've never done that. I've, I've, I've read a lot about it. And I, you know, I probably saw that this, the spirit molecule document. Like I said, a lot of this, these kind of ideas and stuff, you know, I get through listening to music and, and kind of researching it and reading it and stuff like that. And, and, you know, it's been a long time since I've actually indulged, but, but it's almost like you only have to do this thing like once or twice. And then you kind of get the picture and you can kind of take it with you the rest of your life. You know, you don't have to get trapped in some kind of, you know, pattern of, of continuing to do it. But, but it's good to check in every once in a while and see what's happening. It sure is. I love checking in. Do you, now I've got a question here in the same line of conversation we're having. Joe Kelly wants to know, do you prefer LSD or mushrooms? That's an important question. Well, I think mushrooms by far, just because it's, you know, it's, it's, it's organic. It's natural. It just grows on cow shit or wherever else people are growing it. And, and, you know, it's all just chemicals, you know, I think I'm on the same kind of page with Terence McKenna in terms of like drug culture and it being like, you can't lump in like LSD and mushrooms and this kind of stuff with like methamphetamines and, you know, whatever other kind of chemical derivatives, but, but also, you know, drugs aren't inherently bad, like, like everybody thinks that they are. It's just, it's just the patterns of behavior that people get into and that become bad. But, but I think there's ways to, to use them in a responsible way that will actually enlighten you to these kind of different levels of thinking and different really giving you a key to, to these new connections with, with nature, but also nature is like, it's a perfect place either. It's just as brutal and fucked up as war too on some level too. And I think, you know, you wouldn't spend a long time being a predator. And I think that's kind of sculpted the way that we, we kind of are scared of a lot of things because we've, we've been scared of things for millions of years. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. I mean, that's kind of the tragedy of human beings is that we've got one foot in the bloody apocalyptic Old Testament river of revenge and death and eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth, violent sort of survival related epigenetic echo ev, habituations. And then our other foot has the potential to step into a utopian river, a river of, you know, harvesting energy in ways that don't destroy the planet and figuring out systems of that, that where people aren't exploited for dough and, you know, where, where we can like share a little bit more, but somehow not force that sharing, you know, like ways that we can give and give and give. And so that's what says that about humans. You look at a great white shark and it's like, that thing's just, that's what it does. It's a, it's a fucking, it's just a, it's a goddamn hole filled with knives that swims, you know, it just swims through the ocean, eats. It's not evil. It's not, you know, it's, it's what it does. They seem kind of sweet. I feel bad when people kill them, but that's what they do. They eat. There's, there's never going to be a moment when a great white shark swims next to a boat and like coughs up the cure for cancer or some kind of beautiful book of poetry or, or, you know what I mean? Or, or some incredible work of art, but that's to me, the glory and the tragedy of humanity is it's this meeting a human being is these two places meeting. And that's what drives, I think people who take psychedelics crazy is from that through the psychedelic lens. You realize that we don't have to be channels of destruction. We can be channels of love and connection. And, and, and you want, and if we were all a little more filled with hope and a little more aware of that, then this planet, man, this planet could be, wow, this planet could be something even more special. You know, we just, this could, this planet can really, really get a lot of Twitter followers if it. Yeah. Yeah. Like you can look at a place like, you know, I think an interesting metaphor for that, that kind of situation is like Three Mile Island. You know, it was a place that, you know, there's that big nuclear meltdown or whatever, and it was a big disaster or whatever. And now it's just people aren't allowed in there anymore and, and nature is somehow thriving there. I mean, maybe they have an extra eyeball or something, but they're still, it's almost like it's through that destruction, it's become an oasis. So, so, sometimes I'll just be walking around, going on a walk or something and be thinking about how, like, we're just destroying everything. But then, like, there's always a patch of weeds that has the potential to grow into a new forest. You just got to, you got to just think about things on more of a geological timescale rather than a human timescale. And then you realize everything's all good. It doesn't matter. I mean, we're just a blip, or, you know, we're just a second on the, on the clock of, you know, the history of even the earth. And I think that's something that psychedelics kind of help you to understand too. It gives you a much wider lens to kind of transcend and view all this phenomenon that's happening around us and kind of, and then as humans, yeah, we can kind of, we can, we can go more towards, you know, love and, and understanding and interconnectedness and things like that. And it's just, it's really up to every one of us. And, and it, and it does go back to creativity. And that's a way to kind of hopefully inspire people through art and literature and music and dance and whatever else to, to be in the moment and to be creative and to, to, to strive for excellence. And to understand that others are out there. I think that's a really important piece of the puzzle that people have forgotten is that there are, there are people like, here you are, the creator of Pepe the Frog, this being that is like, becomes synonymous with evil. And here we see that you are this beautiful, peaceful person who, who is connected to nature. And, and, and the, I think there's much more of you out there than people think. And that is one of the theories I have is that there is a concerted effort by some group of people to try to make sure that there is a general sense of hopelessness in the world, in the sense that people just think, yeah, this is what it's going to be like. This is how it is. It's going to be like this. I mean, maybe it'll just become a little more authoritarian. Maybe it'll become, maybe there'll be another world war. Maybe there'll be another, you know, a disaster, some kind of, or whatever the fucking sad story is, but pretty much this is it. This is what it's going to be. And this couldn't be further from the truth. This country is brand new. This is a relatively a brand new country. We just had a fucking revolution. And we, and, and, and it's only been a few generations since that revolution. And look at what's happened, you know, and, and so this is an important thing for people to realize is that from a grand universal scale, yeah, this is all of humanity, the flickering of a Nat's eye. But in this moment where we're all gathered together here, there is so much potential for connecting, for finding where we all agree. And I think that there are people out there desperately trying to keep us from doing that by creating the illusion that we're fighting more than we are. That's yeah, these fucking bots, you know, they're there, they represent both sides, you know, like on the internet, the bots that are popping up in threads, what people are calling Russian bots, maybe they are, maybe they're not, they probably are. They're, they fight on both sides. Because it's like they can't shut the internet down, right? They can't shut it down. To shut down the internet is to probably invite a revolution. Like if they try to shut down the internet, there's going to be big trouble, big fucking trouble. So, so how do you deal with it? How do you deal with like in the old days, you know, you say some shit to the media, the media publishes it in a newspaper and that's what people think is real. Now we don't do that anymore. The state needs a propaganda outlet to control the people and the internet is fucking that up in the most severe way. So what do you do, man? You get in the threads, you pollute the threads with bots and the bots have these fights in the middle of these threads and the fights distract and they ultimately keep us from finding what we used to be able to find in a nice argument, which is like a common connective point. You know, that's what it used to be. We get in an argument, not so I could win, we get in an argument so I could be like, oh shit, I guess you are right. Wow, I didn't see it that way, but fuck yeah, I see that now. And that's the potential of the internet is, is all these people on what's called the right and all these people on the left get some time, spend some time together constructively. I mean, maybe I'm just a naive son of a bitch, but I have a feeling that we're more connected than we are broken apart by our ideas. And so that's what that's the creepy thing, is they're trying to fuzz us out with the background noise of bickering bots, right? It's like, imagine like that's what's what like it's like the noise of bots fighting is drowning out the sound of human beings coming together. Robots are fucking us up man. Yeah, yeah, it's robots and it's advertising and it's television and it's the internet, it's all this stuff in it, you know, it's kind of like it's keeping everybody kind of just looped into, you know, they've got their feed bag and they got their, their switch to hit and you know, we're all just fucking rats in a cage despite all our rage, you know, and you know, I think there is power in kind of, you know, the internet kind of started off in this, you know, by like, you know, was invented kind of by people with more of an idealistic perspective that, you know, nobody would have thought in the early days of the internet that this thing that was really going to bring people together in unprecedented ways would go to these really, you know, you know, anonymously dark places or these weird robotic algorithmic places where we're getting, you know, I can't go online and look for a pair of sneakers and then check my email without seeing that pair of sneakers come up on an ad right next to my email. It's like really weird that that happens, you know, so we're all kind of just, you know, and there's all this that talk about like the echo chamber, you know, that kind of came into fruition during this last election, you know, where people that are, you know, lean more towards the right and have friends like that, you know, they have their version of their news feed and then people on the left had their version of the news feed and, you know, there isn't a common kind of, there is no common delegation anymore, everybody just gets spoon fed whatever the hell they want and it's curated to their own tastes, so nobody gets another perspective to, you know, we don't get the rights perspective and they don't get our perspective in a way that would be creative or productive. We all just think this is how things should be and they're not this way and blah, blah, blah, blah, and you know, I think there's a missed opportunity there to like try to find some common ground. Like you said, we could create a lot of great jobs by, you know, utilizing new forms of energy and technology and stuff that will actually bring jobs to the United States and help the planet and stuff like that, but a lot of it just has to do with the people that are in control of the resources trying to hold on, to grasp this control desperately and to keep us driving, keep us paying $100 a month to be force fed advertising right into our faces in our own homes, you know, and we're paying for this shit. That's right. Well, I mean, we, you know, the, this is to add to the weirdness of it all, like for example, like if people are listening to this on their speakers, right, I could say like, Alexa, order butt plugs and you know, in people's houses, their Alexa will like try to order butt plugs, like they'll have to tell, they'll have to tell the Alexa. No, Alexa, order 1000 rolls of toilet paper. Yeah. You know, it does that. Or you could say like, Alexa, turn off everything. Alexa, let's, let's, let's watch some porno. Doesn't do that. You have to say like, you'd have to, you'd have to say like, Alexa, what's like a really annoying song? Wait, what is Alexa? I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, Alexa. Is that like a Siri thing? It's the Amazon Echo. And it's in a, it's in a bunch of people's homes. And it's got an, it's got an AI associate. I've got one. So all I have to do is say to the damn thing, you know, order like a toaster. And then a toaster shows up at my door. Oh my God. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's cool. It's cool. But there is an, it's, it's one of the examples, like people say that we're headed towards like some kind of AI disaster and an example of an early, like AI problem is on some Super Bowl ad. Somebody said, I can't remember, did an Alexa command. And like in homes all across the planet that had a Lexus, it like turned off something. I can't remember exactly what it was, but it was an example of like the strange future that we're spiraling into. And I think what you are experiencing as an artist is part of that strange future. The replication of a thing that came out of your brain that is now spread like wildfire. I mean, God, man, these Twitter, I've got so many questions on Twitter about Pepe. It's, it's incredible. Like, um, uh, here's one. This is a good one here. This is from a, this is from Dusty triple six. This is, it looks like we got a, an alt-right feller here, possibly, but I don't know. And he wants to know his picture. It looks like he's, you know, I don't know if it's really him or not, but he looks like, uh, looks like he's like 15 maybe. But, uh, he wants to know, uh, how do you feel about liberals who think that Pepe is a hate symbol? That's, that's a good question. Um, you know, I think that, uh, that's part of the tragedy that Pepe thing is that like, you know, I can understand the whole, the try to step outside of it and see the bigger picture and like, um, you know, I see that there's a news story there where, you know, it's a kind of an absurd news story. But, you know, when, um, these kind of a satirical, uh, left leaning kind of, um, television programs or something are trying to explain the, this alt-right thing, which, you know, shouldn't be getting this much airplay, but it, but it just keeps going and going. Um, you know, it just, uh, it just kind of competes the situation or gives, um, gives it more power than it really deserves. Right. You know, like now, now, now I feel like a lot of people are just kind of talking about the alt right now. And I don't know if I'm too close to it because I got this Pepe frog thing that's like, you know, entangled in the, this thing. But, um, but I do think that, yeah, there is, um, um, there is, uh, some room for debate on whether that's a productive thing to continue doing it, um, or not, you know. So that's, that's, so that's why I'm just trying to do what I would do, um, just any other day, which is kind of ignore all this shit and just continue to be, um, creative, you know. Yeah, I get that. Yeah. That's what it feels like. You're just like following your art. You're not letting yourself get distracted by this, but no, but I am, but on some level I am totally, uh, entangled and distracted by it too. Like I'd like, you know, I'd like to, um, cultivate a personality of someone who doesn't give a shit about this stuff, but on some level it does kind of wear on my soul that this thing that I created has been, you know, associated with, uh, despicable kind of distasteful stuff. But I also see the joke part of it too. And like, I'm just, uh, trying to take more lighthearted and more, um, you know, humorous approach to it. So you don't feel as though, when, when I, I mean, I know, I know it sounds crazy, but you don't feel like maybe the, if I were you and this had happened to me and I was looking at this frog and I was looking at Keck, the Egyptian God, part of me would wonder if like a spirit came through me. Does that ever drop into your head? No, no, no, not really. No. I mean, I, um, I mean, I think creativity in general is kind of a reflection of some kind of spirit or something. Yeah. Where does, you know, where does it come from? So yeah, on some level it is, it is, um, you know, that's any artists or a creative person's kind of goal is to tap into something that's outside of themselves and to kind of, um, um, you know, hit, you know, get into some kind of groove or get into the zone or they call it, you know, and, and for me, um, just my own artistic practice, it's, it's been, uh, you know, I'm interested in meditation and stuff. I haven't really done it that much. I'd like to get more into it, but, but for me, drawing in and of itself is kind of meditative than there's this big kind of, um, you know, like adult coloring books are kind of popular right now because, you know, people are just working these bullshit jobs and kind of locked into these, this reality that they're not totally maybe, um, satisfied with. And, um, you know, at the end of their day, you can go home and, uh, you know, put on some pure mood CDs and bust out your colored pencils and color some kind of an intricate, um, you know, geodesic vortex with beautiful colors and that totally, um, focuses your mind and, and then you don't have to worry about the alt-right or any of this other bullshit. And, um, so I think if more people were coloring, you know, the world would be a better place. Man, thank you so much for letting me have this conversation with you. It's really, really cool. How can you- Oh yeah, I really wanted to come on this program because I really enjoy your, um, just your kind of general positive attitude and, you know, the, the, um, the way you speak about things. And, you know, it's very, it's very cartoonish, uh, and, uh, very imaginative. So, so it's nice to talk to somebody that isn't just like so blah, blah, blah, blah, like just has the same bullshit stuff to talk about. Thanks, man. Well, thank you very, thanks. I hope, I hope that there wasn't too much bullshit in here. I think we covered some great ground and I hope that, I hope that our effort here in some way or another is, is going to resurrect a beautiful, powerful, and, uh, untainted Pepe from the, from the depths of your mind. And how can people chip in for the Kickstarter? Um, yeah, it's really easy. Basically, you could just Google save Pepe, just two words, or you just go on Kickstarter and look up save Pepe, and it's just on there. And I think you just plug in your info and you can give anywhere from a dollar to a million dollars, you know. So there's no, well. Just give me your credit card info. A million dollars. I don't know. I, actually, my brother's, my brother's kind of taking care of the technical side. What do you get for a million? What's the reward for a million?

Dirty Angel. Out. Now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Greetings, my darling friends. Thank you for joining us. If this is your first time listening, my name is Duncan Trussell. Used to be a divorced lawyer. Was hit by a micro meteorite right at the nape of my neck and became enlightened. And now I lead spiritual orgies in Lexington, Kentucky in a very small warehouse.

You can find the link to sign up for one of these orgies at DuncanTrussell.com. My dear friend, Emil Aime is the great musician, eternal outsider, brilliant philosopher, somebody who I was friends with in college. I'm so lucky that I ran into this guy and that he derailed me from whatever boring ass tracks my train was chugging down. He's here with us today and we cover some of my favorite topics on earth, the occult, cults, Satan, black magic, the Illuminati, and much, much more.

Now everybody, please welcome to the Dunkitrustle family, our podcast, Emil Amos. As you are with us, shake hands going to the moon. Welcome to you. It's the Dunkitrustle family. Emil, welcome back. Tell me, it's been a while. It's been too long. And we both have become, I don't know, like what do you call it? COVID refugees? We both moved to North Carolina. No, I didn't see that one happening. You probably really didn't see that one happening. I didn't see it happening. No, man, I really didn't. That was one thing that I did not see in my future. Was it always kind of in the back of your mind that maybe you'd go back to Chapel Hill? I had daydreams, yeah. I think early on, after we lived together in LA, I got up to Portland. And it was just such a rough, rough time that I remember looking out my window and just thinking a lot about how much fun everybody was having back home and how they were supportive of each other in terms of like the music scene and like I didn't have that in Portland. I just felt like I was against the world. And I think it's safe to say you were probably feeling pretty similar like right after I moved out of the apartment in LA. I'm imagining you felt pretty doomed for a little while or were you having a ball? No, I don't think I was having a... I think that was the, that when you left, that was the beginning of a pretty brutal time because I had to learn how to do comedy and, you know, like live in like uncertainty for a really long time. I was grinding my teeth at night and stuff. I was so stressed out because you just, like God, it was so crazy to think I would try to get into comedy and so weird. Yeah, there was a part of you that like, there was a part of you that truly didn't even want to do it. You just knew that you had to get to the other side of that, that initiation process. Yeah, I think so, man. Yeah, I just like, it was just great. It was just weird, you know, and then the more you realize it's a possibility the more you, it's like, for me, that seemed like a really nice kind of job. I mean, I think we both share a kind of like sense that we, a real feeling that getting stuck in like a, in a weird fucking job with a weird boss is like one of the levels of hell, right? Well, I think kids listening or maybe long-time listeners probably assume they came to us when we were like, in their minds, you know, we had sort of been established or something. I'm just using that term loosely, but there was never an early parallel between us in terms of careerism or anything. There was just this idea at school that I had to play music whether I liked it or not. And then, and you were still deciding what you wanted to do. But we never knew that we would go off in these different directions. And then in weird ways, the same thing would happen to us. And then we'd kind of curve back to this extremely similar place, which is extremely a very rare place where you can produce your own art straight from your house and sort of sell it to the world as a business. That was never in the cards. There was no plan for that. No plan. We couldn't even imagine that that would be some kind of possibility. Like, because the technology didn't exist. I mean, that was the grim thing about coming up during the time we did. Like, basically, we were like one of the last generations to not have access to the internet. And so when they were telling us about the possibilities for our future in school, there was no internet. So it was, the possibilities were pretty like, a lot of those things they were telling us we should go and do. I don't even know if those jobs even exist anymore. And certainly not in the same way. Did you have to take cursive when you were in school? Oh, yeah, I took it all, but typing. Dude, yeah, typing. And I can remember being in typing class and just not naturally thinking like, God, this is what the future looks like. This is the world. Like, you got to learn how to type on one of these stupid fucking things. Like, this is the world. You need to remember that you need to learn how to type a certain number of words per minute, WPM. Remember that? Yeah, it was actually the one thing I could do well, the typing. But so what I think is almost impossible to explain to a post internet person is that the gatekeeping system was so rigorously set up. And part of my question for you is that when I left LA, you know, we don't ever talk about this time that much, partially because it was miserable. But I'm fascinated with that time because that was that period in your 20s where you just basically have to, like you were saying, that you have to swim in these waters of uncertainty that have no end really in sight. And you're kind of just perpetually sinking. Your head's not even above water. And did you face, did you come into contact with a very palpable sense of the gatekeepers in LA? I mean, there's moments in your career where someone might have taken you aside backstage. And I wish I could watch the movie of your life and see these moments where someone took you aside after you're set and said, you're no good, man. Like, you're not good at what you're doing. Those terrible moments. Yeah. Did you face the gatekeeper? I mean, it's ironic because you got hired to be the talent agent at the comedy store. So that's really ironic that you got put in that position. Yeah. And certainly it helped. But like, you must have, did you come face to face with the gatekeepers at some point? Sure. Yeah, because you have to, because back then you would have to, you know, the gatekeepers were, you know, a cobble of people who worked at clubs or people who worked at networks and would listen to pitches. Because that was the way in is you would have to come up with some idea of a show and then you bring it in and you pitch it. And then if they like it, then you get to make a show that if you make a show, it gives you this kind of weird credibility. And then that, you know what I mean? And then from there, you get into this trajectory of success. But until then, yeah, you got to go through all these people. And like, it's not just the obvious ones who are like legitimate like business people who are trying to find good ideas because they have to get generate content. But it's like those people are surrounded by other people. And that's where it gets weird. You know, that's where all these like parasitic goblins appear. Like people who not only don't really have any power at all, but who are like have designed a kind of dark life around pretending to have power, scooping people up who've arrived into town. You know what I mean? And then like essentially like misguiding them, giving them terrible advice. Did you ever run into that like bitter? Oh my God, yes. Bitter people, just bitter people giving you rotten advice about how you're supposed to like get ahead. And I look back and think, God, that some of the shit they told me was just completely wrong. Right. And they are milking. What they may see or unconsciously know is a pure active sense of self loathing inside of you. Because you have to believe at that point that these people might help or there is some kind of like, you know, traction in the wall to get out of this sort of bottomless pit. And so they use that piece of yourself that doesn't believe you're good enough and they use it on you until you can one day finally figure out that they actually have really no power. And the whole time you, you know, you were essentially right. You were just sort of doing what you were needing to do. And that's all you do need to do is just do what you need to do and follow your gut. And so that that moment when the gatekeeper falls and you realize that they were a symbol you were projecting and nothing that was actually there that you even needed. That's like one of the more depressing moments too, because that thing you looked up at that parental entity, the older brother or the father figure just sort of looks so small and sad and pathetic. And you thought you needed them and you had invested so much mental energy into them. And then bam, all of a sudden you realize you're the adult. It's such a sad moment. Did we ever talk about like when I ended up like briefly in Jeff Conway's orbit? Yeah, I was going to ask if you wanted to remember I'd come through town and you'd always be in like no discredit to you at all. Like you'd always be like working on your your current like scheme to get the fuck out of the bottomless pit, you know. And and I would be to it's just that years were so LA and mine like Portland had no there wasn't really much traction there was just a lot of just intense competition between musicians. And then there was no real ladder out back then so it's kind of I was just miserable and but you were like you had like sort of palpable situation that you were trying to work with and so every time I'd come through you'd be like yeah so I'm writing a script with the guy who wrote Waterworld. And I was like, well, I don't know where that's going to lead. I mean, it's not, you know, not a most very respected film. But you wait. No, I know you're talking about wasn't what wasn't what I don't think is Waterworld. It was actually that it was. So yeah, that was some that was battlefield earth battlefield earth. So I got, you know, JD Shapiro, he's he's a very cool guy, not a gatekeeper, really funny. He he got in a fight in the cafeteria of the Scientology building like got in a fight with somebody in the cafeteria scrappy guy. But like that that was. Yeah, you're always doing something like that. I in one of those things was somehow because like you always there's always somebody's like hey man I'm working on something with Jeff Conaway and or some you know celebrity from a long time ago but because like who the fuck am I. I have like maybe two and a half minutes of unfunny jokes that I do every Sunday. You'll take anything you can get and like suddenly you're in like this. You're up in the Hollywood Hills and this weird mansion with Jeff Conaway and this strange orbit of people around him and the mansion has been foreclosed on and he's smoking herbal cigarettes and he's like talking about how he has an idea for a scene in this pilot script that you've been working on. With all these people that you that are portraying themselves as being very like LA and very six already successful like in my mind I'm like this is when you're just completely happy to sleep on a mattress on a floor. And like if you know if you have cheese in the fridge. It's wow cheese or if you if you fill your gas tank all the way up. It's like holy fuck I just filled it all the way up things are on the up and up for me now. And like I like I remember him saying this. You know I think at the time he was really struggling with addiction. It was really sad. He would go to I went to the dentist's office with him once. I'm just remembering this now and he would bring headshots of himself. And like and it was weird and I remember he man I remember he the idea for the script was someone is robbing up. It's about I think it's about some people running a pawn shop and someone comes in to rob the pawn shop. Jeff Conaway runs the pawn shop. Someone comes in to rob the pawn shop and Jeff Conaway converts him to Christ. That's the pilot. Now this is the dude that OD that was in taxi right. Yeah. Okay. Okay. I remember that was another face. I I have many times at parties confused water world and battlefield Earth for some reason. It's easy to blend together. But you tell me what about you man in the music world are there versions of that like how does that look in the music world. Well yeah there's definitely versions of it. For sure when I mean we were in the same exact position right you're just trying to get essentially booked on a stage which is like kind of my nightmare. I did that's not what I wanted to do in any way. So I'm finding myself you know following the advice of older people since I was little saying you know you got to make a name for yourself before people buy your records. Right. You know which is the equivalent of your podcast which eventually we just basically did we did what we wanted to do in the first place without following that same trajectory. And somehow we we won. And I think it does have a lot to do with technology. The thing that you were you were really on the cusp of I wasn't paying attention to that you taught me pretty much everything I knew in the beginning you gave me my first drum machine. Did you know that you gave me now first down forage. Yeah you gave me the drum machine. I did declare the West with all that stuff. Yeah. And it was rebirth because you just went like you already interested in electronic music and I was just like. Yeah. You know I had no interest in anything electronic but once you were showing me like basically the recording programs I was like I can repair my my four track recordings and then eventually I begrudgingly moved on to the. Yeah. Computer which was a big deal for me and only would have taken like in that way you you were the you were the older brother or something that that kind of put it in front of me for long enough so I realized you know I needed it. But yeah we have so many stories. You are a purest. You know you were you had you had a very strict ethic regarding music at that time and it definitely electronic music was not part of what you were interested in at all. You in and I really like I always think about that I still love that I mean I love like you were because what you. Still do you had this this kind of like. Oh man I kind of like transcendent simplicity in the way that you were making stuff that was like like really rigorous you know what I mean and from it like forced a really beautiful style of music. You know because like all the normal distractions you know it's so easy to add all this extra shit to anything you're making. That you just don't need and in that you know in that constant addition of like completely unnecessary flourishes whatever the fuck it was you were trying to make in the beginning just kind of gets suffocated under all the icing. Yeah you know what I mean so by the end there's nothing there. You know like whatever you that initial impulse gets so diluted by like for me it's just insecurity. You know that's how I always know whatever I'm making isn't that good if I suddenly like start adding a lot of effects to it or something. You're totally you're totally right but like you know things about me that I don't remember or or didn't notice and then I'll I'll be able to remember things about you so it's interesting you say that I didn't really have technology. In front of me in the beginning so there wasn't this idea that I could have just picked up all these plugins you know. Friends there's something interfering with your happiness or is preventing you from achieving your goals like I don't know maybe you're in a global pandemic where every time you go outside you wonder if you're going to suffocate to death.

I remember playing house music for you once. And I was excited to play it for you. And I'm like, listen to this. And I played it for you. And I'm sure it was a terrible song. Like, who knows what it was like prodigy or something. And I've had two very powerful experiences that I needed where people I respected rejected the music that I liked. And one of them was when I played Ellie Smith for Joe Rogan. It's just a fucking stupidest thing to do. And the look on his face was like, just not. I don't know. The look was so funny because it was a look of like sympathy and confusion. Because he's like, his response was just like, you shouldn't listen to this. And then, but when I played whatever it was to you and what I know it was, it couldn't have been a good song. I don't know how I had it or what medium it was stored on. But I was like, what do you think? And you know, when you're excited about a certain style of music and you play it for some of your respect and they don't like it, it hurts. But I remember I played it for you. I'm like, what do you think? And you just kind of like, you just shook your head and you said, it just makes me feel cold. Well, you gotta remember, like, I started really, really early, right? So when I was even, maybe even 11 or 12, I was already here and things like Fugazi, which everything about Fugazi was like, no, like they didn't want a light show, right? Even today when I go play in Sweden with Ohm, Europeans always come up to me like, you guys, you should really get a light show. And I don't know what to say because coming from that world back then, there's nothing wrong with that. But like coming from that world back then when you didn't even have access to the idea of lights or computer programs, there was this idea that like if all you had was a guitar in the stairwell where I recorded in my dorm, that you ostensibly had to go climb up in the cave like Zarathustra or something and just figure it out, you know? And because we have the Beatles as sort of the base jumping off point of basically all rock music in terms of, you know, expansion, curiosity and like exploration, I just thought, you know, you see a picture of John Lennon sitting on a piano or Paul McCartney sitting on a piano. When they sat down with the piano, that meant it's time to listen closely. Something serious is going to happen, right? Right. You're not thinking about, no one thinks about plugins or, you know, electronic music symbolized a lot of kind of silly equipment and clothing and culture stuff to me at the time. So being that I was in the very middle of that seat where I was, all I had was a guitar and I was in a room. And once I walked out of that room and showed the world what I'd been working on for years and years and years, it just, it had to be legitimate. It had to be good. So that was just like a code I was trying to crack. So then you walk with like the culture of electronic music at the time and no offense to anybody. I know it's been rescripted as a very fashionable thing, but the fashion of it was so embarrassing. Do you know what I mean? Yeah, I know what you fucking mean. You mean those big ass pants we were all wearing? And the pacifiers at the time and like Asheville. And the candy necklaces. Yeah, there was exactly in glow sticks and stuff. And there was no raves up there. So when I see people trying to echo something they know is going on in the big city in like small towns, I always feel kind of bad for them. I'm like, I mean, that's your right. You know, to wear those pants and the little like, you know, wife beater shirt and like dance around with your headband in between classes and the lobby of the, you know, but like, it just looks so fucking dumb. And they were all in the muppet babies. I'm just saying like the aesthetic. Oh, no, I remember, you know, I'll tell you this though. To me, the thing about that aesthetic that in the thing about the small town rave scene and the thing about it is I don't I to this day, I have never encountered anything more satanic than looking at someone dressed like, you know, a toddler wearing like a muppet babies t-shirt covered in glitter, painted fingernails. You know what I mean? Glow stick. Vakes. Vips. What's it called? The vape Vicks vapor rub. You know what I mean? You look down. You're like it. One of these raves before, you know, it was became anything in your one of these raves. You are high as a fucking kite on some kind of crazy drug. And you look over. And there's someone dressed like a toddler whose eyes have rolled completely back in their head. I'm basically a seizure because they're on so much ecstasy and they're in like a cuddle puddle. Candy necklaces, the wafting sin of old men, the shit people used to rub on their chest when they had a cold, rising up from these like weird vignettes of like people dressed like babies. So high. We're this crazy fucking music coming out of giants. To this day, I've never seen anything that is like more like weirdly satanic. You know what I mean? Because it was and I don't know if that was the intention. If it's like, look, we're going to dress like babies, but we're going to be so fucking insane. I think you're you're right. It's like you're I hope nobody listening just thinks we're like trying to mutilate a culture's fashion. It's not about that. No way. You're basically seeing Tex Watson the moment after Manson first convinced him to drop everything. There you go. You know what I mean? That's it. Because like once once somebody sees that there's this like the older brother that's doing this cooler thing and then they go out and buy the outfit. There's a moment of inflation where they think they know everything. Yeah. And really they're just in this really dangerous like you're saying these dangerous waters of kind of vague conformism that are such a pathetic moment. And we all experience it and we all remember the clothes that we bought and we all remember the fucking hairstyle we had when we were totally diluted. But at that moment that kid doesn't get it. And they think they're onto this thing and you don't you don't get it. And you're like, I mean, you're kind of feeling so bad for yourself and them finding yourself in this world. And I had come out of like hardcore and hardcore. It was like in punk, you know, the entire structure of punk socially like the sentiment of punk with all that like, let's get back to what's real. Yeah. And the entire world of the subculture was a bunch of people posing as tougher or more real. But like no one person really felt that way. So there was this intense competition trying to embody this sense of punk. So you've got this entry level kind of conformism just running rampant. And I had already wrestled with that with all my high school buddies in our in our first hard club. So so by the time I'm getting to college, I mean, I'd kind of seen these patterns and you have to understand like the pain of competing with other little boys. Like when you're in high school is so deep. It's like such a deep cut because inside I just thought like, well, I want to do this thing. I believe in the power of art. I believe in these songs and the ability this open horizon of creativity. But in order to perform that creativity to practice it, you're taught that you have to have a band in the in the guise of Beatles and you have to go to the music store and you have to buy all this stuff. I was like, no, I just want to do the thing, the pure thing. But like everybody around me just agreeing on what day to practice, what time to be there. Like someone getting mad because someone else's girlfriend is there. Like someone's amp not working. Someone having, you know, just like the minutiae of the struggle to make the thing was so laborious and annoying. And every, I mean, the problem was everybody's ego, everybody feels that they are the star, no matter if they're just the fucking tambourine player. There's always this sense that you've got to wrestle with everybody sense that they're really the superstar. And so from ninth grade, I was already just like, dude, just let me do the thing I want to do. I don't care if it even fucking works out. Just like, yeah, why do I have to go through this process and older people were telling me, yeah, you got to get up on stage at the local club. You got to like make make some buzz happen. You got to start getting people to your shows. And then eventually, you know, someone might put it in record, I was like, fuck all this shit. I'm not going to do all this shit. And so by the time that I met you, I was just like hardcore in my private feet, you know, trying to crack this code. And so kids walking through that were just sort of, I call them converters, like people who have just taken on a whole thing and they take it on way too strong. Yeah. There's this old friend of mine, this girl in Portland, who had just started dating one of these guys and he had gotten in his head in one weekend that he was going to be part of the Portland bike messenger culture. You know, that's kind of like something that's been lampooned quite a bit, but like, that was like a really tough guy punk. Well, sometimes cross punk stance. And this guy had went out bought the outfit, and he went into this bar that was known for being like an underground bike messenger bar. Yeah. He saw a SUV of like subtle, I mean, I guess they were frat boys. I don't know what they were. They weren't really anything, but they he identified them as the enemy because the night before he'd been anointed in his mind as this special warrior, this special messenger. So he just slashed their tires. What? Because they were in his mind, the enemy, and they just walk out, see him slashing tires and just brutally destroy him. Just completely beat him near to death. And like, he has to go to the hospital. And what's he's just lying in that bed, you know, thinking like that kind of jihad righteousness. You know what I mean? Sure. Yeah. And that's the converter. That's the converter's inflation, the ego inflation that happens right after you join a club like that. Yeah. You know, man, it's so curious how regardless like of where it shows up in these little clicks and clacks, this hierarchy appears. You get neophytes who feel somehow that with somewhere if they could just get far enough up that hierarchy that they'll a great mystery will be revealed. You know, or like, like it's like that whatever the particular click is, somehow it represents the possibility of escape from the oppressive mundanity of day to day life. And it's somehow in there there, they will get, you know, the taste of the whatever the thing is. And no matter how like these things show up everywhere, it's crazy to think it shows up obviously with music, obviously with comedy, but bike messengers. We even thought a community existed around that, but it, but it shows up. And it's like, and within wherever there's that kind of hierarchy aggression appears. And it's the, you know, that's to me, that that's the part that's like always the same. You know what I mean? That's the, no matter, that's the water and the particular form is the ice cube tray, but you always see like this aggressive thing that appears just what you're talking about. And that's the, that's embarrassing. It's an embarrassing thing when you see someone trying to like bully their way through or up or into a thing, take it over, become it. And sometimes like the aggression, I'm sure you've seen this sometimes all the, all the aggression becomes the primary, like whatever the original thing was that goes away. And then it's just all that's really embraced is the politics, the navigating. And then that's why sometimes you'll see in a variety of different art forms, people who seemingly have risen to the top, but you just don't know, it doesn't make sense. You know what I mean? But it's like, oh no, they just did the right steps. They didn't, you know what I'm talking about? Like there wasn't really like anything more than that. You know, they just, Yeah, I mean, you're talking about Keith or Neri, you're talking about the head of Nixxiom. Yeah. The people that just jumped through like a certain amount of hoops. And then at that point, I mean, he never even really claimed to be a spiritual character, but people made him into one. Yeah. You know what I mean? Keith or Neri. There's cults everywhere you look that that I think back in the nineties when you were sort of, we were both really interested in cults. It wasn't a thing that most people talked about back then. But I think maybe partially we were just, there's a lot of double meanings in there. But I think we were probably fascinated with this kind of induction, like thinking errors, the leap of faith, all the different things that come along with cult thinking. But like, you're going to not believe this, but like back in Portland, we also had this cult that was based around worshiping the Partridge family. Oh, yeah. You've heard of that? Yes. Yes. And they were violent. I think they came up from LA maybe actually, but they actually beat the shit out of people. I mean, people will celebrate anything. They will see symbolism. Like is it in Slacker where they're talking about Papa Smurf is like Hitler and that Smurf is a secret Nazi cult. I mean, it's like the cults are everywhere you look. And dude, look at us now. 2020, it's the age of the rebirth of the cult. People are staying crazy cult nonsense everywhere you look. It's fucking amazing. Oh, you mean QAnon? Yeah, basically. Yeah. QAnon is like the perfect, it's the perfect formula for a cult because you have such a... First of all, what's really brilliant about QAnon as far as cult shit goes is like it seems to be fairly decentralized in the sense like they have a mystery leader who just sweets ambiguous shit or puts out QDrops as they're called. And then these are up for interpretation. But there's some kind of weird like grapevine of these people where they, you know, trade ideas that all seem to be like based on the idea that the elites of the world are worshiping a Babylonian God, right? This is it. They worship a Babylonian God. It never went away. Like the worship of Moloch, it didn't go away. It just went underground. Exactly. And so, you know, the whole thing of like eating babies or whatever turned into the consumption of Adrenochrome, which apparently reverses the aging process. And the whole structure, it sounds like things I've thought when I've been like having a really terrible trip. You know, when you're having like the great paranoid trip and you start looking around and you're like, oh my God, it's the world of the devil. It's the world. Everything's Satanic. Everybody. Why are there pentagrams on cop cars? Why would they put pentagrams on cop cars? Man, that's the devil. You know what I mean? That's funny. You say that because like, you know, the old saying that like, no matter if you're completely not religious or you, if you're weakened to like a really intense extent that you'll start praying, you know, that idea. It's like, that's what you're talking about. Like the spirit of these people has become so insanely weakened, right? That they're starting to see symbols everywhere. It's almost like they're like, they're dying or something. It's like their immune system, their spine is so deteriorated that they're reaching out for a hand to follow in any direction and getting scooped up by a pyramid scam. Yeah. But also, I mean, this is the, isn't it? I think like in that world, like in that world, in the world of any cult in general, but in a world where you've sort of, you get gifts from a cult. The first gift is the gift of discovery, you know, like you become an initiate. You feel like you have hidden knowledge and that's a very powerful feeling, right? Like I know something that the world doesn't know and it's something so incredible. It will transform anyone who hears it if they believe it. That's, you know, that's huge. Now this is, it's essentially like, remember, I think Curb Your Enthusiasm had an episode that made fun of this phenomena. But there was a period when people would be like, hey, my friend has a brother who's in the CIA. And he said, get out of LA for a couple of weeks or whatever, like something's going down. This was post September 11th. Everybody would have secret information and you'd hear it and you're like, fuck, I should get out of town. It was a version of this, what would happen when I was in elementary school. I remember one day somebody came and said, their pastor had said today, the world would end at noon. Like you're looking at the clock, like fuck, really? But you know what I mean? But it's like, so that's the first gift of the cult is the secret data like that you feel like you have and that you share with the devotees of the cult. And then the second, I guess, gift of the cult is this kind of like hope in the sense that the world has meaning. So you get this delicious sense of like, oh my God, it all makes sense. All the suffering of the world. I get it now. Like the reason things are so fucked up is because of this Babylonian death cult consisting of billionaires and trillionaires who are extracting the life energy from the sheeple and using it to maintain eternal youth. And you know what I mean? So it's like that then in that version of reality is grim as it is. I guess for some people it's a little less grim than, you know, what I've heard, which is like, oh no, it's just you're dealing with like rolling forms of chaos energy that are being adapted to by various cobbles of people with completely disparate intent. You know what I mean? There's no like world dominance. There's no, there's no one way that because that's the hope, right? I mean, that is kind of the dream that you get around all the rich people. You get around all the rich people of the world. The super elite, like finally you get in the great chamber where they're like rubbing adrenochrome on their tits or whatever they do. And they see you and they're like, yes, yes, there is a plan. Yes, we have it all under control. Instead of the reality, which is like you run into most of these people and they're like, I have no idea what's happening. You know, they legitimately are confused or they're just trying to get laid. You know what I mean? There isn't anything there more than that. Exactly. Yeah. I mean, it's funny because I feel like I don't want to say that we bear some responsibility for pointing kids in the direction of occult thinking.

Back when you gave me Behold the Pale Horse, you know, this would be 1996 or something. Back when we were playing in the waters of, you know, we wanted to know everything that we could about Satan. That was just blatant, pure curiosity, just mere curiosity. Like we just wanted to know everything, right? There was no sort of focus on, there was never any talk between you and I about joining a cult. There was never any point where we said, let's go see if we can get in the masons. We'd peer in the window of the Masonic Temple and we'd creep away like being all freaked out, you know, on acid or whatever. But like there was never any talk of like trying to join something. And when you get back to that Tex Watson moment, you're talking about people who need a family so bad or need a structure. Or they deeply desire some sort of structuralism to come and swoop in and take away their independent, you know, their responsibilities. And something that will take care of them and whisk them away. And we just never had any of that impulse or instinct. I mean, in terms of like looking for a family or anything, and now you fast forward to now in like this talk of cults and stuff. It's done by people who have more of an agenda. It's not just raw curiosity. You see people talking online. They're playing with it for reasons, you know what I mean? And so I feel like along the way, you know, maybe I wrote this song called Things You Do While Waiting for the Apocalypse. Like I've had kids on my Facebook walls like saying like, how did you know about the the the patterns that we're going to take over in 2020? Because if you read the lyrics, it sounds it sounds like conspiracy theory. But there was it's that's not what I meant, you know, and I'm sure you've you've sort of sort of nudged people often to like exploring new territory. But here we are talking now like refuting a lot of this shit. I mean, we know for a fact from from like comments underneath your podcast that people think that you are like in the CIA or they think you're in these cults. Yeah, like they believe that. And I was I mean, have you ever actually refuted that? Have you ever said I'm not involved with any of the stuff? I mean, have you ever had people come up to you in person or like pursue you? Yeah, I mean, you know, to see this is what what's interesting about like all specifically like the CIA, which I am most certain if I'm a fucking member of the CIA, they owe me some money. They haven't got a paycheck. You know what I mean? Like I'm working for free over here. Come on. But I think that the the the I just the problem of like, like, because the CIA has to is like, you know, is its own secret society has to function in secret has to function in, you know, compartment has to compartmentalize itself for just like any other corporation and within those compartments, God fucking knows what's happening. You can apply for a job if you really want to like demystify the CIA just go to their shitty website. Why does the CIA have such a shitty website? But they also have an archive of all the we just everything they just put it all out there. And you look at it and it's like, oh, wow, man, y'all are like definitely just trying to like vacuum up all data like what we were doing, you know, and and like the CIA doesn't care where it's coming from. I just want to know what these cults and little subterranean groupings of people are up to, because I think they want to protect, you know, the United States, right? But somewhere in there, things go crazy because it's you know, it's the thing it's where it gets Philip K. Dick, where the thing starts invest like investigating itself and then you get these ridiculous feedback loops happening with the CIA. I guess I mean, who the fuck knows? I don't know. But, you know, I applied. I did apply when I was super stoned to the web because it was funny to me because because like the first thing it says in the way people should know I'm not in the goddamn CIA is the first thing on the CIA website when you're trying to apply. They're like, don't tell anybody you're applying. You know, that's what's cool about it. Like you apply and then we'll find you. You know what I mean? Like that's what there's no like you literally have to apply. You don't know what's going to happen. I guess maybe you're just walking down the street and somebody comes up and like, hey, email. Get in the car. It's time for your job interview. You know what I mean? And so then you become part of the CIA. I don't think I've, have you ever met a CIA agent? I don't think I've even ever met one that I'm aware of of you. Not that I know. I've met people who have tried to trick me and just that experience in itself. I mean, usually it was like, you know, some sort of roving criminal in a grateful dead parking lot or something. Those, those people that they exploit you when you're at your most high moment. And that is the creepiest thing that usually comes to my memory. But no, yeah, I've never met any of these people. I mean, we're insignificant to them. Like, like I would be interested to get your freedom of information act. That would be interesting to see if, if there's any sort of like anyone that's ever watched you just because you, I mean, you've left the country and you, you sort of like speak to a big group of people. I don't know. You know, once I went to get the thing where you don't have to stand in line at the airport. I can't remember what it's called like trusted flyer. You would have to go to LAX and get interrogated by somebody. And then you don't have to go like, basically you don't have to go through the same bullshit screening process that other people have to go through. And not everybody does it because you have to pay for it and it's a fucking pain in the ass. Like you had to drive to LAX and you're not flying anywhere. But I remember sitting with this, this, I don't know, security agent for my interrogation, which I've been looking forward to all day. Because I'm like, what the fuck is he going to ask me? And he's like, had something on the screen and he said to me, so you like to make fun of the president? He did say that. He totally said that. That's amazing. And I don't know what, whether it was because like it said that I was, I was a comedian or because like something popped up like that somewhere online. I made fun of like Trump or Obama. I don't know. But it was a really chilling moment where I'm like, oh my God. Like that's so funny. What the fuck? Like, you know, what the fuck? What are you looking at? I should have asked him like, is that on there? But I got to, it's like, you know, I got to travel. I mean, I don't look, I think, you know, more than likely there's if you have any kind of like voice at all, you've someone's probably looked into you. You know what I mean? They just want to find out what like I'm like, it's also though, I thought the CIA only worked. In other countries, I thought they didn't invest the, I thought they were foreign like FBI would investigate the FBI investigates domestic people. The CIA investigates shit. The CIA are the people who like, you know, because this is to me the really thrilling. You don't sound like you're in the CIA. You sound like you don't even know anything about government structures. No, I'm not in the fucking CIA. I mean, honestly, I went, I went on Rogan and was like, we were, I was talking about how I had gotten stoned and applied to the CIA. And we're just laughing about it. And then on my, on my, on my subreddit, someone who was clearly very smart wrote this thing about, hey, I just want to say, I know Duncan was talking about the CIA on Joe Rogan. A lot of what they were saying is completely wrong. And I just wanted to put out here more of what the CIA is about. And I was looking at like, oh my God, that's the fucking CIA and they're recruiting. You know what I mean? Like it was like, it was so funny because it was, and it was really intelligent, boring, dry. You know what I mean? A long sort of like list of shit about other countries. And I skimmed it and was bored with it in like seconds. And I thought, oh, that's this, that's definitely the CIA and they're fucking boring. And I never in a million years want to be involved in that shit. Because I think most of them are just like, you know, surveilling like, like sex and cults of like, you know, extremists in other countries. And it just sounds really boring and not, and like, just not fun. Like it's not like born identity shit. It just seems like you just have to sit in front of a computer and like, like listen to people's phone calls. And it's probably just incredibly boring. Yeah, there's probably people listening that don't know that there's people out there that really think you're some sort of underworld, like evil king or something. It's, I've seen it. I've seen these kids write this shit. My dear friends, we have a wonderful new sponsor, Mudwater. You thinking about getting off the old coffee train, you sick of pouring that dark black demonic brew down into your insides, leaving your insides all gooped up, splattered and acidified, leaving your, your, your, your spinal cord trembling like a worm in the rain as you fall into various mild paranoid anxiety induced deliriums.

And like they just stepped off the ship on some like really hardcore Salvia trip or something that, you know, they stepped off the mainstream boat. And the first thing they do, you know, in a paranoid delusion is they start, you know, trying to decode the different things out there in the world that may symbolize something. Some sort of greater allegiance to the occult, which you, I mean, clearly, like most things in life, you're projecting all this shit, man. And like they, somehow because you're playing in the waters, these waters, you're talking about basically like off the beaten path spirituality, they just, they're suspicious of you, I guess. And it just seems really entry level and misguided, but people take this stuff really fucking seriously. And it seems irresponsible not to make fun of those people. Well, I mean, well, I mean, yeah, it's like, I think like the what's, what's sweet is that the people is number one that you step off the cruise ship. That's a nice thing, even if you are smoking Salvia, which I don't recommend at all. But I think like where, where a lot of people get confused is that they, they, they're, oh, they're looking at human organizations, you know, it's like, you know, the, it's the CIA, the FBI, the WHO, the CDC, all these little stupid little like clusters of just business people. Not that the CDC stupid, but you know, they're looking to, they're trying, it's again, it's like, you know, one of the things that's going to happen, I think in a world where people are getting increasingly distanced from any kind of connection with the mystical is that they start idolizing the state. And like, you know what I mean? So the idolatry, the way it forms is either like a strange and embarrassing respect for the office of the president or the Supreme Court or whatever. The, you know what I mean? It's like strange thing that is more than just like, yeah, you know, I really love that it's so great that firefighters put out fires. Like, thank God there's people who are willing to risk their lives to go into buildings and put out fucking fires because I wouldn't want to do it. Thank God. That's, that's good. You should respect firefighters, but there's this fetishistic thing that quickly turns into a kind of bizarre form of bootlicking. So like, you know, you see it in the pundits from the left and from the right where they're just like going on and on about the glories of the presidency or something. And it's really bizarre when you realize like, oh my God, that is a fanatic of a religion that consists of the state, the state and the apparatus of the state. And it's really sad because it's idolatry. And so, but, you know, I love like Alex Gray's idea of visionary art. And I love the idea that a lot of psychonauts and certainly anybody who's like a actual like mystic has, which is like, oh no, these little temporary manifestations of human intent that form as corporations or, you know, positions of power and all of this, these, these all just fall away. These are really nothing. And if you go looking for God in these things, you all you're going to find is confusion. But, you know, I think we probably both agree that, I don't know, I think we do both agree that inspiration, maybe it doesn't, it's not really, it doesn't come from the, from, I think a lot of my inspiration comes from the realm of the occult. And a lot of my great inspiration. And a lot of the things that drive me and excite me are like contact that I've made with entities that aren't necessarily embodied and that aren't malefic at all, but rather seem to really want to help the world and like recognize the suffering of the world. And like, there's something really exciting and delightful about the idea that there is a, there is like, there are things out there that don't go to offices in the Pentagon. You know what I mean, but that have like made contact with our species and really do want to upshift the consciousness of the planet. And I think that scares people because they're like, no, that's the devil. The devil wants to upshift the consciousness of the planet. The fucking devil wants the planet to be flourishing. The devil wants to go back to the days where people were dancing in fields, having orgies. The devil wants you to take mushrooms. The devil wants to speak for the earth. You know, that's what they think when it's like, really, it's the devil that's made, the devil is the thing that's making them scared. You know, the devil is the thing that's like making the QAnon people obsessed with like, you know, tech autocratic elite people molesting children and somehow completely ignoring the fact that the Catholic church is like, the popes have actively protected pedophiles. You know what I mean? Like, you don't hear them talking about that as much. It's that people are worshiping Malik. Meanwhile, there's an entire world religion that has as a priest class an entire swath of them that are many of them are in jail for fucking kids. You know, but so, you know, to me, I do, I don't mind that people identify me as having some occult like, I love the occult. When people, I get, I get really defensive when people start trying to throw witches and Satanists under the bus, you know, because my encounter with them, they're always sweet. You know what I mean? So, so I do understand why people think that I just think where people are confused is they think that like, that I'm like, I don't know, you know, burning fucking weird oils or something. I'm muttering chants and shit. You know, and I, they probably think that about you too, because people have a, generally, like, they're, they're, don't, I'm sorry, I've gone on too long a ramp. But the reality is like, if you want to like understand this stuff, you're, you're not, you need to find it yourself and look into it yourself, not try to find it in other people. Like you need to get in there yourself and try to reach out to it and see if it talks to you. And then if it does, how does it talk? What language does this be? And what is it saying to you? And if, for me, most of the time I run into anything that's telling me to shut up, I know I've encountered actual evil. But anytime I run into a thing that's like telling you, no, see, go sing about love or, you know, like, don't be afraid. That's another thing, you know, when angels make contact with people in the Bible, they always say, don't be afraid. So if you run into anything that's saying, be afraid, you're probably in the presence of something that is an angelic, you know. Yeah, seems like you've, you sort of prescribed the fact that the world's suffering from the ultimate disease of fear. But on another level, I think that stepping off the cruise ship, I think there's like an instant ego inflation. The second you, you know, you start being curious is the nature of being open and vulnerable, right? You make yourself vulnerable to let something in. And that's the moment of true beauty because you're sacrificing yourself potentially, you're not guarding yourself. And so when you open up and then you learn something, you take in information that is a pure process, you're not, you're not tainting it with confirmation bias. Then after the lesson is learned, like something new is learned, I think there's a pattern, sort of like two steps forward, one step back or something. I think there's a pattern of ego inflation that happens where people, as soon as they learn something, want to stop learning to bathe in this new superiority they're feeling, right? Right, right. And that's an incredibly powerful pattern, so powerful that somebody's stepping off this cruise ship of the mainstream into your podcast, they're starting to play with concepts that are new. And then they kind of dig their heels back, shut down, put up their guard and say, no, no, I'm an expert on this. I can tell that you have an allegiance to the Dark Lord and you're working against us. Well, that's not remaining vulnerable, that's not staying open, that's not being curious, that's being lustful towards the logical conclusion of something you've already decided before you even became vulnerable. That's falling prey to the games of fear and that's not pursuing this great creative positive thing that we are after, you know. So I find it really amazing that you can meet very, very intelligent people that fall prey to these patterns, all sorts of insidious, weird patterns that often just seek to use views and make money off of you as an underling. But like very smart people fall into these whirlpools of idiocy. Yeah, yeah, it's so weird and it's so sad, too. It's like, I mean, you know, it's just interesting, it's like to me, I love the version of Satanism that is depicted in those chick tracks, you know those? Oh yeah, dude, love them. Love them. And that version of Satanism, it's such a delight in the sense that it definitely presents a way out of suffering, which is like really, you have to do some ridiculous like aligning yourself with this, you know, being that for whatever reason just wants you to burn forever and hell. Like, you know, like a real basic bitch, like that version of Satan is just like so, so boring and basic. It wants to deceive you, trick you, but also during that deceiving and tricking process, you're going to be on some great drugs, you're going to be fucking so many people and your band's going to take off. You're going to have like a little pentagram tattoos on you or whatever. And then like, inevitably your band's van goes off a sea cliff. And as you're plunging into the sea, the devil appears and is like, I got you. It's so stupid. It's so basic and weird and like, and what really sucks about it. The part to me where like, it's, it's malicious is that it is so against art. It's just is the most suppressive thing. And you know what I mean? It's like, and talk about the gatekeepers, the very worst kind of person. And I know you've encountered this man is a person who once you've achieved any kind of success takes credit for it when they really had nothing to do with it. You know what I mean? That's the worst piece of shit. Is the person who fantasizes that they gave you like, if not for them, you wouldn't be, I've been around people like that, man. And they're, it's like, when you, I've been around people who are so noxiously narcissistic that you begin to grok that they think that you're lucky that you're around them. You know what I mean? And then they start doing these like weird, they think they're doing some kind of subtle teaching to you to improve you or something like that. It's the exact opposite. Anytime you run into someone like you or, you know, anybody who's like legitimately cool is legitimately cool people. They don't care. You know what I mean? It's not like they don't care about you, but they're not like their ego isn't all engaged in your personal evolution. You know what I mean? But you run into the vampiric narcissist and like you realize like, oh my God, like no one's really friends with you. Everyone just kind of enters into your fucking stupid mystery school. You know what I mean? Where you like, you're, you're, you're sort of downplayed yet rather obvious sort of observations on popular culture. Maybe they have like a, you know, maybe maybe they're a little, maybe they have a deep understanding of some style of music or some style of like film or whatever. But you just start realizing like you think, oh my God, you think you're like some high priest and you think you're sharing with me some fucking great data. Meanwhile, you know what I mean? They're all puffed up talking about like the Three Stooges is the peak of comedy. It's totally that kid that you, uh, do you remember you take like, you know, eight hits of liquid LSD and go out on the football field with some kid like that. And then they start leaking like, you know, that term that like, like serial killers and super liars, they leak information accidentally. Yeah. Like they start leaking like this insane reverberation of like pure sad loneliness. And like, you know, they start like muttering stuff about how they just really need to get their hands on some money or like just like really crazy week, you know, tenants start coming out of them. Because they've spent so much time deluding you and it's in those moments where the older brother dies or the or the parental entity dies. You're like, God, I've spent all this time looking up to these people my whole life. I've wasted so much of my time to the point where some people don't even want to look back. They just want to keep putting stock into it because of their own weakness that they think this is the only ladder there is to climb. You know, that independence and the beauty of exploring on your own won't lead to some sort of palpable trophy. But that's what we're trying to say. It's like, leave, you know, leave the scaffolding, leave the structuralism, go away and you will find the same beautiful thing that the Buddha found. It's there for you. But don't you know, don't fall prey to these fucking idiots, man. Yeah, man, don't fall. Because they get, I mean, it's like, that's the thing. Like, I'm, I think it's, it would be dishonest to say there isn't some like, like weird pleasure that comes when you realize that someone thinks you're in the CIA. You know what I mean? It's funny, you know, but, but also like, it's like, you know, there's inside of me, you know, there's like, I really do think decentralization is, is like, it's one of the more important things right now. And that, that, that, you know, the more like, you got to watch out because, you know, you number one, you can't do phony unholy, which Ram Dass talks about, which is like, if you don't recognize that you like everybody on the planet has something to offer people around them, their community, like gifts you can give and like ways that you can like, you know, help people feel better. You know, just some people pretend they don't have that. And then because of that, they reduce themselves and become very unhelpful. But the other side of that is when like, you realize like people are recognizing, like you were saying earlier, that the insecurity of folks who really just want a family is so profound that they begin to centralize people like that around them. You know what I mean? And, you know, this, like, for me, like the example of, of the way it should look is like those, those Ram Dass retreats, you know, like, you could say it was centralized. People like being around Ram Dass. It was great. He would like go out into the ocean and like rainbows would appear over his head. I saw it. It was insane. It was beautiful. But Ram Dass was never trying to take credit for anything. You know what I mean? He was never like, this is because of me. This is, this is me. He was always talking about his guru and his guru is never trying to take credit for anything. Like there's stories of Neem Karoli Baba where people would try to write little Bibles about stuff that was happening. You ever heard that story? Like somebody had been writing everything he said down in a book and he made them throw it away. I mean, it's, it's ironic that, you know, that's the guru has to defrag the idea of the guru constantly. But there's got to be, it's just people's need to congregate, right? They're not maybe always wanting to find something to follow so they can stay as a child. But maybe they're just naturally trying to, you know, buzz around with something that they think is beautiful and good. So then that thing being Ram Dass has to like constantly, you know, basically fracture and demystify and deconstruct the guru paradigm just so they can like stay on their own. But yeah, we're all together here and we're focused. Our eyes are on the fucking prize, dude. Don't look at me. Yeah. Why? Yeah, that's, that's the, did I, did I tell you the thing Ram Dass said to me when I asked of you as my guru? Yeah, I think so. But say it again. He goes, yeah, but now what? And, and, and you know, like this, there's this brilliant Buddhist scholar named Bob Thurman who at one of these Ram Dass retreats was the funniest thing he gets on stage in front of these many people have come because of Ram Dass and be here now. And the first thing he says is be here now. What does that mean? That doesn't mean anything. Be here now. Be here now. I don't know what that means. And it was the best because he broke. He broke the idol, you know, and, and like that's the, that's the thing is like we, it's good to do that because we, you know, we just like what you're saying. It's like if we get too caught up in one person, one, whatever, it's the tent pole structure. You know, it's like anytime there's a tent pole, it's, it's fucked because like when the tent pole goes away, the whole thing falls apart. So you know what I mean? Like, yeah, I love, um, I really, really love certain musicians. You know what I mean? Like they're amazing and I'm, I'm, I feel lucky that like they create a situation where we can go and like, for lack of a better word, worship their art. You know what I mean? Like I love that that they put them, you go, y'all put yourself on a stage and you fucking put out like incredible music and we all get a chance to adore what you're doing and you, and that's okay. You know what I mean? There's that's good. That's fine. That's like a joy. You know what I mean? Fandom and all that. And all that's wonderful. It's like the, it's, it's irresponsible to then try to get people to think that because of this certain thing, you're like a holy person or a saint or any of that, you know, because yeah, then, then you just, it ends up becoming a mess. And all you're going to do is disappoint people. Like that's the main thing. You're just going to disappoint. People are just going to get disappointed when they realize like, oh my God, man, you're, you're, you stink. You stink. Your body stinks. You know what I mean? That's totally the, you can always feel that if somebody's trying to protect their brand by like not opening up that kind of conversation and just trying to maintain the idea that they are some sort of holy entity. You can always feel that energy. And I feel like, like podcasting, for example, I was never supposed to podcast because like cool musicians don't do that. You know, you don't see the cool musicians like opening up for two hours of improv because it's ugly. And the idea is to actually demythologize some of this stuff and get into what is ugly and actually tell a true story. The thing that's the most redeeming, you know, is not to, not to build a brand to continually make money off people and stay in the distance. Just like the Wizard of Oz and just like what you were talking about before with QAnon, you know, not to hide. It's to, it's to reveal yourself, you know, the actual redeeming thing that we're all after the thing that, you know, I feel like the Beatles are pulling you towards this thing of goodness inside yourself. And the Stones are just there to essentially rape you and steal your wallet. You know, but it's like, there's like, it's just, it's just reverberating there for you. But if you get caught up in that same old capitalist system, if you get caught up in that same old game, then you can, you can see people, they will leak that their mission is to hide. They'll leak that their mission is to never reveal themselves because they're terrified too. And it's not even to say that you and I aren't vulnerable. We've had, you know, countless heroes and like Ram Dass, we've looked up to them and asked if, you know, they were our guru. But it's really important to get to that phase where you become so depressed because you realize it's not going to work that way. You know, it's not going to work out. You have to get to that phase that's totally deflating that, you know, you won't get to stay a child and you will have to become the adult. And you will have to live in the world with consequences and responsibility that you'll never be able to hide away in this fucking fantasy thing. They're telling you and selling you. God forbid, man. I mean, did I tell you that story about the Buddha when he goes to see and meets Brahman? Have you ever heard that story? Oh, tell me again. He meets God. Basically the synopsis is the Buddha through meditation meets God. God's around all the other gods. They'll dimmy gods, you know, and so it's Brahman. And so then God sends Buddha back and then shows up in the grove and says, look, I sent you away because Buddha was going to God because to find out how to like take away the sorrows of humanity. And Brahman says to him, look, man, these other gods think I'm God just because I was the first one here. But I have no idea who made any of this. And I have. And I'm letting them believe I'm their daddy just because, you know, they need me. But I don't know who made any of this. And I don't know how to do the human stop human suffering. Can you help me figure it out? And so that that's the best story of the disillusioned. Like, like imagine getting to God and realizing like God being like, no, I have no idea. This shit's older than me. I don't know. I have no idea. I'm sorry. You know, like that that is the best because the moment that happens to you, you've been given all your projection. Back. You've been given the. Now it's like, now you are a participant. You know, and instead of instead of somebody who's like doing what Chogyam, Trump or Rinpoche called spiritual hitchhiking. You know what I mean? Now you're now you're in your own car. You participate. You're in it for real. And that's beautiful. That's in that in communities of people who are doing that are lovely. You know what I mean? Because in the community, it's the interfacing between people is where the guru shows up. You know, and that's incredible. That's that's what I loved about those retreats, man. That's where the real magic would happen where like, I remember once meeting somebody there who was the first time they come. And like, I was just chatting with her. And then we went and sat at a table. And all of a sudden the her and the person she's talking to, they, they both realize that they both have just lost children like within the last like year. You know what I mean? Like, you know, and then they both just start crying because they're comforting each other. It's that. You know what I mean? That whatever the fuck that is, that's to me, that's the guru. That's it. And you can't put that in a bottle. You can't capture it. You can't wrap it up in something and control it because it comes when it comes and sometimes it's there. Sometimes it's not. And that that's what I love, which is why it's so dastardly when some motherfucker pretends he or she is that thing. Like it's dastardly to do that to people. It's fucked up to do that to people. You know, that's really, really, I think as an actual sin is to do that to people. And it doesn't just happen with spiritual communities. It happens just like you're saying with bike messengers. It happens with any time you run into that motherfucker who's the hot potato. You know what I mean? It's the worst. Yeah, it's the thing like internet culture saved me and you. I hate to give it so much credit, but the internet like it gave us a way to just reverberate what we were doing at home through this, you know, narrow window out into the world. But along with the rise of the internet came the rise of the know it all. And now we live in, you know, this ultimate hater culture. The rise of the know it all. Totally. And what what is the know it all the know it all is someone who wants to shut the conversation down at every turn as efficiently as possible to prove and have the last laugh. But that's what you're going back to those those people saying they've lost the children. It's that the healing that the creativity in that field as they bond, it's that vulnerability. It's it's like remaining open. Like there's no know it all presence in between them. The wall is kind of lowered. So it's just as we take two steps forward and two and one step back in the sense that we have this ego inflation upon learning. We also once we get we learn from like the vulnerability learning from pain. We then tried to set up a whole fortress again so that we'll never get hurt again. Yeah. It's idiocy after we've just learned from pain. You know, so I think there's this constant kind of sense of like, well, I get it now. So I'm done with the process. Right. But I think that the know it all wants to say they're done with the process, which obviously we know never happens. But remaining vulnerable. That's you mean that's what a great artist and what you were talking about the occult like remaining vulnerable to your own unconscious to like let it speak to you to let the world to engage with the world. Those are that's the way of you know, just like lowering the walls. Yeah. Like it's like, yeah, because really whatever the fucking thing is that you're like, you know, you could you can you're whatever the medals are that you're jingling on your little bike messenger shirt or whatever or whatever you're giving yourself medals for there. That's over now. Like you might have gotten a million awards. Those are gone now. I mean, that was like what was always so awesome about stand up comedy is saying like you're only as good as your last set. It's like, you know, whatever the fuck happened before this, it's gone. And you I know what you mean that that instinct to like hold on to anything. God damn it. Please just give me one little place to like really this is a God here. And it's not I know you also I think there is something to be said for a little basking. You know what I mean? It's cool to like bask for a second. But then sure as fuck that basking turns into like tanning and the tanning turns into like some cancerous activity that's giving you a melanoma because you've been laying under some dumb fucking heating light that your ego invented. Because like, you know what I mean? Like whatever it is, it's really quite depressing. When you run and think it's like, I don't think basking is the is the word for like feeling good about your connection to the universe. I think it's I mean, not ticker. I don't think that's what you were saying, but like, I think that what feels good is true spiritual confidence, like knowing that you are in touch with something. And feeling that like even after, you know, some sort of match or set or concert or something that like if you had to go back out there and do it again, you could do it even better. You know what I mean? Like there's never any sense of being tired. There's never any sense that you want to give in and give up and like cash it in and bask. It's really the feeling like victory is just really actually knowing that you can perform at your best and being in touch with your skills and not being, you know, tired and kind of ready to sell it all to some sort of, you know, brand pursuit or making money off of people. It's like about getting back in the ring. That's that. Yes, I got to live. Yeah, man. That's it. That is it. It's that is what you and that's that's thing. Once you got that because it God doesn't hurt when that goes away. When you get lost in the bean counting and then you're just like your music. I don't know this. Maybe this doesn't even happen to you. But like for me, that's one of the most grim things is when I'm like, you know, like right now I'm in a good place creatively. And like any time I walk into my studio and I look at like my synths or the mug or like my microphone, I'm excited, you know, because like, oh, man, I'm going to make. I don't know what I'm going to make or make something, you know, and it's a joy. But when like, because, you know, that's it. You won't you're not going to get anything better than that. You won't. There's nothing in the world is it's it's going to that's going to replace that certainly not fucking money. You know, it's that not because that's that's why I was talking about the angels, you know, because it's like that that thing is bigger than the world. It cuts through the world or it's the world rests on it or it's the ground of all things. And it's like, I don't mean that in a pretentious way like I'm in contact with the ground of all things. There's nothing that special about it. You know, it's like my my also my two year old is in contact with the ground of all things. You know, like when he's playing in the creek, he's fully absorbed in the water and the creek and that's it. He's not thinking like if I do a good job in the creek, I'm going to get maybe I'll get a raise, a toddler raise. You know, it's like, yeah, he's in the creek and he loves it and he's playing and then he goes and that's it. You know, and that that yeah, that to me, that relationship, that connection cuts through all the bullshit and cuts through all of it. I think it's very difficult for all these motherfuckers. These seductive little fucking vampire Charismatics out there who like have like a sad cult of like, you know, depressed record collectors around them or whatever the fuck they're into. You know what I mean? I think like once you make that contact, your immune system won't tolerate that shit. You know, that's it. You know, you're not talking about like that thing when I was a kid, which was like, man, maybe I can get boy, I sure hope I get a smile from Jean. You know, whoever the coolest person in your mind was that's that's gone now. That's mostly gone. Not to say like, if you know, if like, if like, there's still like, I have idols, I idolize Stephen King. You know what I mean? I saw idols, but it's mostly gone now. Totally. I mean, I think the the truest, purest form of of actual deflation, actual sadness is when you walk into your room, your life, look at your instruments, things like that. And you look at your life and you you realize you kind of you're too tired. You don't want to be present for it. You don't want to participate in your own life, right? Yeah. And it's at that point, you know, you can. You can wait in those waters for a bit, but then it's time to to do whatever it takes, whatever ritual, whatever, you know, sacrificial task it takes to get back to that place where you actually want to live your life again. That's, you know, that's you're obligated to find that way to value this thing, because it's not going to be going much longer, you know. Yeah. Well, that I mean, yeah, it's like, exactly. That's it. And that's rebellion. And that's the thing where you just shake off all the all whatever it is. That's why this is why I love like, like Christianity is why I love Buddhism. This is why I love these things is because not not because of like some symbolic figure or anything, but because they really do fly in the face of all hierarchical power structures that want to give you a sense that you're trapped. I love that man. That to me is just such a joy. Even if you don't know how to get out of whatever your specific condition is, it's like just that like sparkling knowledge that there is a way out. It won't last. You will. There is like, you're going to see the shore. That is that. I don't know how to express it, but to me, that's just a delight because it really fucks up the whole game of people who are like, depending on you, thinking that that you're a necessary component in their path to happiness. It's true. It's like even just a Christian hymn is when it's saying, you know, when it's saying and it reverberates in a church, the feeling that you're, I feel like is intended is inclusion, you know, come into the house of the Lord, you know, you deserve to be here. Like we, we include you and you can, you know, step into this dimension of love, which is the opposite of everybody trying to exclude you out in the world in the cold, hard capitalist world. Everybody's trying to push you out of the door, right? Yeah. So yeah, it's that same spirit that where you know there is good. I mean, both of us dabbled with things, all sorts of things, but you know, we're lucky to feel that we know the path back to that place. Yeah. Yeah. That place, that place. And that is that there. That is what God was. I was just reading this great quote. I can't remember who said it. Maybe it was a Dalai Lama, some famous Buddhist, but it was saying like, no matter what the religion is, no matter what, if like a Christian is like through Christianity experiencing like transcendent bliss. That's Buddha. That's Buddhism. Buddhism isn't a thing like the, you know what I mean? It's not like a brand. It's like a state of consciousness. It's this like, it's that, I don't know. It's like when you're, you know, something like just when you're hanging out with people you love and you feel like you're warming your hand on like a fire. It's, it's jolly. It's cheery. It's that, that it's not some austere thing. Like I used to think it's not, you know what I mean? Like it's not, it's not a big deal anymore than it's a big deal to be like enjoying a nice day with your friends. Do you know what I'm saying? It's like, it's the, that's another thing that these motherfuckers do is they, they produce this path that's long and arduous and maybe it is. But like basically like the Keith Rainier, like God Jesus Christ, that guy created like a maze of initiation that ended within branding his initials on your pussy. Like, you know what I mean? Like he created like a thousand stupid initiatory rituals that just ended up exactly where any basic, boring, horny fucking dude. He's like a little fucking sick. Would want to be, you know, my dream would be to shave a girl's pussy and just put my initials on it. It's just not even the saddest, weirdest redneck on the beat of Daytona. Just like during the ultimate possible trophy. What the fuck was that? Holy shit. It's the supposed fucked up thing. Like you get, like that's what, and that's what I've heard with like Scientology is that the last thing is you get a briefcase, they open it up. In the briefcase, it's like some weird shit Elrond Hubbard wrote. It's like, doesn't make any sense in it. Like either it is, but by then you've spent so much money that you make it work. So it's like when they're getting branded and exactly like you said, it's like they're just, they're no different than somebody who like signed a release for girls gone wild. You know what I mean? It's like you're, yeah, you just basically ended up in Keith Rainier's version of girls gone wild. Vanguard was really just a dude who was like, hey man, let's do tequila shots. Let's have a three way. But your brain is like, but you are the van. You're my, you're my, what do they call him? My Vanguard. Yeah. You're my Vanguard, but they had other names for it. What did he call him? My Keith, Keith-ness or something. Gross. Anyway, the point is, it's like, yeah. And who do you have to blame? Who do you have to blame when you find yourself feeling a brand with Keith Rainier's initials going over your pussy? Who do you have to blame when your girlfriend who you got into the cult or your wife comes back home with a band of John that's got Keith Rainier's initials? Is it Keith Rainier you have to blame? Or is it the fact that you decided to be an idolater? I don't think there's a single moment in either of those documentaries where any of those people take responsibility. I can't remember a single moment where any of them say, yo, I fucked up. It's insane. The whole, the documentary, the vow and seduced, have you seen seduced yet? No. Oh, you'll just be screaming at the television every five minutes. The whole thing is based on how, like, they were just duped. They were tricked. And yet they are also acting as masters to their own slaves. Exactly. But they all play innocent and it's so, so sad. I mean, it's a testament to people's deep lust to escape their own responsibility in life, to get underneath someone else that will be responsible for everything. It's so fucking sick, but I couldn't turn away because I guess I just wanted to be angry about that. That is, to me, that's like the part where, like, that's the main thing. Like, these motherfuckers, it's not just that they were, like, vacuumed up into a cult. It's that they also let themselves be little mini cult leaders and had their own tyrannical bullshit. And in a weird way, some of them are replicating it still. I mean, that's the weird thing is, like, there's now they're, like, turning themselves into, like, survivors of a cult. But, I mean... Oh, exactly. There's even shots of that Nicki girl outside of the courthouse now where she looks just like the Manson girl. She still follows Keith. She's still outside the prison dancing around. I've seen this new video where the followers that still exist are dancing outside of Keith's prison window. Is that true? Yeah. Look it up. It's a fucking video that they published of themselves, like, frolicking through the prison parking lot. God, that's awesome, dude. It's still happening. Yeah. It's so crazy. I think that's why the show is so popular, because a lot of people, you know, didn't grow up maybe quite as obsessed with the Manson families we were. But, like, that was such a big deal back then, man. Like, Helter Skelter being in your high school library was like, that was... What are you going to check out over that? That's the book you're going to go check out of the library, man. Dude, I don't know why people aren't able to just say, yeah, I got, like, completely tricked. Like, I got taken in. I was dumb. Like, I just, like, you know, I just wanted to meet God, you know, and, like, I was lazy, so I let this guy be God for a second. It's really gross. And then, you know what I mean? Like, that, to me, is, like, it would be such a wonderful moment to see some of these fucking, like, Trump idolaters. To see, like, one of these... Like, imagine if one night, Tucker Carlson was like, oh, you guys, I just, you know what? I fell for it. I can't believe it. I fell for it. I decided, like, some real estate dude was, like, Abraham Lincoln, and, yeah, it was a mistake. That would be such a delight. You know what I mean? It would make them so much more powerful, too. You would be like, wow. I think it's structured so that people are put in a position to try to prey on each other. Right? Like, your friend isn't going to come to you and say, like, yo, dude, I tried the publisher's Clearinghouse with Ed McMahon on the front and stuff, and, like, it didn't work out for me. Like, nobody says that. They try to sell you the Avon stuff. They try to sell you the shit. Yeah. It's weird, right? Like, yeah, it's so bizarre. I mean, just, like, you can end up in a shitty relationship, and you can be like, yeah, I just made a mistake that I fucked up. I was just, I didn't, I was too, I didn't really see what was happening there, and it just kept going on and on. And, but somehow with cults, man, people just don't want to, they just don't want to give up. I get it, though. I get it. I mean, god damn it, I get it. There is something really sad when you realize you've just, there's not much of a difference between you and, like, a dog that you see humping someone's leg at a party. But that, but that sad moment is, like, the essential pivot point into adulthood. Like, you have to be let down like that. You can't remain in that place that basically the government or everybody's trying to put you in. They're trying to, you know, you can't, like, kill your neighbor in the ghetto because you're both so frustrated. You have to help lift each other. There's like this really pathetic video game that I play when I'm bored, and if you're in a fast car and you drive away from all the people chasing you, there's a point at which they'll all just turn on each other and kill each other because they're so frustrated they can't get to you. That's what game. That's awesome. I don't want to say what game it is, but the, but I mean, that is definitely a metaphor for a level of like the game for power, right? You know, it's, it's the, it's the obsession with winning, right? Yeah. And like at some point you have to just let it go, you know, you just have to let someone else fucking win and like not keep clawing at the man next to you, you know, just to try to get ahead. And that is, yeah, that's going to be a moment of great sadness, but you need to go there, man, the first day of the rest of your fucking life. Embarrassment too. Sadness and embarrassment. You, you like, you know, man, sometimes like I'll just end up in the woods with, with my kid and you just realized like, yeah, this is pretty much it. Like this is, this is a billion times better than anything that the work that you're going to get from like the, like being a careerist or from anything. Like this is the, just you're not going to get, nothing's going to surpass like taking a walk and then you go and, and, and walking in a creek with this two year old. You know what I mean? And, and that is it for me. Some like that's a, that's a weird moment because you're like, well, I could have done this or I could have done this sooner. You know, like maybe, maybe that's okay. You can, that's where you should bask. Maybe there is a basking in that because that you are being here now. You're finally letting yourself be there. You know. Yeah. But I mean that, I think for a lot of people that's, that's really, I think that could be a little bit, a dismay, even though it's nothing special. It's like the same shit you hear all the time. Alan Watts talks about it all the time. The Dowdy Ching talks about it all the time. Pretty much everybody talks about it, which is like, oh yeah, you do go ahead and do like all the human pursuit stuff, but you're not going to do better than nature. You do, you could become like the great emperor of planet earth and you could have like a fucking fanny pack full of ladrinochrome or whatever the fuck slurping it back into the whole, the nations of the world are bowing to you, but you're not going to do better than a river. You can't become more noble than like a basic pine tree. You know what I mean? No matter how much silk or whatever the fuck you're wearing is the great antichrist leader. And isn't that the ultimate frustration of those people? You know, like when you look at Trump or when you look at any autocrat or when you look at anybody, they all seem kind of collapsed in because they know the great secret. That's the problem, right? They know the great secret. They know that they are not that great. And that that's the ultimate conspiracy because they have all these fucking people worshiping them. Do you think, you know, like in the core of it, like when, yeah, it doesn't win when they, you know, pull the curtain back on the Wizard of Oz. Is he particularly, does he have a look of kind of sadness like that? Yeah. Yeah. It's like, I mean, Keith, Keith Ranieri, he didn't even, he didn't even plan out like his vices. He didn't even seem like he knew he was like arbitrary. Like, well, this one seems like she'll let me put her in a cage. He didn't even seem like he was actually experiencing that much private secret joy, you know? No, no, he just was kind of like, you know, he just, he reminds me of like a horny, like sort of dude who played it in a, like in who was in band and high school or something and then like made a couple of brilliant starcraft. Yeah. Yeah. Just kind of like, then just somehow got caught in a bizarre updraft and didn't let it stop. See, that's the thing, man. If I'm at somebody's house and they have a leg humping dog, it's already annoying, but I recall a time when I was at someone's house and they let the dog hump their leg. Like they didn't stop it. They let it go on too long and you're like, no, you got it. Like that's, that's bestiality. Like you, the dog humps, you push the dog away. Like, don't know. You don't sit there with your leg outstretched, letting some dog just fuck your leg until it has some like canine orgasm. And that's what these cult leaders are doing ultimate metaphor. Don't let them hump your leg. Like, you know, cause like you're, well, you're not helping yourself. You're going to get dog cum all over your genes and you're sure as fuck not helping the dog who deserves to fuck something more than a leg. You know, I think that's the main thing is like, you should always be pushing people off your great moralist. Don't let them hump your leg. No, I think, you know, usually we get into pretty like emotional and historical stuff, but today I think it's important to, there's like a social service to like just saying like, like some of this, this new independent thinking, this new breed of people who are doing their research and essentially just like affirming their confirmation bias and living off of means. I mean, there's just, we have a responsibility to as now the elder kids or whatever, just to just call out some of the bullshit. So it just seemed like important to do over two hours of just like recontextualizing instead of just people being able to make someone like you into anything they want and give you some allegiance you don't have. I mean, I just think it's really clear that you're really just fighting for love and something very simple, something very positive. Yeah. And I'm, and if anyone listening to this is in the CIA, I'm not opposed to joining. How do you not troll? How do you not troll? I would join the CIA. Fuck it. What's the big deal? I'm 46 man. I'd like to, I want to see the thing. You think they would? Yeah, they would. What's the big benefit of, of inducting you in the CIA? Yeah, I don't think there's any. I think it would be really bad for the CIA. I'm yappy. I can't be able to keep a secret. Like you think I'd be able to not talk about like an alien artifact? Well, the second day you've had too many Apple teenies and you're just giving away everything. Yeah, there's no fucking way that like I could find out about alien artifacts or anything like that of that nature. I guess if it was as far as under the threat of death, I guess if they're like, look, you want to see it? It's an alien casket. We found it in, you know, Arizona 20 years ago. It'll evitates. We can't figure it out. I don't know. If you tell anybody about this, I'm going to kill you and your family. I would not tell. So I guess that you'd have like, you wouldn't get past like the first inhalation of your first joint. You'd be like, dude, craziest thing. You're right. You're right. You know, I would see you and I'd be like, Emil, turn your phone off. I saw a fucking alien artifact and I'm in the CIA and that's the last thing I would say before you just see a red dot on my forehead. Emil, I love you, man. Thanks for doing the show. It's been too long. Yeah, yeah, for sure. We'll do it sooner. Maybe next week. Yeah. Yeah, dude, and I can't wait to see it. You'll be here soon. Yeah. Bye. Love ya. Love ya. That was Emil Amos.

Shake hands, no need to be blue. Welcome to you. Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi. It's me Duncan Trussell, Duncan Trussell. Ngai, welcome to the DTFH. Hi. The DTFH Family Hour. This is the DTFH Family Hour, as they call it. And man, I gotta tell you, you're doing your podcast yesterday was so fun. Oh, thanks. And I just want to pick up exactly where we left off talking about one of my favorite topics, which actually, I don't talk about much on the podcast for some reason. Abundance. You just started talking about it. Can you tell me what is your definition of abundance? Having enough. I mean, that's the thing. There is definitely enough to go around. And one of the challenges I think we have in Americans and in the world really is the greed is the only god that can ever be appeased. And we keep trying to tell people it's not enough. We don't have enough. But we have enough for everybody to eat. We have enough for everybody to have a place to stay. We have enough for all of this stuff to happen. But you have to ask yourself, how much is enough? We're talking about this inflation right now, but it's not inflation. It's greed. These companies are making record profits and still raising their prices. Like 20-something years ago, I read a story about a guy in Japan who made tofu. He made really, really, really, really good tofu. But he figured out that all he needed to do was to sell two, maybe three boxes of his tofu. And then he could be sad. Then he could have his days free. And he could pay his bills. He could chill with his old lady and all that stuff. And everybody's like, but your tofu's so good. You could make more of it. You could do all this. You could do this and that. And he's like, I really only need to sell three boxes and then I'm good. Why would I subject myself to all that stuff? Why would I go after all that when I have everything I need already? Right. And this is the question we have to ask ourselves. How much is enough? Is $1 billion enough for you? Is $2 billion enough for you? Is $3 billion enough for you? This is interesting. So your concept of abundance is more in line with, find a way to be happy with what you have. And you are instantaneously abundant versus the abundance that a lot of people, when people are abundant, they think, like Michael Beckwith from Agape, this idea of the universe is infinite. Energy, infinite. We live in a universe where there is, at least as far as we're concerned, infinite energy right in the sky, enough to keep an entire planet alive here, here. Just a million, and so because there is this reality, whether it cannot be hidden in the sense that you can't hide the fucking sun, you know what I mean? There's no way to hide the sun. The sun fucks up the whole concept that there isn't enough. Yeah. Because the sun's up there just blasting us with energy. So much energy. Giving us enough. But giving us trees, giving us food, giving us life, giving us vitamin D, there is enough. There is more than enough. We just don't allocate it correctly. And we want to make sure that some people don't get it because it makes other people feel powerful. That's right. That's an idea. That's the big conspiracy is there's enough for everybody. But if everybody has everything they need, or more than what they need, if everyone has, like, gets to live the life of a billionaire, then billionaires are no longer special. How many people are going on dates with Jeff Bezos after everyone's a billionaire? You know what I mean? All the billionaires, how many people suddenly they're like, I don't care you're a billionaire. I'm a billionaire. Now what? A billion dollars is not a personality. A billion dollars. I mean, I guess you could cuddle a billion dollars. But I mean, is a billion dollars a good cuddler? Is a billion dollars not a kiss? Is a billion dollars going to billion dollars playing the clitoris? I think, sadly, I mean, I think if you set up the game that we've set up where it's like, you know, we're doing this kind of ridiculous, insane game where some of us have so much and some of us don't have enough. And that's so much thing. It really does. It might not be great to cuddle with the literal stack of dough, though I wouldn't be opposed to trying. It would be cool to know what it feels like. Just throw it on the bed in decent proposal style. Hold it. But what I'm saying is it's like the only reason I think people are driven to achieve that much is the same reason like those sad little birds that build. Have you seen those bird, the bower bird? Have you ever seen these birds? What's the bower bird laying on me? Oh my God, it's so weird. It's this bird that gathers twigs and stones and sticks and builds these like intricate structures in the forest to attract a mate. A female bird flies by, sees a well built, whatever the fuck it is, it's like, oh, yeah, I want you to, I want to lay your egg, man, let's fuck. Women are often impressed that you can do something well. Whatever it is, you could be the regional Kribitz champion. There's going to be somebody who's attracted to that. Yeah, yes. So I'm saying if like everyone had everything they needed, then using abundance is your bower bird style made attracting magnet, it wouldn't work anymore because we all have a billion dollars and now we have to actually deal with our personalities. But is that abundance or is that skill? Right, you have the skill to find the things to build this nice house. Yes, skill. So that's a skill. That's a skill, right? Like a peacock, you have the skill to keep all those pretty ass feathers in one place in the face of all these predators and all these other things. A female peacock is going to find that attractive and be like, well, if this person can keep everything together and still look this pretty in this hard ass world, maybe he knows what he's doing. Yeah, that's a beautiful peacock. But what are your, what's your thinking in regards to like the sort of metaphysical ideas behind abundance? The idea that no, no, it's not just that what you have is enough, it's that you can actually have anything you want. Like there is the potential somehow via meditation, prayer, visualization to manifest. Rob Brezhne, who does the real astrology column, I don't know if it's still in your alt weekly out there, but he also wrote a book called Pro Noia, which is the concept that the universe is conspiring for you. Yeah. The universe is out to help you. And he says, you can have anything you want if you ask for it in the right tone of voice or the right frame of mind. And a lot of these cats, a lot of this manifesting, a lot of these things, this is true. You can't like, I rely on the universe all the time. And, you know, it's been close. It's been close a couple of times. I was like, come on universe, you got to come through for me, dog. You got to come through right now. I need a place to stay. And it generally works out for me. But it's, it can be a challenge. Sometimes I think of it, if it's like playing chess, like you can make moves, but you have to make allowance and adjust for the other person's moves. You can't always just be moving like my plan is this and I'm going to go like this, this and this. And there's some other person or some other force, like, well, no, we're going to counteract this with this and we're going to counteract that with that. And so now where you might have had a good plan, you might have had a good strategy, your tactics have been exposed as to not paying attention to what, what all is happening on the board. Right. You have to keep evolving. It's not just like you can, you have to change and shift. It's not, it's a two-way conversation when it comes to manifestation. It's not just like a- And you know, I mean, it's easy here in America for the most part to be like, yeah, man, it's the line of opportunity you can manifest. You can be, if you just work hard enough, if you just apply yourself, you can have it all. You can get what you want. And sometimes it's true, but it's, it's, I mean, you can get most of what you want. A lot of times it's, it's a tricky thing. But then there's other places and even here in America where you can't, you, maybe you haven't been equipped. Maybe you don't have the tools. Maybe you don't even have access to the tools that would need, that you would need for you to build your bower bird nest to attract a nice mate. Right. Right? Yeah. Right? They've come down all the forest and now there are no twigs and stones. Oh, right. Yeah, right. I mean, yeah, that's, I think that's the, that's where the manifestation stuff kind of slams into like a real wall. Yeah. Because it's like, oh, you know, I don't know. You're, you're setting up an accidentally, and I think it's a beautiful thing as a subjective philosophy that you don't put on other people with your own life. If you, if you want to play around with the concept, it's great. Just stick to yourself though, because if you start universalizing it, then all of a sudden people who aren't doing great, it's like, well, you didn't manifest hard enough. And that becomes, that's one of those things. That's why you have the cancer, because your faith in Jesus was not enough to overcome it. Yeah. Shit happens. Yeah. Yeah. That's such a weird Zen phrase, but it's so true. Shit, happens. Thank you, Shutter, for supporting this episode of the DTFH. When it comes to movies, I like them scary good.

Shutter's streaming library has just about everything from original movies like Superhost, The Boy Behind the Door, and PG Psycho Gorman to the hit series Creepshow, which my friend Rob Schraub has directed, I think at least two awesome episodes of.

And we lived right next to this old musty video store at the best selection of classic, obscure horror movies. That's what Shutter is. It's like that hard-to-find video store where someone who loves horror has curated a beautiful collection of some of the creepiest, goriest, sometimes funniest horror movies out there.

Cute. Cute! Cute! Cute. Cute. Cute. Cute. Cute. Cute. Cute. Yeah. Shit happens. Yeah. That's such a weird Zen phrase but it's so true. It happens. I think that's so important though though I'd subjectively like I do know that stuff works and the earnest home. You get in the science of mind if you've ever gotten into that stuff or the Kabalyan or like any of that stuff. Do you know what I'm talking about? You ever heard of earnest homes? You know, my mom was a little woo woo. She definitely does some, used to do like, you know, the crystals and the readings and the ESPE and all that stuff. And the mind is powerful. Like I visualize having good sets. I visualize buying a car. I visualize making the rent. I visualize all these things, you know? But it doesn't always happen like you want it to happen and you have to be able to handle that and to deal with that, right? Like Octavia Butler says, change is the only constant. And then you have to shape change is what she says in the urgent books. Shape change. Shape change. Right? It took me a year to figure out. I was like, oh yeah, shape change. And I was like, oh yeah, shape change. Shape change, change shape. I love it. That's so smart. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You should read the books. Read Parable of the Sower. I used to carry that book around like it was a fucking Bible tract and it ended out to be. Octavia Butler. Octavia and Butler. Parable of the Sower. Oh my God, hold on, look that up. Well, you know, I think that people forget sometimes that this two-way conversation is happening. And then when they forget that and they don't get the thing they were trying to manifest, then they can get bitter, despondent, angry, cynical. None of this shit works. But if you wait a little bit, then you realize, oh fuck, if I got in that thing. Like my wife and I, when we came up here, we were in full prepper mode from living in LA. We found a place that was like branch, Davidian style, like a compound. Owned by a weapons, like a guy who makes ammo. So it's all set up. Dude, it was like, it literally was set up for the end of the world. And thank God that he knew, like I think this guy just wouldn't sell it to us because he's looking at me and my wife and our California license plates. And his kid gives us a tour of the massive like forest behind the house that's like all uphill. And his kid is like talking to our realtor, being like, there's a lot of good family friendly places out in Hendersonville and just kind of mentioning like, what the fuck are you doing? You don't, you're not gonna chop wood. Come out here with your city ways. You're not gonna hire someone to chop wood for you. It gets cold out here. Yeah, yeah. You're gonna get a sweater, LA boy. That's it, yeah. So we couldn't get that. We didn't get the house. And I was like, what the fuck? And now in retrospect, we're both like, oh my God, thank Christ. They wouldn't sell you that fucking place because we would have been fucked, man. I don't, we wouldn't have been able to sell it. We wouldn't have been able to move back to LA. So you know what I'm talking about, right? Yeah, man, sometimes. You gotta trust. My, one of my biggest gifts and maybe one of my biggest curses is that I am an incredibly patient person. Sometimes you just have to wait, right? That's why a lot of times I identify with Aaron Burr as presented in the musical Hamilton where he says, I'm not falling behind. I'm lying in wait, right? You have to wait for the opportunity sometimes. You have to pick your spot. At least for me, for other people is different. Some people can kind of impose their will on a game, right? But when I'm playing my best, I'm in like flow state, right? Like Bryson DeChambeau, the golfer, talks about a sympathetic state. Like I'm just in a vibe and that's when the game comes to me and that's when I have a better game is when I'm just in the moment and play and not trying to force anything but just trying to step up and be my best. Sympathetic state, can you go into more detail? What does that mean? Sympathetic state. It's just his fancy way of saying he catches the zone and gets in the flow state. His mindset is right. You know what I mean? He's paying attention to the, he's not overthinking anything. He's just paying attention and playing golf. And that guy's a crusher. Are you a golfer? Yes. I'm not very good at it, but I do really enjoy it. You think as long as I played golf, I'd be better at it, but no. Yeah, well, I think I had a manic episode and bought a bunch of golf clubs and never played. Let's go, let's go, man. Maybe we can play once I get on the right. The biggest thing golf has taught me is the follow through is just as important. Oh, right. Even though like post-hitting the ball. You still have to follow through. Okay, okay. Go into detail about that for me because friends, this obviously isn't just about golf, but go into details about that, okay? Because like, I'm dumb in a lot of ways, but when I was like taking some golf lessons, I was like, oh yeah, this is a metaphor. Like the whole damn game is some kind of like philosophical. Spiritual, weird initiation that I don't really understand, but I was smart enough to be like, okay, there's way more here than what I thought when I was watching my dad's boring-ass golf game he put on the TV. But go into detail about that follow through, please. Okay, so golf instructors will teach you when you're swinging the golf club. So when you think about baseball, you're just thinking about hitting the ball, right? Yeah. Right, you wanna hit the ball. You're aiming right at the ball, you hit the ball. And they tell you in golf, you wanna swing the club and the ball just gets in the way. Right, so you just wanna make a good full swing, right? The ball is almost inconsequential. I mean, it's what you're trying to do, but really a good full swing, flush, follow through, making almost a perfect circle if you're thinking Zen style. And that's what will give you the good contact and give you a good golf hit. Wow. And if you just think about hitting the ball, it's not necessarily the best way to do it. Okay, now from that, extrapolate how you apply that idea to other aspects of your life. It's one of those things, like if you have ideas, but you don't act on those ideas, or you don't do anything to get that idea to happen, if you don't follow through on your idea, on your full swing, then it's not, you're not gonna get the result, always the result that you're looking for, or the result that you'd like to find. And the thing about golf is so frustrating because unlike a lot of other sports, there's nobody playing defense. No one's throwing a curve ball at you. No one's trying to lock you down in a box in one. The ball is just sitting there. You have hit that ball in a straight line, 175 yards. Yeah. More times in UK count. And yet for some reason today, it's not working. Okay, what are you looking at now? That is something I'm, that's what I love about games like golf, bowling, archery, darts, archery. That's what I love about it, is that it, over time, if you keep playing those games, you get a sense of like, maybe there really is a multiverse. Like right now I'm in a parallel timeline than the one I was in, even with comedy actually, but right now I'm in a parallel timeline where the identical things that were working in the, just the other time I was playing are all not working now. The wind seemingly the same, that the air feels the same, and yet something's different now. What do you, what do your theories on that? It's just something like neurological, like shit is on. That's the whole you can't throw a rock in the same river twice. Yeah. Right? It's always different. Even if it seems the same, it is always different. Right. Right. You know, you've eaten this thing a million times. You've made this sauce a million times. It's still gonna be a little different. Everything, whatever. The humidity, the weather, the air. It doesn't even matter. One tiny little ass blade of grass could be the difference between shaking the ball to the rider, hitting a bullet right down the fairway where you wanted to go. Yeah, man. Clean your golf course. Dude, there's a lot of things. You know, and I try not to overthink, that is my biggest problem with golf course because I come from like fast-paced sports. I like basketball. I like soccer where your flow state is easy to get into because you just run and you fucking concentrate and then you're in the zone. Golf, you kind of stand around a lot. You have a chance to stand there and get in your own mind. Like, I'm not opening my hips enough. I'm not opening my hips too much. Keep your arms straight. Keep your elbow in, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Just fucking hit the ball. That's the easiest way. Make a good swing. Swing through. Follow through. You're all into yourself. But with golf, it's also the inaccessibility of the golf course. You know what I mean? That's like, with piano or like muscle memory style things, you can really, you have all the time in the world if you have a piano to get your hands to start remembering like patterns and riffs and stuff. But with golf, you could go in your backyard, I guess. I'm like practicing here. Go in your backyard. I got a driving range three miles from me. It costs six bucks for a small bucket. And you just go out there and you hit it. They also have a little practice area. I mean, it's like everything. It's like taking your basketball by yourself to the court and just working on your jumper or working on your free throw or running layup drills. I mean, you still need muscle memory. You still have to drill it. You still have to have some fundamentals of it. And I'm fortunate, I'm not a fancy country club golfer. I'm not trying to pay $200 to fucking walk around for four hours. I go to the $15 course. I paid $12 yesterday to play nine holes by my house. Right? I'm not, I bought all my clubs at the thrift store. Okay. Right? It's not, I'm not trying to make the tour. I'm just trying to focus my mind and get my steps. I should let you borrow mine until we start. I'm not going to talk about it on you. It's embarrassing. I should just send you mine. Listen, when you get to LA, we'll come out. We'll go out to the little, I always, it's not at water. It's not Silver Lake. The little one where they shot Swinger. This is a little part three. It's harder than it looks, but it's a fun little course. And we can go to the golf. I know exactly what you're talking about. That would be fun. I mean, the, you know, the flow state, it's like, it's something that I'm really interested in. I think anybody who's a performer, anyone should be interested in it because it is the, you know, once you find yourself in it. And, oh my God, oh, the best, the best. But when you're not in it, you know, actually I heard that song Cecilia by Simon and Garfunkel. You know that song? You're breaking my heart. You're shaking my confidence. Take it, go on. Yeah. That's about inspiration. That's about flow state. That that's the, they were, the song, the, that, that the moment where like, cause for me, like sometimes I will start working on a song or start writing. And it's like, why did I ever think this was hard? This is as easy as anything ever. And then the next day it's like, ah, I'm a fraud. I can't make anything. Why am I doing this to myself? I gave up. So what, what do you do to get into a flow state? Do you have any rituals, any sacraments, any psychedelics you take? What's your process? Yeah. You know, weed and basketball have always gone hand in hand since the seventies, but for some strange reason, I cannot find the right weed strain to improve my golf game. Golf for me is better sober. Basketball for me is better, just a little stoned or even a lot stoned. It's the weirdest thing. How often are you stoned? Not as often as I used to be. And I don't know if that's good or bad, but the minute I turned 50, I kind of became a lightweight. Interesting. And so now it doesn't take me as much to get high. I just did a, I was at the Transblade Challenge event in San Francisco last week. It was like a weed competition, 10 to 12 different strains, a bunch of different growers, a bunch of different things. And I was there for maybe four hours and I was higher than I'd been in a long time. I mean, it was great. It was glorious. I was not out of control. I can handle my weed. Well, I suppose weed was the best, but I was definitely higher than I'd been because I don't really, I don't really like smoke like that anymore.

I don't really like smoke like that anymore, I mean, I still have degrees on occasion. Yeah, that's cool. I mean, that's interesting. Don't you think people have an impression of you as being someone who's stoned all the time? Well, sure. And that's kind of the impression that I give out, definitely on the social media. And that, you know, early in my comedy career, I fought against that potlabel comic, because it was gatekeeping. People were keeping me from gigs. It was like, all you do is talk about weed, which is not true. I talk about weed a lot. But it's not my whole thing. I got jokes about sex and quantum physics and raising kids and being in Montana and all this other shit. But all they would hear was a weed joke. This is back when weed was especially illegal. And so that's all they would hear. And they didn't, you know, it was, I didn't get in the Montreal because of that. I didn't get into a lot of things. They almost canceled my Make Me Laugh episode, because I did like six weed jokes on three of us. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, but then I just started leaning into it. I was like, fuck it, weed has been with me longer than any of you fuckheads have. And when I got divorced, me and weed came to an understanding like, I will go hard for you and you will make sure that I have a gig and have some money and can get a place to eat and, you know, get a place to live and some food to eat. I'm going to dedicate, I'm going to dedicate years to helping you out. And we've gotten along really, really well since then. And right as soon as that happened, like my boy was like, I'm moving to L.A. to open a club. I need your help. I was like, boom, here we go. And we started to activism. I leaned into the festivals. I leaned into being a weed comic. And it kind of worked out. And now weed's legal. And everybody wants to be the weed comic now. Which is a whole different thing. Like, we need a young ungyo bilam. That's the old show title. The old show business gig goes, right? We need an ungyo bilam. We need an ungyo bilam type. We need a young ungyo bilam. Hey, no, we don't. We don't need you. We don't need any replacement ungyos. Oh man, I'll always be me. But you're, I want to talk. See, this is, to me, I think something that is really curious about cannabis is that it has some kind of, it has, it's not like you're versus some other drugs. It's like you're just eating them or something, you know? But with weed, there's like a spirit. There's a mysticism to it. Right. Yeah, it's a sacred plan. Yes. Yeah. And so if you had to describe that personality, that spirit, how would you describe it? What is the personality of weed? Do you assign a gender to it? What are your, what are your thinking? What's your thinking in that regard? A lot of people tell you that the cannabis is big on female energy, right? Because you smoke the female plant, right? Cannabis is sex. There's a male cannabis plant. There's a female cannabis plant. You don't really use the male for much except for maybe propagation because it doesn't really produce the THC. It gives you some terpenes and some things, but really you just kind of, if you're a breeder, you'll use it for the pollen. But really you're using, you're interested in cultivating the female, making sure the female gets everything it needs. And then it's going to give you what it has, you know? That sounds so weird to say it like that. But there's a lot of that. Now my ex-wife would say to cannabis, weed just gives you what you need, right? So when people say to me, I don't really smoke weed because it makes me sleepy. And I'm always like, you probably need more sleep. Right. Right. You should think about that. Because sometimes I'll smoke a joint. Like I'm just going to say to relax. And I smoke a joint and then all of a sudden I'm like, you know what? There's a lot of shit I need to do. I'm going to straighten up the kitchen. I'm going to fire off these females right quick. I'm going to do all this little things. I need this energy to get up here and take care of my business and focus and get over my ADHD right quick. All this shit and hand all these things I need to do. Right. Yeah. But that's one of the challenges for it too though. Because people, one of the challenges they're having with the Germany medical cannabis industry is that of course the Germans want to be like, if you have A, then you do B. If you have this sort of problem, then you need to smoke this sort of weed. But weed doesn't always work like that. For some people, a cush will make them sleepy. For some people, a cush will give them energy. For some people, trainwreck is this. But for another person, trainwreck is that. It's not, everything is not the same thing for everyone. You have to find what works for you. And fortunately for weed, there's thousands of different strains so you could find one. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Yeah. That's, that is, you know, that's one of the wonderful things about getting legal is people like how precise it's getting like, you know, how like people are learning like that you could almost dial in states of consciousness according to the plant. Now, I don't know how much of that is placebo effect or how much of that is real. But in my encounters with marijuana, it's versus other psychedelics. It has a, it has a kind of stern quality to it. You know, like it's like, if you want, if you have been fucking off, if you haven't been taking care of yourself, if you haven't been exercising, or if you've been an asshole, it reminds you of that in a, in a, in a, in a pretty ferocious way. Sometimes, yeah. Which makes it kind of like a good friend. You want friends like that in your life. Right. It's not blowing. It's, it doesn't, it sounds cheesy. It doesn't blow smoke. It's like, well, I, it will identify exactly where you're fucking up. And, and, but also, I think it also will like, I don't think it likes to be abused if that makes sense. You know what I mean? Like it, it won't let you, I've noticed that if I go into like fade weed phases, like getting stoned for like a year straight or something, somewhere in there, I'll start getting signals from it. Like you need to take a break for a little bit. We love a tolerance break. People love a tolerance break. We talk about that all the time in the cannabis industry. Hey, sometimes you got to take a couple of days or a week or even a month off of smoking weed. Just let your bodies, natural chemicals get back to their little homeostasis or whatever the people call it and see how you do for a while. Right. Um, that used to happen to me when I would judge the Emerald Cup because you judge Emerald Cup and you smoke weed for four weeks, like every day, 400. You got to smoke 400 different strains in a month. So you just sun up to sundown. You just smoke all kind of different kinds of weed. And then you do the festival and you smoke weed all through the festival. And then the day after the festival, you get up. You're like, I'm going to smoke a joint and you roll a joint. And then you're like, you know what? I'm good. I'm good for a minute. Yeah, you judge the Emerald Cup, dude. That's crazy, man. I've seen that. I look at that and I shudder. I would be in the fetal position, two strains in. I would be gone. I would gone like the wind. I would be out. I would be on a rickshaw, whatever the fuck. Yeah, man. I don't know where you did. Gone. I would do that to my friends because my friends, you know, we tell people, yeah, I'm judging flowers for the Emerald Cup and everybody's like, man, I wish I could have your job. I wish I could just smoke weed all day. I'm like, all right, come over and help, right? Bring some snacks. And then they come over and we start smoking weed and four strains in. They're like, oh, man, I'm good. I got to go home. I'm faded. Blah, blah, blah, blah. I'm like, man, we got to smoke at least 10 more today just to keep up with the quota. And we have a list. We got to get through all of these today. Today. Yeah, no way. No thanks. Maybe you could help me understand this because it seems to me like at the Emerald Cup, the fifth strain that people are checking out, it seems like the first few strains have an advantage over the later strains because the judges are getting increasingly high. You know what I'm saying? Like, how do they, do they acknowledge that? For me, I don't, you don't have to smoke a giant joint of every, of everything, right? You don't have to smoke a whole. For me, I take a couple hits. If it's super tasty, I'll take a third hit. And I sit around for 15, 20 minutes and see how I feel, right? So, you know, in the next 15 minutes, if all of a sudden I feel like I should get up and do my taxes or clean out my living room or if I'm just sitting there kind of maybe in a nap or feel like I want to, you know, food around a little bit or whatever, then you get a feel for the effects. You don't, you don't have to smoke the whole joint. And then, you know, half hour later, it's like, man, that one's probably worn off, only took a couple hits. I got good tolerance. Then you smoke another one and see how it feels. And if you, if I find myself being crazy high, like I smoke some weed, you know, like the 15th strain of the day and I don't really, like I get the flavor and everything, but I'm not really feeling different effects. I'm like, well, we'll come back to that one tomorrow morning. Fresh. Let's see how it goes. Right. So you find the ones you like and then you go back and you smoke those all again and see what's going on. When, when, when people come to visit the judging, like the judges would all meet up once or twice a week and people will come to visit and they're like, which one should I try? And Swamy would always be like, find the one that doesn't have much left in it because that's the one that everybody's smoking. Right. That's so cool. Look for the emptiest jar. That's the one that people like. How, how much is winning the Emerald Cup affect growers lives? Like is it, what is that going to do to a strain? It's, it can, it can do a lot to a strain. My homie, first of all, I make friends. Like if I smoke some weed and the weed's not labeled, we don't, they don't, everything's just got a number. So I smoked this one weed one time and it was the weed I thought should one, should have won and it came in third place and I almost got into a fight about it, but whatever. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Dude, it gets heated. We have some arguments. Who are you arguing with? Like a fight, fight? Like you almost got into a fight, fight. It wasn't quite physical, but words were exchanged. Fuck. Dude. No kidding with some other beat. I was passionate about it and should have won the fucking cup. And let me say it too, the Emerald Cup, from all the cups that I've judged, the Emerald Cup is the most fair and the most really everybody has a chance and all the judges really know their shit. You know, so there's no, there's no shenanigans. Sometimes you do a cup, you're like, I feel like the sponsors are kind of pushing us toward one way or the Emerald Cup. Wide open and the best lead generally wins. But it's also, you know, you can't, it's so close. It's so subjective. But anyway, the point is he came, that weed came in third place and I, they told me who it was from. Finally, they're like, oh, it's third place was a purple candy cane from Green Shock Farms. I ran over to that dude and I was like, Bruh, I love your weed. We have to be friends. Here's my phone number. What's your phone number? I want to come visit the farm. Tell me how you do it. I'm like, we're homies now. Cool, that's so cool. That's a good weed. It's, correct me if I'm wrong here, but isn't it really fucking hard to grow weed like that? The idea we all had as kids, you could just take a seed and put it in a pot and grow like good weed. That's not true. I grow halfway decent weed using the benevolent neglect system. I just throw some shit in the backyard. Although I just got a new grow cabinet. I don't know if you can see it over here. Your camera turned off because of the internet. I want to see it. When your camera turns back on, I'll let you know. The way Riverside works is when the internet, whatever the fuck happens, when the speed fluctuates, the camera disables. But I do want to see that. So wait, what was it you said, benevolent? Benevolent neglect is how I raise my garden. Okay, right? I just kind of, you know, like I throw some cuts out there, some seeds out there, and I try to keep it watered and I do my best to keep the bugs off of it. And that's fucking it. Right? And I got my homies, like my hardcore weed growing homies will come over and be like, oh, you need to top it. Oh, you need to do this. You need to add mulch. I'm like, dude, it's fucking weed. I'm just trying to, I'm not trying to sell it. I'm just trying to have extra weed during the holidays. Right? But if you want to grow- Oh, that's so cool. Good championship weed. And yeah, you know, you got to top it. You got to make sure this is that and that is this. And I love talking to growers about that. And I love listening to growers talk because those guys, it's like watching quantum physicists discuss shit. They did the whole thing. I'm using a Bacillus Thuringus on this one and I brought in a thing. It likes a this and a that and a blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. It's great. It's great stuff. It's wild. Yeah. It's wild, man. There is a real difference between weed farmers and like other farmers. You know, they have a, they have a very fascinating alchemical quality to them that's and also again, like I can't just, like I love marijuana. So I can't distinguish how much of the, what I think about it is my own romanticism attached to it and how much of it is real. But anytime I'm around the plant itself, I feel like it's got a kind of awareness to it that I don't notice in other plants. You know what I mean? Like when, when you're, when you're around like a monkey or a dolphin and you're like, Oh shit, this is not like being around a chicken. This thing is like watching me. It's judging me a little bit. You know what I mean? I don't think weed judges you. But like you said, weed is a good friend. We will definitely sometimes tell you when you're fucking up or help you decide on your next steps. No, weed to me is always going, Hi, hi, hi, hello, hi. Whenever I'm around it, that's just since I'm getting, it's very welcoming and it's like, wow, hi. It's a very sweet energy, a very beautiful energy. That's one of the things I like about weed. Like we talk about that. Like the weed circle, right? You stand in a circle, like the round table. Everyone is a peer. No one is, is, there's no hierarchy when you're smoking the weed. You're standing around in a circle evenly. Like everyone is together. Like even people who don't smoke weed, I like, I like people, people who don't smoke weed, but will still stand in the circle. Those are some of my favorite people, right? They just stand there and they like, they take the joint. They don't hit it. They just pass it to the next person because they're sharing in the fellowship and the energy and the ritual of the cannabis circle, which is a great thing. Do you think Tolkien, do you have you read Lord of the Rings? No, but I am familiar with it, but it's kind of a nerd badge of honor that I have yet to read Lord of the Rings. You know, I had chances and then now I'm like, I'm just going to be contrarian about it. I'm not going to fucking do it. Well, I'm jealous. It's the, it's the kind of thing where you wish you could wipe your brain just so you could read it again, especially stoned. Tell you what, once you read Parable of the Sower, I will read Lord of the Rings. You got to. Well, anyway, I just, I sometimes there's like, there's Tolkien had such a clear affinity for like smoking with a pipe and like that, just what you're talking about. Like that appears over and over again. And now I've always wondered like, man, is it just tobacco he smoked her? Whoa, cool. Get off the black hole. Look at that. That's a ha, that's cool. It's the ceremonial. Welcome to the inner sanctum, sir. What are your, I want to know your thoughts on, just because, and I'm sorry, if we don't have to talk about weed, I'm sorry, if when you go on podcast, people just want to talk about weed. Right, it's one of those things. Eskimos talk about snow. Okay, cool. Great. Because I have questions, man. What are your thoughts on Delta 8? I haven't really tried it. It's one of those things, to me, it strikes me as one of those things. You know how like, you're hip to maps, the multi, what is it? The multi-disciplinary association for psychedelics. Those guys are, you know, when some MDA, MDMA came out, right? And then all of a sudden it's illegal. Well, we just changed a couple of chemicals in here. So it's technically not illegal, but it gives you all the same effects. And that's pretty much what Delta 8 does. People who do it, so it's maybe a little stronger than regular THC. I don't know. I just, I live in California. I travel around and everybody knows me. So I just smoke weed weed. I don't have to worry about a loophole. Man, I got it. That's like both my wife and I, when like we're in a place where it isn't legal, and you'll see like they're selling Delta 8, and it just makes you sad. Because you're like, I want to, in California, you just, you know what I mean? It's like, I'm happy people have access to something like that here. But, you know, there's something so like truly depressing about being in a place where weed is illegal. I always feel weird about buying hemp at a gas station. Same. We're spoiled. Once you've been in LA, you're so spoiled. Oh, God. So spoiled. You're so spoiled. Because you just, yeah. But, okay. So another weed question for you. Okay. Do you study or have you paid any attention to the world religions that have marijuana as a sacrament? Sure, sure. Those cats in India who do it, the Rastafarians, love a little weed as a sacrament. For me, weed is definitely, I mean, I'm not super mystical or woo-woo, but for me, almost any drug has to be taken with intention. Right. You can't just be mindlessly doing shit. Right. So sometimes my intention is to get stoned. But sometimes I'm going to smoke the sativa and really mop and vacuum and get into the flow state of mopping the floor. Right. But do you have, aside from the intention, do you have any kind of mystical, like, do you pray or do you have any sort of, do you find yourself connecting to any of these philosophies and weed? On, probably on a superficial level, like I'm, I don't really try to get too deep into any one religion because I'm a joiner and I have to be careful what I join. Right. I, I'll get into shit. And so I'm very careful about what I really get into. Oh, I see. You're afraid like it'll, an undertow will pull you out or something. I'll be super rostered, dude. You know what I mean? We come to a reason I and I, but I have to be careful. I have to be careful about that sort of thing. That's why I never became a Marine. So, yeah. You're right. I know what you mean. But, but it is, it is my school. It's a heightened state. It's an elevated, it changes your, your brain chemistry. So it's a different, like I had a friend who did acid so much, Joel Barfield, may he rest in peace. He was like a brother to me. We were very, very close. But he did acid a lot to the point where he could induce a psychedelic state just by force of mind, just by reminding his body of what it was like to be stoned or to be high on, to be tripping. And he would, he could just get into it. Thank you butcher box for supporting the DTFH butcher box. It's a subscription service that takes the guesswork out of finding high quality meat.

In shamanism, this idea comes up, which is like the shaman really doesn't even need the substance anymore. There's a direct access to that place. Yeah, which I agree with. It's just interesting. That's so fascinating that the reason you don't delve deeper into it is a sense of being consumed by it. I've never heard anything that I really liked. Man, when I was in college, we went to India and I smoked weed in a Shiva temple on the banks of the Ganges River. And with these Shyvites singing these kirtans that when you're stone, I mean, talk about that circle. When you're doing this thing that's like, God knows how old it is. God knows how old whatever this ritual is. God only knows. We will never know. You're reaching back and you're reaching forward. Yeah, yeah, that's right. Yeah, that's right. It's something so special and something so powerful. But yeah, I just remember that never really engaged in an actual ritual involving marijuana and then experiencing that resonance. It's kind of like the way you feel when you take MDMA. Are you saying, well, no, no, wait a minute. Now, because you're a deadhead and I would say that smoking weed and going to a dead show is also a sort of ritual. Sure. Oh, yes. Yes, I don't mean to. Yes, absolutely. And thank you for pointing that. I don't mean to hierarchize like just because it's like a thousand year old ritual that the Shyvites are doing somehow that makes it, you know, more advanced or some shit than a more like than what we have in the West, which is the that thing that you're talking about. It's just it's just interesting to see the way it shows up. I think sometimes we don't we don't recognize the rituals that we perform out here in the West. We don't we don't make for small magics. We don't realize a thing. There was a thing on Twitter today where a dude had ordered Chipotle, but he had forgot to change the address from what he was in a completely different spot. He ordered Chipotle delivery and the Chipotle driver brought it to his house and he's like, hey, man, I'm not even there. So you can just have that Chipotle to yourself. Go take lunch or whatever. And the driver wrote him back and was like, hey, you know what, man? I got to thank you because the place I delivered to is right next to the graveyard where my brother is buried. And so I'm going to sit in there and have lunch next to my brother and talk to my brother. So really, I really appreciate you. And that's such a small magic. It's such a weird coincidence. And yet it was perfect for both people. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Right. Yeah. Right. Right. That, that's the real religion, that thing you're talking about there. That's the real thing. All the other religion is just like trying to catch up with that thing and you can never catch up with it. Yeah. I'm a great believer in small magics. Small magic. Yeah. Me, yeah, me too. I mean, and I always, it's one of the easiest things to forget about for some reason, at least for me, I forget because it's so subtle. And the more you want, by the way, I've noticed maybe you could fill me in on how this works for you, but the more I want small magic to show up around me, it seems like the less it happens, like the more I'm just in the moment, the more it just naturally appears. That's that whole let the game come to you vibe again and paying attention and being, being in your, in your walking Zen or in your natural mindfulness flow of state where you're not. Yeah. Well, they say about archery, like you have to want to hit the target, but you can't try too hard to hit the target and you kind of have to not be super attached to the results. Yeah. It's like, quarterbacks, football quarterbacks to tell you, make good, make good decisions. Live with the results. That's cool. Bhagavad Gita, you have a right to your action. You do not have a right to the fruits of your action. So forget about whatever comes from the stuff you're doing. Just be in the action itself. Rituals, man. I got to read you this. You made me think of this. Okay. Did you hear this shit about the Catholic priest who said the wrong word? The wrong word, the wrong, wrong word. I got it. Can I just, can I just read it to you? Just so people. Have you heard of it? You heard it. Yeah. No, I'm hip to it. Okay, go. Okay, cool. Speaking of just crazy rituals. Okay, a Catholic priest in Phoenix has resigned from his position after a church investigation found he had been incorrectly performing baptism over his 20 year career. As he poured the holy water during the baptisms he performed, the Reverend Andres Orongo would say, we baptize you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. The Father Orongo misstated one word, we baptize, should have been I baptize. And getting that word wrong nullified all of the rituals he performed using that language. If you were baptized using the wrong words, that means your baptism is invalid and you are not baptized. Olmsted wrote in a message to parishioners, you will need to be baptized. Can you, like, what are your thoughts on that, man? Here's my argument. This is what I would say to him. I would say that his baptism is stronger because he's invoking the entire community and not just the one person, right? Yeah. We, we as a community, we as a church, we as an establishment, we as a vibration baptize you in the name of this all powerful magic here, right? Not just I. It doesn't just come from one person. God doesn't just come from one person. God comes. God is the force, right? Yes. It's in every tree. It's in the fucking doorway. It's in your Mardi Gras beads. So when we baptize you, we're coming together as a group. And I would, I would say, give me, if I was trying to be baptized, it'd be like, give me the community mojo. Don't just give me the mojo from the one priest. I don't know that dude. He might like kids in a weird way. Give me the whole thing so everybody can get in on it. That would be, that would be my argument. And also, I think God understands that people are not infallible. That's the whole point of being a human. Well, right. But if you're, this is to me, what's fascinating about Catholicism in particular, as opposed to other forms of Christianity, is that it has this technical aspect to it that if you are a full on, if that's fully what you are, if, if I'm pretty sure that if you die and you're not baptized, I think you like go to like limbo or something. You go to limbo. Wait, that, and that this means that if any of these people whose baptisms have been annulled or whatever have died. Listen, it'll be a party because it'll all be there. And they'll be like, Father Arganza? Hell yeah, what's up, man? I got baptized by Father Arganza too. What are we going to do? Let's play bingo. No, it's going to be a, you're going to show, you're like, you've been a, you've given money to the church. You've done charity work. You got fucking baptized. You show up to heaven and they're like, bad news. You're fucked. No, you're going to limbo out of a technicality. Like that's what I'm saying. It's like, to me, trying to- That's only if you think God is a petty regional manager. They do. I mean, that's what I'm saying, man. Like if, if they, if you're saying you're a ritual, that's what they, that's exactly their version of, of like the divine force, the thing that created tigers, jellyfish, the thing that created fireflies is like, yeah, but you got to say, I, in that ritual, or I'm putting you in close towels, I can get you without putting you there. I mean, it's true. Words have power, right? There's that cartoon where the, it's the, it's the, thanks to a typographical error, John received power and riches beyond his wildest imagining in exchange for selling the devil his soup. That's cool. Yeah. Fucking technical error. That'd be awesome. So, I mean- I mean, listen, you can't, I don't get hung up on that. Like the thing for me to, even when talking to people and, and, and, and things like this is I don't always try to listen to the exact words. I want to listen to the vibe to what you're, what you're trying to say, what you're meaning when you say that, you know what I mean? Because not everybody is super gifted with words. Not everybody can always express themselves like that, or, or they're trying to, to, I don't know. I try to listen to the whole thing, to the whole, the whole story, and not just the words that are being said. That's very compassionate. It's, it's cause you can really- They all think I'm tough. No, that's so compassionate. It's not true. I've been talking about the joy since 1986. Yeah. What's your favorite strain of marijuana right now? Whatever I'm smoking at the moment. Lately- Come on, tell us something. What do you got? Lately, I've been enjoying the pigeon-pop pie that I got at the Translate Challenge. If we're talking like, I'm, I'm, I'm big on, you know, I'm one of those guys like, oh, this is 17 year old Scotch imported from the hinter lens, right? Yes. So I'm definitely one of those like, oh, this is a Mendocino indoor. This is a, it's like wine for me or Scotch or some shit. So I do like the fancier exotic ones. But if we're talking like readily available strains that are, that are kind of universal. Yeah. Blue Dream gets a bad rap because it is everywhere, but a well-grown Blue Dream, a well-made Blue Dream. You understand why it's so popular because you smoke that shit and you're like, man, this shit is, is really just got a nice hybrid feel. It's got a great feel for, it's great for movies because you're relaxed, but you're not too stoned to somewhere you can't follow along. You can get up and make sense. Yeah. Yeah. I love Blue Dream. Oh God, I can't wait to get back to you. Blue Dream is great. What? Pre-98 Bubba Cush, you can find one of those cuts. Those are also very nice and sure, diesel. I love a good diesel. And I like a gelato every once in a while. Cookies, but I do like ruts because it reminds me of that old school skunk. They call it ruts, but really they should just call it skunk. That shit smells like a skunk shit in your bag. Man, I got, when I was up in San Francisco a long time ago after a shop, these growers gave me a giant butt of skunk weed. It was so strong. I took it back to the hotel room. I had to fucking pay the cleaning fee because I didn't smoke in the room. I've argued that cleaning fleet. I've argued with them. Right? What time did I say they tried to charge me the cleaning fee? I was like, I didn't smoke in the room. You have pictures of me standing outside, not smoking in the room. They're like, well, we have stems and things in the garbage can. I was like, yeah, because I rolled a joint, but I smoked it outside on the little patio. Right? And I was like, okay, we'll remove the fee. And then he goes, there must have been some good shit because it was stinky. I was like, hell yeah, it was good shit. I'll smoke bad weed. We met. They wouldn't remove the fee for me. I got on the phone with like the executive manager of the hotel and he goes, listen, whether you smoked weed in there or not, the room cannot be, we can't give it to a guest because it smells like weed. You can't open a window or use some air freshener. What do we do when someone takes a giant massive shit? This stuff was radioactive, man. I've never encountered anything like it. Like it just, just its fumes, whatever it was putting out, soaked into the walls. And forgive me if the folks who gave this to me are listening because I don't mean this is, I didn't get, I couldn't even get that high from it. It just was incredibly pungent. Yeah, maybe it was because I was annoyed having to pay the room fee or something. And I was just like, yeah, no, I had some weed like that one time. My homie in Portland knew a guy, he's retired now, but he used to harvest on the solstice in the equinox. And we used to call it Portland magic harvest. And that shit was the stinkiest weed. Like I would drive it down from Portland in two Tupperwares and a plastic bag in a box in the trunk. And my whole car would smell like weed. Like I was standing across the gym one time with a small bag of it in my hoodie. And one of my homies was like, I can smell you across the gym. Like I made friends because the neighbor next door at the apartment smelled us smoking. And he had to come and knock on the door and be like, what is that shit? Like what's going on, dog? We got to be homies right now. That shit was so good. I wish, I man, I wish I had some weed again. I missed that weed. We've lost so many strains. I've become like those heirloom guys. Oh, wait. I never even thought of that. Like there's strains that just are gone now. When was the last time you saw a chocolate tie? When was the last time you saw a Panamanian red? When was the last time you saw some straight up Oaxacan? There's no more Panama red? I haven't seen a Panama red in a million fucking years. Probably since the 80s. People are bringing it back. Acapulco gold is kind of making it come back, which is great because that's a nice weed. But I mean, there used to be a weed called Champagne, which was hella popular. I haven't seen that weed in forever. What happened to Odyssey? There's so many, you know, it's just one of those things, man. It's like the Cavendish banana. It starts to take over shit. And with this legalization, growers and these companies and consortiums, they're trying to make all their money back right away. So they want big yielders that ripen fast, right? Everything's got to be ready in eight weeks, nine weeks. There's no 12 weeks sativas. 14 week plants. Some plants take 14 to 16 weeks to come into full ripeness. They don't have time for that shit. You got to have turnover. You got to move it around. So we're seeing this vast commercialization and we're starting to lose some of these more, you know, maybe they don't yield as much. Maybe they take longer to grow, but they fucking taste delicious and they have great effects. And it's worth the patience and it's worth having that. And it's worth holding on to that. So I definitely got a bunch of heirloom seeds. And that's one of the reasons I got this grow cap. You do? And so I can do some stuff and hold on to some of these older things. We respect the ancestors. That's so sweet, man, that you're doing that. Like we need a vault. We need, like, not just the arctic seed vault. They're starting that. They're starting a weed genetics vault and like a seed vault like that for that, for sure, for sure, because it's important. That's important. Can you talk a little bit about the- You ever read The Botany of Desire? Start to interrupt. No, I've heard of this book. No, I haven't. Yeah, check it out. Let me write that down. I'll send you a text. Now, you know, okay, the, okay, the, so just because we're talking about, like, you're telling me all the kinds of interesting nuances in the, like, weed industry that I just wasn't aware of. But it, let's talk a little bit about, I think, some of the most unacknowledged people in the supply chain of marijuana. Okay. That I love and I don't think they get enough credit, the trimmers. I was just going to say the trimmers. The trimmers, it's like, the trimmers, no one, like, you know, everyone's celebrating the growers, but the tr- these people, it's a hard job. It's a hard job and it doesn't pay what it used to. That's what I heard. Yeah. I heard that the industry is shifting away from the trimmers and that they're kind of just getting thrown to the wayside now because of, like, some kind of, like, a new way of do, of trimming weed or something. There's a bunch of differences. There's machines that do it. They don't do it as efficiently, but they do it faster and they don't, you know, you don't have to pay a machine $200 an ounce or $150 an ounce to trim weed. No, is it $200 an ounce? No, $200 a pound. Sorry, I take it back. So it was $200. We used to get $200 a pound to trim weed and you could trim maybe two pounds in a 12-hour day if you went hard. But you would also come home with a repetitive stress injury, but you could go hard. Right. You could go hard at it. And also with the advent of all these concentrates and all these dabs and all these extracts and things, sometimes some companies just buy the whole plant. Like, we'll buy that whole tree off of you and you don't have to trim it at all because we're just going to take it. We're going to freeze it, mash it up, we're going to extract all the shit from it. So we don't really need to trim it. We want all the leaf. We want all that stuff. But yeah, they're trying to pay trimmers like $20 an hour. Like, it's a regular job and in some ways it is, I guess. Because it's legal. Because it's legal. The reason trimmers will get paid so much. What? Trimmers need a union. We need a trimmers union. Oh, I thought you said there are. Well, yeah. The reason for that amount that you're getting paid is because you're up in some underground farm somewhere. It's true. You know where I've heard a lot of some like it can either be like some kind of like marijuana utopia or things could get weird out there. You know, like hippies with guns is always a weird combination. Yeah, right. Yeah, they got to defend themselves up there, man, because they're competitive and like it's not the it's not always some agrarian paradise. I mean, it is, but you can't go to the cops, right? One of the gifts in the curses of this new cannabis legalization, one of the cool things is it is definitely less. I mean, there was never really a lot of violence because it's weed. But also you can't just go see a guy. Like if a dude owes you money, like some dude didn't pay you the money on the weed, you could just show up and be like, hey, bro, you need you got to give me the money. You got to give me something. Right. Do something. And now you got to send a letter. Right to your lawyer or the court. I was going to cost you more money just to go see this dude about the money. Wow, such a different landscape. It's such a different landscape. You're like, dear sir, please remit the blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. As opposed to like, hey, man, you owe me a thousand, just give me the money. How many times did you end up trimming weed? Like how often did you do that as a job? I trimmed weed a couple of times for sure, definitely. And I still like to visit the farms during harvest season. I don't really trim like that anymore. I'm an OK trimmer. I'm not, I'm not like an all-star great trimmer. When you were trimming, were you staying in a like a house or where? Yeah, you were staying in the cabin in the woods. Sometimes they have tents. It depends. I mean, I would never, I wouldn't just show up like, you see some of these trimmer grint laborers, trimigration season, they just show up hoping to catch onto a spot. That's how you end up sketching. Like I have friends. I would just call my friends and be like, hey, if it's trim season, I got a couple of weeks, man, let me come up and get into it for a couple of weeks. And, you know, they'll be like, yeah, man, you can come up and hang out, you're funny enough or whatever. And you sit there, we're sitting around and it will be very social. But for some people, it's definitely a different, a different vibe. So. Okay, I, okay, that's cool. Now, this gets me to something I'd love to hear your thoughts on. It's my stoner hypothesis that let's take a strain of marijuana, whatever it may be, randomly selected strain of marijuana. Okay. One tree trimmed with a machine. One tree trimmed by a professional trimmer. Give people these strains, not letting them know which was which. I don't know how you'd create the actual study. My hypothesis is that the weed that was hand trimmed is going to have a much better high than the weed that was trimmed by the machine. Thoughts. I concur with you, one of the challenges that they would have with the machine, some of these newer machines are better. But one of the things about this machine is it's going to bump your weed around and roll it around and you're knocking off all those trichomes, right? And the trichomes are where all the terpenes and all the THC and all that good stuff is in that. Those are those little, that's how you make the hash. You take those little glands and you knock them off the tree and you press them together. And now you have hash or now you have dabs, right? So when you're doing it with machine and it's rolling around, bounce around there, the trichomes are just falling all over the place, which is great if you're a company, because then you could take those trichomes and turn them to another thing. But if you're just trying to smoke flour and you're cutting it by hand, you're saving a lot of that stuff for the staying on the plant. And it also looks better. You can tell when something's been machine trimmed because it looks almost too uniformed and kind of mushed as opposed to when you cut it up and let it, you know, looks like a centerfold, looks like a high time centerfold. Yeah. Yeah, man. And then this, see, this is the thing. Like we're also excited about the end of the prohibition. And in your podcast, we talked about how like now everyone's like, it's legal and doesn't, they don't realize all the activism people like you have been doing forever. Bro, they're trying to run away from the stoner lifestyle. They're like, oh, we're getting away from the stoner paradigm. Fuckers, stoners are the ones who got weed legal. Quit fucking with us. Right. We're the ones who went to jail behind that shit. Pay some respect. I'm an OG. It will be treated as such. Yes. Yes. Celebrate the stoner. What are you going to do? Disregard them now just because like it's like legal. You're going to just like say that that entire thing was just a result of the prohibition. Oh, fuck off. Now, okay, this is my theory to go back to the trimmer thing. See, I think weed, like, okay, what is the coffee? Coffee is a sponge, man. Like if you, if you get coffee around incense, it'll like soak up the incense. You know, it'll like and fuck up your coffee. I think weed does the same thing for human energy. And that I'm just, I know it's, I mean, listen, y'all look, you know, the guest is, we're talking about weed. All right. What are we going to do? I just, these are my thoughts. I haven't talked about weed in a while with anybody, but like I feel like it absorbs human energy. And so when you're, when you're smoking weed and, and trichromes, trichromes aside, these tremors, God knows what's on their hands, right? Fuck knows. That's the best. Finger hash. That's getting into the weed too. All their oils and the patchouli's dripping out of their hair into, you know what I mean? Into the weed. Like whoever they were fingering or fucking or whatever. That's getting into the weed. Oh, you're super fancy. You're like, you smell it. You're like, I don't know. I feel like the trimmer had some bad vibes. This is maybe going through a divorce. Can I get some weed that was turned by a happier person? Oh yeah. This smells like they sat around enjoying a birthday, eating cake, finger banging. I'm telling you exactly. This was a mystical trimmer because some of those people up there, they might as well be Jesus. Yeah. You know what I mean? Some of the people up there, you, I've met some of them and it's like, I don't know what planet you come from, but it's not this one. You're like some kind of, you know, I'm talking about that fairy folk, the elf creatures. You're one of them. His name is Swamy. You can hang out with Swamy. You can hang out with Mendo Bruce. You can hang out with Tim Blake, a bunch of cats, bunch of cats out there. Sunshine. They're all named sunshine, sunshine. She's hella cool. There's a lot of cool people out there. And they're, and they're so, they're all like healthy and they're all, but they're mystical and they're all like, who knows what? Drinking like tinctures and pinecone mixes with weird like. It's easy to be healthy and mystical when you live in the woods and have kind of cut yourself off from that whole, from the rest of society. Like I, I go back and forth on that all the time. Like, man, I could just go live somewhere and fuck being a bodhisattva, fuck trying to help people just go out in the woods and live my own little peaceful life. I wouldn't even know if there was a war in Ukraine. I don't know. Right. I'm just sitting in the woods drinking tea, maybe journaling, maybe not. Maybe I'm just having my own thoughts in my head. Maybe I'm just living in my own little cabin-fied world, but it's tough. It's tough because I feel like, uh, like that song by Solomon Burke. Until all of us are free, none of us are free. So. Yeah. Right. Yeah. That, that. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. The bodhisattva concept is really beautiful and it doesn't have to be a permanent bodhisattva, by the way. I mean, I didn't, again, friends, I like weed. All right. I'm sentimental about it. You or you and I are both sentimental about it. I love weed. It's got me through. So much to save my life. It's been there for me. It's, it's giving me a career. It's been there from. Yeah. Yeah. It was the worst cinema. There's other podcasts to listen to if the stoner talk is bothering you, but. We've covered a lot of things to that. That was not just weed. We talked about a lot of things and that's what. Yeah, I know. But actually talking about weed is not just weed. Like the, the other thing about when you're getting marijuana during the prohibition is that like these people put, are putting their asses on the line. A lot of them and a lot of them it's, they're not as financially motivated as you might think. A lot of them know it's medicine. A lot of them know this is like helping people have cancer. A lot of them know this is healing people and needs to be in the world, you know, and they were up there like just waiting for the fucking ATF to come in. Take everything. One of the best growers I ever met, Dr. John Hudson, may he rest in peace. He started growing because his sister told him she had cancer and he had heard that weed could help with cancer. So he started growing a weed for her. It turned out she was a liar, but it also turned out he was a really good weed grower. So he's super got into it. He opened a little small dispensary and really, really in helping sick people. He got busted a couple, three times and, and the third time he got busted, I was like, man, why are you still doing this? He's like, well, I think I'm kind of crazy. Also the shit needs to get out. And then the fourth time he didn't get busted, but the DEA, and I know three people that this has happened to, the DEA showed up at his house and they're like, Hey, listen, this is, this is where you grow it. This is who you're selling it to. This is this, this is that. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, quit. Just quit because if you don't quit, we're going to fuck it all up and you might win, but it's going to take all your money. It's going to take all your things. It's going to take all this and this. So you should just stop. And he stopped for like five years. I know, I know. Better than arresting him, I guess. I know a couple of people. How terrifying would that be to have the government just show up and be like, we know everything about you. And then also you're like having to look at them like, all right, let's play the game that I'm growing like fucking plutonium out here. What's not yellow. Thank you to plutonium. I'm telling you all that it's not yellow. Thank you, radio. It's just a weed plant. It should be next to the strawberries. Congratulations friend. You just shut down a farm. That's what you did today. That's what you did today with your life. That's what you did. You shut a farm. I'm so proud of you. You just shut down a fucking farm. That's how they feel it too. It's haunting for them. So when we moved to LA and there were maybe two dispensaries in LA when my boy Don Duncan opened up his and all of a sudden there was like a proliferation of dispensaries and the fed started showing up and busting people. And so what we did was we started like a texting and a phone tree and we started flash mobbing these dudes and we would call the TV stations and we would call the police and we'd be like, hey, there's people robbing medicine from sick people right now. Right. Right. And we would show up. Right. Don't take my medicine. Quit fucking with sick people. We're supposed to be helping people and it created a lot of bad press for the feds. And so they stopped, they didn't really stop. They stopped with the long protracted raids because they would come in, they would tie everybody up, they would bring in a safe cracker, they would take all the stuff, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, they threatened everybody with the rest. And then after they started getting the negative publicity for that, they would just kind of show up and smash and grab. They'd just run in and grab as much money and weed as they could and then run out. And then that creates a different thing. You're like, oh, so are you guys really trying to uphold the law? Are you just out here smashing and grabbing like a gang? Yeah, yeah. Oh my God. What? Yeah, we all know the fucking answer to that. We all know the answer to that. I'm just asking questions. Everyone knows, everybody knows like they're just smashed, they're grabbing the weed, they're grabbing the money. Essentially, it's like there was, I know what you're talking about. That was the period where marijuana stores were like just fruit trees or the cops to come in, wait for the fruit to grow, wait until like, you know, there's enough, there's a lot of money. It's successful. And then come and take it, you know, and they would want, like that's what's interesting about your friend is like, from what I heard, they would watch, they would act like they're doing surveillance, but really the surveillance they're doing is they just want to wait until there's enough stuff to grab to make money off of. They're casing the joint. Yeah, exactly. They're casing it so they could like, you know, once there's enough, you don't want to bust someone who doesn't have a nice sports car or someone who doesn't have like shit that you can sell at auction. Right, exactly. But you seem, when we were talking about, I can't remember which festival, it seems like you've managed to not demonize the law enforcement that you don't feel bitter about that, that like you somehow forgiven them or was I am I mistaken? I go back and forth. I mean, once again, lots of times people when you hang out with them as individuals are very cool, but when they start forming large groups or joining gangs, they're different within that concept, right? Right. Because I've definitely hung out with some cops who be like, I would never bust anybody for weed. I've never busted anybody for weed a day in my life. I think it's stupid. Same. And I've definitely hung out with cops who are like, I can't wait to fucking bust somebody for weed or I can't, you know. So are you like, well, you're talking to me like you've had cops. What do you mean? Like, did they throw the handcuffs on you? Listen, I've been arrested for weed in three different states. It's two different states. Almost arrested in Nevada on some bullshit. They just took the weed because legalization was going to be there like a year later. The cop was like, this is not even going to matter a year. I'm like, I'm glad you agree. So you could take this weed. I'm still mad about it, but I didn't pay any funds. Right. I didn't pay any fucking. That's cool. I'm not fucking coming back to Elko until the shit is legal. Yeah. When I came back and shit was legal and no one's ever slated me on anything. So sometimes you got to wait them out. You just got to be patient. Have you ever done time? Did you ever have to do any time? Never any hard time. I spent a weekend in jail in LA on some bullshit and I spent a day in jail. This motherfucker outside of, was it salmon Washington? I'm driving to a gig. It's late at night and I had borrowed my mom's four by four because it might have snowed. I found it might. It was like a wintertime gig and I taken it to get an oil change. I was like, fucking check everything because I'm driving through small towns and I'm black. So make sure everything is good and they're like, everything's all good. And so I'm driving through the small town and the cop pulls me over because the light over my license plate was out. Oh my God. And then now I got weed in the front seat and also maybe I got a warrant from some shit that happened four years ago in Seattle that I never paid a ticket. Totally fucking funny about it. And now I got to spend a night in jail. I got to tell you though, it was a nice jail. I had to sell all to myself. They brought me a decent lunch. They let me use my cell phone. They brought me a couple of magazines. I was like, man, that's cool. And then I got to go back up to go to court. And the judge was like, well, it's kind of dickish, but I got it. It was still kind of legit. I'm like, whatever. And then they're like, you got to pay a fine. I'm like, okay. And then I fucking left. I never paid that fine. And then weed's legal like three years later. And then I called around like, you don't have any warrants. All right, I'm good to go. Wow. Thank God. But I had to miss again. That was the thing that upset me. And here's the other thing too though, right? Like, so he sees the weed on the front seat and he takes that weed and he kind of searches the car. He finds the other weed, some of the other weed, and they take me to jail. And I'm thinking to myself, well, he didn't say anything about the hash ease, which is definitely a felony. So I'm probably, I'm probably good, right? I'm not going to say anything to it. And then I get the car back. I was like driving to Montana. I'm like, oh, look, my hash is right there. So really, it's not too bad. We avoid the felony. That's cool. I've avoided the felony twice. One time I was staying at a Motel 6 in the San Fernando Valley, just because I was coming to LA to do something and I was going to go see my kids and whatever. And the fucking cops knock on the door at like 10.30 in the morning at the Motel 6. And I'm like, what's going on? They're like, well, you have a warrant for your arrest. I'm like, I don't have a warrant for my arrest. I'm fucking naked. I got weed and hash on the goddamn thing. I'm like, I don't have a warrant for my arrest. I cleared all my, I was very careful to clear all my shit up. They're like, well, you got a warrant right here. So now I'm handcuffed. They take me to the thing. I got to call my new business partner and be like, hey, you got to bail me out of jail on a $30,000 warrant on some bullshit, right? Right, right, right. And so, and then I get to court and the judge was like, yeah, no, he doesn't. He did all the things. He got all the stuff. And we're like, what, what about the hash? I'm like, well, I have a letter from my doctor right here. This hash is, is completely covered under the prophecy, under the 10th of Prop 15. And then the prosecutor's like, well, hash is a wobbler, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I'm like, no, according to the governor's guidelines. And they're like, okay, we got to continue. So then I got to go back, right? And I show up with the governor's guidelines and said, I'm like, listen, it's right here. And the judge was like, okay, cases dismissed. And then my public defender was like, hey, you need a job. You can't afford me, bro. Man, I, you, the fact that you're able to talk about this and laugh, I'm so impressed. I mean, I, I, I'm so impressed. I just, that's so cool. I'm a black man in America. I've only spent like five days in jail in 54 years. That's really not bad. That's really not bad. That's so, man, it's just satanic that you have to, that that is the experience. That's so satanic that that's, I get it. It's just, yeah, it's probably just because I'm, I'm white that like this stuff is, and I, I have no like that I find this stuff so infuriating just out of a lack of, listen, what are you going to do? Do you, you know, that's the activism. You know, the job is dangerous when you take it, right? That's part of the civil disobedience. I didn't, I wasn't surprised. You walk around with weed in places where weed is illegal. Every once in a while, you might run into trouble. So you just have to be willing to accept it and willing to deal with it. You know what I mean? Okay. Last question. Yeah. I think a lot of people, especially in California, they feel like the work is done. You know, and I wonder if you could share with people some, some things folks who are in states where the weed is still illegal or people who want to like, who have that activist impulse in them. Can you give some advice or some instruction to folks who might want to, all right, continue the work that you've been doing? Go hard. Don't expect science and common sense to win the day. Because how many city council meetings or things have I been to where they're like, oh, these arguments are all make a lot of sense. You all bring up very good points and then they vote against the whole thing anyway. Because that's right, right. If science and common sense would win the day, we'd be, we'd be a lot better off in a lot of different ways. Right. Don't be afraid to speak out. Just, you know, be ready. Have a good lawyer. At least make friends with some lawyers, people who can help you out a little bit. Don't be afraid to be a little more radical than you might usually be. Because you're in no good negotiations, right? So you, you want to start your negotiations from all the way over here, right? Because they're going to start all the way over there. And if you try to start here and they're here and they'll be like, well, you try to compromise. You're like, okay, I'm a compromise. And then they move that way a little bit. So start over here. Start with like, we should be legal. We're all going to fucking the streets, right? Gotcha. Yeah. And then try to get it to, okay, you can carry a couple ounces. You can grow six plants, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Love it. We should hand out weed to children and people who are fucking the streets whenever they want. Start from there. It should be part of lunch program. At least for the teachers. God knows it should. It should. There should be spas at these schools, steam rooms where you get stoned on your break, sit in the steam room, go back to work. That's what we got to push for. Cannabis-infused massage right after you get off before you have to grade some papers. That would be a good time. That would be a good time. So you're heading out on the road. Working folks find you. I know you're going to, are you going to Spain? I'm going to Spain in March. I will be in Spain for the International Cannabis Business Conference and for the Spannabas Festival. And then I thought I was going to Denver, but that got moved. So in April, April 8th and 9th, I will be at the Spring Smokeout Barbecue in Monterey with two short E40, Mazi, and a bunch of other cats. And then 420, I will be in Hobbs, New Mexico with Devon the Dude at the Hobbs, New Mexico 420 Celebration Smokeout. And you know, that's my birthday. 420? Yeah. Hey man, congratulations. That's a good birthday. Isn't that cheesy? It's cheesy though. I always feel embarrassed by it. It's like, it's like, if they say you pick your incarnation, I'm like, I'll do 420. Well, that's a good choice. So cheesy though, but. Minus 215, which is the proposition that legalized medical cannabis in California. So. No way. That's so cool. Yes. All right. It all works out. Hey man, thank you for your time. It's so, I like the, the last two days, just getting to spend time chatting with you. It's been such a. Man, it's always a pleasure. I can't wait for you to come to LA so we can go play bad golf and smoke good weed. It's going to be a good topic. Yeah. And let's smoke weed and golf, please. Even though like, because I suck so bad, man. It doesn't matter. Can't make me worse. We don't even have to keep score, man. We're just come out here for the walk and the experience. Okay. Awesome.

452^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - CHRIS RYAN IN LOVE FEAR AND AEROSOL Transcript and Discussion^2014-06-27^When love calls, where will you be? When love calls, where will you be? Will you hear the knock? When love calls your name? When love calls, where will you be? That is the question that Daniel Johnston and Chad Fair are asking all of us on their amazing album, It's Spooky. You can get that on Amazon.com. Where will you be? When love calls, and will you even hear it? Will you even hear the call of love? When you're wandering through some city briefcase in hand, fresh lines of cocaine oozing down the back of your throat, eyes bulging out of your head as you go rushing in the direction of whatever stock exchange you're planning on trading shares for? Will you hear it when you cross paths with a person that could become the portal through which your progeny go exploding into this universe? Or will you be deafened by the sound of your own inner monologue? Will you be too lost in the cyclone and the hurricane of thoughts that up until that point has completely defined you as a person? Blown around inside your mind like Dorothy in that house, little dog yapping witches flying around? Will you hear it? Will you hear it when love calls? So many people don't. So many people have filled their ears with the waxy essence of fear. Their ears have a kind of psychic filter shoved into them so that the only thing that they hear are reminders that the world is a pit. That smoke rises up from the cities of the world which are perpetually collapsing into the mouth of the goddess Kali. All things destroyed, chewed up, spit out. The world like a chainsaw dropped by a serial killer on some dusty Texas highway. An abandoned implement of gruesome death left on the skin of time by some malicious god. A horrific device still clotted with the meaty hairy clumps of whatever sorority house he just saw to pieces before he hitched a ride with some unlucky trucker to San Antonio. Some people think the world is like a cigar cast away by some psychotic multi eyeballed cigar smoking shit god. Some people think the world is a vipers nest, a deadly pit. Your mind thinks that. Why wouldn't it think that? It is dangerous in so many different ways. The world is a dangerous place. You can't deny that fact. The world is a dangerous, dangerous place. All you gotta do is flip on Nancy Grace for 6 minutes or watch one of those autopsy shows on HBO or tune into the Drudge Report or watch videos of ISIS or Al Qaeda videos, September 11th videos. All you have to do is stand at the edge of some busy street and recognize that if by some accident the wrong neuron fires in your brain and you go stepping in front of a truck, that's it. You will explode like a bloody water balloon, horrifying people for the rest of their lives. You will create post-traumatic stress disorder for all those who watch as you get ground under the wheels of a semi because your brain malfunctioned. Constantly surrounded by the potential of being devoured by time, constantly surrounded by the potential of vanishing instantaneously from this dimension. Being slammed out of our bodies. Being eaten by wild animals. It happens all the time. You could just be jogging and some pack of roving pit bulls could come clambering out of the foliage and chew you to pieces, friends. And if the pit bulls don't get you, then a shooter can get you. Some insane lunatic. All amped up on whatever antidepressant and vapor pen he happens to be inhaling and chomping at the same time as he goes marching through a shopping mall with his AR-15 blazing, blasting giant holes in the backs of the heads of innocent people who wanted nothing more than to buy a Swiffer from Target. All you have to do is turn on the news and you can see that we exist on a planet where the ice caps are melting, where nature itself seems to be rising up against all humanity as though we were some awful cancer about to get wiped out by the white blood cells of planet Earth, who will soon cover the cities of the Earth in swampy, brackish, malarial water, causing refugee crisis, displace people, wandering the globe, and if it's not the Earth that gets you and if it's not your brain malfunctioning that gets you and if it's not a shooter that gets you, then it's going to be some unknown disease that could be currently growing inside your body at this very moment, some terrible, malicious malignancy that you don't even know about. And if it's not that that gets you, it could just be some unexpected thing, an accident, some rare moment where a brick goes spiraling off the top of a building and spins down and smashes you in the head just as you were about to order a margarita on some beautiful Saturday at the beach. It's true, the world, a billion gnashing fanged teeth if you look at it a certain way, and it was always like this, the world's always been like this. There's always been lions and snakes, there was a time in human history where the snakes were winning the game. We had to stay up in the trees, the moment you came down from a tree if you were some poor monkey, you would get simultaneously attacked by a swarm of deadly adders and rampaging hyena beings. That's what it was like to be a proto-homoted way back in the early dawn of man, a terrifying experience, the world's terrifying, just watch any squirrel, the way a squirrel acts as it's forging around in a yard. The squirrels generally are not relaxed, they act like they just finished seven tours of Afghanistan and got back to the United States, drank 50 cups of coffee and injected themselves with methamphetamine. Squirrels are freaked the fuck out, birds are freaked out, why wouldn't they be? At any second, a bird can get eaten by a cat, the bird population drops massively in areas where cats live because when cats get into the backyard, one of their favorite things to do is kill birds and squirrels and moles. The entirety of nature is this strange caloric exchange where life gets sucked into some being, shit out, flowers grow, the flowers pollinate and create food for more life which gets eaten by more cats, the whole goddamn thing eating itself up. It's almost as though we've gotten trapped in some kind of atomic grinder and of the unfortunate curse of sentience to make us aware of the fact that at any moment the whole goddamn thing can go exploding on top of us and we end up in the hospital or experiencing some horrible few months as everything inside of us explodes in some kind of chemical cancer fire. So, that element of the universe exists, and the mind being just like a squirrel, scared, lazy, foraging for information, looking out into the world to try to find some safety, constantly spins and runs around, lost in an endless fear cycle. If you're caught up in that goddamn fear cycle, how the hell are you gonna meet eyes with that sweet, beautiful darling who wants nothing more than to rub mayonnaise into your stomach under some Tahitian moon? When love calls, where will you be? What part, what channel are you gonna tune into in this universe? The frequency of fear, the body of fear, as the Buddhists call it, as Jack Cornfield calls it? The inarguable and inescapable truth that everything you own, everything you are and everyone you know will vanish into oblivion for infinity eventually. Is that what you're gonna tune into? Is that the excuse you're gonna make? Is that what you're going to use to rationalize and justify the fact that for the majority of your life you have been in a boxing match, not with somebody who wants to knock you unconscious, break your jaw so that they could wear some golden belt and prance around a arena filled with cheering morons in Vegas? But a boxing match with the force of love that isn't trying to punch you but give you the ultimate hug that anyone can get. And you're just swinging and punching and sweating, fighting desperately against this strange and beautiful force that exists in the universe and has been the wind in the sails of countless romantics, mystics, saints, and other inspired people who have existed since the beginning of time. Yes, it's a deadly world out there. I'm scared all the fucking time. And not just because I eat chiba chews every day, which are a very powerful, edible form of medical marijuana. But because there is a huge part of my mind that's fear based, freaking out, screaming, cutting itself with every single possible negative scenario that could happen in any given moment. For example, today, beautiful walk with my dogs, beautiful walk, walking up a sidewalk and I passed this nice elderly couple. And they love the dogs because the little one, a poodle, is just learning to walk and can't seem to understand that he can walk straight ahead. It's like he's always on a diagonal as though he's being sucked into an invisible fan or he's made of metal and there's some magnet pulling him in the wrong direction at all times. But he's learning and it's super cute. He's trying. But this nice elderly couple sees this idiotic diagonal dog. It's like watching somebody who's drunk at a music festival, stumbling into ported potties. It's cute as they stop and they laugh and the elderly gentleman reaches into his pocket and brings out two little bits of dog biscuit. Do you mind if I feed your dogs? No, go ahead. But in my mind, I'm thinking, wait a minute, wait a minute. I think I saw something like this on Nancy Grace or on one of those autopsy shows and I'm already hearing the news story. Idiot stone hippie allows elderly dog killer to feed his dog massive doses of cyanide and mercury resulting in the painful and death of his dogs, which 10 minutes later popped like two fat, bloody ticks on a summer sidewalk. That's what my mind does. You can put anything in front of my mind and it will figure out a way that that thing can kill it. Anything, bumblebees, babies, if it's a baby, the feeling is like, oh shit, man, I hope I don't accidentally step on the baby or drop the baby or you name it. My mind is like a trailer park amphetamine addict drunk on Budweiser's and screaming out the window at clouds floating in the sky. It's just a function of the mind. They call it the body of fear and Buddhism. And it's in every religion, the acknowledgement that there is this aspect of the universe that is actively devouring all humanity. This is an incredible, this is a great verse from the Bhagavad Gita that I'm going to read. I may have read it before some podcast ago. I don't remember. Chapter 11, verse 24. This is when Arjuna, the protagonist of the Bhagavad Gita, the symbolic representation of all humanity, the hero part of the self that is inevitably faced with having to fight to have the courage to go plunging into the fray regardless of outcome. And Krishna has revealed to Arjuna his universal form, as it's called. And this is a scary moment during what sounds like some kind of psychedelic DMT trip. Oh Lord of lords, oh refuge of the worlds, please be gracious to me. I cannot keep my balance seeing thus your blazing death-like faces and awful teeth in all directions I am bewildered. All the sons of Dhritarastra along with their allied kings and Bhisma, Drona and Karna and all our soldiers are rushing into your mouths and their heads smashed by your fearful teeth. I see that some are being crushed between your teeth as well. As the rivers flow into the sea, so all these great warriors enter your blazing mouths and perish. I see all people rushing with full speed into your mouths as moths dash into a blazing fire. Oh Vishnu, I see you devouring all people in your flaming mouths and covering the universe with your immeasurable rays, scorching the worlds. You are manifest. Oh Lord of lords, so fierce a form, please tell me who you are. I offer my obeisances unto you. Please be gracious to me. I do not know what your mission is and I desire to hear of it. The Blessed Lord said, Time I am, destroyer of the worlds, and I have come to engage all people. All the soldiers here on both sides will be slain. Therefore get up and prepare to fight. Everyone is put to death by my arrangement and you can be an instrument in the fight. All the jobs rotting corpse and put them in a laboratory with the rotting corpses of Tesla and Einstein and bring all the great inventors who exist in the world today. Bill Gates throws Stephen Hawking into that stinking half zombie filled laboratory. Elon Musk get him in there and all the other tech geniuses that never get famous and throw them all into this alchemical laboratory and give them all the money and resources that they possibly want and need and tell them that you want them to create some kind of device that will protect you from this inevitable demise that we all face and they could never do it. Even if they spent an infinite amount of time and figured out a way to transform the atomic structure of your body into some kind of never changing, infinite human form, they can't stop the sun from supernovaing and wiping out the planet. And let's say they could even do that. Eventually all the black holes are going to conchill together and we're all going to get sucked into some kind of impossible to understand singularity. There's no way to stop it. So if you're letting your mind trick you by clanging pots together and drawing your attention away from the more subtle call of love that exists everywhere, it doesn't just have to be sexual love. It doesn't just have to be the secret love you feel for your step sister who you desperately want to finger under the stairs. That's just an extreme version of this force of love that according to some very smart people permeates all things. When love calls, where will you be? Well the fascinating thing is the only place you're going to be is the present moment because until you figure out a way to, you'll never get the methodic that lives inside the trailer park of your brain to stop screaming about the fact that his fillings are actually implants placed there by CIA agents who want to monitor his thoughts. You're never going to tune down the subconscious Nancy Grace that parades through the neighborhoods of your mind muttering about children being strangled to death in the swamps of the world. You're probably never going to be able to stop that part of your mind, that chattering hellraiser cube part of your mind with the meat hooks hanging down from the ceiling and the weird cinnabite demons with the pins in their head telling you how everything is just pain. But the great hope is you can understand that that is just one part of your brain, that's one part of the universe of your mind and theoretically if you can begin the slow process of disengaging from that slayer concert that's been raging in your mind ever since you realize that your parents are going to die. There is a possibility that you will hear from an unexpected place a brand new sound that you forgot even existed. It's the sound that babies hear. It's the sound that lies underneath all the turbulence and horror of the modern world. It's the sound of love friends. Where will you be when love calls? I'll tell you one place you won't be when love calls, you're coffin. By then it's too late. If you close off, seal down, let the fear mind activate the laser sensors of the vault of your heart and shut those fucking doors down and seal you up and close you off and you walk around the world with your fists clenched, writing angry blogs about shit Ricky Gervais said. Then you're going to miss out. It's as though there was some enormous buffet that exists in this garden of Eden like planet and you decided to stay at the section of the buffet where they only serve diarrhea. You don't have to eat the poop from the buffet of life for your entire existence. You can eat pasta as Jesus said. Hear it. This 4th of July hear it. It's under the sound of fireworks. It's inside the sound of fireworks. It's inside the sound of birdies. It's even inside the sound of chainsaws ripping sorority sisters apart underneath a Texas moon. It's inside everything just like salts inside all the water of the ocean. At least that's what the super smart people say. Who knows? Maybe I'm just a loony hippie who likes to eat marijuana and ride his bike around. But I can tell you that every time in my life when I've become convinced that it'll never emerge into my existence again, every time I've become convinced that that's it, I might as well just start eating cat food and shaking my fist at Mexican kids riding their bikes in front of my house. That's when it comes. And whenever it comes, you have to be there to open the door. Because if you don't and you let fear take over and you allow your mind to tell you though you're going to get ripped, this is going to be it, you're going to get your heart broken this time man. So what? Better to have a broken heart than a heart covered with a meaty fear callus that comes from a coward's life. I'd much rather have a broken heart than a heart that looks like my big toe, which if you've ever seen it is not a pretty sight. There's a thick yellowy callus that from time to time I have to go down and get people to shave off with grinders. They have to put on saw goggles, they have to put on the same thing they wear, the Fukushima nuclear reactors when they saw the calluses of my feet. I'd much rather have a broken heart than a heart covered with a thick yellowy mystery callus, that's for sure. Pick the pain, it doesn't matter, we're all plunging into the void anyway. Take the ride, when love calls. Pick up the goddamn phone you cowards, not that you're all cowards. Some of you I'm sure are a million times braver than I am, a billion times wouldn't be that hard. For those of you that are cowards like me, this 4th of July, open your ears and just the act of pretending, playing around with the notion that when things seem the most bleak and lonely and impossible, when it truly seems that winter is not just coming but that it came and is going to stay there forever, that's when the little sprigs, the little green sprigs start growing up in unexpected places. Spray some water on those arid fields friend, let the universe shave off that nasty yellowing translucent callus that you've allowed to form around your sweet heart. But be careful, once the flat still briny, malarial water of your subjective consciousness gets filled with effervescent bubbles that come from falling in love, you will no longer be able to function as a cunt in the same way. And that can create a lot of problems if you've based your entire life on being a drooling, fang-toothed life cunt erupting negativity on all those who cross paths with you. You're just going to have to deal with that. You're going to have to deal with the fact that you are going to become a sweet, powdered little baby's cheat that everybody wants to pinch. And yeah, we know, you're afraid that you're not going to be funny anymore, your business won't be as successful, or some part of your life based on being a goddamn infection is going to fall apart. Who wants that? Let it fall apart. It's already fallen apart, trust me. We're in some kind of flux right now and your distant relatives have already forgotten about you at some point in the future. So forget your stupid career based on being a dickhead. Forget your dumb career based on being cruel to people or whatever life path you've taken that somehow your mind is convinced you is only working out because you're a closed off, shut down human swamp adder. Let that fall apart. You'll be fine. I'm sure it would be better to be in the throes of ecstatic, Sufi level love and living behind a dumpster letting rats piss in your mouth than it would be to have a closed off, shut down heart chakra and be at the top of some diamond encrusted tower getting blow jobs from your sex slaves. How are you going to enjoy sex slaves if you can't feel it's like going inner tubing in some way that you can enjoy inner tubing couldn't think anything for that one. We go deep into this in this podcast friends Chris Ryan as you know if you've listened to past episodes always hits home runs every time and this is a deep awesome conversation where we go into the idea of love we go into the idea of impermanence. We talk about what it means to be gay we talk about a great many other important things which I can't recall this very second, but it was fun. And I love Chris Ryan. And if you get a chance listen to his great podcast tangentially speaking, we're going to get going with this podcast but first some quick business. This episode of the Dunkin Trussell Family Hour podcast is brought to you by Hulu Plus. For those of you who don't know Hulu Plus allows you to watch TV shows current episodes of TV shows like Community Attack on Titan, Nashville Lost and Doctor Who on your TV. You can binge watch shows that's what it does for those of you who've never binge watched shows it's a great thing to do. If you follow my advice and allow yourself to experience love and fall in love when you eventually find yourself staring down at the broken fragments of your heart screaming at the sky and wondering if the pain will ever end. One of the first things you should do subscribe to Hulu Plus lay in bed surround yourself with ice cream Doritos booze weed whatever gets you off and binge watch Doctor Who. That is a surefire way to go back into ignoring the pain. And sometimes it's great to ignore the pain. Sometimes if you've got a hangover and you don't want to go and mow the lawn or do whatever it was that you were going to do if you've gotten food poisoning because you skimped on eating at a reputable restaurant and ended up eating a chicken burrito that from the moment you tasted it to the moment you finished it you knew was poisoning your system this just happened to me. And you find yourself a few hours later with explosive diarrhea in your head filling up with the chicken farts. And you realize that for the next three days all you're going to be doing is writhing around shitting and puking. Then why not subscribe to Hulu Plus and spend those days distracting yourself from the fact that your insides are at this very moment filled with rotting flesh that you decided to eat even though you knew it tasted bad. Just happened to me. Hulu Plus came to the rescue. They've got amazing shows. They've got the entire criterion collection. They've got the fall guy. They've got the A team. They've got Fraggle Rock. Remember Fraggle Rock? I don't know why someone hasn't written a conspiracy blog about Fraggle Rock but man if anything gave an incredible commentary on human society it was Fraggle Rock man. The Illuminati was using those cute little subterranean dwellers to send some message to us. Maybe not but if you get stoned enough and subscribe to Hulu Plus and watch Fraggle Rock you can convince yourself that you're actually getting beamed top secret Alex Jones level information from what ostensibly was just supposed to be a kid's show. You get all this for $7.99 a month. If you go to HuluPlus.com slash DTFH and sign up you'll get two weeks full access completely free. Then it turns to $8 a month. What is $8 a month? That's three big gulps. Only it won't kill you. Not that big gulps will kill you depending on what you're doing when you're drinking the big gulp. $8 a month you get access to every TV show. The entire criterion collection. A plethora of movies. And you can watch this on your smart TV, Roku, Apple TV, Xbox, PlayStation or pretty much any streaming device you already own. I can't recommend this enough. I subscribe to Hulu Plus. $8 a month. They didn't give it to me for free for doing these advertisements. But that's okay. I don't mind paying for it. It's a really cool service. Makes me feel like I'm in the future. When I was a kid, you had to go to the back of your musty old TV and wipe away the tears from your eyes as you listen to your parents downstairs screaming at each other, throwing the cat into the wall, praying to Lucifer. You'd stick the weird metal tongs in the back of the TV and then flip the dial of the TV. And you were lucky if you just got sound. Sometimes you didn't just get sound. You didn't even have sound when I was a kid. You just pretended that the fuzz that you were seeing on TV was some kind of sci-fi movie where a spaceship was moving through infinite clouds. That's how we got entertainment when I was a boy back in the early 30s. But now you can go to Hulu Plus and instantaneously access nearly every TV show that ever existed. If I went back in time and told my younger self that, then I'd probably put myself in an intentional coma and try to skip my entire childhood, teen years and college years until the moment that Hulu Plus existed. So now you can experience the sweet geyser of entertainment. That hot, salty, wet blow of pixelated glory that Hulu Plus splatters all over your face every time you tune in. Go to HuluPlus.com slash DTFH and sign up. Give it a try. They're sponsoring this podcast. They're true sweeties. And I'm happy to represent such a cool company. HuluPlus.com slash DTFH. Okay, guys, lots of new dates coming up. These dates are going to be listed on my website. I'm adding new dates. I just added a date in Vancouver, but there's also dates coming up in San Francisco. There's also dates coming up in other parts of Canada. There's tons of great dates coming up. Please go to dunkitrustle.com and check those dates out. For those of you who have attempted to buy our new t-shirt design, we have new shirts that should be in within the week. We sold out almost instantly because these shirts have within them, as William Burroughs put it, a mythic resonance. The new DTFH Enneagram shirts were designed by the mystic artist, Ron Regi, and he encoded within them a lot of different occult symbols which are designed to protect you from the evil eye of the haters who might go walking by you and want to roll their eyes at you because they see that you're bubbling with love and joy and have opened yourself to allowing yourself to get heartbroken because you've recognized that you'd rather experience a true connection with the force of love in the universe than walk around completely disconnected and pretending that you're feeling okay. This will shield you from the evil eyes of those cynical, sardonic cunts who want nothing more than to shove you right back into that dusty, dead, airless vault that used to be your life of fear. It'll shield you and protect you from these bastards. So go check out the shop at dunkatrustle.com. There's also a lot of great posters and other cool stuff that you can get there. And we have a forum. I haven't talked about the forum in a while, but for those of you who haven't gone to the website or checked it out, I highly recommend it. Forums are weird things, man. They go through different weathers and moods and they change, and sometimes they're a little weird and off base and there's some wars that rage there. But man, right now I am so happy about the way the forum at dunkatrustle.com is going. It's a really cool community of people. And I invite you, if you haven't gone there, to sign up for a membership and just say hi to these people. I'm not saying there aren't a few turds floating in the bowl over there, but if they are inside the turd, there's a diamond. That's for sure. Inside every turd, there's a diamond. One of my favorite songs. And if you also, what am I missing here?

Everybody, please welcome to the Dunkertrustle Family Hour podcast the great Chris Ryan. Ryan! It's the Dunkertrustle Family Hour. Test, test, test. You're with Chris Ryan. Chris, fucking Ryan. Chris Ryan, welcome back to the Dunkertrustle Family Hour podcast. To the audience, I apologize. You might hear a background hum. That is the fan that we have running, because it's fucking hot in my podcast studio that I need to figure out a cool-down. Welcome. Thank you, man. Nowhere I'd rather be, even with the heat. Where would you rather be? I said, nowhere I'd rather be. Oh, I thought you said, you know where I'd rather be. No, no, no. There's nowhere I would rather be. There's a lot of places you'd rather be. Well, not right now. You wouldn't want to be, say, in the harem of some... I'll get there later. But right now, I could... Right now, I want to be here with you. If you could teleport... Dunkin' T. Russell. Immediately into a room filled with the smartest humans who ever lived, you would rather be here? Yeah. No, a room full of the smartest humans that ever lived in a fucking disaster. They'd all be arguing. There'd be all this ego going on. I'd be the dumb guy in the room. It's like when I lived in the house, I probably told you about this. I lived in this mansion where everyone who lived there was a fashion model except me. It was like Melrose Place, and I was the ugly guy in the house. I don't need that. I don't need to be in a room full of geniuses. Transport me into a room full of idiots. There you go. Really ugly idiots. Fucking smart guy. I have fun. And really old. I'll be the young guy. So you want to be in a room full of old, asymmetrical idiots. Exactly. And then you could be their leader. Start a country. That would be a great insult. You asymmetrical idiot. What's that mean? See? See? This fucking... This guy is like... This physical form thing, man. It's just such a pain in the ass. It's like... Here we are in this amazing time in human history for better or for worse, but we're still chained down by the constraints of the physical form. People are... You've got a thing about that. You've got a bug up your ass about the physical form. I've heard... What do you call it? The meat body. Meat bodies and all that stuff. And yet, I was just saying earlier, you look incredibly fit and healthy. So there's an interesting dichotomy there where your actual meat body is... All right. I'm thinking about this because I told you before we started recording, as soon as I get home in a couple of days, this marks the big division where, like from now on, I'm working on the book, I'm going to the gym, I'm going to get in shape all this shit, right? So... I've been thinking about our bodies and my relationship with my body and all that. And the thing is, like, I sympathize with what you're saying about being trapped. William Butler Yates said we're... I think he said we're chained to a dying beast. Yes. Right? So I sympathize with that, especially I'm 52, the beast is a little more dying than it used to be. You know, hairs are growing out of my ears and shit, you know, all this weird aging stuff. But on the other side, there's no greater source of pleasure in our life than our bodies if we treat them right. Right? Like, taking a good shit is a wonderful experience. We don't generally talk about it, you know? But it is, it's like a real fucking pleasure to take a proper dump. Yes. No one's going to argue with that if they do that out of their minds. Even a fart, even a good fart, if you're alone, is wonderful. The excretory function is a great source of pleasure. I mean, most functions are. That's the thing, you know, you're scratching it, you go to sleep at night when you're tired, you wake up in the morning when you slept well, that feels great. You eat when you're hungry, that feels great. You take a dump later, that feels great. It's like a constant source of pleasure and contentment if you have a good relationship with it. My problem right now is that I don't, I've been ignoring it for years, so I don't, like, get that feeling of, I mean, even not when you're doing something specific, you were talking earlier about riding your bike a lot, when you're in shape, it just feels good to be alive. Yes, it does. This is like a constant background hum of contentment. You gotta walk the dog. You gotta walk the dog. Exactly. And that's what your body is. Or it becomes a whiny, gappy bitch. Yeah, that's exactly. You gotta walk the dog, and when I say the meat body thing, I'm not saying reject or renounce the needs of the body temple. I'm just saying that it's a shame, or it's what we, what we, it's a, it's in the same way humans can't fly. Right. Like, wow, how amazing would that be if humans could fly? It's a, everybody's fantasized about it, that just, if you just sit for a moment and think about how incredible it would be, how much of a burden would be lifted off of all of society, if suddenly every single human gained the ability to fly. Sure, there'd be problems, but you look at people who are driving like, what the fuck are you doing? Like, why are you in that car when you could soar through the sky, getting to wherever you want, flying would be incredible. So there's an eternal burden that humans have, or a wall, which is gravity that obstructs us from what appears to be one of the great pleasures available to certain animals on the planet. But there's another obstruction we have, equivalent, which is, if you are asymmetrical, if you have an asymmetrical form, if you're just born with, for whatever reason, features that aren't considered to be attractive, then you live a very specific type of life. You live a very, whether you like it or not, you want to talk about racism, sure, there's racism, idiotate black people, idiotate white people, misogyny, sure, idiotate women, idiotate men, but goddamn, there is another form of racism, another form of thing that seems to be built into us, maybe, genetically, which is that if somebody is not physically attractive, they are rejected by the world. And to me, that's always seemed like a very sad thing, because some of the people who aren't physically attractive, or some of the most incredibly beautiful, amazing humans you'll ever come across, Is that a function of them being unattractive, though? Would they be that interesting if they were super good looking? Man, you know, you think that, and then you meet someone who's incredibly physically attractive, and they're amazing, and then you realize, like, holy shit, no, it's not, I mean, you might be part of it. Well, there are exceptions, but having lived in that house full of fashion models, I can tell you that the women tended to not be interesting at all, and they were irritating to be around. But in some ugly people, I know what you mean, though, here's the idea, the idea is, this is an idea to think about. But we compensate, right? We compensate. So if you don't have it going on in one area, like, I'm not a natural athlete, right? If I were a natural athlete, if I were, like, dominating the other kids on, you know, the football field or whatever, I doubt I would have read as much as I did. So then I wouldn't have developed, you know, the intellectual capacities I have, which are now, like, what pays the rent, right? So, you know, in a sense, I think, of course, there are many examples. I did meet intelligent, wonderful people who were super good-looking. But in general, being that good-looking, you don't need to work for anything, so you don't, so it comes easy, and then you get this sense of entitlement, like rich kids, kids who grow up rich, you know? They tend to be dicks. Why? Because they don't know what it's like to not be rich. This is the idea of... I was just, man, I've just recently gotten into this. God, honestly, I'm gonna say it. I'm gonna say it. I think I'm in love with him. Zizek. I think I'm in love with Zizek. Like, I feel like I just want to be close to the guy. Who the fuck is Zizek? He's this incredible Marxist philosopher. Oh, I met him. I spoke with him in Australia at the Festival of Dangerous Ideas. God, I would... My hands would be shaking. That guy is... Have you seen his incredible documentary on Netflix called The Pervert's Guide to Ideology? No. Wow! It's amazing, and it's just a breakdown of the conditioning in a lot of Western movies, and he's just so funny and smart, and I've got butterflies over this guy, but one thing that he says... One thing that he says is he's showing the riots, videos of the riots that happened in the UK, and all these people rioting and rioting and talking about how the... You know, the people like to say, this is the socioeconomic condition that's causing these people to riot, because blah, blah, blah, and he's like, yeah, but no matter what the socioeconomic condition is or the external condition is, if you're a human, you know that there's something inside of you that transcends your socioeconomic, physical, gender-based, whatever condition. There's something in you bigger than that. Otherwise, we'd just be robots, moved by the... Not robots, but just kind of like individual droplets of H2O being sort of thrown around by the tides of society, and there's something bigger in us than that, you know? So it's like, yes, people are lazy, that's for sure, and yes, you meet somebody who's entitled, and sometimes you find that they seem to be unappealing or uninteresting. Here's the big question. How can you be a human being and not be interesting? How can you be shot out of a pussy under this strange... Shut up. ...automatically be interesting? You're a sentient little piece of the fucking universe, whether or not you're symmetrical, asymmetrical, rich, poor, you're fucking interesting. So maybe that thing we call personalitylessness that we ascribe to some of these people is, in fact, a kind of massive defense mechanism to keep them from, like, being objectified. So do boring people have interesting dreams, I wonder? God damn, that's a great question. I mean, isn't a dream automatically interesting? Blind people, apparently, who were born at birth, have visuals in their dreams. Oh, wow. Yeah, not like geometric shapes and stuff like that. That makes sense. Yeah, because the brain produces those. Yeah. But yeah, do boring people have interesting dreams? I mean, a lot of people that we would consider boring, uninteresting, whatever, it's because they're so repressed. That's it. So that could make them really interesting if you could release some of whatever's under all that weight. But that's dangerous, you know? Yeah, I mean, you've done that too, I'm sure, with women. You meet a woman who's really repressed and you sort of find the key that opens her up a little bit and it's like saving someone's life. You know, like the American Indian thing, if you save someone's life, then you owe them taking care of them the rest of their lives because now they're alive because of you. Yeah, this is spiritualized, an idea of the guru-disciple connection which is like the guru takes on the karma of the disciple and it's a really heavy duty thing to do because and also the stories of coming in contact with the guru are always one of weeping, one of this explosion of all this repressed aspects of yourself. Because why are people repressing themselves? Why are they? Why do you think people repress themselves? We generally fear and shame, which is the same thing, really. Yeah. So, when you get around to guru, the idea is these are people who somehow, whether you're superstitious and believe they have a telepathic connection to your subconscious and witness all the things you've been hiding or they're just really good at making it seem like they're witnessing the things that you're hiding, regardless they're able to project the impression that they have completely seen everything about you and they love you no matter what. Right. And if you're in a good relationship with somebody that's awesome when you really love, you do feel like that. Yeah. Mark Marin has this great joke about when, you know, he's in love and he's like listening to his, oh, you're not, I'm sorry, you're not supposed to say comedians jokes on the air after that. Oh, really wonderful. Yeah, because it, I almost did this with Rogan. He's like, that's one of my jokes. I think you were there. Yeah, I was there. I noticed you guys were doing that. Like, careful, don't say that. I thought it was because he had a special coming up or something. The reason is because if the comedian is performing, it's not what they're saying generally to be new to the people. Yeah, but if they've already done it publicly. Yeah, but it's still, anyway, it's a great, it's a great, the point is it's that idea behind the joke is like, even the like functions of a person that normally would be considered appalling or hidden, you just love every single piece of them. Yeah, at the beginning. Well, yeah, of course, of course. But in that, what you just did right there, the thing like at the beginning, that's the human mind. That's the mind. The mind does that. Anytime anything wonderful is happening, the mind, as soon as it really, as soon as you're getting into being in the moment and experiencing this explosion of ecstatic euphoric love, the mind says just what you said. Well, okay, but it's also the brain, which has experienced these things. I mean, when I was in my 20s, I would have said that probably because I was immersed in it. I was like stewing in, you know, and there's a great line in Tobias Wolf. He's a short story writer. He wrote This Boy's Life. It's a great movie with Leonardo DiCaprio when he was a teenager. Anyway, he has this line where he says, you know, it's the curse of experience is knowing that everything ends. But it's also the curse of youth thinking it won't. So when you're young, bliss is endless bliss. Pain is endless pain. And as you get older, you realize, well, whatever, this sucks, but it'll pass. This is amazing, but it'll pass. You know, that's who said this too shall pass, plate over somebody, you know? I think it's just, it is part of the human condition, but it's the fact that we have memory, you know, and we learn and like, oh, I've been in love before, and it's wonderful and enjoy it. Like we're getting back to taking a shit, not that I want to equate being in love with taking a shit, but there's a wisdom in deeply immersing yourself in every moment of your life, Karpi fucking Diem, because you know it won't last. Have you heard the term zen mind, beginner's mind? Yeah, I read the book. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it's like, you could take anything, man, whatever it is, a beer. It's great for now. It's gonna run the fuck out. It's gonna get warm if we don't drink it. But every moment, it's like, to me, it's like my mind in the past has had the tendency to say it, and especially the tonality that you said it with, too. It's like, did I piss on your love? I didn't mean to do that. You didn't piss on my love. No, you can't. But the mind, it's the function of the mind to piss on love and to piss on everything else, just like a baby. But see, I don't think so, because you're, I mean, the way you're taking it, and I understand that you're doing that, but the way you're taking it, you're saying you minimize it by recognizing its transitoriness. Transitoriness, is that a word? Well, not only do you minimize it, but you have some incredible hubris to say that anything, anything is going to meet your expectations for good or for bad. And the lovely, lovely invitation of so many of these insane mystics is, let's abandon that for a second. Just for fun. Let's, instead of doing the thing that I've certainly always done whenever I get into a great situation, not just intimate relationship, but anything. Great day. Oh my God, like ecstasy. Take a hit of ecstasy. One hour in, when you're really feeling that incredible euphoric rush, and you start thinking like, this is going to end. You know what I mean? That's the mind. That's the mind. So you take that part of yourself just for fun as an experiment. And you put it on an altar and you take a dagger and plunge it through its heart and say, before you do it, you say, I'm offering you up to the greater truth. I don't know what the out things are going to turn out. Just for fun, I'm going to pretend that I don't know how things are going to turn out. Oh, it's fun. But see the thing, you and I are looking at this from two different perspectives because I don't have that tendency to, what I was saying is that for me recognizing that something is transitory doesn't, it doesn't result in my minimizing the experience. In fact, it's the opposite. It results in my paying greater attention to it because I recognize it's going to end. I mean, I remember having this conversation with women, you know, repeatedly over the years. Like, you know, the woman saying, but, you know, we're on the road. I was traveling all the time, right? So, okay, you're great. I really like being with you. You want to have sex. I kind of want to have sex, but I'm going to be hurt because next week you'll be in Cambodia and I'll be in India and we'll never see each other again. And I remember saying, yeah, but today we'll never be here again. Tonight we'll never be here again. You know, wherever we are, we'll never be there again. So why not really experience this? Yes. You know, granted I was trying to get laid, but I think there was, there was truth in that. But PS, man, it's, there's a bigger issue here. It's like a lot of people are like projecting their fear of death by like, you know, applying it to like the most special thing that you experience in life. And one of the most special things you experience is the kind of connection with people. Yeah. And so because it's easier to deal with the idea that, well, this connection, it's easier to do that to be like, well, yeah, I guess what else won't last? Your physical fucking form, motherfucker. Everything won't last. Everything won't last. The entire universe is in a state of complete dissipation. We're all heading towards a massive atomic change just around the corner, just around the corner, blink of an eye. Entropy always wins. Entropy always wins. We're going to go back into the cosmic swirl, become, become aerosolized by time. Yeah. So from that perspective, it's kind of like, well, aerosolized by time. Duncan, you come out with fucking humdingers, dude. I don't mean to interrupt you. You come out with some shit that like somebody should be following you around with a notebook. Oh, please. You're aerosolized by time. Aerosolized by time, man. Blast it. That's a great expression. Back into the great void. So from that perspective, since we're not just dealing with the fact that it's just love that has the tendency to fade like a beautiful rose or love as we understand it, we're also dealing with the tendency of all things to do this. Right. To me, it kind of like, it makes it, you just have to like make sure you watch that part of the mind that's doing that to understand what exactly is the purpose of the thought matter. Sure. A lot of times you're right. A lot of times it's a diminishment and it's out of fear. It's like, yeah, yeah, this is great, but you know, come on, life sucks. You know, it's that tone, right? Which I guess is what you heard in my voice. But it's not what I mean. It's not what I believe at all. I believe the opposite, which is, yeah, nothing lasts forever. So fucking enjoy it. Open it up, man. When you're taking that dump, enjoy that dump. Yeah. You know, there was that great story. You know, we got it somewhere. Some Zen monk woman. What's the name for a woman monk? I guess it's just monk, right? Spanish is a different word. But anyway, she was, she was giving talk somewhere, or maybe she was a nun or a Christian figure. Anyway, she was, so she was this sort of like aesthetic, you know, living in silence and all that kind of stuff. And she was having dinner somewhere and they served her a partridge. And she fucking went into this partridge like a wild animal. She had like fat running down her face and she was just like tearing it. And someone said like, wow, I didn't expect you to enjoy food so much. And she said, when it's time to meditate, meditation. When it's partridge time, partridge. And it's always partridge time, man. And it's, and that's, you know, that's the, we're dealing with this kind of like tendency of the self to, and I feel myself do it all the time, but it's the tendency of the self to contract. It's expansion versus contraction. And it's, and you can contract if you want, and that's fine. You can contract all the way you want, all the way into a little ball. Like one of those roly-poly bugs that will just if you touch up the stick, it curls up into a little ball. Some people spend their entire life like that. And you could do that. You could definitely do that if you wanted to. That's what the movie Fargo is about, right? Right. That's super like controlled uptight little guy. That's it. Yeah. And you can tighten down all you want, man. You can tighten down all you want. And I get it. I don't blame you for tightening down like that. If you really consider from the very top of the pyramid, which is that how do you know how fast the earth spins? I don't need it, but we're going that fast right now. So when you consider that crazy idea that we're going is however fast the earth spins, not to mention the spinning of the earth, but it's orbit around the sun. Then you're adding the spin to whatever the speed that the earth is traveling around the sun. Just that incredible speed that we're experiencing, that amazing speed is enough to terrify a person if you let your mind think about it. Then you add to the fact that you're on top of this speeding fucking ball and you're melting like a wax candle because of the effects of oxygen and gravity on your body, right? Then there's even more reason to shut down. Then you add to that that to really enjoy human relationship. You have to have the courage of allowing yourself to get stretched out and fucking eviscerated, sliced wide open, and you have to do that, man. That's what you do. You get sliced up and eviscerated. Hey, man, it's what's happening to us anyway. We're all like in the Bhagavad Gita when Arjuna is talking to Krishna and Krishna says, I don't remember the exact verse, but it's like his example is, behold, I've already eaten everyone on this battlefield. And he goes into a great description of it, which is like, look at them in my teeth. He's basically saying, look, it's pieces of your brother in my teeth. I've eaten them all, motherfucker. This is Krishna. This is Krishna. He doesn't say I've eaten them all, motherfucker, but that's what he meant. His point being, friend, I've already eaten you. You're a lunch. It's a done deal. It's a done deal. We know how this ends. So don't throw down the bow. Don't give up the fight. Don't become a, don't become dejected, but rather eat that fucking partridge. Right. And enjoy it. Yeah. Oh, no, I definitely agree with that. Now, let me ask you a slight change of topic. But since I've got you here, you know, I am in LA, right? I'm shooting this pilot. Yes, I do. Okay. For HBO. And I guess I can say that because this won't be out for a couple of days at least. And one of the segments that they want us to do is called unsolicited advice. Yes. So I got 30 seconds to give unsolicited advice to anyone I want. Awesome. And I'm thinking like, what should I do? Here's my idea. And like, if you have other ideas, throw them out. Awesome. Because yeah, I want to bring it. My idea was to, and I'm not sure who to give the advice to the head of the FDA, the whoever gets chosen to be the head of the veterans administration. The advice is open up, remove all controls on using MDMA to treat PTSD and returning vets. Great advice. Because you guys are fucking over the vets. You're not giving them the, especially mental health treatment. Great advice. And nothing is more powerful than psychotherapy assisted company by MDMA and remove in helping people with PTSD. Great advice. What do you think? Love it. Yeah? Love it. You know, Carl Rowe to fuck off and crawl back under a rock because you know, Carl Rowe is just... Is that advice? Well, yeah. Here's some advice. Fuck off. You know, you could praise it. Because you know, Carl Rowe's father was gay. Oh, no, I didn't have that. Yeah. Carl Rowe's father was gay. He was, that's why his parents got divorced. And then his mother committed suicide. His father came out and that led to the divorce. And his father was also really into genital piercing. Oh really? And he was like on the cover of genital piercing. So Carl Rowe was just rebelling. Yeah. Against his dad. And the whole country suffering. Wow. And apparently he had a good relationship with his dad and he accepted his dad being out and like, it was cool. So he subsumed it or what's the word, he repressed it all. And now it's like the entire country is fucked because Carl Rowe is... So sad. And he's such an evil fuck. So sad. Yeah. I like your advice, man. I like your advice to the Pope, the current Pope, because he's doing such a good job. Like, be cool about weed? Not just be cool about weed. Because he said drugs should not be decriminalized. Smoke marijuana. Right. Or take some ecstasy. The Pope on ecstasy? I think he'd dig it. I think that's it. I think the idea is like, okay, fine. These drugs are evil, even though marijuana existed during the time of your savior and was not prohibited at all. Right. It's not an utterance that I know of in the New Testament where Jesus said, don't smoke marijuana. And probably the oil they were using to anoint everyone was fucking hand-coil. It was hash. So, yeah. So the problem is, is like, okay, wait a minute, man. A lot of the stuff you're saying, friend, is pretty beautiful. The images of you washing the sick people's feet symbolically, that's incredible. You got rid of the Pope Mobile, you're like, look, if you want to shoot me, go ahead and do it. That's incredible. The guys communicated the mafia. Super cool. Pretty cool. But it's like, you're still saying it's okay for farmers to get raped and prison. And that seems like a pretty shitty fucking thing for a Pope to say. Oh, and farmers. Right. Marijuana farmers. Right, yeah. You know, because if you send somebody to prison for marijuana and they go to the wrong prison, there's some statistical probability that they're going to get assaulted and raped. So, oh, Lord of love, representative of the force of all love on planet Earth, can you please shut the fuck up about marijuana being illegal? You satanic shill for the devil. Come on, you motherfucker. You motherfucker. Really? You want to send fucking farmers to the dungeon and you say you represent Jesus? You piece of shit. Oh, come on. Don't go that far. No, go that far. These are our only hope. They took his kids away. They took his family away. They took his life away. Anybody who went to jail for weed, and this son of a bitch is saying, keep it illegal and don't let people make their own decisions, you evil satanic fuck. Okay, but you're going to lose him if you do that. I mean, I don't want to be, you know, with, what's her name? I don't want to be friends with people who send agrarians to prison. Yeah. Now, I would also like to see the pope sit down with God and ask God why he made marijuana and grew out of the earth. Was that like an accident to make the evil plan? Was it like, I want to see God's skull or the pope's skull, God. And it grows so fast and so easy. And it cures so many ailments. It's fucking incredible for fabric. And this goddamn weirdo, this weirdo who's in a death cult is prancing around because his PR team is like, let's do this and this and it's going to make the people love the Catholic church and forget the fact that we've been fingering toddlers for the last 40 years and what appears to be an organized, an actual organized and protected thing. The whole world will forget about it. Listen, it's going to suck. He's the Obama of Catholicism. There you go. Yeah. He's the pretty little thing sent out to calm everybody down. There you go. Let me keep doing their thing. There you go. There you go. But you know a man by his stance on marijuana. You know a man. You know what a man is. The moment a man says that human should be in prison. Or a woman. Or a woman who says that people should be in prison for freedom of choice to do a substance that causes zero deaths. Victimless crime. Then you know that's an evil man. Yeah. That's an evil man. That's not a good man. Or at least an ignorant man participating in an evil system. And that's what, I mean, come on, let's face it. When you get an ignorant charismatic, what do you have, man? You've got the worst kind of thing ever. You don't want that in the fucking chessboard. Yeah. You ever listened to hardcore history? No. I keep wanting to. Yeah, I know. Daniel told me to check it out and I downloaded a few episodes and from, you know, a year ago I had them on, whatever. And so recently Cassie and I drew, I told you earlier, we did this porn movie in San Francisco. Yes. So we were driving down to San Francisco and I decided to put one on. And it turns out Cassie's mother was a huge fan of Genghis Khan, which is a weird thing. My mother-in-law was a big Genghis Khan fan. Put that in your pipe. That's badass. Yeah. So anyway, so Cassie knew all this shit about Genghis Khan, so she was really interested in it. She knew the wrath of the Khans. I think it's a four-part series about the Mongolians. I've heard about it. I've heard it. It's excellent. It's very good. That's what Danieli recommended. Why am I talking? Oh, he repeatedly made this point because apparently there are revisionist historians who are saying, look, Genghis Khan, okay, he's got a bad rap. But look at all this great stuff he did. He brought order to the world. He created safety and passages and allowed trade and he was religiously tolerant and he was like, hey, it wasn't that bad a guy. Really, man. And Dan Carlin's point was, okay, but he killed 50 to 60 million people ruthlessly. He would be like, just go in and kill every living thing in cities. And we're saying, well, yeah, okay, there's that. But look at the other. And he was like, okay, you want to make a lot of money? He wrote a book about the good aspects of Hitler, you know, because the only difference between Hitler and Genghis Khan is... Hitler was lazy. Well, Hitler lost. So he's not writing the history. And B, it was recent. People are still alive and who will rebel against that. But if it's, you know, 500 years ago, you can like say, well, yeah, okay, 50 million people died, but whatever. I didn't know them. So let's look at the structural positive things that happened. You can't do that with Hitler yet because it was too recent. But it's exactly the same process. Wow. That's so cool. That's so interesting. The tendency of time to wipe away the ethical or moral implications of a person's action. Just look at the result. It's so Machiavellian, isn't it? Time is the most Machiavellian thing. Let's take a beer break. Can we take a second? Good idea. I'll go get us more beer. Yeah, that's wild that history wipes out, history wipes out the ethics of a thing. Well, any sort of distance, right? And time is one way to make something distant. But another way to make something distant is to just control information about it. Like today I was reading this thing about how highly controlled the United States food production system is. You can't go to a slaughterhouse. You can't go to a place where these animals are being raised and destroyed because you can't see. Everyone says you can't. You don't want to see all your sausages, mate. Well, what if you do? You can't. It's illegal. Right. The penalties for these undercover PETA people who go in and film the way animals are treated, they're draconian. They're worse than terrorism. They're considered domestic terrorists. Why? Because they're bringing to light the truth about where that fucking hot dog came from. It's a game changer, man. It's a game changer. It's a shit-disturber. It messes up the... It's like there's a play going on. And it's a play. We're in a play. And the set is the United States of America. And you're supposed to believe it's real. Yes. And there's a script. And the script is the idea that you hear. And you know the script because it's the thing that you'll find people saying. We're defending freedom. We may not be perfect, but it's the best country on earth. That's right. The fucking John Kerry wants to frenchify us. Frenchify me. Please, somebody frenchify me. Have you ever been to France? It's fucking great. It's great. The women are beautiful. The food's fantastic. It's a fucking great country. Yeah, yeah. Free health care. You have a baby. You get like six months off if you're the father. Barbarians. Oh, barbarians. Keep me in my trailer part. Fuck those Frenchies. But you know, I'm sure there's some fucking problems there, too. They have a set that they're into. But the way it works is you get the powers who write the script. Then you get the directors who are the guys who have funny suits on that have guns that will shoot you if you go too far off the script. And the Hollywood executives. The Hollywood, yeah. And then you have backstage. Now backstage is a combination of all the rooms that the people meet in to talk about lobbyists or corporations or paying for the certain laws that are getting passed. Right. But they're also the prison system. Yeah. So that's backstage. So backstage, what you have is cages filled with people who, in varying ways, are like, I'm not going to fucking imbibe. I don't want to read these lines. Right. Or someone who stands up and says, this isn't real. This is just a play. Yeah. Yeah. And they're actors. These are actors. You know those. So the more you start talking, now, in prison, clearly there are, in any society, it's a game that you're playing. And there are certain rules of the game that hopefully correspond to natural law. And then there are certain rules of the game that stop corresponding to natural law and start corresponding to human law. And the human law, and that could be OK, as long as the human law is for truly the benefit of the tribe. The moment the human law that they're applying, whatever it is, is clearly just benefiting one person or two people in the tribe, or the most charismatic or tricky, or have the most, have somehow managed to get people to hold swords to the throats, people aren't playing the game. That's where you get into the arcies, right? The oligarchy and the various weird societies where it's not the people who are the community running the show. It's the community pretending they're running the show. You ever think you were going to end up in prison? Do you think about that sometimes? Sure, I think about it. I think that I ended up in prison. Yes, I thought that. I thought I would end up in prison. I thought that. And then I thought, well, I'd rather be in prison, imprisoned eventually, than walk around in a mental prison where I'm doing, modifying my actions in an unreasonable way based on the fear of being, because I know people where you get around them and you start talking about guns, for example, like owning a weapon, and they'll have you put your phone in another room before they start talking about whether or not they have guns, because they feel like they're being monitored at all times by the NSA, which could very well be true based on everything that's coming out from the Snowden revelations. It could very well be true. But the way I see it is, well, I would rather than NSA hear everything that I'm doing and then arrest me for it as a very, very low level public figure, because at least then my arrest or imprisonment could be used as a political action and maybe could help the world a little bit, a little bit. I'd rather do that than walk around like, shh, don't talk about it, be quiet. It's better to just talk about it. Let them shoot you or arrest you if they're going to shoot you or arrest you. We're going to get... It was last my time anyway, brother! You got it, like... That's true. Now, the reason I ask, my last podcast was with a guy who robbed 14 banks and he also escaped from prison. That was an interesting story. And then he became a yoga teacher while he was in prison and was teaching yoga to the other prisoners. And he spent 24 years, I think. Wow. In Lompoc and serious hardcore places. Wow. Yeah. It was very interesting. He's the second guy I've had on the podcast who did serious 20-plus years in prison. Wow. And interesting to hear. I mean, one thing he said that actually comforted me a little bit. He said, you don't... The Hollywood image of prison, he said orange is the new black, there's some truth to it, a lot of that. But he said that generally the Hollywood image of prison is inaccurate. He said he only heard of one guy who got raped in 24 years. Wow. And that guy was essentially a prostitute who was like, you know, fucking dudes for heroin. And then he like racked up too much of a heroin thing and then, you know, it was like a punishment. And he also said like, you know, fighting and like you get in there and you go up to the biggest dude and punch him in the face. No, no, that's not how it works. Like it's actually kind of, there's kindness there and they're like older dudes who look out for the younger dudes and there's a lot of compassion for guys who are new and are freaking out. And yeah, it's a different image than I had of, you know, the popular image. So if we end up in prison, you know, because I always think I'm gonna end up in prison. Yeah. Well, you're gonna end up, I mean, if you're gonna end up anywhere, it's gonna be in some kind of FEMA camp. It's not gonna be prison and you're probably gonna get executed, but it's not gonna be like a, you know, when the shit shifts and transforms happens real quick. I mean, look at what's happening in Iraq right now. Fuck. Look at that. Holy shit. That's like that. Everything's fine. And then it's like, wait, what? Monday, everything's fine. What? Thursday, half the country's gone. It goes from like everything's, but there's like a little, you know, what would happen would be like in the United States, what would happen would be like a small scale nuclear weapon goes off in a major metropolitan area, martial laws declared. Once martial laws declared, everybody's kind of staying inside. Now the NSA is not only like completely accepted. It's like everybody wants it because they're like, now we understand. Now we get an holy shit. We are so wrong. Is this please monitor, monitor, monitor and get rid of these fucking domestic terrorists. Because guess what? They found some goddamn collusion between some ex Afghani Afghani US Marines and Al Qaeda. Or ISIS and Iraq who actually help them get the weapons in this is the storyline of course. So now it's like we've got to look out for these domestic terrorists because they are somehow colluding with terrorists overseas. And next thing you know, it's like there's a new ministry just like what they did to the jet. Remember when they put the Japanese in internment camps? Well, it's not the Japanese. It's people who believe that guns should be owned by people as a pro drug people. It's a libertarians. The idea is you're just hanging out in your house and post whatever they're going to call it, whatever date it was on or whenever it happened and the dead nation went off. You're in post that America and you get a knock at your fucking door. Probably a letter actually. You probably get a letter. It's like, hey, show up to the courthouse at this time. We just need to talk to you about some things that we've heard. And then suddenly you're arrested. And then the next thing you know, everyone's like, what the fuck in it? Have you seen Chris? Yeah. They picked him up. That's what happened in Germany, right? With the Jews. They got a letter. They like go come down here. You know, you have to sign these things. And then I know we just have to, you're going to be transported to this place. Everything will be fine. Yeah. Yeah. There you go. And then whoops, quick. It happens quick. And just like you're saying, a hundred years from now, everybody looks back and they think about that time in New America when they had to go through and find all those people who were upsetting the status quo. And that's the Alex Jones paranoid theory of the possibility that things can change. And if you look at history, you will find that these changes happen so fast. Look at fucking Iran. And they're so, they're so, we're so good as a species at coming up with justifications. Like, you know about manifest destiny? Yeah. I mean, Jesus Christ. Yeah. Sorry. We have to wipe out everyone on this fucking continent. Why? Because it's God's will. Yeah. And then he obviously intends for us to take over the continent. Yeah. That's hilarious, man. That reminds me of this thing I was thinking today. Eating some weed, thinking about what if instead of religion happening, people like decided that instead of praying to God, things would get better. But if you fucked a pig, things would get better. You know, like somehow that happened. Like that was the root of all the world religions, which is people like, you know, like there's some, there's a village somewhere and there's a drought or something, like a drought. And someone happened to pick, fuck a pig. He's fucking a pig. Yeah. And everyone's laughing at him. People are watching him. Oh, and then immediately he starts raining and he's like, see? See? Yeah. See? You fuck the pig and the rain comes. And then they're like, were you doing anything else besides fucking the pig? No. No. I fucked the pig and the rain came. Because he was focused. I mean, if you're fucking a pig, what else are you going to be doing? You're not checking your emails. Yeah, it's the email. Wow, fucking. I mean, if you've ever tried to fuck a pig, it takes both hands. I'm telling you. I mean, that's what I've heard anyway. I get in enough trouble for fucking cats. I don't need to be fucking pigs now. And then, so then this village starts fucking a pig. Like the village starts. The same pig? Yeah. You think they'd get other pigs? I think they'd start off fucking other pigs. Yeah. Ritual, it'd be a kind of like what? It's a polyamorous pig situation. Polyamorous, yeah, fucking pigs. And then I think that like, you know, someone from another village and everyone would come to trade and see like, oh my God, they're all fucking pigs. Why are you guys fucking pigs? And they'd be like, uh, did you notice the rain last week? Hello. That's because we were fucking these pigs. And then it spreads to that village and that village starts fucking the pigs. Then the next thing you know, you've got like seven villages all fucking pigs, right? Yeah. But the rain doesn't come. The rain doesn't come and they go back to the original pigs. Exactly. The original pig sucker is like, listen, you didn't do it in the exact right way. I was wearing a cape when I was fucking the pig. Coconut helmet. That's the outfit. Face to the southwest. That's it. And now all of a sudden they start doing that. Maybe the rain comes, maybe it doesn't, but other villages are like, you guys are disgusting to fuck pigs and it doesn't affect the rain. And they're like, really? Well, we're going to fucking kill you. And then they invade the other villages and they make it, they start enforcing the pig fucking policy. And the next thing you know, you've got an entire new religion based on people fucking pigs. Right. And also the other people who haven't been conquered will start fucking pigs because they'll say like, wow, that society is like kicking ass. What are they doing? Oh, well they've got this special thing where they fuck pigs and the God smile upon them. And no God. So we better fuck pigs too. There's no God. It's just the energy of fucking that pig. Oh, there's no God? In my mind, there's no God. This is an atheist religion yet somehow from the fucking pig is the magic act that creates positive change in a person's life. Then you get like, then you get to watch the evolution of it, you know? So it's like you've got like the version of it that would pig fucking it would be Judaism, you know, which is a kind of like we only fuck the pig on Sunday. Right. Well fuck it, but we won't eat it. We only, or we only fuck the pig. Which reminds me of your joke, which I don't know. What you said, if you find some intruder in your house, you can kill him. Don't give it away. But, but, but you said why? But it's like a temple. Judaism would be we only fuck the pig on Sundays in the temple. We do it. But then Christianity would be like someone coming around being like, no, you can fuck the pig in your own house. We fuck sheep. We have a personal relationship with the pig. Hinduism would be we can fuck any animal you want because they have all these different gods. So they're like, yeah, you guys are nuts. We can, we fuck. It's just, it's up to you pick the animal that's the best thing to fuck. Buddhism would be like, you can, I get, I mean, like you can, you can fuck the pig, but you're still going to be miserable. And then. You could fuck the pig or not. It doesn't really. It doesn't matter because what, because you know, you can't fuck the pig forever. Maybe that's what they say. Like you're going to. I'm so glad I got a PhD so I could do this. Have these conversations with esteemed intellectuals. And then like the animus, the hunter gatherers would be, you'd have to fuck wild animals. You have to catch like fuck a bear or something. You know, yeah. That's hardcore. And then like is. Bears give each other below jobs. Didn't know that. Oh yeah. Just in the news last week. Male bears. I mean, in captivity. So who knows? Maybe they're, you know, sell, sellmates, but they were, they gave each other. They weren't talking about Harry gay guys. They were. I don't know. They did the research at a bear bar. Isn't that like where bears catch salmon? Like a sandbar. Did I ever tell you I went to a bear bar with Dan Savage and Andrew Sullivan. Bears are awesome. It was wonderful. They're really friendly guys. Yeah. Yeah. And I was standing. I was actually, we all went to the bathroom together and we were standing there pissing. I'm pissing between Andrew Sullivan and Dan Savage at urinals. The two, probably the two most famous gay men in America. Yeah. And I said, man, you know, what a lost opportunity. Here I am standing between you two guys. We've all got our dicks in our hands and I'm fucking heterosexual. What a waste. I never stopped anybody. From doing what? From what? What are you talking about? Giving him a hand job or something? No, no, just like, you know, how many gay guys would like, oh my God. I was like, you know, in the bathroom between Dan Savage and Andrew Sullivan. You can enjoy a cock and be straight. Come on. Where are we existing these days? Really? You don't think so? Well, enjoy it in what sense? In whatever way you want to. If you're enjoying something, you're enjoying it. Really? So you could like, you know, be asked by a dude and not be gay. I mean, I know you could, but could you want to? You know, I think that it's what Isaac Asimov. I think it's Isaac Asimov. What a segue. It's not a segue. Isaac Asimov was talking about in the future, there's no more gender based sexual proclivities. There's just fetishes. And I think that's a much more evolved way of looking at it, which is that, you know, look, let's face it, man. There's a pretty large portion of the population that has discovered a truth that a lot of people don't like for some reason. And that truth is, it feels good to have things shoved into your asshole. I don't think that's a, I don't think you can even argue about that anymore. No, I don't know about shoved, maybe slid gently. Look, you're a romantic. But the point is, the point. After and fine dinner. Yeah, you're a romantic. You're a romantic lass. But the point is, like, the prostate is a sexually charged organ, and it feels good to have things put inside of it, which is why. I think Louis CK has this excellent joke, and he's done it on his specials. So we can say it. But he has this excellent joke where he's talking to the audience about giving a blow job and pointing out that more than half the audience enjoys giving blow jobs, or gives blow jobs sexually. And, you know, he's the men or the small percentage of people who don't do that. So there must be something great behind it. That's a really smart way, and that's a very heterosexual human pointing out these obvious truths. It's like, come on, man, it probably feels good. I've often thought that. I mean, you know, I've often thought that if I were gay or bi or whatever, I would give amazing blow jobs. Sure. And, I mean, I honestly, this will sound like bullshit, but I honestly wish I were gay or bi, because I imagine men give really good blow jobs, because they know how. This is what I see the future. I see two generations from now, dinner table conversation. If I have kids and those kids have kids, I see myself as an old man, probably around 120 years old, based on what's happening. Life extension technology. Yeah, maybe not. But also, maybe just from riding my bike, I'm healthy. I was to be 120. I pictured myself sitting at the table. My grandchild was just turned 14, and he looks across at me and he's like, granddaddy, did you ever give a blow job doing man? And I go, no, I'm straight. And he goes, I didn't know granddaddy was a bigot. In the same way that when you're around a really old, old man who was around during racial times, they're racist still. Can I tell you a story? Yeah, please. I think that's already here. You're already a granddaddy. Yes. Seriously, check this out. I told you I did this porn movie, right? I had three scenes with India Summer where I played myself. The story is, it's a really interesting film. It's sort of like bridging mainstream cinema and erotic cinema. That's what he's trying to do with it. So she's in a relationship. She's having issues. She's a documentary filmmaker, so she decides to interview some people who've written books or thought about relationships and where it's going, and what's changing, and all that. So she does these interviews with people like me and Cassie and Reed Mehalco and Carol Queen and other people who have some sort of public prominence in this area. And I play myself, but I'm being interviewed for a documentary by this woman. And anyway, very interesting. One of the scenes when the director sent me the screenplay, he's a friend of mine and he asked me for comments, there's a scene where there's a three-way going on, two guys and a woman, and I think they're in a shower or something, and the dudes start touching each other and it ends up being like they're both fucking her, but then they fuck each other as well, right? And I said to him, dude, I don't know about that. I mean, that's, you know, like people are into seeing women with women and men with women, but men with men, that's gay porn. That's a different genre, you know, that I think you'll lose a lot of audience with that. And, you know, like I personally, it would make me uncomfortable, whatever, and I don't know if you're... And he said, Chris, listen, man, young people, they're not making those distinctions like you and me. Yeah, okay, that's the thing, but guys in their 20s, situational homosexuality is completely accepted. You know, no, obviously not by everybody, but far more than when you and I were in our 20s. Yeah, because we're burdened by this massive conditioning that makes it so it's like, you have to react, you've been taught to react to homosexuality. If you were, I don't know, if you were born before 90s, I don't know when things started loosening up on gay people. Hey, largely due to Dan Savage, I have to say. I'm sure. People give him a shit, but I think that dude is a historical figure. Yeah, he's like, he like, people like him probably also like, think about like Harvey Fierstein, like people like that, people who like... Billy Crystal's character on, what was it called, that family? Do you remember that? Maybe this is even before your time. Billy Crystal's first character on a major TV series. He was really young. He played a gay guy. What was the name of that politician you got shot in San Francisco? Harvey Milk. Harvey Milk, too. Yeah, it was about the same time. Yeah, those people, you know, these are people who are like Gandhi, but won't get recognized as Gandhi for another, you know, probably another generation, but like same level of heroism. I think so. And alleviating a kind of like hellish existence for a group of people who just want to be, what's the same thing as a smoking weed or whatever it is, man. It's like, you get to do what you want to do with your body and the whole shit, but we still have built into us this thing where it's like, you know, I don't want... Like, you know, remember when Brokeback Mountain came out? Yeah. And it's like, that came out and everybody's like, oh, the horror, that ain't gonna matter, I guess. The horror, that these two men were... It was like horrifying to like, you had to say that if you're a gay, or if you're a guy. You're a guy, not a gay. You're gay, you said the opposite. Yeah. But if you're a guy, you couldn't be like, I don't know, it didn't really bother me, man. I don't know. You couldn't even say that. You had to have... You were expected to have at least some... You were hanging out with, like, much of dudes. I was praying and I was like, you know, who knows. But the point is, people are still petrified and terrified of it. Yeah. And depending on what generation you come from, it's like the conditioning is really intense. So what your friend is saying makes absolute sense, which is that the conditioning is loosening to the point where in another generation, it won't exist at all. Maybe. Among many people. I mean, of course, these things take so much time to start. Bigots will be more ostracized. Because they are now, right? In college, in American campuses, if you think gay people are creepy and weird, you're the weird dude. Yeah. You are a weird dude. Mainstream is like, yeah, they're gay. You're a bigot. Yeah. Like, you're the worst kind of person. Right. Like, you are the worst kind of person. Romney. Any more men who believes that gay marriage is wrong. Anyone who believes that it's wrong for gay guys or gay gals to get married. Gay gals. Gay gals. I know you're not speaking. I like to say gals. I love it. I think it's great. But that's, you ever, like, that is a, that is a, that, the human who, like, says those things, that human, they're, it's like, look at it this way. It's a million times creepier to me to believe that you're the servant of an invisible homophobic god and to repress humans on this planet who have this minimal amount of time to enjoy their bodies before they vanish into oblivion. And love. Yeah. Their bodies just like, to have, like, the right to visit your partner in the hospital. That's why we disagree. I don't think gay people feel love. Just kidding. Love for the cock. It's just cock love. Yeah. No, if they felt love, that would be different. Yeah. I think a pig feels love. Yeah. Yeah. When you're fucking it for the rain. Exactly. This is for the rain, you fucking pig. No, I think it makes, I think, I might, I'd much rather be around a guy who fucks pigs and make it rain than a guy who worships an invisible homophobic god and represses humans on this planet who keeps them from loving them. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They do many things themselves, they even get raise arms and I'm like, oh, man. Their life sucks. Like, yeah, I were watching it for a month, but, you know, I don't think even that scene became the same. Yeah. This was really awesome. I was almost driving there and it was at about six years or so, about eight years old. Like, that's the idea. That's, and- Carl Rowe. That's what I'm saying about Carl Rowe. I think that's a very- What do you deal with your issue, though? I like to pretend that the reason these bigots are bigots is because there's a, because it gives you this idea that they have this, like, kind of, like, chance for sexual redemption. You get this glorious idea in your mind that all Carl Rowe, people like Carl Rowe are like one positive gay experience away from transforming into these beautiful people. Yeah, you get to believe that, but it's like, I don't think that, I don't know if that's true, man. I don't think it's as simple as the fact that somebody is a repressed homosexual and is like, I'm just gonna stay in the closet because I, and while I'm in here, I'm gonna, it's like Sol Tarsus, stoning Christians. But you know about that gay escort who was, got the White House pass and spent nights in the White House and nobody's ever explained what he was doing there? You know what I'm talking about? Yeah, but maybe it's like just, here's a real fun idea. Maybe people just like to feel good and they're part of their brains understand that the gender of lips that happened to land on your penis in an ethical, subjective, moral, gender vacuum are irrelevant. Well, I just interviewed Stanley, who I hope you meet someday, he's 81, so, you know, get on the stick. I just interviewed him last week and we talked about his sexuality and he was married to a woman for 50 years or something, but now like he's, all his lovers are men and a lot of his lovers over the years have been men and I said to him, like, did you ever come out of the closet? Were you ever in a closet? And he said, no, I just never thought of it in those terms. Like I'm attracted to some people, I'm not attracted to other people and you know, a lot of them have been men because men are easier to deal with than women. Right. Women are so complicated, but he really doesn't give a damn. My problem is an aesthetic problem. It's like guys seem so fucking bristly and like greasy and like just generally like, I don't know, it's like women are so beautiful, they're so soft and they're so, there's something about them that just seem like, it's like. So what about a trans, transsexual? Have you been to Thailand? Never been. Man, there are some, Cassie and I, last time we were in Thailand, we sat outside of this area of it's like a famous place with Nana Plaza, it's called, and we're sitting in a bar there just watching people go by and you see all these couples with like an older white European or American guy with a, you know, young hot Thai woman. And a lot of times those Thai women are dudes, physically dudes. Oh really? Lady boys, yeah or whatever. I'm sorry, I said the word lady boy and I got a bunch of shit in your heart. You don't mean, it's not coming from a poisonous pit in your heart? No, I, I, I totally respect it. It doesn't matter what you fucking say you're not like, you're not a bigot, so you're not a, I mean whatever, I mean whatever the fuck I want. Fuck you. Fucking language. Motherfucker, motherfucker in tits. Yeah. Yeah. So anyway, so I mean, they're beautiful, they're so beautiful and Cassie was like, eventually Cassie said, look, the only way I can tell the difference is that they're too beautiful to be women. Well, I mean, look at like, look at, see, this is the symbol of the new Aeon, which is like, this is the symbol of the new Baphomet, this is the symbol of the hermaphrodite, which is a, a man and a woman who represents the mystical connection between the final balancing out of these two, like it's almost like the universe is like, it created men, it created women, we emerge to represent these two energetic forms, and then it's almost like that, the physical merging of these two forms somehow represents like ultimate peace or ultimate balance, not just a society that worships the goddess, not just a society that worships the male dominator God, but somehow merging these two together into a society where both sides are balanced. Is it possible? Probably not. If you need to go to Thailand and make love to a beautiful hermaphrodite, I don't know what the word is, it is not offensive to some, they're probably, the funny thing is, there's no way to refer to that being without offending somebody. There's no language, right language for it, someone's going to be like, that's rocked. Did you hear what happened to Dan Savage a couple of weeks ago? So is it University of Chicago doing this thing? And it's a private thing where like a public figure comes and speaks to, you know, 50 people and it's closed, no media, you're, everybody agrees not to talk about it publicly, right? So there's a student there, Dan's talking about the word tranny and how he stopped using the word tranny in his column and his podcast because people were offended by it, but he said, look, you know, I remember when tranny was what, you know, people who were transvestites or transsexuals called themselves, you know, they're trannies and it was a word that was not derogatory in any way. And then, you know, it became this political football and now people are saying you can't use it and okay, I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings, but you know, it's weird the way words like move from fine to not fine and then back sometimes and all this stuff. Faggot is another example and when he started writing his column, every letter started, hey, faggot, you know, it was a joke and, and gay people would call each other faggot and it was like no problems, like black people calling each other nigger, no problem. And so the, so he was making this point and a student stood up and said, you know, I am a transsexual and I prefer to be referred to as it, not he or she. And I think that this word is offensive and I, I am offended that you're using it here today and you shouldn't be doing it. And it turned into this big thing and the student ended up like leaving crying and then started a petition to like censor Dan Savage and it turned into this big fucking deal. It's so funny that you can't even refer to it. As you said, there's no word to refer to the thing you're, and this guy wants to, or this person wants to be referred to as it. It's weird that it understood that it's a monster because like all monsters get referred to as it. And I don't mean a monster because of whatever its gender happens to be, but a monster because it wants to apply the same rules of oppression to language that had been applied to somebody who wants to express themselves through their gender. So you end up in the exact same boat. It's like, all right, now you're a different type of bigot because you're a language bigot. You're not a gender bigot, but it's the same fucking thing. Back off, Jack. Dan Savage, and I'll tell you this, you can take a homophobe and an evil person who wants to control people's sexuality and make people feel guilty for what is more than likely a genetically based proclivity towards a certain gender, and if it's not genetically based, who cares? The point is, you can take a person who's against that and you can tell them whatever the most up-to-date politically correct words are to use in reference to these people and when it comes out of their mouths, it's going to sound like venom because it is what's behind it. It's intention. And anyone who can attack Dan Savage, it's like someone attacking Gandhi for not being Indian enough. Like, well, you lived in South Africa, you're not one of us. Fuck you, man. As our Lord Jesus Christ said, young out with a lot of guys, a house divided upon itself cannot stand. And in that way, it's like, figure out what the fuck is going on here, man. We're all people. So what's the problem with fucking people on the left? People on the left, and I consider myself one, if we're going to use that left-right dichotomy, progressive, whatever, open mind, blah, blah, blah, they're the scolds. Why are we scolding? Hey, every time somebody sends me a fucking email, I'm so disappointed that the words disappointed and inappropriate just make me want to fucking blow up. Here's what it is, man. They haven't come to the bigger truth. And the bigger truth is, or the way I see it is, one consciousness expressing itself through multiple beings of various genders and sexual proclivities. One consciousness, man. Understand that. Go back to that. And then understand the ultimate connective tissue is love. It's the force of love. That's what we're all going for here, man. We want to figure out a way to make it so that people can love each other freely. That's it. It's a very simple, very, very Christian. It should be the essence of all religions. Well, and probably Jesus would agree with you, right? Let me, can I read something to you? Do you mind if I read something? Are we going to have another beer? Yeah, we're going to have another beer. I'm going to cut. We have actually, well, we'll cut. So with all this sex talk, gender talk, I want to read this thing out of Ron Regi's book, who's this amazing artist who is on my podcast. This is from the Cartoon Utopia, and it's called Affection Alchemy. And what he does is he takes Western esotericism, Western mystics, and he like sort of, he like writes out what they say, and then he draws these incredible images of around it. So, because you know, regardless of the gender of the person that you're having sex with, that's not what matters. There's a much deeper thing going on, and it transforms society, and this is an incredible summation of that. This is by PB Randolph in Ron Regi's awesome graphic novel. Okay. What are you thinking about during intimacy, and how does it affect you? Both partners must have an equal and balanced mindset and involvement in the act of bringing the source of love into the body through mutual concentrated intention on love. The power of creation is broken out of your body and brought into your conscious awareness. Our principal life is the life of imagination, and through love we can realize all there is. The hermetic marriage, the goal of alchemy is to bring the two sides together again, soul and spirit, heart and mind, beauty and strength, intuition and reason, the sun and the moon, yin and yang, we all have both sides within us. The mysterious conjunction, the reunification and abolition of the opposites, the higher nature is brought down to the body, the lower nature is brought up to the head, as above so below. Every relationship outside ourselves recreates it. The creation myth, the primeval soul that contains all souls is split into two polarities. Love is the recognition of identical harmonic states, the electromagnetic forces of your heart and mind and even the vibrations of the atoms within you enter into an exchange. Complete the circuit, combine the positive and negative, a measurable electromagnetic force lies behind all observable phenomena. The creative power of the entire universe is present during sexual union, yet it can only be accessed through love. An enormous power of attraction is generated through this creative moment. The consequence of accessing this power without love can be seen everywhere in the problems of the world today. Human history is full of abuse of this power of attraction for personal gain. A union without love is mutually exhausting, it drains all power and creates nothing. Without balance and mutual cooperation, without love, the obtaining of this power is a terrible delusion. It will bring ruin to all who practice it as a means of obtaining power. Whatever you imagine with persist, it will bring ruin to all who practice it as a means of obtaining power. And then look at this awesome drawing you did of people fucking you don't love each other, that kind of anger fuck, it's a really great panel. Look at that right there. I've been that guy so many times where you just don't feel it and you're just like doing this weird sweaty workout thing. Yeah, yeah, you know, I don't know. I mean, I think casual sex, now the key for me there is he said it will bring ruin to people who do this as a way of seeking power. Yes. But if you're doing it not as a way of seeking power, then I don't think there's any problem. Absolutely, no, no, no. Two friends fucking and they're just friends and they just feel like fucking like I'm a four. But you love your friends. Well, even if it's a stranger, what if it's a one night stand? And what you're saying you can't love strangers, it's that moment. Yeah, you can't love someone you don't know. Sure you can. It's that moment when you're objectifying a person, using them, tricking them. Oh, yeah, if it's ugly, it's ugly. There's no doubt about that. That's what he's talking about. He's saying that here is this incredible thing that transcends gender and in the conversation about it's and hers and he's and hers with hers or he's with these or he's with it's or hers with it's or hers and hers with an it or it and her or the he whatever it is, you lose the actual thing that's going on and all this chatter about these pairings of various genitals with each other, you're missing to me what's the bigger picture, which is that in the state of sexual union, there is a point of access that can happen if you have the slightest intention of love behind it. You can come in contact with some of the most powerful forces in the universe that can transform your life for the positive and make you a much happier, healthier person. You know, I was watching the World Cup today. I don't know when you're going to release this, but the World Cup's going on as we record this and somebody scored a goal and it was the typical thing, you know, the guy scores the goal, he runs, he falls on the ground, all his teammates come and they pile on him like a bunch of puppies and they're all like squeezing and hugging and you know, and I thought I've never felt that love in my whole life. I've never felt that love and how many of us have how many have you ever had like, you know, 10 guys who you know really well and who you've like shared all the struggle with and you know, all these training and working out and wins and losses and you score a goal for them, you know, for the team, for those guys and they all hug you and love you and it's a feeling so few of us have ever had and I related that to an interview I heard recently with the guy who wrote The Perfect Storm, Sebastian Junger. He was actually, it was a TED Talk, I think, Google TED Talk, Sebastian Junger, Y-U-N-G-E-R and you'll see it, he's talking about how he was embedded, he wrote war too, he wrote war and he did a documentary called Corungal, you know, yeah, no, no, his friend died, Tim something died in Libya, yeah, right, and he did a piece about that, but anyway, he was talking about, you know, these guys who were in this horrible situation, they're in firefights every day, they're getting shot at from every direction, it's just this horrible fucking situation and they stick it out, they're out there for like six months or a year or whatever and, you know, he said, and then they come back to America, the ones who survive and they're fucked because the thing that's missing is love, right, here it's like you got your car, you got your house, you go to the store, you come home, you know, nobody, there's nobody, like maybe your wife loves you, maybe your kids love you, but they don't really know you, they haven't been through that shit. And this is the famine of the West, man, and this is the famine that we're, that is raging in the world, in our world right now, it's a famine of love. Yeah, it's a huge famine, I often feel like we live in a society that has told us that every natural source of vitamin C is a sin, right, citrus fruits are, they'll rot your soul, they'll make your, the hair grow out of your palms, you know, and all this stuff, you can't do it, and then they sell you these, these shitty little vitamin C pills that just barely keep you alive, and we're all on the edge of scurvy. So when we go to, you know, we get a massage and someone's touching us with care, what happens? You want to like touch them back, you want to, you know, and there are all these stories of like dudes get a massage, you start groping them, masseuse, and you know, or like a lot of hookers, prostitutes will say, half the guys who come, they're not even into the sex, they just want to be able to lie in bed and be touched and not have to lie about who they are. That's so, man, this is, that's where we are. Come on, you gotta lighten up guys, stop fucking, this is what I'm saying, you know, you curl up like a little goddamn roly-poly, the next thing you know, you're treating everybody around you like they're a stick trying to hurt you, just open up for a second, if you can, it's, it's like you want to do something revolutionary. But it's so hard, dude, it's like, it's like what we're talking about, you know, cultural and training, right? I mean, I've got a little sympathy for that. I'm heterosexual, I have no doubt that that's cultural training. Yeah, right? I, as my loved gay guy, I have had friends who are gay, who I literally loved more than any other friend I've had, and, and they definitely wanted to, you know, have a physical thing with me, I couldn't do it, I just, I couldn't do it. Yeah. I mean, eating dogs, right? Why? Why not eat dogs? I've been there, man, but, and that's not something I'm necessarily proud of, that's just something I see as a kind of like, well, I guess in this incarnation, that's the force field I'm up against, and it's not something I really want to like, I'm not going to spend a lot of time like, trying to overcome. You're talking about eating dogs or what? Yeah, I've been with like 500 guys, but I just can't eat a dog. By the way, I'm going to tell you something, man, there's some, it's a way more fucked up in my mind, eat a dog, but it is to have sex with somebody of the same gender, but, but. No, of course. Now, you see my point, though, it's about cultural indoctrination. Yes, and, and, and, and, and I think we're both hitting on the, on the same sad, tragic aspect of modern society, which is here we have this technology that is so connected, that is bringing us together in such an incredible way, but one thing that we haven't been able to overcome yet is the personal firewall that exists in each of our hearts that keeps us from opening the love and just letting love exist in our lives without shutting down. And so many people in the same way when people are afraid of death, they, instead of talking about their fear of death, they talk about their fear of heights, they talk about their fear of. Negroes. Yeah, yes, gay people riding a bike. I don't know how many people, when I've been saying I'm addicted to riding bikes, so I would, it's so dangerous to ride a bike. It's like you're afraid of death. The number one thing that's killing people is not bikes, it's heart disease, it's couches, that's the real deadly mother fucker. So it's like the, the, the, in the same way that people are attached to their fear of death to smaller things and the same way people have attached their fear of love to the activity of objectifying people they're having sex with. Oh man, I fucked this hot bitch last night. It was so fucking hot. They have these kind of like prophylactic experiences with people that instead of a condom, even though they're probably wearing a condom, they're wearing this thick rubbery sheath that they call their ego and personality, you know? Wow, that's an interesting heart condom. You got a bear back with your heart. And then, and in the same way like when people are wearing a condom and they're afraid of AIDS, people are wearing this ego because they're afraid of heartbreak and it's like, or HIV rather, but the point is it's like pull off the fucking sheath, man. Feel it. Yes, feel it. That's intense, man. I never thought of that, a heart condom. That's a hell of a condom. It's a heart condom and like how many times have you been having sex with someone and you're so terrified and you're so, and you've, you know, I've thought back like I feel so lucky to have run into these Rondos people and like Jack Hornfield and gotten to interact with them because they push me out of a really dark place. But I can think of times having sex with people when I was younger and I'm not there at all. I'm just a fucking mannequin. I'm not there and not only am I not there but I'm pretending that the person I'm with isn't a person. It's an object, you know? I'm having sex with somebody. I like them but like I'm not acknowledging the fact that this is a being just like me who's experienced so much pain in their life just like me, is lonely just like me, wants to be loved just like me and because of that we're, and they're doing probably the same thing to me in some way and now we're pretending. Now we're just pretending and it's sad because in that moment of connectivity and intimacy when you have become literally it's as close as you can get to a person, as close as you can get. You're not there at all. Come on, it's sad. It's like being in fucking Hawaii and when the sunset's happening you put on blindfolds. You get this wonderful sunset, you're in Hawaii, look it in the fucking face, feel it. Yeah and people say no, I don't want to see it because it's gonna end and I won't be here forever. Yeah well you know love, I mean I think about this sometimes. I'm a coward on certain levels like one of the reasons I never had kids was I was afraid of being that vulnerable. Yeah you know of like well what if the kid is born fucked up? What if the kid's an asshole? What if the kid gets hurt? What if the kid dies? What if the kid you know like there's I mean there are other reasons, there are more practical reasons and honestly kids didn't fit into the sort of life I wanted to live but you know there was also an essential cowardice of like no, I want to be able to die. I want to be able to have shit hit the fan without worrying about anyone else. You know if I have a motorcycle accident I want to be able to have a fucking motorcycle accident without like oh I'm going to leave kids with no father or I'm going to leave you know. And even in my marriage or you know partnership with women I've also felt like and I think this is partly because when I was a kid I moved a lot so I and my family moved like every two or three years. Okay so I think you develop a fear of connecting because like the more I connect the more it's going to hurt when we move again. Ah genius and not only that but don't forget about you also get the glory of being new to a school like when you're in a new place you also get this extra attention and there's like some weird positive side effect ever too. You get both so yeah you're right man it's uh it's all it's like it's just like all an issue all of us are fighting desperately against love. We think it's the opposite you know but we think that the thing we're fighting against is darkness or suffering or evil but really what we're fighting against most of us is love. But it's because of the suffering right it's because love doesn't come without suffering. Well yeah and it's also because of the the the dissolution of the ego that comes once you've like become gone from being a one two or two and gone from being a two to a three. A I to a we yeah. Yeah the moment that happens you've dissolved into a bigger hole right you know and this is the thing I remember watching this amazing documentary oh god I wish I could remember the name of this documentary. They showed it at my liberal arts college it was the difference between the way indigenous people raise children. Oh the continuum concept probably. Is that what it's called? Well there's the great book which was a classic and I wouldn't be surprised if there was a documentary made about it called the continuum concept. It's by a woman who through happenstance ended up living with this stony tribe in Venezuela and it was all about how they raised their children and their constant physical contact with the kids. Well it was like that and it was showing like here yeah that must be it man because it's showing like here's how we do it in the west. Put them in a room let them scream don't touch it. Right. And then it was showing this tribe I don't know what tribe the baby is born they stand around the baby the entire tribe stands around the baby and they chant to the baby and what they're saying to the baby is something along the lines of you are with us now you are with us now you've come from a they say something like you've come from whatever now you are with us. We're your people. Yes and then the other thing they did which I thought was really cool is they sit with a baby in a hut for 24 hours to let the baby die if the baby wants to go back into the nothingness it's like a weird accident. I just thought to me though the beautiful thing about it was it's a we and it's not a we like the family it's a we like all of us welcome to the club. Well that's what I was saying about the football about about you know there's a sense of like you are us we are together and that and the only place we get that is sports and war right we're also we're going to get that. Oh it's so sad. It is. God damn it. It is it's terrible we're we're we're yearning for I mean you and I are good friends yeah but you know we haven't been through anything together near deaf experience unless it's like you know worrying that Joe might get pissed off and kill us but there's no like I mean you know what I mean there's nothing in our in our lives there's there's nothing that deep but the fires don't have to be grow that hot for it's just like really what it is is that people are selfish they don't want to give up themselves they want to be shielded from the world they don't want to merge into the whole they don't want to be part of a real community. Okay but you're blaming it on people I blame it on structural issues you know in Spanish the word insulation to insulate is the same word to isolate wow wow right and that's sort of the key of this book I'm working on now it's like yeah we try to insulate ourselves from dangers and fears and yeah you know all these things and what do we end up doing we end up being isolated that there's no meaning we're we're empty and lonely and lost of course we are because we've cut ourselves off from everything that could potentially mean something to us because it's dangerous like love right like what you're saying about love you know love hunting I mean all these things brother sister the community doing community activities getting into the into the challenges having a baby having a family giving up your identity letting yourself merge into the whole throwing yourself into the void with the intention of like dissolving someone it's like those guys who buy surf like Peter Gabriel jumps off the stage and the people yeah there's this faith there you know or baby eagles are in a nest way the fuck up in some cliff and at some point they're like okay I'm going and they jump but you gotta believe you know you gotta believe or it never happens you just die in your nest and so many people die in their nests have you ever seen that documentary about I'm not gonna end I don't want to end but I'm not actually but it's stupid I was just about to end it I'm like talking about the most more rushed documentary I know well there's a documentary you reminded me of called babies have you seen that yeah oh that's a great one that that's a recent it I'm sure it's not the one you're referring to um I think it won an Oscar actually it's there's no words there's no narrative there's no nothing right it's four babies there's one American born to like a progressive couple in San Francisco there's one Japanese I think yeah there's one in like Mongolia and one is gay no and one's like uh in some hunter gatherer tribe in Africa and it's just these four babies and their experiences and they cut between they're back and you see the the African babies like rolling around in the dirt he's licking the the tongue of a dog he's like in it he's happy he's fat he's funny and all these adults you're referring to all these different adults like pick him up and talk to him he's got like 20 parents you know and then you look at this American baby in this little like high tech carriage thing yeah you know protected from too much UV radiation and the the thing protected from mosquitoes and oh don't touch that oh and it's so protected and fucking screaming and miserable and sickly looking and man there we go right there there you go man that's it some of the hunter gatherer babies die right they die the weak ones die as you're saying there's a ritual in fact a lot of hunter gatherer people don't believe that babies are people until they can talk wow so this first couple of years when a lot of them die they weren't people anyway so that mitigates the pain it's a great defense mechanism against the harsh environment that many of those people are existing in but well harsh environment yeah there's different kinds of harsh well that's what you're saying man it's like do you want to live an entire lifetime without feeling love or would you like to have a few years existing completely embraced by this family with the risk that you might die yeah you're gonna die anyway you pick yeah what do you want you want to be in a fucking spacesuit and a planet that you don't need a spacesuit for right it's like one of the saddest things ever it's like we've got these fucking side of space you did it again a space suit on a planet you don't need a space suit for fuck that's such a great image and so many people do that man because we're terrified of love but god damn it let the snake bite you motherfuckers let it bite you i just saw this documentary on these two sigmes twins these poor guys they were connected by this one have you heard of them these two asian sigmes twins connected by this flap of skin and they couldn't get it surgically removed because at the time the doctors didn't have x-ray equipment they're like it could kill you if we do it so only married two women two twins yeah yeah and at the end of their their lives one of them dies and the other one dies within four hours they do an autopsy and they sever the skin it's just scar tissue with one vein they could have cut themselves free at any time during their entire lives but they were so afraid of dying that rather than die they live their entire lives connected to another being who for a big portion of their lives they weren't very happy with they were afraid to cut that fucking flap well in the same way so many people are afraid to fucking slice this one little protective sheath they got what do you call it the hymen that when you're about to have sex it with a virgin it like that gets separated and it's like painful and causes some sort of membrane yeah it's a membrane that must that has to get separated that's the same so many people have fucked literally thousands of times but they're still virgins because they haven't experienced that incredible intimate connection that happens when you're with someone you're like god damn it i love you i love you like i i don't even know what it is some energy is radiating from both of us at the same time it's way bigger than anything i was aware that even existed that's sex if you ask me i mean i i don't know what to

Hello friends, and thank you for tuning into the Duncan Trussell Family Hour Podcast. It's me, Duncan Trussell reporting into you from Planet Earth, where we are all eternity trapped in ham, trying to understand exactly what we do as we wander around this bend in the space time continuum caused by the giant ball that we're on pressing into the fabric of space and time. I am getting this up on Thursday because on Tuesday, in the midst of doing the intro, I got a call from my mom, who had just gotten back from the doctor because she had started feeling bad. She's, as some of you know, most of you probably know, she's had a late-stage breast cancer for the last four years, and it moved into her bones, and from her bones it moved into her liver. That happened a few months ago, and that has progressed. And basically, the doctor told her that she's got to go wherever she's going to die because, you know, that her time is very, very short, because once it spreads in your liver, at some point your liver is going to hemorrhage, and that will cause you to go into a coma, is what he told her. So she was calling to tell me that, and then that news sort of made me press pause on recording the intro and start figuring out other stuff, which is that I've got to go up there, and probably I'm going to be saying goodbye to her for the last time. I was talking to a friend of mine, a friend of mine called me up, and she was calling because right now she's an actor, and right now it's pilot season in Los Angeles, and so what pilot season is, is where all the actors try to get jobs on the network TV shows, and pilot season is just one of the most, I've talked about it on the podcast before, but just brutality for actors and for people who want to be on TV. It's just, it's this terrible, archaic series of brutal initiations, and it's really rough, and you've got to be, you're in traffic all the time, and it's just brutal. And she was calling to talk to me, and we talked a little bit, and then you know, I told her I've got to go up to my mom's dying, I've got to say goodbye to my mom, and her response was, oh, you know, how am I complaining about this when you, you've got to go say goodbye to your mom who's dying, and just got one of your balls snipped off. And I've been finding a lot of this has been happening where this hierarchy gets created, where people will complain about little things to me, and then the little things that they're complaining about that immediately gets followed by like, how could I even complain? You know, you only have one ball now. What am I complaining about some bad service that I got at a restaurant, or some little problem that happened with my car? But here's the thing, the big problems are less problematic than the little problems. That's the amazing paradox. The big problems give you something to fight. The little problems, the tiny little tragedies, they drive you insane. And this is articulated in a really beautiful way in this poem by Charles Bukowski. It's not the large things that send a man to a madhouse. Death he's ready for, or murder, incest, robbery, fire, flood, no, it's a continuing series of small tragedies that send a man to the madhouse. Not the death of his love, but a shoelace that snaps with no time left. With each broken shoelace out of 100 broken shoelaces, one man, one woman, one thing enters a madhouse. So be careful when you're bend over. So be careful when you bend over, pals. He's absolutely right. And I'm just going to get on with this podcast. I'm heading up to North Carolina soon.

Human beings Johnny, what do you think about these sons of bitches? I don't know. I think I'm one of them. I think we we run the spectrum don't we? Yeah, it's a real mess. From beautiful crimson orange to dark bloody brown. From blue eyes to brown. That's what makes the world go round. I have a little treat here. What do you got? I got some fresh pee pods. God damn boy. Johnny Pemberton you guys. I just picked these from the garden today. This is something that I don't think you those of you who've listened to the podcast and know Johnny and have listened to the other episodes. One thing that you don't realize about Johnny as you listen to him chew one of his wonderful pee pods is he's a child of the earth. You're a child of the earth. You're a teagod. We all are though. See that's what a child of the earth would say. Okay. That's exactly what earth children say as they chew upon their pee pods when someone points out that they're earth children. I had a neighbor growing up in a house when I was like you know 10 year old kid and the lady next door was this really weird lady named Mrs. Gilchrist and her whole front lawn was filled with wildflowers and I was like oh she's like a hippie right. My mom was like no she's an earth mother. She's older than hippies because she was not she was old too old to be a hippie. Yeah your mom's smart. Earth mother. God I'll take a million earth mothers over a hippie any day of the week. Earth mama. She was like really kind of kind of weird kind of you know distant distant. Yeah a little bit a little bit of spacey. Well you know we're that that's the problem is there's not enough earth mothers. There's these I don't know that you know I guess I smoked pot today when I shouldn't have in the morning. First thing. Yeah. In the shower. I wanted to go right. Reading. I just finished this crazy book by Ph.D. Philip K. Dick gave me that anytime I read a Philip K. Dick book I've got a week of being fucked up from reading the book and this one really got me that's such a good feeling too when you read something and it's like it feels like it warps your perspective. Yes. I like that a lot. I haven't had that in a while. I feel like I'm really missing that in books. Philip K. Dick. Yeah I guess sometimes it's like I have to find something a certain way otherwise I don't. You know what I mean you have to like I can have someone recommend something to me but when I find it at the right time then it's like it makes it all the difference as opposed to just reading it. You read a lot. I don't I go I go back and forth. Sometimes I read a ton. Sometimes I won't read anything but magazines. When you read how do you find the time to read. I usually read in bed before bed or I read in transit someplace. That's what I like to travel. If you traveling I feel like that's the only time I can really read. Yeah. I've read Tim O'Brien's The Things They Carried Have You Read That. Nope. It's fucking amazing. It's so well written. It's like you know it's about soldiers in Vietnam but it's not just about that at all. He messes with like time convention and like all these things about what is truth when you're writing. It's so bizarre but he I read that cover to cover on a I bought it in the airport and read it the entire flight and then I got home and I read it finished it in like two hours at home. I was like I've never done that before. Sat down just to read. Yeah. Because I had I didn't have anything bothering me. It was like a very it's easy to read when you're traveling because there's no that's you don't have anyone around you by yourself and you can you have time. You have you're isolated. Well I guess you're not isolated but you have time to read. You know that thing make taking the time to read is exactly the same thing as meditating. Oh yeah. Absolutely. Because when you read like I'm just forcing myself not to read like like a I'm treating myself like an oily kindergartner who just wants to sit in a puddle and not bathe. Yeah. Because it's like there's a from the from going on the Internet too much. Some part of myself has weakened. Oh totally because you want like you want immediate gratification. You want like the thing to be interesting right away. Yes. And that's the thing that kills me. I find that now it's like it's totally killed my ability to read is because if something doesn't happen I'm not getting like OK where's the cool stuff. Where's the where's the thing I want to remember. Where's the highlighting part. And it doesn't happen quick enough. I get like impatient. You have to work with books. Yeah you do. You have to you don't get it right away. Books build but when but when they when they hit when everything starts combining. Oh it's a frothy spray. God damn man. That moment when a book when you when you feel yourself finally connecting with the story of the book and seeing where it's going. That's magic. Yeah. And it's and it's a reading is more important than your career. Right. Yeah. I think so. Those are different things but I guess you could say that. Yeah. Meditation is more important than your job. But you could also say that those things will you know they go back into it. So if you're reading helps your career. Oh yeah. It'll help you. It'll help everything. More than anything really. This is what people don't understand is the the flurry that everyone's gotten into at this point. I mean people are in a flurry. A flurry they're just they're running around. They're going around doing crazy shit everywhere that accomplishes nothing when if you it's gotten to the point now. Like do yeah doing. They're doing a lot of doing. They're just doing. It's gotta be gotta be doing. It must be doing. If you're not doing. Who are you. What are you. You're not doing. Get out of my town. What do you do. What do you mean. What do I do. That's just a question. Exactly. Yeah. That's the worst question. So what do you do. So what do you do. What do you do. What do you do. I don't know. I don't know what I do. I mean what does a bird do. It's it's yeah. This is this question that what do you do. It's terrible. It's the most the worst thing ever doing is like doing is the everything bad that's ever happened has been because of people doing things. I mean things nothing like almost nothing bad happens from not doing it from inaction. Good God Almighty man these people are cultists like you know everyone rails against the poor Scientologists. They do yeah. But you want to talk about the real cult. It's the doers. It's the doers. It's the well I guess you could say it's the capitalist machine. You could say it's the I don't I mean the machine is comprised of doers and I wanted to I want to talk about the particulates in the machine. I've been a doer often. Oh God Johnny. I've so have you. We all live in doors. You know you've been a doer. You've been a doer. I've been a doer. Yeah. But but but but you know thank God I had this amazing chance to have an excuse to not do right. You got struck down by the the lightning finger fucking month. Yeah. I got a two month bench period and during that time I got to not do and and I like don't get me wrong. I like doing doing is great but I'm talking about I'm not talking about action because we all have to act. Right. I'm talking about the people who are clearly using their action as either some kind of revenge some kind of like they're kind of like trying to get vengeance through their activity to prove to the world that they're OK. Yeah. You know what I'm saying. They're sure they're trying to they're using their their ambition is not because they're passionate about what they're doing. Their ambition is this desperate better to be like to be in front. What time did you get up this morning. No I've been up for a while. I've been up. I've been up doing for a while now. Yes. Yeah. No. No Melanie. No she got up. Melanie just got up everybody. Melanie just got up. It's platform. No I've been up doing. I've been up doing. I did a little of this. A little of that. But some of this. There's some of that. So we were doing. What were you doing. Oh you were you were you sleeping in. OK. OK. OK. You just go you go ahead and do that. OK Melanie. OK Melanie. OK Melanie you sleep in. Jack has not missed a day of work in the last 20 years. Jack hasn't missed a day. I remember it. And I for some reason I I still remember this. It was like junior high the last the last like pep rally of junior high where they gathered us all in the gym to say goodbye to us to because we would I was I went to rugby junior high and from rugby rugby and from rugby junior high you moved to West Henderson home of the Falcons. And that and they was that's up the hill. The high school is up the hill. And I remember the principal at rugby coming out and giving this speech about how you're going to move up the hill. Things are different up the hill. And they now anyway they gave an award. This is the thing they gave an award. And the award was to this weird kid who hadn't missed one day of class. It's always a weird kid. In three in three years he didn't miss one day. Not one day. That's the that's the ultimate you know that's a mini doer. Right. Who's like it's that or like you'll hear it about comedians too. Oh yeah. Oh Jackie flips. He was he had his appendix had exploded. But he's still still did his 50 minutes out of the comedy story that night. Yeah. Doing. I played a gig on base when I had an IV in my arm. I was doing. Maybe it wasn't doing maybe it was just I don't know. But if this is the in our society the what's rewarded is not so much. What is being done. It's the doing. Yeah. The fact. Oh you built the house. Or you you built the suburbs. You did it. You did the thing. You made the one made the tea at least action action action action. Wake up. Get going. Wake up. Get going. So you see this and what ends up being lost is just really basic shit. And one of the first things that gets lost in this activity that you're always engaged in. Here's what I can think of. Right. I found there's three things to get obliterated by doing. But if you're in the cult you know you're in the cult of doers. If right now you consider when was the last time that you sat still and did nothing for 10 minutes straight. I mean I'm not no reading no TV no internet so difficult to do that. When was the last time you did that. Just really think about that. When was the last time you did that. Think about that. Because for many many many many people it's almost never in their whole lives. They've never done that. The best thing I think I think that the best thing to do in terms of like finding that time is just to watch things I find that like I like more than anything I just like to like observe you know you just like because if you're observing you're not talking you're not all you're doing is watch you're just watching what's happening. And if you go places there's a lot of places that are very conducive to just looking and watching and observing like like if you go to like like the Huntington Gardens or something like that. Or any place where you can watch things watch nature and just sort of you're just observing it and it's weird when you when you don't say anything and you're quiet how much how many things come forth because you're allowing them to present themselves. Damn right. And also that if you if you go and you and you decide to actually get out of your man-made cave and head out into nature and sit still and just sit still in nature you will find there is a really creepy amount of guilt that comes up like you're supposed to be it's such a weird thing to be just be out in nature sitting still not doing anything. There's a sense inside of you that's like what are you doing. Yeah. Oh yeah. Okay. What time is it. What time what time is what's next what's next for the day. What are you doing. What are you doing. Why are you just sitting here. Man it's a real fucking mess. I mean we're talking like like deep level brainwashing has been inflicted on this species. Yeah. It's like it's getting worse too. I think it probably is getting worse because just how much noise is in the environment. We have a lot of significant amount of noise and noise makes it hard to to be it's very easy to be distracted because of all the noise. Yeah. Yeah. Well I mean but the noise you can absorb the noise. We're just talking about this like act the act of you you think you're free but find a time that you normally would be doing and sit down and read for two hours and then tell me you're free because you're not because just finding those two hours to sit and read for a lot of people they're like oh god oh to have that time to have the time to carve out. Yeah because I was thinking that part in American Splendor have you seen that movie. Yes. Yeah. Harvey P. Garre is in the bakery and he's buying like two day old bread for cheap and he sees some woman he used to go to college with and she's like envious you know he's like hyper depressed and in like doldrums constantly and he is woman's like she's like envious of his lifestyle because she has kids and she's like now I have because they were in English class together so they and he was really good at that and she's like oh that's so amazing you're reading that book I haven't I haven't got to crack a book in so long because I don't have no time with kids and everything like that so it's like yeah I don't know what I was thinking about that. No it's terrifying but if you don't have kids you still not I can I just think of like you know being in LA we get to be around people who are have the ambition of Napoleon. They're crazy yeah this town is like crazy driven it's like there's you never see people who are so so type A just ready to cut down whatever jungle is in front of them. But why do those people always seem so pissed? I think it's because I don't know it's funny I guess it's because maybe like the anger comes out of that action because they're so driven it's like a part of the same thing you know it's a part of the thing where they're it's the aggressive the aggression. Yeah they're steely and they like can actually get angry on the way to yoga like they they'll get mad they they'll everything they do has this underlying current of anger beneath it it's like they're they they're at their actors usually are their producers but in the midst of the process of acting like something or producing something the fuel behind it is this bizarre competitive rage. I think a lot of times there's hummingbird right there by the way they hang out in that window and I love it. Very pretty it's the thing where it's a product of I don't know I think maybe I feel this way sometimes too is you don't know what you're doing you don't know what you really want or what you're trying to do so you just do stuff with this sort of blind rage and that sort of it it's loud enough to quell the the the underlying question or whatever it is that you are unsure of it busies the mind so you don't have to think about that thing that is really at the center of what you're driving for moving toward. What is that thing? It's different for everyone I suppose you know it's the thing it's like what is the what is the the big question or what is the thing that you really want to be doing or what is the thing that you really would make you happy. I think if you're busy if you keep yourself busy and always doing stuff it's very easy to not have to deal with that thing that is maybe something that you should deal with. I like but you know being busy is definitely a wonderful balm when you're feeling depressed. Oh yeah I think there's two different types though I think there's one thing to be doing to be like doing good when you feel bad like to do good things because that always that's nothing makes you feel better than doing helping other people when you feel bad because all of a sudden it's just like it evaporates but I guess I think I mean more like in terms of just just like getting stuff on the calendar I can't always think about that kind of shit when in my life I'm like this this day's open oh no there's too much white not enough ink on my calendar exactly yeah I I I it all boils down to being outside the present moment really yeah and that's the worst that's the worst thing is being not in the present moment what I like to do when I have these pangs of anxiety that have tormented me for my entire life is whenever I get a nice like sweet gong on that like when when a nice big gong on the fucking anxiety bell I like to instead of just feeling the anxiety and reacting I like to kind of trace back like who banged the gong and it's inevitably the being banging the gong is always a thought of the future the anxiety comes from thinking about the future yeah like if I think right now I'm like man I've got a going on the road Wednesday I've got all this shit I've got to do I've got two days to do it how am I gonna have the time to do it I want to wash my clothes and I I need to clean but I'm I'm I've got to you know I've got to make you crazy I gotta do these guys podcast done I've got to make sure that I like have my material together and get the puppet polished but but but but but but if I if I don't let myself think about the future and then I'm just here then everything slows down like all of a sudden when you just think right now about just being in the present moment and you're just kind of sort of giving up the future drinking the tea you're drinking tea then all of a sudden everything's like I'm not gonna say everything's great you still have the residual hangover of a lifetime of thinking about the future that's always with you but you can deal with it you do it's everything just shifts in such a substantial way the moment you pull the tendrils of your mind out of the phantasm of the past or the future mm-hmm yeah that feels good to be the moment to feels very good it's a thing where it's one of the best feelings I suppose is being in the moment that an abject terror yeah well I mean do you think you like terror yeah we were talking with this the other day about how how I don't know I was because I went running today and I had the I had the terror the you know the quick silver down the brain of terror so not that's not so much terror but that that fucking electricity that lightning of endorphins yeah I get once in a while and sometimes it makes me cry like I'll think about something I like I will be running and he'll be crying because I'm like no not like weeping not like you know weeping but I'm like becoming very emotional because that chemical has been dropped into the the think tank and it's like all of a sudden I'm like blasting off into outer space kind of with them but I feel like that's that's sort of like it's a sense of terror in a way it's like because it's so extreme you know it's just you feel a very extreme feeling of I guess it's in the moment it's very much in the moment kind of thing it's a yeah it's almost like it's like an orgasm I suppose in a way yeah I know I do know the feeling that you're talking about it's the thing everyone's I mean people you're running to feel that feeling where many people are running away from that feeling at full speed at all costs they don't want to feel that that's a feeling you get not just from running that's a feeling you get from falling in love yeah that's a feeling you get from intimacy that's a feeling you get from acknowledging how you actually are I guess anything really intense anything that needs sort of intense version of something like getting fisted I mean fisted definitely fisting yeah falling falling falling down a pit falling into a pit of fists a fist pit fist pits are notorious around here yeah I just missed one earlier today fist pit full-on fist pit a pissed fit when I get stoned sometimes a pissed fit and fit a pit of piss fists oh we got a pit of fist pissed here we're gonna we're gonna have to lock this down I'm a cuz what we discovered sir was when we were going to kill Osama we discovered a fist pit I don't know if you've been aware of this type of phenomenon geological we've encountered much and doing drills is a fist bit over 50 of our Marines we're fisted in that pit I tell you what they're not coming back they're coming back physically but they're not coming back there's nothing worse and when one of these fine soldiers comes back to our country to see their family and they've been fisted their souls been fisted out of them I mean to look at them it's a look at a negative image like this is a photographer if you took that negative image that's what they look like physically it's like gazing into a blank cloud a boy a cloud is that knows what you're thinking it's gazing into you ever look at a cloud and it looks back yeah that's the best pit their assholes have developed gravity similar to low level star system it is a black hole they can't shit without turds going back into their ass they shoot it it goes back in then dicks will be flying from all corners of the world flying I'm talking thousand miles an hour dick just whipping through the air boom shooting up these assholes and I tell you this with these terrorists or this is what the power that they have unleashed because they've got they they've got this black hole this gravatron that is just sucking in dicks faster than anything I've ever seen in my life it is a it is a straight up it is a rain of dicks not only do we have our soldiers anus is sucking dicks in but we are having to restrain the penises of non-affected soldiers so they get ripped right off their bodies and shoot it is very difficult then this fellow this bossama jim lobhamfeller he is unable he is immune to the effects of this very dangerous he's got enough there's nothing down there he's he's a he's a neutral creature sir we believe he may be the third sex the third sex sir we we may have confirmation mr. vice president we believe we have confirmation of the third sex destroy it what are you talking about what do you mean I'm not my present anymore sir you've been elected for life I don't know man I I I think that the there whenever I get stoned some when I get stoned and go eat breakfast at this cafe I felt for a moment like I was existing in the Neolithic period like I was existing that's caveman right yes that I was existing in it in a primordial past that kind of like weird moment where you're sort of suddenly wake up just for one second you're like oh god oh god we're so very primitive we're so so very we were so we're so still exactly in the place we were at oh yeah nothing's changed it's just sort of like the clothing or just the just the color of the whatever just the overarching sheen has changed everything's the same and then you combine so it's like the you have this sheen but it's the prohibition on being able to look at other people you can't look at people what do you mean if you spend too long staring someone yeah one of the first things you teach kids just don't stare don't stare you're not allowed to look and this is the thing that got me really freaked out as I started I actually looked it up how many stars are there in the universe well they don't know that but in the Milky Way they think there's right around 300 billion stars it's a lot on earth there's only 6 billion people so that makes people more unique than stars right so I was thinking if I was at a cafe and a bunch of stars were at the table eating all I would do is stare at them right because they're so unique and incredible but somehow in this dimension we've incarnated as sentient star particulates and we're not allowed to look at each other in cafes I do it sometimes though I break it I do too and then people think you're trying to fuck them well there's nothing greater than when you get a chance to watch someone who doesn't know you're watching them that's some of that's one of the greatest feelings I've I remember one time I was doing this show this this play right yes and there was a girl who was doing the play after us who was doing her makeup I took her like a good 20 minutes to do her makeup and she was really engaged in doing the makeup right she was not thinking about anything else because she was really looking in the mirror engaged and I sat there the entire time I was like going over my lines but I was watching her like the whole time it was like the most relaxing thing I've ever one of the most relaxing experiences I've had because it was like you're just watching someone do these very simple actions and that she was completely unaware I was staring I was just staring right at her and it wasn't like I wasn't like looking at oh she's hot it wasn't like that I was just looking at her because it's like something about the actions she was doing were pleasant it's comforting yeah it's comforting it's like those chances are that's why you got to ride the bus I had a friend who was a voyeur I want to make a confession and this friend of mine wait when you say a voyeur does that mean he derives sexual pleasure from no no no I wouldn't call it sexual so what is it then how will we how am I not a voyeur then I guess that's voyeuristic what you did yeah boy I don't know that voyeurism always has to be sexual pleasure being derived from the observation of the being I mean when you know I could Jane Goodall is a shimpoi absolutely so it's so you you there's a well science is nothing but observation that fucking Mars probe man that fucking lawyer what a perv they're fucking snapping shots of that poor planet taking them to look at later analyzing everything but I had a friend who was a voyeur and I remember once he like he was like I want to show you something that I do and he took me behind a building mm-hmm where he found a window that he could stare in mm-hmm and there was no way for the person in there who kept their window open to know they were being observed because if I guess the way I don't know just the light the lighting is the lighting and so we stood out there I'll never forget this is the one this moment is firmly fused into my mind yeah because we sat there and watched this person at a desk writing that's all just writing right the weird glow of the light and man aside from like the creep factor of thinking like whoa shit man my friend is so freaky but but but aside from that it was like there was this moment it's this it's relaxing there was a moment of like truth of yes you're seeing truth you're seeing people who aren't lying when people don't know they're being observed they're they're not lying they're just living in the actual moment it's true in the moment that's why people can't stand bad acting that's what makes them uncomfortable because bad acting is like because it's not true that's awesome I mean bad good acting isn't really even acting it's just it's finding a way to be something for real and you're not tricking me I mean there are a lot of people who do trick but it's that same thing that's why people like watching movies and plays so much they'll always like watching them because they love watching being able because what you did was basically a a way to watch someone as though you would watch them in a movie because if you watch a movie or a play no one's ever gonna tell you to stop looking at them because it's it's a spectacle it's there to be watched right and and if they're doing it right it's it's just playing truth and you get to watch that truth and it's really very pleasant so it's I think it's the yeah it's that same thing where you get to this because there's so little truth in media and media products that we watch most of them are are untrue and false and shitty so if you get to see that truth in real life it's like a play that's a really well done play a perfect play yeah perfect play perfectly acted because when a person's being themselves they're being the greatest actor of all time yeah exactly you're being right now you're the Daniel Day Lewis of Johnny Pemberton I am I'm doing it the best you're doing Johnny Pemberton better than anyone could do a Johnny Pemberton but see but this is the this leads to I was just talking to my friend about Kurt Cobain okay and Kurt Cobain's suicide note oh I don't I haven't read it in forever I remember what it says please read that drippy little thing but his suicide note yeah is one of his main problems is that he feels like he's faking it on stage that's a big problem with a lot of artists I read some article about Helena Bonham Carter and I don't I don't know what you feel about her but I like her as a as an art as an actor yes and she says that she was saying that how she feels like a fraud a lot of times yes I think that's I think that's how fucking everybody feels well that's the thing because Kurt Cobain ostensibly the great bard of annihilation a punk a punk deeply embedded in the truth singing the siren song of rebellion against the falseness of the world getting paid to do it it's getting paid to do it but still let's just say that the money I don't think getting paid is I it's okay to throw money at talent that's okay I think but but uh but to me where his entire message really becomes convoluted is that he killed himself because he began to experience real truth the truth before when he says I don't feel real anymore I feel like I'm a fraud on stage yeah what he's actually experiencing is the the true state of being human the true state of being human is to feel fraudulent and the reason that you feel fraudulent is because your beingness is nothingness is the combination of nothing being met with the awareness of the nothingness that's the root of all human beings you've got the great white self-awareness board of of consciousness the white board of consciousness and it's being met simultaneously with his sense of an awareness of the self and those two things the awareness of the self mixed in with the self create an innately fraudulent thing because everything that you do that isn't nothingness is essentially uh uh acting you're acting like something all the time so anyway Kurt co fucking bane when he finally came to the realization of what he really was yeah you're a goddamn fraud we're all frauds we're out here trying you're acting like your name's johnny pemberton acting like my name's dunga trussell you act like those are the clothes you wear yeah I like you pick those out you put on your costume I put on my fucking costume but at the base of the fucking thing it's just this white board of nothingness this great field of oblivion yeah a 440 an a 440 I don't know what that is it's the frequency of a of this yeah there you go yeah you're just the ohm you're just this tone you're this non-differentiated self that is unfortunately and a lot of people say this is a bad fucking this is a catastrophe what to be that self-aware or the death of the tone or the death of the nothingness or we're nothingness dying and the experience of nothingness dying is this terrible predicament where we've got to march around this stupid planet for 60 years acting like we're something yeah it's that that's a that's definitely a predicament it's a thing where so yeah self-awareness is kind of horrible it's because it's it takes you out of the moment that's what takes you away from being alive is being cognizant and so aware of what of who you are as opposed to just just being being here now well that's the see this is why uh some some people will say dude please just don't get into spirituality don't get into meditation don't get into this stuff because it's gonna wake you up oh yeah it'll stop you from like doing stop you from making lunch plans you're already doing it if you if you've managed to smack some fucking gold chains on or if you've managed to like to really fucking adopt the identity that you're living like you're just sure that's who you are oh yeah oh babe stay there yeah stay there stay in the zone how fun you're just you you just you're just you're just this you you believe that for example like a lot of people believe status quo you believe that you are important oh yeah oh how fun why am I not being recognized uh why no i should be on that list excuse me oh so fun hey hey will you ask me to be there so far to me um i i don't believe i was asked to be what this thing i'm surely you meant to to invite me and put me on that list of select people but quite often it's the opposite it's the opposite where you're like i just don't think they like me i think everyone hates me i don't think anyone likes so bad it's not even that no one's noticing you yeah that's yep yeah so it's but such a trap but such a trap oh it's a hoot especially with comedy too with comedy stuff it's so easy to think about all that horrible shit well i mean it's so many evaluative scenarios and it's just really gross well it's gross because you i mean like it's look for me for some reason my mind always goes to goths like i think about how funny goths are because they're kind of like dour and they wear these they wear black clothes and they wear these funny costumes and they just really stick out yeah now i don't know if there's even goths anymore but there are but but uh coming back but um in the same way when you run into like uh career comics you know what i mean like people doing the career comedy thing yeah and they've like they like all hang out with each other and they all um they all uh you know what i mean they all like they all act in a particularly similar way style there's a style to it and it's like in the same way oh you guys are goths like you're goths only the way that you're dressing and acting is a different thing but it still is a very similar thing yeah and when you see rich people and you'll notice that oh Jesus Christ these are fucking goths they're all acting weird they all like they're all acting in the same goddamn way and it's a very it's a but but at the at the core root of all these things it's just people who are um putting on who are acting like they're in drag they're in drag for that particular show like that rich person thing especially that's a thing where it's so it's never changed really it's it's just the styles have changed but basically there's always been this thing where you have to be yeah you have to be a certain way if you're wealthy to where it's not even doesn't matter how much money you have it matters how much if you act like the people who have money button it down you button it down here's what you do you button it down you go to Pilates you get your trainer you get ready for pilot season you fire your agent you rehire an agent and you're out there and you're doing the thing your car is clean you have to have a nice car it has to be clean it must be clean and uh it must be it can't be old it has to be new that's something that uh I remember seeing some documentary a while ago about class and how people people often and still today and probably always will mistake racism for classism because classism is the true that's the true uh discriminatory evaluative system it's not people people don't care like if you're if you're if you're black and you're rich why racist white people will love you because like oh you're not you're black which are not black you're you're rich you're one of us you understand the same things but the only thing the nothing scares a rich person more than a poor person especially a poor white person especially a happy especially a happy poor person oh yeah oh god nothing's gonna put a fucking stick right in the eye of a rich person than getting around a real authentic uh christian who's generally like somebody who's like figured out how to be completely happy has has abandoned and I'm not talking about the kind that like fuck kids or the kind that like hey gay people I'm talking about when you come to like that humble person who's just like yeah they're just happy they're happy no matter what man they're not running around they're not like getting their goddamn teeth tips whitened they're volunteering yeah volunteering they're not even thinking about it they're not even it's fun they're not even thinking about they just did it yeah it's a it's a it's a it's a spook show man and so the the uh the fraud the so that's what this goddamn state of feeling like a fraud feeling like feeling that emptiness you should just be you got to even get past that and just become the emptiness yeah be the uh the worst sometimes I think about that I'm like oh I'm gonna try to do the worst job I can with something not be the worst that's what it's a freeing thing if you do that sometimes it's a thing where uh it's not the worst the emptiness I don't think it's the worst I I guess I mean more in the sense of uh if you strive if you don't strive for something then that's um then you're in like a zen state because you're not you're not trying to make it good not trying to do a good job you know I think what it is is you strive in the zen state so what I mean is instead of being like completely ego based right complete instead of being the costume you know it's like okay look we didn't get invited to this fucking kids party something happened where a vagina shot us into a wardrobe area called our family they wore wardrobe area yeah so we got wardrobe by our family and the wardrobe didn't just consist of the clothes that they put on us the wardrobe consisted of the internal costume that they injected into us and then now we're this kids party where everyone's supposed to dress up like themselves and so now we're all wearing these stupid fucking clothes dressed up like ourselves and it's like it's when people start arguing over their costumes and judging other people's costumes based on the costume they're wearing that's where things get weird I guess I'm doing the same thing I'm being judgmental but it's it's uh I wear a fucking costume I wear a I got a fucking personality I put on a show I spray up fucking tail feathers I do a little dance around this goddamn dimension acting like something but we're all stuck in it it's different though if you're if you're not aware of it and you're not like realizing like what you're doing I think it's different and both are fine in fact it's better god damn it you if you're out there selling cars and dressed in an awesome outfit and happy with your life and you fight over your sports teams and fucking do it's great not in a condescending way either yeah it's you're healthier than than people who are like a tooth half hanging out of the mouth of god just with a little nerve ending that's kind of getting blistered by everything can't go in can't fall out right that's why I always get jealous of hillbillies I always wanted to be a hillbilly would that be great to be like just like the semi-ignorant hick and just really something about that I just really think that'd be I would be fun because I always think of whenever I I do this this character once in a while it's like a redneck guy and it's like a thing where it feels so good to do that character because I feel like there's no there's nothing I don't know how to answer because I know I know the truth of everything in that character's life and so everything is everything's easy it's like so simple because you just know let's go back to honesty I suppose because it's about because if you're playing a character that character has no repercussions for being honest because it's a character you're obviously doing a character it's a joke yeah so you can be as honest as you want because it's not you and that's why I think yeah I really happy people are people who are the same as some character because there's there is no answer that they can't there's no wrong answer to anything because there's always speaking from a place of truth yeah I don't it's hard to be truthful with yourself I'm you know what it is man both here's both just both sides are just oblivion it's like either you're like acting like a thing yeah you're nothingness acting like a somethingness to the point where you're completely unaware of the nothingness that's acting like a somethingness or you're somethingness that's become aware of the fact that you're nothingness sort of merging back down into the nothingness but either way it's oblivion it's just you're nothing it's all shit it's not shit it's not shit I just wanted to say that but it that it that does sound depressing when you hear oblivion it sounds awful when you hear annihilation it sounds awful but really it's just thinking of something so grand that it's non-cons you can't conceptualize it right it's it's everything everything at this it's all the same it's the place where everything becomes so profoundly incredible that it becomes incomprehensible that's all and it's like that incomprehensible place is what we really are right because it when you have that when you have those moments of that when you when you sense that somebody's I feel like it's it's like a fleeting thing but when you do sense it it's a thing where I don't know I think it I say the word hopeless but I think I hopeless in like a good sense the sense where it's like you are so hopeless and so powerless to the to everything that you are it's like the best and the worst at the same time it's everything because you realize for a second or somehow you come to understand that the nothingness and the complete complete hopelessness of whatever it is that you think you are and that's that's so freeing and so amazing because you're like oh this is this massive beyond all measure and you're just you're just some little blip gone beyond gone beyond gone beyond the going what is that I had some kind of buddhist thing yeah some kind of buddhist shit some kind of buddha butter well that's the that I was just listening to this awesome tick not on youtube video you see a yogi he's a he's buddhist monk okay and he was saying like you know buddha you see buddha in the present moment like you can still experience buddha buddha exists in the moment buddha never left buddha buddha's enlightenment was this thing where it blasted out a repetitive it's sort of like injected the essence of that being into the present moment perpetually and eternally because really that's all you are anyway it's like what happened with buddhism was when a human being their ego like actually did crack off disappeared it disappeared vaporized but they were still alive yeah it was like buddha was probably like the first contact with in it one of the first contacts with an alien thinks that because how that was siddhartha how that's how long ago was that 2000 bc or something I don't even know the dates right now I'm not sure yeah that's a great question yeah well I mean they say he incarnated a bunch of different times right like sometimes he was a cricket that did something really sweet oh it's weird shit sometimes he's a bird but it was like all these different incarnations and in every incarnation it was like getting closer and closer to this final like blast where the whole thing gets cracked open this way is shown the pathway forward for humanity to like get out of this goddamn silly phase that we're in right now was revealed and it took a lot of different incarnations to get to that place so he's he's there he's he made it well I mean I don't know he made it I don't have a he made it he made it buddha he did it I do fucking made it he booked half hour there's no way to think about that in context of uh that's such a funny thing too god I suppose that was a horn oh there's a horn a good old horn yeah he made it dude he made it he fucking hit the hit he fucking struck the bell he struck the bell yeah I don't know man I you know I like I I don't I don't really understand any of that stuff but the the older that I get the more it seems like all all that stuff that they say is completely right on what stuff the who says well the whole idea of like going into a state of blissful non-desire abandoning everything that's it sacrificing your future permanently obliterating your future with no regard for result annihilating your future evaporating your past yeah then that when you think about evaporating your past like really sacrificing your past oh shit yeah that's a big thing give up your mom give up your dad give up your friends give up everything from record collection everything's gone everything's gone and in the future give up your hopes give up your dreams expect nothing give up your expectations yeah give up what you think it's going to be a result of this thing yeah and then then what do you got your freedom then you become something else but you're not you anymore I'm just asking you to take off your fucking kids party costume and show me a dick maybe the maybe the Buddha was just molesting humanity take your clothes hey it doesn't matter if you're naked here it's fine don't worry about it yeah no seriously it's good you can keep your clothes on take it off you can also take them off take it off it is warm in here isn't it it's warm it's warm and it's hot in this dimension let's take our egos off and show each other what's that what's that you have there looks like a star oh Jesus Christ man where did this podcast go take a break fuck yeah this did any of this make sense what we just said it doesn't matter all right yeah it doesn't do you think it'd be weird to be the first person to have an orgasm on a podcast I think it's got it has to have been done right there's so many porn stars who've oh yeah like yeah podcasting yeah I'm a porn star I guess what I'm gonna shock you hey look out world I'm a porn star yeah I said it mom yeah I guess what yeah I guess what I'm not a stupid I'm not a stupid b I'm a porn star and I like to go to book guess what I'm gonna shock you I like to go to bookstores more than I like to go to porn stars what but I'm a porn star what I'll suck your dick right now but guess what I won't suck it I'm a porn star I thought you would I love that shit the porn it's like the the let me shock you with how non-shocking I am but still being a porn star I just you know I'm just like anybody else I like to eat soup I love I love soup I also left second a big double oh give me a juicy double mac christ hey you know what's interesting man there's also sometimes behind porn stars the same kind of anger that's behind like super ambitious people I'm sure I'm sure like in that shock thing like no I just love to suck cocks ah guess what not all porn stars by the way no but just I know cool I know actually a super cool I'm sure you do they have to be out there but I guess I'm just sort of sick of the the new thing now where it's like hey porn is cool man it's like it's totally um it's like hip to be this is so funny you're saying this flaunting it because my my the the next guest that I have on the podcast is Sam Tripoli right who has a podcast dedicated to porn or mostly porn there you go so we're gonna get into porn we're gonna talk a lot about porn porn stars I'm my opinion my opinion on porn is uh is that it's so overpowering I'm not it is it's pretty fucking amazing that we have that like it's such a new thing really if you think about it it makes me feel like I'm a cow and a farmer and I'm just milking myself oh god it makes you know what I mean it makes you feel kind of trapped what do you mean because it's just so available yeah it's just available whenever you find yourself jerking off the porn it's just always this like there's never ever that I can think of a time when I'm jerking off the porn where I'm like yeah this is exactly what I want to be doing yeah it's always like a means to an end or something it just is this numb blankness it's just like uh here we go fucking jerking off the porn some people some people have successfully not looked at porn anymore at least they claim to which I think is interesting that would be so hard to do I wonder if I could do that I guess I could do that maybe I'll try 30 days 40 Morgan Spurlock 30 days no porn 30 days no porn and just McDonald's ah god damn it see where we're at man that's what I'm saying this is the neolithic period we're still in some dumb ass part of human existence where that's what we're obsessed with but we're like we're so young we are very very young as a species yeah think about sharks think about fucking sharks man yeah sharks um they're really old haven't changed at all yeah sharks probably used to all they used to do is look at porn yeah there was the porn parade of sharks which was uh there's some fossilized evidence of uh sharks masturbating to trilobites doing sea sprays that's all they do is jerk off the starfish and then once they got their rows of teeth they moved beyond to eating them just to going down and just consuming all things just these um there's just great this how did sharks get so fucking lucky I don't know man we don't I mean I think it just almost things where it's a good design and it just stuck it's like how uh tube tube tube with teeth they're like helvetica they're helvetica the animal aren't they isn't the idea with sharks is that they've barely evolved from haven't changed at all they haven't just they're that's just it yep they haven't changed they're they're fucking crazy no I'm fine I'll just be an underwater teeth tube I'll just eat everything all the time and not sleep why do I I don't need a car thank you nope I'm fine I have this uh rocket kill tube I that is me I don't need yeah I don't I don't don't need an elevator no don't need a watch don't need no out of there to change this just need the front of me to have a shillow to razor sharp knives in the front that I keep open as I swim through the sea eating everything eating everything without regard to what it is there's something there's this really great zine that um nick johnson the guy who wrote big dead place put out called shark fear and awareness you can get it on amazon it's so so so funny it's the funniest thing you've ever read because he's basically just talking about a whole thing is about how sharks are the worst how they're they're horrible and they should be feared I mean it's all a big joke but it's just it's so fucking funny the way he talks about sharks in the same way we're talking about it you know Hemingway when he went fishing he used to have a machine gun he did on his boat that he would shoot sharks with as he was fishing god what an asshole well no because they were going for his food when he was reeling he would reel fishing that was a problem like when you would reel fish in the sharks would like bite the fish he caught one of the biggest fish in like a world record size fish that got half eaten up by sharks that he tried to shoot with machine guns machine guns people hate sharks man they really hate them it's so why would you look I mean there there are it's very hard for me to like a shark I don't know I think I feel like I wouldn't want to go to coffee with one they have a very distinctive play it doesn't want to go to coffee with you if that's for sure no shit it has no desire for coffee maybe like a coffee of blood it's just that oh would you care for a blood coffee sure it's just that look in his shark's eyes yeah it's that glazed over the terror look the terror of uh of just death it's the same look Ron Jeremy has what they are they are gods they're like god's black angels the sharks they're there to do the um what was that it's the only good quote from um god's black angels god that's the only good quote from that a newborn movie or uh what's his name what's the guys I can't think of actors names anymore I do this he's the guy he's a skinny guy he was in the movie the racist one he's uh gained a lot of weight he's uh he was in that other Spike Lee movie he's a white guy he plays like serial killers he was in I don't know oh come on you know his name brother I can barely remember my aunt's fucking a uh fight club what's Brad Pitt in Edward Norton yes Edward Norton says to he says uh we are the sin eaters I was like oh that makes sense it's kind of makes kind of makes sense you do you do the bad things and you you eat the sin you consume it so it doesn't have to poison other people's perfect realities I think sharks are the sin eaters of the world sharks are the black holes of the sea yeah they eat the sin they do the bad they do all the bad yeah eating fish isn't really sin maybe it's not maybe uh spiders are the are the sin eaters I don't I mean eating spiders is more evil than spiders eating bugs yeah I think killing spiders rampantly is pretty evil I do too I try never to kill a spider what do you got here okay this is this thing okay so I picked up this um this is a little thing called radical mycology I just read this last night it's an slf primer it's from the spore liberation front which is a group of people dedicated to the proliferation of mushrooms what's their website let's see here it's um it's slf I think it's something oh it's not in there what they did you can find it these goddamn anarchists print your fucking website on your goddamn z just use the internet a sport liberation front it's there so I read this last night it's totally blew my mind um so fucking I just lost the page this is from a zine convention that johnny went to yeah john johnny's girlfriend is a very talented visual artist and she puts out really cool zines and so johnny went to a zine check out supersecretpowwow.com okay so here I'll just read it here uh the oldest mushroom found the oldest known mushroom found in amber has been dated over over 90 million years old mycologist tom volk theorizes that millions of years ago trees developed cellulose and lignin to protect themselves against fungi that were consuming them as time progressed mushrooms evolved so that they can now decompose these components but all the vegetation that died in the interim just piled up got compressed and after millions of years became fossil fuels this is why the earth will never produce oil or fossil fuels again because mushrooms will forever on decompose living matter fucking blew my mind off isn't that fucking crazy yeah Jesus Christ mushrooms can do they can do everything they can eat um we talked about this before but how that guy paul stamets talks about how the they're just a matter of time before mushrooms can evolve to deep they can decompose any substance any toxic toxic substance it's just a matter of time before mushrooms learn to eat that and spit out nutrients that they can eat themselves that's fucking crazy they're they're more advanced than us well they uh they i was also reading about this and they talk about this in the same thing about how mushrooms are closer to animals than they are to plants because they don't plants produce their own food through photosynthesis mushrooms don't they eat their hunters they consume yeah they spread out and they consume uh they consume their fuel they consume it like we do this is the thing that that was on reddit about slime molds okay yeah same sort of they don't have a brain but if you put a slime mold if you put a slime mold into a maze where at the end of the maze is food the slime mold will send throughout the every possible pathway in the maze tendrils and it will take the fastest finally it will find the fastest way from point a to point b point b being the food and it will withdraw all the tendrils that aren't the fastest way and just go the fastest way down into the food yeah that reminds me of um creep oh you mean are you talking about starcraft i am it reminds me of creep it is like creep yeah i think that is supposed to be fungus it is because that those are neural networks they're exactly the same as any network neural networks and that's the other thing is that so the the they took maps of london and of and of tokyo and they put food where all the subway stops are and the slime molds the pathways based on the geography that they took were almost identical to the subway paths to the road maps and so the point of the article is these things don't have a brain but they're still doing things that humans are doing with brain because humans are so smart we're so smart we're so great humans have created such great incredible things it would never get created otherwise we're such we're so good we should pat ourselves in the back good job humans oh we're so good oh we do such a good job at everything we're so good is this yeah is a species we are so fucking hung up on ourselves oh god man that's yeah we are so deeply deeply hung up on how great humans are we're just the fucking best oh if like oh what would how many a human died kill them all let me let me ask you this can you do this as an acting exercise isn't it isn't fair asking you last second okay but i want to interview you as though you are every human on earth combined into one being is the ego of the planet okay that's that's a that's a pretty interesting task so i'm the ego of the planet huh you you represent our species well who are you hi everybody this is dunca trussell welcome to the dunca trussell family hour today i'm going to be interviewing the entire human species hello embodied in one being hey how's it what's up hello hi thank you so much for coming on the show how so what's it like what do you have for me i know i want tea oh uh is there more can i have more please yeah i'll get some more oh great how much do you have i have uh i don't know like five bags okay i'll have all of it thank you can you make it please thank you i'll have all of it then we can begin you're a shark i'll have all of it please you just are a consuming thing i'll have all of it that's it huh that's your idea of the species i think so i think it's like a combination of i'll have all of it but acting also like i mean you have to you what you just created was kind of like a a black a black eyed alien being that's just like i only devour i think there's another side to it which is like manipulative or something right okay sort of conniving like a trickster yeah like Loki yeah like Loki the trickster yeah i think the species is just very puffed up right now mm-hmm oh yeah we're pretty high on ourselves that's why that meteor was such a great yeah like oh ups get it yeah i watched on something on flocks news there's a clip and the woman after she after she closed it off she said oh oh my hope no one got hurt that's the last thing she said i was like an idiot you just finished how saying thousands of people were injured and well hope no one got hurt i love man there there's just something about that that's so nice it's like you know it's like when the best it's like when there's like a terrible rainstorm or anything like that any force of nature or it's like when you're watching the people's court and you've got some really puffed up teen who obviously did some stupid thing to someone else's property and they get smacked down by a wopner it was like that's what happened to the entire species you get this puffed up teenage species it's like we're we're so fucking great we're gonna kill each other instead of focusing on interstellar travel we're gonna spend all our money on weapons fighting over imaginary religions because that's how fucking that's there's just plenty of us to go around could have been tomorrow's 50 years ago nah let's fight each other let's blow each other up then all of a sudden one very very tiny tiny little little rock from space comes plunging down shatters glass a nuclear explosion there's that one moment where it's like

454^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - Saraswati and Raghu Markus Transcript and Discussion^2015-02-06^Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. Hello my dear sweet friends. It is I, Duncan Trussell, the Thwilich of Cloudcashin, and you are listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour Podcast. A few weeks ago I received this audio file from a man in Kentucky. Here Duncan, my name is Harry Deppon, and I am sending you this audio file in the hopes that you have the courage to upload it into your mudgames. Two months ago while singing in my backyard, I was witness to a meteor impact in the forest outside my house. A bright light filled the sky and there was a sound like a thousand angels screaming in the night. I will never forget the way the meteor sounded when it hit the earth. It sounded like a fist punching a cold steak. I rose from my hammock and ventured into the forest to see if I could discover where the meteor had made its impact. It was not that hard to find where the meteor had made its impact. I only had to go in the opposite direction of the animals that were running from the forest. Squealing, howling, barking, and chirping when a great cloud of mammalian terror they plunged away from me, but I ventured ahead for a moment, forging upstream through a river of terrified fur. Until at last I arrived at a smoldering spot in the forest where a crater the size of three Volkswagen buses lay. The smell of that smoke was unlike anything that I had ever experienced in my entire life. It was the smell of a demon's breath hot on your back as he impaled you again and again in the lower circles of hell. His eyes rolling backwards in his head as his slavering fangs dripped acidic saliva onto your buttocks, feet, and back. In the middle of the crater there was something that was clearly an egg shaped the color of the night sky dusk. I ventured closer into the impact zone. Having discussed this with my wife, I recognized the terrible mistake that I made. One should never very enter into a meteor crater. A scientist should be called immediately, but it was as though that egg had a hypnotic hold over my psyche and I was drawn into it. The very top of the egg could only be compared to the protuberance of a baboon's genitalia. Fleshy and alive, what happened next changed me forever and could potentially change the world. I'm prepared to give you exclusive rights to my story on the condition that you proved to me that you were to be trusted by playing this first part on your podcast. Once I hear that you have played this part, I will supply the next part of this story as well as photographic and video evidence if you request. I hope that you will make the right decision. Not only your life, but the life of all beings on this earth depend on it. I know what you guys are thinking. Duncan is putting himself in a great deal of danger by leaking this kind of information out into the world. Some of you are probably thinking I'm doing it for the wrong reasons. You think I'm doing this level of journalism not because I care about getting the truth out there, but because I want to win another Pulitzer Prize. I imagine some of you even think that that was my voice in the beginning of the podcast and that I couldn't come up with an opening monologue or intro. So I just recorded that to fill in some space. You, sir, would be wrong or madam. That email was sent to me two weeks ago with an audio file attached. And if you're out there friend, I will continue to share your story with the world. All right, we got a great podcast today. We're going to dive right into the interview, but first some quick business. This episode of the Duncan Tressel Family Hour podcast is brought to you by the pubic wizards over at harrys.com. They say that before you are born, you are a being composed entirely of light fueled by love. An ever expanding blast of pure orgasmic bliss radiating infinitely into the universe. Over the course of incomprehensible aeons, you realize that you had learned everything you needed to learn by being limitless, blissful, pure and free. And you decided to enroll in the interdimensional academy we call human incarnation. Now, instead of being a light butterfly filled with pure love energy, you get to be an oily bag of organs, bones and meat from which pubic hair sprouts against your will. And that's where Harry's comes in. Harry's.com. These sweet pubic wizards are saving the world from having to endure the deep awful humiliation that comes from going to a drugstore and trying to buy expensive razors enclosed inexplicably behind bulletproof glass as though razors needed to be protected like plutonium bars. Also, I'm sure you're aware of this, but there is a massive measle outbreak spreading across this country at this very moment. There's a 100% chance that as you wait to get your razors from whatever drugstore that you venture out into, a measly child festering with disease will sneeze in your direction and spray a combination of mucus, vomit and skittles into your face. You'll get measles again. You will spend weeks and weeks and weeks covered in oozing sores and pox all because you wanted to buy razors to clean your face up so that you could go on a tinder date. Harry's has saved us from these events. Thank God. We don't have to go to the store anymore. All you've got to do is go to Harry's.com. Our music. Go to Harry's.com.

It makes me feel like I'm living back in the 50s to get a nice little box with a fancy razor blade in it and a fancy kind of shaving cream that they used to use back in the good old days where you would stretch your neck back and some guy would slather your face with Edison-style shaving cream. And the whole time you got to secretly worry about whether or not he would slash your throat, but you didn't mind because it added to the rush of getting your face shaved. Well, you can have that very same experience without having to worry if a lunatic barber is going to slash your juggler vein open by going to Harry's.com and ordering one of these razor blades.

Okay, and sorry for all the plugs here, guys. You do know you can skip ahead if you get bored of these things. But I just have been sponsored by a great company called Linda.com. If you're not aware of what they are, this is a digital training website where you can learn how to do After Effects, Photoshop, HTML, animation, anything utilizing software, 3D Studio Max, 3D Design, anything like that. If you want to become an expert at this stuff, Linda.com will train you to do that. It's where I learned how to use Photoshop. I'm currently taking a Logic Pro course, which is about a seven hour course that's introducing me to the basics of Logic Pro. I've started recording the podcast in Logic Pro because of the training that I'm getting from Linda.com. If you're somebody who's in a job where you've got a lot of downtime and you want to start training to maybe move in another direction, or if you're somebody who's just not working right now and you've got a lot of spare hours and you want to have that awesome feeling that comes from exercising your brain and learning how to do new stuff, then go to Linda.com, sign up. I am signed up with them. It's like there's various packages. My package is the one. I think I'm paying like $40 a month right now, but there's other packages too. If you want to use them, they've got like a $25 a month package. I don't know exactly all of the details. Go to Linda.com. You can check it out. But if you go to Linda.com forward slash family hour, you will get a free 10 day trial. So theoretically, if you want to sign up and try this service out, then you could spend the next 10 days training in anything that you want. So you could definitely finish one of these courses in 10 days if you just want to dive in and dive out. But it's a great way to see if it works for you. I have been using Linda since I worked at the comedy store, which is like, I don't know how long ago that is. That's a long time ago, but I've been using it on and off since then. And when I had downtime at the comedy store, I would spend my time training on Photoshop. But there's a lot of other classes that you can check out. Go to Linda.com forward slash family hour, sign up for a trial membership. Won't you? Okay, that's it. Let's dive right into this podcast. Today's guests, one of the guests is a returning guest. The other guest is her first time. It's Raghu Marcus and Sarah Swati Marcus. As most of you know, Raghu Marcus works with the love server member foundation. He organizes the retreats that happen in Maui. These are the retreats that I've been going to and that I will actually be doing live podcasts from in April in Maui. And Sarah Swati Marcus teaches yoga at these retreats. And my favorite part of there's two of, I have three favorite things at these retreats. One of them is getting to be around Ram Dass and listening to him talk, which is like standing in front of some kind of nuclear love bomb. And the other thing that I really love is the yoga that happens in the morning. And Sarah Swati teaches these incredible yoga classes and she has figured out the perfect way to mix in all the various poses with interesting philosophical and spiritual perspectives related to having a human body in this incarnation. Raghu Marcus is a co-host of the mind rolling podcast, which is located on the mind pod network. And Sarah Swati, you can check out her website by going to nourishinglife.com. So now everyone, please open your hearts and send some laser beam level love blasts in the direction of my two great friends and teachers. Sarah Swati and Raghu Marcus. Welcome back to the Dunga Trussell family, our Raghu Marcus. And for the first time, Sarah Swati Marcus is here with us at the Dunga Trussell family hour. Thank you so much for joining the show. Thank you, Duncan. It's great to see you. Good to be with you. Great to see you too. We were just having a conversation in the living room about these retreats where you teach yoga at these retreats and how a lot of what I learned from those retreats comes from your yoga class. It's exactly at the same level as when Ram Dass is speaking or Cornfield speaking or any of them. I get my mind blown by your classes, so it is odd that you haven't been on the show yet. Why do I keep having you on, Raghu? I'm going to give you $200 for that. Yeah, we'll talk later. Thank you so much. Ram Dass, I mean, I'm sitting in your space here and I couldn't feel more at home. Thank you. And taking care of. And, you know, they've been definitely submerged in these teachings for a long time. And when I teach yoga where we met at the retreat, I really try to think about what could I bring that would companion these teachings from people like Jack Cornfield and Ram Dass and Krishna Dass, Mirabai Bush, Trudy Goodman, you know. So I really try to make the yoga integrate into that. So I appreciate that happens for you. Yeah, I mean, I've had some of the most transcendent experiences of my life in your yoga, just in your yoga class. Maybe that's probably just because I'm incredibly out of shape and just need to exercise. So like anytime I'm doing any mild physical exercise, it's like, wow, this feels great. But you have this perfect pairing of the actual yoga itself mixed in with philosophy that it's really interesting. Because it's and also you just sort of offhandedly say things like in the last yoga class or the last in the retreat, you said the spine is the antenna. The spine is an antenna. Do you remember that? I do. Can you talk about that a little bit? Well, what's funny is, you know, I ran into you and you're like, I've been thinking about that thing you said in class, your spine is an antenna. And I was like, did I say that? Is that something I've ever said or could think about? It took me a minute, you know, because you drop into some kind of flow or stream where you open to a wisdom body channel and things come out, you know, that makes sense in that moment. And then so I didn't even recognize it at first, but then I thought about it a little bit. And what that means is that your your spine is an extension, obviously, of the brain and it's all your central nervous system and moment by moment. We're making decisions about the degree of our suffering or pain and whether we're going to aim and towards that and compound it, make it worse or whether we're going to course correct towards something more wholesome and healing and nurturing. Right. And they have that opportunity and those are called, you know, you know, that those opportunities are called awareness or practices or consciousness. And so when you surround yourself with these kinds of images that are here in your space and teachings and, you know, sounds like mantras, I think that helps us to, you know, to aim in a different direction. So that's how the spine is in the antenna is reading the environment, feeding back to the brain and you make a decision. Do I feel safe or do I feel, you know, contracted? Right. Yeah, that's that that is I love what you're saying specifically. I love everything you're saying, but one thing I really like about it is that you're pointing in the direction of the idea that we have free will. You're sort of obliterating the possibility of being a victim. If your spine is giving you these moments and every second to push in the direction of wholesomeness or to go back into the path, the destructive patterns, if you're always you're saying that we get to decide. I think we can decide if we know we're doing it. So our level of awareness and consciousness, I'm not sure how much free will we have with that. Maybe that's there's some predetermined. You know, they say, you know, you, you know, you've when you're born into a family of yogis that you that's a really high birth. And the rest of us who weren't, who knows how we stumbled onto this kind of material. And often I'll speak to that in a class where there's so many, so many people who never will hear these teachings ever. Right. And to just really take in how rare it is and soak that in free will. That's deep. Yeah, it's deep. So from what I've understood over the years, free will is something we need to think we have. And then we can go forward because we make choices, as you say, they can be for life or dark. But ultimately, we could never understand the reality of what they call karma and grace. That's one of the biggest things we have. I mean, you've been to a couple of these retreats. Yeah, see how much the conversation kind of turns into that direction, almost at every retreat. And I'm not sure if we're maybe it's just me. I'm super interested. I'm super interested because of what was said, you know, by both Nincor Olibaba, who many of you listeners out there. If you've heard me on Duncan before, you know, I'm talking about and that he said to Ram Dass one day when he was asked, is karma and grace the same thing? Meaning, do you have free will or is it all just it's all planned? It's all part of a plan that's everything is absolutely indicated past, present and future. And it's all part of that divine intelligence. And really, you don't have any, you know, which is a rational way of understanding something that we can't understand. And that's what he said. That's not something I'll talk about publicly when asked that question. And then Ram Dass is thinking, gee, why did he say that? And he thought and he told this to the interpreter, who then said, I must have told Maharaj Ram Dass is wondering, is it possible that they're not the same? Anyhow, he came back and he said, Ram Dass and I understand each other very well. So then later on, I actually got a chance to ask my Indian mother about this in particular, who had been with Maharaj for 50, 60 years. And she said, yeah, it's true, you cannot understand that. There's no way any, if you're living in duality that you shouldn't say it quite like that. You cannot understand that reality. And what we need to do is act as if we have free will. In not so many words. Well, there's the freedom to be conscious of what you're doing. That seems to be a real... You can actively make that decision to just start following your breath into your nose and out through your nose and then notice when you get lost. That feels like free will to me. Could be having the grace to even think about your breath. Right, I see. Okay, I see what you're saying. You know, the... Again, we can't understand... It's a circular conversation. It's a circular conversation. I remember one thing you said in the yoga class at the spring retreat, which was, I think it was a spring retreat, it was one of these retreats. You said, the place, the bridge between suffering and grace is surrender. Do you remember saying that? Really cool. And that... I love lately especially thinking about the notion of surrender. And I wonder if you guys could talk a little bit about what it means to you, the idea of surrender. Because many people when they hear it, that's not a good word. To say the very least. Jesus. You want to go first? Ladies first. Well, ladies first, that's a whole thing. Because that's never free. Ladies first, there's a price tag there. It's like, you have to be careful. I'm always... On your podcast, you and your listeners are witnessing our dynamics. Oh yeah, there is a price tag to ladies first. Ladies first, we're opening the door, paying for dinner, it's not free. So just point your conscious there, miss there ladies. Hear it, be strong. I've said it. I've said it out loud. I've said it out loud, like I pay for everything. I've said it out loud, those foul words have come out of my mouth and I've watched them like some awful verbal flatulence. You're interrupting Adam, you're just exposing all of my deep vulnerability and manipulative qualities in one terrible, simple sentence. You go, why did I do that? Always. I mean, I'm either... I'm unfortunately spend a lot of time going, why did I do that? I spend a great deal of time doing that. But surrender. You know, when you think, if you heard, we surrendered in Afghanistan. Not that we were leaving Afghanistan, but we surrendered, it's like... You know, Sharon Salisbury, she said it, one of these retreats. She's like, you know... Well actually, she said something different, but it reminded me of surrender, which is forgiveness. It's sort of along the same tapestry, I guess, as letting go of something. You're forgiving someone, you're surrendering something that's like causing obstruction. You're giving residue. You know, you want to be spacious. That's part of why we work with the body and the breath and movement and coordinate all of that is to make space so that something new can emerge. You know, a new thought, a new feeling, a revelation. You have insight, not outside. But she said about forgiveness. She said, forgiveness doesn't mean amnesia. You know, I loved that. The name is a little bit about surrender. I mean, surrender just means you don't give up, you give up the fight. You know, like you kind of, a little bit can be with things as they are, just little by little by little. And that is, you know, one way to think about the bridge between suffering and grace is to... You know, sometimes I've described it as bringing in like whatever you want to have happen. You know, you know, if you... I remember the last time I gave this example is when my mother was just diagnosed or she had just had a stroke and I was really hoping that she would overcome the stroke and heal. And I was causing me a lot of pain and suffering that she had had the stroke and that then there was me, my attachment to how she healed and all of it. So having, wanting truly what I want, which was for her to get better, make a full recovery, but also bringing in the opposite. Like leaving room for the fact that she's not going to get better. And like where do we find the place in our body-mind to hold both energies? And I think that becomes part of that movement to surrender. That's a great question though, that you... Where do you find the place in your body-mind to hold both those energies? And are you supposed to? Holding both those energies, do they just rip you apart? I mean, isn't there a greater truth happening that it's regardless of whether your mother is sick or well right now or your friend or your dog or whatever. The big, big reality is no amount of hope is going to keep anyone in this room or listening alive permanently. So does surrender mean maybe just going into that mental space completely or consciously being aware of the fact that you are a relatively to the span of time a rapidly decaying cloud of particulates? That's often I think of myself like that. Well, more and more lately. The times are tough. Getting old sucks. It does, yeah. You're doing it well. I mean, you are one of the most strikingly handsome men I've ever met. See, this is what you get on the show now. This is nice. I'm telling you though. How long have you guys been married? I call it we were struck from bell one and that's been eight years in April. Wow. That's cool. You were struck struck from bell one. Yeah. I like that. He actually when when he asked me for my phone number, you know, you put it right in your phone. He before I, my name was Saraswati. My name was Robin. So he put my name in his phone as Robin Marcus. Right away. I was like, oh, you're really into it. You're really into this. All right. Now we're getting too squishy here. Not too squishy. Surrender. Surrender. So the biggest thing about the Indians, like they have a concept of surrender, the Hindus, especially in Bhakti yoga, yoga of devotion, yoga of the heart. They, and we had one friend who steeped in it, who KK who, you know, and he said to us, you have no idea what that because the word is so completely destroyed in the West. That word has nothing to do with what we know is surrender. And he went into a hole. I won't get into his, you know, extraordinary definitions. But basically it comes with, it's the last thing before you get fully enlightened with the way they understand it to be the last point at which use their stops being an eye. And so you have acid, right? Best example. If you take a lot of acid, you get to the point where there's no eye. Yes. Right. And that's when people freak out generally. Yeah. Right. Or right before that point. Or right before. Yeah. And so it's the same. That's the same point the way I understand it. Once that's gone, then you are fully in what's called in India, Sharanagat. You can go to Ramdas.org and find S-H-A-R-A-N-G-A-T, Sharanagat. And it's the word for surrender. And there's a complete explanation of exactly how to arrive at that on Ramdas.org. Well, that's an interesting term. Sharanagat is the word for surrender. Surrender. Well, it sounds a lot prettier that term. We need new words. The words are all gone. Yeah, exactly. Like we have no more words that make any sense anymore. Forgiveness, all these words, all the words that seem to be the recurring symbols that point in the direction of waking up are, have been so overused that they're just meaningless. And if you spend even the slightest amount of time thinking about, when I think about forgiveness, I will usually get like a negative feeling tone. It's not like I think about forgiveness and I'm like, oh great. It's usually like, ugh, somebody must have done something fucking horrible to me. And then, you know, like you'll think that. And get into it and how they're going to react. Yeah. And just forgive them. It's so heavy and covered in all these like ideas that you learn from when you're a kid and you get into trouble. Or you know, the vision of like some patronizing pompous enemy being like, I forgive you. But they don't really, they're using the term as a medium to inflict guilt. So that word is kind of a corrupted, polluted word. Surrender you think of, that means I lost. And love, that word is like, who the fuck knows what that means? And see, we have a red heart symbolizes that. And you put chocolates in it on Valentine's Day. All these words are really, really difficult entryways into the stuff that it seems like they're pointing to. I wish we had a completely new vocabulary. Do you see interstellar? I haven't seen it. Oh, you've got to see that. At one point, one of the protagonists, a female scientist, they get into really tough, so you've got to help me out here. They get into a really bad situation in space. And they don't know how to get out of this really bad situation. They're having a dialectic. And it's basically about, you know, it's almost science and spirituality. Well, they're at this moment where they only have enough fuel that you can do one thing or the other. You know, they can go to this one place that she kind of wants to go, or the other place that actually looks more promising. And they're starting, and somehow they stumble upon the idea. She has a soliloquy where she says, you know, I just talked about love being this force that we can't really measure, like an unmeasurable force in the universe. Yeah, the magic that, I think he even said, magic that interconnects everything. And we just haven't really, yeah, we have not done enough science to prove that is what, right? That was what the thing was. So it was actually one of the greatest lines I've heard in a movie in a long time. Love is. It was Anne Hathaway is the female star. And I felt it was actually like a really great piece that they just needed to insert somewhere. Like, let's just have her say it now. It just seemed totally out of left field and had nothing to do with the movie. Yeah, but we need new words, that's for sure. Well, how about this though? I mean, because I don't have that feeling about the word forgiveness. A mentor of mine would often say, forgive everyone everything right now. Like, what if we could? Like, just that's really powerful. Like, we didn't have to like have all these things clinging to us. Like, can you imagine if, if you could do that, what would actually drop away? Like all the millions of things weighing us down. I don't know. That's what I'm getting a visual of. I love it. But I have no problem in general. Yeah, forgiving people. Yeah, really easily forgive people. But forgiving myself. It is impossible. I can't like, I can, if I do something completely ridiculous, something me, sometimes I get really angry. I'll say awful things, awful things. And then I look back at that place, especially from the perspective of what I learned from these retreats, and think, why are you even going to these retreats if that's inside of you? I'm just kidding. I, but, but it, because what I mean is, if you don't, if you're lucky enough, and I chug him trumpet says, if you cannot go down the spiritual path, just don't do it, because it's, it really isn't like as pleasant as a lot of people like to say that it is. Or like you like to imagine it is when you see like the image of the Buddha and that beautiful smile on his face and that complete attunement to love, you wouldn't think, oh man, that guy must have gone through some serious shit to get to that place. You just think that's where I'll be. But I don't, I, if you're unconscious and you're just a jerk, and you're sort of rampaging through this dimension as a jerk, and there are some real jerks out there completely unconscious on a rampage. All they think in their life is, man, people are, people are assholes. I'm the punisher. I got to inflict justice on these sons of bitches as much as I can before I die. And they do that and do that and do that. And they have some weird miserable death. And that's it. But if you start watching yourself and really contemplating the idea that you do have free will and that you have the ability to open yourself up to this love force and yet still knowing that noxious stuff comes out of you from time to time, it's incredibly frustrating. The key there, you just, everybody's got that noxious shit coming out of them. Why are you any different? Because I want to be better than everyone. Oh. But I, I don't mean that. That was a cheap attempt at a dumb joke, but please go on, Saraswati. Sorry. No problem. You know, I remember I, I was going through a kind of, well, a very difficult time, a tremendous disappointment. And I happened to be, had that experience, like just imagine a tremendous disappointment. And it really made me question like everything I had done, spiritual practices, like, you know, guru, shmuru, you know, that kind of thing. And I was just so like, oh, but I also happened to be on my way to Maui and I got a chance to sit with Ramdas and share that. And he had such an interesting kind of, you know, thing to say about it. He's like, oh, he's, you know, he's so beautiful. He's like, oh, look what, look what Maharaj is squeezing out of you. Wow. Look at that. That's cool. Like a purification. It made me, I had a whole different relationship with like all of my loss of faith and just scowling and, you know, if I, if I don't get grace when I want it, then what good is grace? Right. Yeah, sure. It's like, or for me, the question that comes into my mind after I've thrown my iPad into the wall in a rage is I think to myself, am I a fraud? Should I stop talking about this stuff until I get to a point where I'm not throwing expensive electronic equipment into the wall of my house? That's what it, that's what, that's where it gets to me is I think, oh, you know, you don't know anything. You really haven't done the work at all. If you're at a point where you'll get to so angry that you'll destroy an iPad over nothing, over what is this? Ultimately nothing. Right. This should be, this is a line to help actually. Yeah. Just get in that line, right? Yes. That's where you're at. That's what it feels like. You're in that line. It feels like they're. You're the worst person I've ever met. You know what? What? This, I'm going to tell everybody what you did. We're at the retreat. We're walking. This retreat, by the way, was at a beautiful cove in Maui. Whales jumping and dolphins and. Turtles. Turtles. Just a fantastic place. We're chanting every night with Prishnadas and it's like, you know, wonderful. Yeah. Melodies and the rhythms and you get into a trance and every day and it builds up and all these meditate. You know, it's just a, the food is great. We're hanging out with people and he says to me, actually he did, he and I did a podcast, which we haven't done anything with, by the way. Oh, I was wondering what's going on with that. And at the retreat and in it, he talked about, you talked about Choghi and Trumpa. Yeah. Who says, you know, at a certain point, it's easy to grab your new spiritual ego and make that the thing. Yeah. And it's like no, you know, no better than where you were at before coming completely egocentrically just from a different platform. Basically. Right. Yes. And then we walked outside and he says, yeah, like being in this place is sick. I mean, you know, this restaurant, people are eating Dakaris. Dakaris. Dakaris. Wow. I didn't know they had Dakaris. Yeah. It's a Montreal. It's a neighborhood. People from Montreal. Anybody who's listened to this, you'll know what I mean. Dakaris. Okay. Dakaris. Yeah. Dakaris. Dakaris. So and we're walking along and the food and everything is fantastic. We are full of shit. Aren't we? Yeah. Right. I don't know if those are my exact words. Something like that. But yeah, I don't know. I wouldn't say full of shit. It's just this. We're having a good time and we should be in, you know, wearing cloth of horse hair and being whipped a couple of times. I don't think we should wear horse hair cloth. Being whipped can be awesome sometimes, but the essence of the thing is, well, I'm still in the place way before where you're freaking out on the acid and not where you're suddenly, you've had that beautiful surrender, that beautiful moment. I remember the quintessential LSD experience, the ultimate LSD experience I ever had was when I was just out of high school, I was sitting on the sofa with a friend listening to classical music, Beethoven or Mozart or just listening to the music and listening to the notes. And then I started thinking, oh, oh, these notes, so they came out of someone's mind. You know, someone, this music was in someone's mind and then I'm listening and then I started thinking, what part of me is, wait, what part of me is thinking these thoughts? Like where, if these notes came in someone's mind and I'm thinking about these notes coming in someone's mind, these thoughts have come into my mind. So where are the thoughts coming from? Where are they originating from? And in that moment, man, I had that big acid, like, you're just gone, man, and it's glorious. The feeling is exhilarating, expansive, peaceful, wonderful, awesome. But the lead up to that is, it's like flying into a black hole or something. It's just turbulence and insanity and for me, that translates into some, I like, I love the Buddhist term fundamental dissatisfaction, an acute sense of a kind of underlying, un-dealt with quarry of shit inside of me. After the experience? You have this go on after you have this sartori? I have this, the more that I practice mindfulness, the more that I meditate, the more that I go to these retreats, the more I become more acutely aware of this, like, I don't know what you call it. Is it like a sort of angst? Yeah, it's just a feeling of like fraudulent anger and... Oh yeah, how could this be happening when you are who you are? You shouldn't even been listening to this, right? Any of the teachings, reading, they shouldn't be doing it because even, because you're so bad that touching this stuff could dirty it up. Well, right, yeah, I know you're joking, but I, the, and I know that's what they're... That's how crazy, paying attention to your thoughts, it's just, I mean, you're having fun. Right. And it's good, you know. Well, that's interesting. I mean, I think what you've said to me pretty often is that you're really enjoying this. You're like digging in, you're feeding your pathology, you know, the part, and we do, we perpetuate our own pathology. You know, one of another, same mentor said, you know, you want to get healthy or maybe we could say, get rid of suffering, change everything you like, you know, just do the opposite of everything you have been doing, and that helps you to get, you know, so it's actually not very, very mysterious. Right. So you're saying that it's just sort of like getting off on the, the, I'm so used to feeling like crappy or, in my case, I can turn anything into sadness or grief, I can tell you, we were at a beautiful thing yesterday and it became suddenly all about me and my loss, you know, and had nothing to do with that, but that just got triggered. Okay, yeah. You know, and then, you know, I think Krishnodar said something just so beautiful. He can be so staggeringly beautiful sometimes, but he said, you know, we do practices because Maharaji is always there, it's just, we're not, you know, and so like we do these practices to try to be in that field that we can resonate with who we really are, not so much this part that feels like the fraud or feels angry or, you know, not that part. It's daunting though. I mean, and I don't want to hang out with that part and I do know, I mean, I am someone who can really get off on like being down in the dumps or, and there were times in my life where I was really into that. Now I'm at a place I just don't like it. I wish it wasn't, I don't want to be like that and I don't like it at all. Here's, here's a, here's something you really don't like as well. What? I wanted to, I wanted to illustrate, you know, this whole self reflection of being this horrible person, horrible thoughts, blah, blah, blah, and it's a story of when I was with Maharaji back then. See Duncan, also in that podcast, didn't we talk about it then? Or we talked about it with Krishna Das. It was that you can't relate to this story. I wanted to get to the Maharaji story. Yeah. It's the stories of our experiences with Neem Karoli Baba. You can't? No. Well, no, I, the, not, here's the thing. It's not that I can't. I have his picture all over my house. It's on every, it's, I have him in a lot of places and I think about him all the time and I love him because of you guys and the retreat. That's why I, that's where I feel really connected to whatever that guy was because I can feel the imprint on you and you and the people that I've run into there and it's undeniable. It's real. And so I know that there was something there. I don't know what, but there's something there. You know, on my message board, when people start talking about Neem Karoli Baba, quite often many of them are like, yeah, I don't believe any of these stories of his anything really. People are quite skeptical. It's hard for people to connect to the notion of a guru. So, and I, I, I wish there was another word for Maharaji. I wish there was a way to express that wherever you're at this fill in the blank, this, tendency in the universe for healing to happen or this, this, I mean, when we say Maharaji Neem Karoli, but we could say there are, especially that we knew in the last century, a number of these kinds of beings that were no longer living in duality. They were no I involved with them and we met a few of them, Maharaja, I can say I legitimately met two of them, Maharajina, a woman, a saint named Sidha named Ananda Mahima, who's very famous. Anyhow, it is, they, it's localized in a body while they got a body, but when they don't have one, it's, they, it's just, they're just an extension. They are resting in that place that all these books talk about, which is completely at one with what the essence, and we can call it divine intelligence, God, whatever you want. The Buddhists have names, everybody has a different name for it. And that's what this is. And for us now, although I tell you these stories because I, I, I think at times they illustrate something that relates to the presence of what we're talking about in the present. And in this case, it was your reference to how you think of yourself, right? Yes. So I, I was sitting in front, I was about 20, 30 feet in front. I've told this story before, but it's good in this context on mind row. He was asked for these stamps that we all had. We all had a, somebody had created a posted size stamps of Maharaja and sheets, sheets and sheets of them. He'd ask for them and you'd give them too many. Instead of giving two to each of the 20 people sitting around, you give them all to the worst jerk you ever saw in your life, you didn't know what. And he asked for them one day and I was sitting far away, not that far, like 20 feet. I wasn't right up there. And I thought, I've got some, but I don't have that many. So I'm going to rip mine in half. I'll give him half and I'll keep half. And that's all right. No problem, right? Yeah. So I did that. And it wasn't like he's, you know, omniscient powers. I was right in front of him and I ripped it. I didn't deny him anything. I went up and gave it to him. He threw him back at me and screamed at me, night! And that's how it is. No. Go away. And for one week, I don't know if we didn't see him for a week, I was close to suicide. I mean, I really was like, I had to kill myself for being the worst jerk that ever lived and how in the world I could be in such a, I did what you just talked. The story, I told myself that story. I went back there after a week. I still had the stamps. He said, anybody got any stamps? I said, I threw, I got all them out and I put them on the bed, on the tucket, on the bench. Did he keep them? He didn't say a word to me, right? It didn't look at me. He took them and he turned the other way and he gave them all to somebody else. And there was nothing he's talking about. Literally two minutes later, he pointed his finger at me and didn't say a word. And that it's a famous mudra of his either meaning everything is one or watch out, motherfucker. I got the watch out. It was all transparent and then I could, you know, once you're stopped being judged by somebody who has nothing going on that doesn't care about your input, it's a one way street. And once you're not judged, you know, and it's a whole other picture. So this is the, in this kind of yoga where you have a guru, he's sort of embodying like these built in aspects to all of life, which is that life in general, if you try to rip your stamps in half and save some for yourself and trick, trick life, life inevitably will scream no, that's for sure. And so they kind of like embody that in their teachings that you get to experience the very same thing you're going to experience if you're a selfish person. You've been ripping my ignorance. I made that move. But it's just completely obviously I did it. And I was right in front wasn't like, geez, maybe I'll go in the back. Yeah, these up in half. He won't know which at that point, I couldn't believe he didn't know anything because he knew everything that was going on. All right. So I, it was just ignorance. I acted. Okay. You want to talk free will. Yeah. It's where it gets interesting. And I got this teaching back that I'm sitting here and we're talking about it today, right? How many, you know, decades, got it. Right. So this is a huge, so it's like, you read a book. If you read a book, you could read, I don't know, any kind of child's fable will say share or give or don't be, don't be, give, give more than you should give even whatever. It's like, it's not a, it's not, that's the problem. We've heard it so many goddamn times in so many different ways. Don't hang on to all the stamps. Don't cut the stamps in half. Give everything you can away. We've heard it so many times that it stopped meaning anything. And which is why this teacher function is so important because they can embody what happens to you and your life if you keep cutting your stamps in half. And even more though is stop having so much self interest going on relative to judging yourself. Right, right. It's a tremendous self interest or what do the Buddhists call it, self cherishing. Selfishness. It's self, it's just, right, it's selfish. If you're thinking about, yeah, I'm so angry, you know, it's a fraud. It's really what you're doing is thinking about yourself. Exactly, exactly that. I mean, I think it's possibly more insidious than that. It's a habit. And the definition of a habit is something we do unconsciously. So by bringing ourselves into mindfulness more of the time and mindfulness is, I mean, that's why they say you don't just do mindfulness on the cushion. You do mindfulness while you're doing the dishes and do mindfulness, you know, so that you can notice what your experience is and something arising. Oh, something arising. And maybe there's a way you can just zoom out and I love that practice of noticing if something's, oh, is this pleasant or is this unpleasant and like leaving it. At that. Just that. So the note, this is like Cornfield's noting idea, which is that when a thing arises, you call it anxiety, anger, fear, and bow to it. It's really good. So this is cool because what you're saying, because, you know, quite often I have things emerging in me that I have no idea what the name for the thing is, you know, like he, he talks about it's like you're sitting in the forest in a rare and like you're going to watch the woodland animals that usually you don't see because you're scaring them all away. Oh, look, a bird, a coyote. But like when I'm doing this meditation, there's things where it's like, that's something that I don't, that's like something out of a crack underneath the forest that's like got a lot of eyes and I'm not sure what you'd call it. But this, I love that because then you're not stuck naming, trying to verbalize. It's so much, so much more simple. Pleasant, unpleasant. Yeah. I love that. Yeah. And you can do that in any given moment. You can do that in any given moment. Yeah. In fact, I mean, that's a, that's a typical step in the mindfulness training is, you know, how to work with thoughts or how to work with emotions and, you know, notice when you get down a groove because these grooves, you know, they're inner psyche, inner body and then, you know, and then they're not their beliefs, their thoughts, they're, you know, emotions, all of that stuff. And so I think, I think this work with consciousness really does lighten up or kind of that groove. Yeah. And we're less inclined to fall into that. So I, I really, I don't know if you noticed, but I just like, you know, when you were talking about that fraud stuff, you know, 10 minutes ago or something, it really, it really moved me because I just don't see that person very much at all. I mean, of course, you know, you don't see how I feel on the inside either, but, you know, I see so many other things I would say first before that, before that. But it's, you know, I like addressing the innate sense of fraudulence that seems to exist. I know it's in me and I know that it must be in other people too. And the, the deeper I get into doing sitting meditation and doing mindfulness meditation throughout the day. And the more I do watch things arise and you get down into the personality, you know, into the sub, you start getting into these weird sub basements of yourself that you didn't even know were there. And all, it's like you're, you know, like when you clear a clog sink and it's incredible what's down there, especially if it's been a long time since you've cleared the sink. And like it's, it's disgusting as you're like pulling hair and, and, and you get through that one layer, but then you get underneath the hair and maybe stuff has been down there so long. It's just stopped even looking like hair. It's turned into this weird, and it's spit and toothpaste and like gelatinous just gelatinous stuff. And it's cool though, because it's the same thing. Like there's a, you know, is it popping videos on YouTube? There's probably millions of views, millions of views of people who enjoy watching the zits explode out of people. But so there's, so it's weird because like you, as you're pulling this, as you're getting into mindfulness and watching, you start getting into these sub basements and it starts with like, I mean, the other day I was just sitting, was laying in bed, I've been meditating and all of a sudden I clearly remembered a pottery frog from my grandmother's house when I was six that I was fascinated with. Just a pottery frog. Somehow in the, the work, that little memory got dislodged from down there and just came floating up into my head. No reason for it to be there. I completely forgot about the frog. It was cool. I mean, I knew it. It's a vivid thing that you see, you know, you start dislodging all this stuff. And then, then when you get underneath that place, there's, you begin to get into the inner workings of your personality, the gears, the habitual gears of even what I'm doing now, the way I'm moving my hands and talking and the thing that I'm trying to get at and I want to get at something and I guess I really want to get at something that feels not real. There's an unreal quality to it. It feels, I don't know. I don't know what I would be underneath that, but that part of the thing just seems a little real. That's where Jack talks about, it's okay to be human, you're okay. Look at us. You know how he goes into that rap? I love it. Yeah, I love that too. Yeah. So that's it. You just got to turn, I mean, we do, do this all the time. It's just turning it around and saying, it's okay, you're just human. And you know, the biggest thing and the compassionate thing, which is we're talking about what Jack teaches and Sharon solves, people we talk about all the time, and in those courses there for 10 days, you get very deep and yet it dislodged stuff, starts to float to the surface. Some of it's not very pleasant at all. And that is the nature of the path allowing for the fact that a lot of unpleasantness will have to be gone through. That's certainly the truth. Like in this particular retreat, you know one retreat, somebody had started to have a toothache, right? And they actually went up to the Goenka, who is a teacher, a famous Vipassana teacher. He said, just keep, part of the things you sweep through your body with once you have one pointedness, so you're completely at one with every sensation. So this guy would get to his tooth, he'd get kind of stuck there. Okay, by the end of the course, they had to take him to the hospital, his jaw was so swollen out that they didn't want to take responsibility for it anymore. So talk about stuff coming up and what happens and how powerful meditation really can be. If you go to one of these 10 day retreats, she's got great stories, you got a nice story. These 10, a lot of people don't know that there is a thing called Vipassana meditation, which I guess is called insight meditation as well. So poly word for insight and I think part of that ceramic frog, and also it's associated with word mindfulness, they're all related and part of the same tradition. And so mindfulness is either being with your experience, direct experience exactly as it is, so that's certainly noticing what's arising, pleasant, unpleasant, neutral. Or creating like a field or maybe another part of it, another branch, another way to practice, is to create a field to submerge into this place where actually you do have insight, does bubble up, where you do put two and two together, you have a breakthrough. Oh, that's why I'm angry, oh, that's why I feel fraudulent or blah, you know, whatever, and then it's sort of cleared and so I kind of, you know, my perspective, I'm a medical person and so I'm often thinking about health and how this conversation, what those touch points are with health and you know, health, the word, the origin, the etymology means something like whole, comes from whole. So if you can, if we can think about, you know, these experiences, these habits or feeling states that bring us so down or experiences, which is what we're talking about, regrets and forgiving ourselves and just all of it, just they get pocketed away, our conscious mind doesn't want to, you know, so all of it's pocketed away and fragmenting us and we wonder why we feel disconnected and like we have to reach to the, you know, the outer world and fill it up with stuff until we realize stuff doesn't do it and we start looking inside, inside, to find a doorway to this wisdom body that we were talking about on the sofa. And I love this idea, this, what you're talking about is the other thing that's been coming to my mind, it's a lot of this coming from this Goldstein book you recommended, Ragu, it's so good, but the, the one thing he says is that quite often a human moves to alleviate suffering, where movement itself is to like when, you know, you crack your neck or you move your, it's your, you're doing massage something, you touch it and it feels better. Yes. And the idea is that this action, whatever it is, and a very popular movement these days is to take your phone out of your pocket and stare into it for as long as you possibly can. That's one of the big, big movements of the day. Everyone's making it all day long. Look at the phone and I think that you can tell the extent of a person's suffering by the number of times they look at a phone in any given minute or two minutes or three minutes. That's probably true. Because they want to get away, they want to get away so much from this suffering, from this pain, from whatever it is. For me, it might be a feeling of like not accurately representing myself or it might be a feeling of anger underneath everything or underneath that, of course, must just be terror. But when you realize that you are playing video games all the time, not because the video games are fun, but because you don't want to deal with the clogged sink of your heart, or if when you realize that you're looking at your phone all the time, it's not because you're busy or have any interest in communicating with anyone that much that you need to stare at your phone like you're Batman waiting for like word to come in when to save a building from being blown up. When you realize that's all because you're desperately trying to run away from this thing inside of you. It's wonderful, but it definitely will throw your pattern off in a pretty serious way. Well, I think also, sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off, Ragu, but it's, I think it's important to also, I mean, I find myself saying this all the time because I'm always giving people advice as a medical person. They come in and they ask me, what should I do for this? And I give them advice. But I think the most important thing that we can all do is live with our eyes wide open. It's like, I might choose to marathon whatever series I have left yet to marathon, but I know I'm doing it. It's not like I stopped. What do you mean marathon? What do you mean? Oh, you know, like if you watch, you know, five episodes or something. Yeah, yeah, sure. Okay, right. Or, you know, listen to five of your podcasts back to back, which I've been known to do also in mind rolling, you know, just like that. It's, but do it with my eyes wide open. Like, I know I'm checking out from something and, you know, or maybe or I'm bored or, you know, boredom, boredom. Now see, boredom, this is what I've been thinking about. Basically, and it all relates to what we're talking about here. The state of boredom is actually not the state boredom is another word for Duka, isn't it? It's another word for the fundamental dissatisfaction that exists in human experience and that when you're feeling bored, it's not that you're at a lost for things to do. You're numb. Are you numb or is it that you just been, you don't have anything distracting you from the fact that there's a blistering karmic series of sores inside of you that if you don't put the bomb of mindfulness on, just cankers and that this attention and mindfulness seems to be the only thing that has any impact on it. But boredom, is it boredom? Or is it just like, oh, shit, I'm not able to ignore the what it this is. Boredom is people not wanting to just be present and be here in the moment and we're all suffering. But I agree with you. I think it is an aspect of Duka. I mean, I think that's what you're saying. I want to go back to fraudulent. Yes. I like fraudulent. You know what I think? What? I think the thing isn't feeling fraudulent, but not wanting to conceive, perceive, be involved, hear anything that's bullshit. And including whatever comes out of your mind. That's a great way to put it. And but, you know, we're, I understand that well. And sometimes what can happen, of course, you can get a little too cynical, because you're overly judgmental on everything. Right. But I like him, particularly your people, people in general. No, he does a really good job at it. Of being overly, overly judgment, one of my talents. Yes. But yeah, no, it's common, common to everybody. You know what happens, though? I think at a certain point, discrimination starts to happen. So you kind of, okay, you know what's bullshit and you know what's not bullshit. Like go back to this retreat, which is taking place in luxurious circumstances. Yes. With incredible teachers. And yet there's always a sense of like feeling guilty. Yes. That how could we be here getting is this real or is this bullshit? You know, fun. And, and there, but there's a discriminating part of you that knows I'm hearing something and I'm feeling something. And I'm connecting in a way that I know is completely real. Yes, whatever's happening on the physical plane is obviously a manifestation of God knows what, it sure is nice on that plane. Yeah. But ultimately, I am coming here and getting what it is that I need. You know that. That's discrimination. That's right discrimination. It's called in the Indian thing, the Becca. And that's a highly important thing to develop. And it takes, you know, it's working the more you're into your intuitive part and less in your mind, then the more that you can connect with that. And then the less that you're worried that you're going to, this is bullshit. I don't know. This is bullshit. This is, you know, the less that that starts, it starts, stops you. It does not stop you. Right. Yeah, I, yeah, I don't, man, I really don't, I probably just misrepresent, I didn't say in the right, I don't, I think the retreats are fantastic. And I don't know nothing to do with that. I think it's great to have them in Hawaii too, because it shows you how powerful the mind is. Because that's what I love, like practicing mindfulness in Hawaii. And then realizing that you, that you're the only pull, you know, people are worried about Fukushima, the waters polluting Hawaii. But then you realize you're, you have a Fukushima inside of you that's, and that's the only thing that's tainting the experience is this inability to accept love. That's what you get from those things. Got it. That's it. So it's like you're, but you even the recognition of like, Oh, I'm in an active war here. I'm actively fighting off accepting how incredible life can be. And that is really, it doesn't stop it. Just realizing it doesn't stop it. You're still going to give hugs that aren't as good as they could be. You're still, you know what I mean? You're not here. Yeah. Duality, fear, separation. And that kind of brings us back to the beginning of letting go or softening and into something into something else. The Dallas, and I bring this a lot into yoga. Dallas have a great concept of it's something like you can't be sensitive enough. And like that we thin our skin so much that we can just we are connected to each other that we are part of like there's nothing more that separates that. In fact, I mean, all of these wisdom traditions say that, you know, everything's one, but you know, I'm sitting over here, you're sitting over there. So how, how does that equal one? Yes. So that actually the space that is between us gets thinner and thinner and thinner. I mean, it's just gorgeous and that we can actually reverse engineer ourselves to that place. We start with the body, lots of practices with the body, hafi yoga, pranayama, so forth, vibration technologies to kind of change, sounding, chanting, all these, but you change your kind of state of consciousness and then change the mind and change the spirit so that you, you know, you, you feel that connection, you have that connection. And then so that sort of loops around into feeling love, like that being, you know, part of the outcome, or part of what we toneify or grow at the retreat is we, we learn to take it. Yeah. Can I do a commercial? Yeah, sure, of course. A commercial. Yes, for you. Well, yeah, because you just said this beautiful thing and really it represents who you are and your work out there. And I thought it was really well said. And so anybody who wants to take part in being able to be part of a retreat or an ongoing teacher training that will teach you just what Saraswati has been talking about, and you absolutely need to go to nourishinglife.com. Oh, that's cool. Don't know. Saraswati is making motions not to do that. Well, there you go. Look who's not accepting love. See, it's everyone, everybody, active work, fighting it off, fighting it off. You don't want it. And it's a, it's a curious, it's a curious thing. And I, and, and but the older you get, the less it can be kind of charming or something to be like a John Wayne style, like a guy or girl. But the older you get, the more you, you, you realize this is like putting a tourniquet around my existence. And why am I doing it? Why can't I, because you see at the retreat, an entire spectrum of people, you see people who have, who are just accepting the love, they're not thinking, what am I doing and why this is, I feel terrible. They're just like, this is awesome. I love this. I get to be here and it's so great. And I feel great. You get those people, then you get people who have gone from being an I and seem to be more of just, they're not, they are the, the, you know, the love radiators like Ramdas, you know, the people who are just really, really just put you and your yoga class and you, the way you put these whole things together and don't really get any credit for it like you should. And you're assembling the entire thing. Thank you so much for saying that. It's so true. It's huge. It's, it's, it's amazing. But you just do it. You don't, you just do it. So you get these, you get people like you are putting out this thing and then many of the people just attending the retreat are just so authentically beautiful and not in a schlocky, crystal gazing nonsense way. But like, you don't want to be out of their presence very long because they're so cool and, and, and like Mirabai, like, I'll never forget getting to have dinner with her and just talk. It's not the feeling of like, oh, I am around a truly sacred being. It's like, oh, this is like hanging out with my aunt who I never had. Or this is, I feel like I'm with someone who's in my family. It's the weirdest thing. And so you get this great spectrum, but then in somehow in the midst of all that, you realize like, well, I seem to be completely incapable of digesting this or fully embracing it without either, well, I don't know. It's, there's no reason. It's just like, it's a real fresh, it's a frustration for me. I want to be able to accept it no matter what it is. It's not just the retreat. It's like anything in general. I think so many people when a thing comes to them that's good, it seems like a trick. It seems like a, I don't know. I've, I don't know. Maybe I hang out with too many comedians. But you guys, this, there is a, an active war raging in the world right now is the most destructive war that has ever happened. And it's been going on forever. And it's the war where people are trying desperately to not accept love from the rest of the world. And when you find yourself on the wrong side of that war, it's like, fuck, God damn it. I don't want to be like, I want to be, I want to be like you guys. I want to be sweet and open and not secretly somewhere inside of me being like, this is all bullshit, right? This is total bullshit. I can't get past that part. I don't think it is. I don't think it is. I think it's the greatest thing I've ever come in contact with, but I still can't like fully dissolve into it. So sorry for that long rant. Heal me. Well, I mean, does it have to be a race? Does there have to be a timeline? You know, and like, are we measuring like, well, how legitimate is my spiritual practice today? Is it more than yesterday or less than yesterday? I mean, is it like, you know, why can't it just be what it is? You know, and just have fun and ignore yourself. Just have fun and ignore yourself. That is the greatest. That is going to be my new mantra. That's so cool. But isn't that bad? Isn't family our sticker? Just have fun and ignore yourself. Okay, let me let's break that sentence down. Just have fun. Meaning I bother judging anything. Yeah, yourself. Any thought that happens is not worth one extra thought. What about stop ignoring yourself so that you can actually have fun? Well, you that's the next the first if the stop following the thoughts and then that part of that is just ignoring yourself following the thought. Oh, I got you. So it's not it's not it's like, okay, the neighbor's got an awful dog. The dog's barking so much that I can't enjoy my day. Call the police and then ignore your thoughts after that. Right, right. So it's just like you just sort of deal with the dog. Let's imagine the dog can't do whatever it is. You got to deal with it. So ignore the dog's thoughts. It's not going away. The actions. Right. So and so you're saying that perhaps the mistake to make would be when these thoughts emerge? Because in that mindfulness book, one of the teachers was saying you grab it and pull it pull it to you. Like when the thought comes you like or like, which is something I've really been enjoying. I've been enjoying doing it. The thought comes with a associated feeling tone. And then while it's there as much as I can, I try to like zoom in on it, put it under a microscope, what is it made of? This is what I've been trying to do. What's it made of? What's the substance of a thought? Does it have a substance with Joseph Goldstein wrote the book? I would love that. Actually, if you could ever get with him and anyone else out there as a teacher of mindfulness, there isn't any better person in this country. And I would highly suggest inside inside meditation I am s. Yeah, that book has been blowing my mind. But yeah, I mean, it just that's probably not a great thing. You know, there are many different ways to deal with thoughts arising. And the the jacks one seems might might be a little bit better. I don't know. I like I like I like what you're describing because the thought becomes it's like a lead or a tentacle that if you follow it back to its root, you might be able to like unhook it, you know. And so I mean, what what you're saying is that instead of using the breath or body scan as the focal agent or the you know, you're using the thought itself. Yeah, you're gathering your mind around whatever thought is arise. And you're really holding that rather than going from thought to thought to thought or talking more, you know, having commentary, naming, naming, yeah, naming. But it's it's this naming. Oh, here's the or here's the feeling or whatever it is. And there it is peaking, you can watch it. You know, since I've been doing, you know, you guys know this, you watch it emerge. And it really does like I've been saying, it's like we were snorkeling and we saw a sea turtle sort of go off into the water. And it just goes from being this incredible thing dot and then it's gone. And it seems like these thoughts have the same kind of process or fluctuation to them. But yeah, it's like when the thing comes in into me, particularly like anger, when it's there, I try to really like zoom in as far as I can into the because I what is it? I mean, I know it's a neurological, it's some combinates some neuro electrical activity that must be happening in some it must be a it must be in it must be inside of my brain. So I then I think, oh, this is what is this is what is that specifically what is the vibration of a thought or a feeling? What is it at its atomic level? What is that thing? Do you know what it is? Is it I've read that I've heard the term vritti in this yoga sutras of Patanjali. This is like energetic cyclone or something. But is there anything in the scriptures related to or in the teachings related to what is the fundamental composition of a feeling or a thought? What's it made of? I mean, I think that vritti means fluctuation or a twisted or, you know, something like that. But in Chinese medicine, I mean, if we can go to that place, you know, each emotion has a different frequency. It has a just like, you know, it vibrates in a certain way in our body. And, you know, people have different constitutions, given, you know, the line of people that they came from. And so once you take a body, yes, you know, when you're not in a body, you don't have so much of that. But once you take a body, then you're going to, you know, have all of the whole range of experience with your constitution leaning you off in a particular vibration. Okay, got it. Yeah, sure. Like that. I mean, sure. That's how that's how we think about it and then work to antidote that with opposing vibrations or opposing vibrations. How do you do that? I mean, it's a little more complicated than this, this moment. But, you know, what I'm talking about is a system of the five elements and figuring out which, you know, is part of what I do and part of what I weave into a yoga practice actually is working through the five elements towards that goal of wholism, that health being whole being integration like that. So we work through all the different vibratory experiences of which emotion is truly, truly a vibration and just one more quick point. I think it's so interesting and I love this analogy. The ancient ones would describe emotions. They would equate them to weather patterns like, oh, there's a storm rolling through, and then it's rolling out like it's not me, and it's not of me. It's the thing that's passing through. I get that. I like that. I like that too. Is it so easy to feel like I am this anger when it's actually just, it's a storm passing through? Yeah, no, yeah, it feels like that. When you watch it, it feels exactly like that. And it feels the other shocking thing I've been getting from this is how you really start realizing how natural you are. Like you start realizing how the sound of your breath going in and out of your nose, it sounds like when you're listening to wind coming in on the beach, or when you're in wilderness and like winds rolling through a forest, and then you realize, oh, that is what I am. I'm just a moving version of it. But that's pretty shocking. So I do get why I love that you're using the elements, because that's something that has been coming to me lately is it sounds so weird, but how natural of nature that I am. And when you're not meditating, or when you're sort of in your head a bunch, you don't even, you feel completely separated from that idea. And I know you don't have time to explain it now. We're probably already going over the time that you guys have, but so we would say anger is a fiery feeling, maybe. It certainly belongs to an aggressive energy. We can put it there and typically anger, resentment, even sometimes depression, you know, like something, energy not moving or either being stuck, you know, like that, or it can anger, sometimes really moves outward and moves outward fast. So an aggressive, either a blocked energy or an aggressive energy. And so they're very predictable. So you figure out, is this blocked? Is this aggressive? What kind of anger is it? Exactly. And then we know we can very predictably figure out which energy lines that is, you know, manifesting in. An energy line in your body. Yeah. An energy line in your body. And then we give asana and pranayama and sounding, you know, when you make sound like chanting, it sends a vibration. So which chakra, you know, it's all this whole mapping. I think you should take the teacher training program that she's giving. I would love to. That's really cool. What you're talking about is really cool, man. That is alchemical, heavy alchemical. That's magic. That is like that reminds me of Crowley. It reminds me that's high magic that you're talking about there. That's super cool. And so detailed. And this is where does this come from? It's Taoist pretty much Taoist, but it's really, it's blended in with yoga. Because I love, you know, I mean, Taoists, they talked a lot about, you know, Lao Tzu, the Dao De Ching, the Yi Ching, all of those, all of those works. But what I get from yoga, bhakti yoga, you know, these feeling states, this sort of, it's, I had to combine the two, you know, I had to combine the two. And so that's really where the two traditions and there's, it's Taoism meets bhakti yoga. It is. That's the yoga. And honestly, a good amount of Buddhist ideology is in there as well. Whoa, cool. There'll be 50 women in the class. Oh, Duncan, I can't do that. Have you been investigating this in previous podcast? Have you been this, this line of, yes, this line of, well, a little bit in the one that I did before a little bit, but I, you know, I have sort of after the retreat, I decided that I was going to try to do the work and start a real practice as opposed to a reading style practice or a contemplation, distant, vague thinking about, about the stuff you guys talk about once every couple of days, move that into a, okay, I'm going to try to sit every day. And then I'm going to, it was much as I can follow my breath throughout the day. And then I've been pulling it off, not completely. I've missed days of meditation, but it's still a, I've been made an active intention to like do it. Have you shared this with your listeners? I don't, I don't know. I don't know if I've sort of, I mean, they're going to, yeah, I don't know that I've completely, I haven't been talking about the fact that I've been, I haven't yet to talk about the fact that I've been trying to, I've been trying to accelerate my meditation practice much, but I have been doing that since the retreat. Walk the talk. Yeah. Yeah. And move it from the mind into the heart where it can really, where the transformation really can take place. That's it. Yeah. And that's it. And you're all over the spiritual circuit now too. You know that with Tammy Simon, you did a... Oh yeah. Sounds true. Yeah. And she's got a whole thing. It's like couching it and you're giving specific teachings in this particular thing. Unsounds true. Yeah. You see, that's the problem. Well, you know what? I don't think it is because, you know, what you and I, what we talked about just before we started this show was about authenticity and how that there's a place that you can drop into that sort of, that you don't even like to think about so much. I was talking about that also because I don't remember always what I say when I teach and that it's like a well. That's how I know the podcast has been good is I don't remember what we talked about. Yeah. So there's like this well and authenticity I think is you can speak to that really nicely, you know? Yes. Yes. Yes. I mean, the whole tapestry of it. I mean, authenticity doesn't necessarily mean that things always feel good. You know, as you talk about this, and I agree with you, I think anyone can tune into a higher consciousness and things can come out of them that are amazing. And if you ask, you know, if you ask Jimi Hendrix what was happening when he was out there playing guitar, he's not, I bet he wouldn't be like, I'm just really good. I'm just a great, really, really good. He's something else is coming through him, something else is coming through. And God forgive me, please, oh great Lord in heaven and all gods that exist forever, even remotely comparing myself to Jimi Hendrix. I didn't mean to do that. I just felt as I did that. But in a very, very deep, deep, low level, like all beings on earth could tune into this thing and it'll come out of you if you just get out of the way enough for sure. I believe that. That's what he used to say, by the way. What? Exactly that. I don't do anything. I'm just getting out of the way. All of anybody who it happens to is that's the only thing. I just have to say, I saw Jimi Hendrix live. You wouldn't think that being good. That is so cool. Yeah, well, I think maybe, I'm not quite sure, early. I was young, four maybe. But apparently, well, it's because Jimi Hendrix opened for the monkeys. And I wanted to see the monkeys. Yeah. That's amazing. Well, you know. So I know about this, but you know the term physician heal thyself. You know that term? Or something Jesus said is, take the, before you try to get the stick out of your neighbor's eye, take the log out of your eye. And I do, I love talking about this stuff. And I've said before that a lot of what I do, I think, is just regurgitating stuff that I've read. And I think I'm okay at like regurgitation, but I think it'd be really cool to actually have that transformation that it seems like a lot of you have done or, and I know there's no spiritual hierarchy. And I know we're all the same. And I know it's all one. I know, I know. But if you go to the gym enough, you get in shape. And it's undeniable that you're in shape. And it's undeniable. So there is a hierarchy in that part of the world. And there is a hierarchy that in comedy, if you go on stage enough, you'll start getting funnier and funnier and funnier. And if you're a painter, if you paint enough, you'll become a better painter. So I think I don't see if I don't understand exactly why that wouldn't apply to the concept of meditation as well. So maybe there is a kind of hierarchy, but what I'm saying is it'd be really cool to not be a regurgitator anymore. I would love that to not just be someone who was vomiting up something that was already good before I ate it mixed in with my own. We're against regurgitators. Let's do that too. What's that? We're against regurgitators. Yeah. We're going to do a whole. Well, what is it you say, Raghur? You say that you've gotten part of something like you've gotten really good at thinking less about yourself. You're the best at it. Obviously, I see that they... Absolutely. I mean, I have gotten over the years certainly less attached to my thoughts, emotions, all of that. I'm not following them the way that I used to. And I'm not at using them like, you know, when you get angry, you're talking about angry, which, you know, that happens to me. That's been my biggest pain. We've talked about it before. Yeah. And when you get angry, even if it's, you're just over something stupid and you're not that angry, you know, your computer did something and then suddenly you get enraged. Yes. You take everything in your whole life and you're going down that path. Yes. Of wanting to kill yourself. Yes. And anybody around you. Yes. That is just supreme indulgence. So after a while, you get that and you don't go down there. You actually just stop. You don't go down. That's so cool. Because you know it's okay. That's that bullshit. I'm not going to do that. That's just like a crack pipe. That's like taking a head off of a crack pipe. Exactly. Yeah. So, yeah, what you're saying is absolutely right. Practice makes perfect. Yes. And when we do that, again, you know, our friend Krishnadas will say something nice about he did say, you know, of course, he's great and all, but he did say something and it was about grace. Another shitty word out there, right? Yes. Oh, one of the words guru grace or, you know, when surrender, when Ramdas came first came back from India, right? After going there to try and find out what the hell everything was about, because acid wasn't doing the total thing. He came back and he said, you know, there's, I have a, I'm going to have a hard time. You're going to have a hard time because I'm going to have to talk about several things that are just absolutely unheard of in this lexicon in the West. Right. Guru grace surrender. Yeah. Can't talk, you know, of course, and then he went on and talked about it. And he talked about him in a way that you get it. Okay. It wasn't about you. It wasn't about you. Surrender wasn't about you getting grace, you know, that the you was taken out of it as he went through all this stuff. So, you know, I think it's really important to that once you get that you and you do that. So, you can do there's nothing to do but do this practice. So, what he said was grace is like when it rains. Okay. Grace is cupping your hand practice rather. I'm sorry. Sorry. Practice is cupping your hands together so you catch the rain. Wow. Okay. That's what it is. And if you don't practice, you just get wet. That's bad. That's so good. And that's how the movie ends. I don't tell you, I can't say how a movie ends. Spoiler. Not a dramatic movie, but I'm saying this these cultivating series and I highly tout them as something else to tell you. I thought you were talking about interest interstellar. No, no, no. Okay. On ramdas.org, there are three cultivating movies cultivating movies. And the last one was cultivating grace and transforming suffering. And it really is great. And in that he really is able in a poetic way as you know, Christian does. Yeah. Yeah. Say what that is. And what you're saying is exactly what it is. We just had a screening else to do, but practice. And it's not you can't think you're going to get anywhere. But of course, just like going to the gym, you're going to get stronger. But ultimately, I got to say though, I think you're kind of screwed. Why? Because I think like we're like we're all screwed. It's like once you turn towards the Dharma and this sort of like occurs to you to be true, like there's something in that direction for me. I don't think you can close the door on it. You can't. So I mean in that way, I think you're you know, I think you're kind of screwed. You guys, thank you so much. I'm so grateful to get to be friends with you and to have I just feel so lucky that I get to have this kind of interaction with anybody. So thank you so much because both of you are my teachers for real. And I'm very grateful to know it isn't you. Why do you always fight that? Because this is why you know, this was the same as me, you know, the cutoff, you know, you should take it. And I think you should start talking. You should slap me around. Well, I love you guys. And thank you for being on the show. Really? I'm going to have links to your class, links to these videos that you're just talking about.

I want to go back to 10 years ago. I want to go back to 10 years ago. I want to go back to 10 years ago. I want to go back to 10 years ago. I want to go back to 10 years ago. I want to go back to 10 years ago. I want to go back to 10 years ago. I love your story because the pillars of the thing are something that I've discovered that is very comforting to me, which is hard fucking work. That's the thing, man. There seems to be a universal form in people who have had any kind of real successes. That is what you have to work really hard. There isn't any way out of that. I think working for yourself is an incredible feeling, but still. Today, I work for myself. I love my job, but my back is fucked up. My back's fucked up because I've been picking up my kid and sitting at this freaking desk every day. You know what I mean? Editing podcast and it finds like, fuck you, fuck you. I was chatting with someone on the Patreon and they're like, you got to get a standing desk. I'm like, I don't want to admit I have a desk job. You know what I mean? But I do. I'm at a desk. The other interesting thing about the kind of fame and success that you have is your fans are like, you're everything to them. Because they found you through God know it through the weirdest possible way. They found you the old school way of people finding musicians that they love. And so I think that that initial discovery, the algorithm doesn't understand that at all. That's something that just is overlooked or people don't even understand that anymore. I'm so grateful for that. I'm very lucky for that. I wish I could bestow that same opportunity on other artists that I think deserve it. I do my best as a label owner. I'm very careful with who I work with. You know, my fans trust those kind of decisions because it is a special relationship where I was never forced on anybody. No one got tricked into listening to my music or, you know, I'm not playing inside of supermarkets. I'm not like, you're not being inundated with Sage Francis material. So if you find it and you get into it, you really lock in and, you know, if you identify with it, you see that there's something unique to what I do that you aren't getting from other sources. And that is what I think great art is all about. You know, we're all living a very similar situation. We're all living a similar experience in life. But the differences that certain artists are able to pick out and accentuate and make others feel like they're not so alone in their situation because no one else communicated it before. Yeah. But also, you know, you attract the weirdos as well, where they think everything is about them. You know, you have to be very careful about the access you give people to your personal life. And I've been very careful about my privacy less and less so in my older years. You know, through much of my adulthood, I threw a lot of trapdoors and labyrinths into what I say and what I say about myself and who can actually pinpoint what's what. It's not about the absolute truth of a personal situation, but what you understand about a situation. And if you didn't live it, it's not going to come out your horn. So I don't have to worry about feeling inauthentic, but I do have to worry about people knowing too much about me personally. Yeah, I think it's super important. And yeah, totally. That seems to be one of the big misconceptions people have about musicians is this idea that every single song is like a journal or a direct rendition of something that happened in their life. I think that's a sign of a really good artist is that just like what you're saying, their real life experience is coming through a kind of artistic distortion. You know, it's like, it's not a lie necessarily. It's more like a gel that you put over a light or something. The light's still there. It's just colored with a simple set that maybe necessarily didn't happen. Well, I'm listen to me, though, like, no, no, no, you go. No, please. Well, my first studio album was called Personal Journals. And so I put a lot of my life into that. And but I was only 23 years old. Yeah. And people still will listen to that album as if I'm that same person. And if I don't reflect all the truths and like the identity points of that album, I'm a fraud, you know, like, so to live with, you know, people always talk about imposter syndrome, but I don't really suffer from that. Because I'm just like, you have to be reasonable as a listener or like someone who is experiencing art to say, what's the context of this? When was it done? And, you know, like, why does it matter to me? Is it because he's that person or because I'm this person? So and that there's going to be something that never changes when you think of it as because I'm this person that that is the constant for the listener. For me, it's weird. Like I can look back on stuff that I've done. I still be very proud of it, but not even identify with it. And that has to be awkward and weird for other people to consider, especially in hip hop where at first we were like, this is the realest fucking music in the world. They say their exact situation and then you go find out like a lot of them were ghost writers and, you know, people were doing there. There was so much fakery involved in this big glossy presentation to the world that we thought was just raw authentic street art. And it was based in that a lot of it still is but honestly, I think we've gotten to a point where we realize, okay, there's a lot of entertainment trickery going on in this and we enjoy it for what it is because that's just what we like. Not because I actually believe that iced tea is going to kill a cop. Right. I mean, it's show business and this is the reality and I think sometimes people struggling with imposter syndrome are people who are really struggling with that reality or it's a little naive. They had a dream about, you know, this is the, you know, a direct perfect replication of my soul being broadcast out into the world. And then they met the reality of like, yeah, but like, you're not always soul projecting. You know, like some days you just feel like shit. You don't want to do music or art or anything at all. You know, and yet I think that, that, that, that insane naive belief that you got to wait until you feel the spirit of the Lord move inside of you or whatever to like produce things. It's sad. It's like, it's sad and I know, but as, as artists and anyone who does any type of craft, or maybe any type of skill job, whatever it is, you're always going to know someone who's better than you. There's always a bigger and better wolf. Yeah. And in a lot of instances, you might be getting better compensation for what you do while you know there are better people like people who do it better. Yes. And that I think is the imposter syndrome of it. I think a comedians get away with a lot of like they get to tell tales and like tell their story, tell very personal stuff and get away with it because they get to blow it off as a joke. If, you know, if any fire comes to their feet, they're just like, Hey, man, it's just a joke. I'm just a fool. Whereas musicians, I'm just a just a big dummy. I'm just a big dummy with these wonderful connections of words and ideas that somehow I made this puzzle make sense and you connected to it, but I'm just a dumb dumb. Yeah. So. Exactly. I don't know as a I try to get away with it myself and I think musicians want want to do that as well. But a lot of us are stuck really living, you know, like, I don't know, having to account for every single thing that we do. I write in character a lot at the time. Similar. Like I like to say, like, when people come at me about certain stuff, I've never tried to like no one ever tried to cancel me. But obviously, there's people who's like, you know, what you said here is exclusionist or, you know, right, ableist or misogynist. And I'm like, yeah, it is a massage. Like that's that character. Like you're supposed to look at it as a misogynist character and look into the mind of what a misogynist is, how they think, how they process the situation, how they can blow it off as a complete narcissist. And that's interesting in his own way. It's the way Stephen King would write characters. Like you don't look at his characters and blame him for being, you know, that mentally ill. But yeah, rap is as interesting beast. And I don't know. You don't really speak for hip hop in general. You don't read Lolita and say, oh, fuck, this is autobiographical for Nabokov. You don't even, you don't. But yeah, with the, with musicians, my wife, she loves Taylor Swift and she'll play Taylor Swift songs to me and then explain who she's singing about. And then like, they've got pictures. She'll like, I'll show, she'll, there's some song with a scarf in it and she'll show me a picture of the guy wearing the scarf. See, there it is. And it's like, you know, this is, yeah, but I, and I think there's something really fun about that. And beautiful about that until it's not just about a scarf. It's like what you're saying, where you're just trying to express a character's experience of reality that isn't you. And people are like, what the fuck is wrong with you? And then you have to sit down and explain it. There's a lot of, there's a lot of parallels between what I've done and what Taylor Swift does, which is funny to admit. But the basics of it is that in the most simplest terms, what everyone experiences in their life is being fucked over by a partner. Where you feel the most vulnerable and hurt and you harp on that as an artist, where you get to tell your side of the story and you never get to hear the other person's side of the story. And I've benefited from that myself. And I have to be honest with myself about it, where my wife told me one of her favorite songs of mine was a song called The Rewrite where I kind of lash out at my first girlfriend of four years who left me. And I just was like, batch, batch, batch, batch. But, you know, I try to like salvage it by the end and say, nah, you're a woman. You know, but it's the whole time it's my take on a story where I never explain how I was unfair to her. I never explain, but it doesn't matter because I know what people think when they break up. So that's the inspiration behind the song. That's how I know people are going to relate to it. And that's what Taylor Swift does with her music and just throwing a few sprinkles of truth and clues where people can pinpoint the scarf. You know, she knows that. She knows that, you know, including those little details is what's going to get people like pumped up about what she's doing and think to themselves, God damn, this is real. And, you know, more power to her. Yeah. No, that there's a story. I heard this story. Charles Bacowski, he's on an airplane. He's drunk. He's like hitting on the fucking flight attendant. Whoever he's with yet like stops him. He's like, you're drunk. Stop. You're like basically assaulting this woman and stop. So later this guy calls Bacowski. He's like, Hey, I read the story you wrote about us on the plane where you say that you stopped me from hitting on the flight attendant. That was me stopping you. And Bacowski is like, when you write your stories, you can make yourself the hero. Exactly. You know, now it's like, Bacowski is an interesting cat. He's one of those artists that you he writes so real, but it can't all be real. You know, like everything he writes, I'm like, I can see it, smell it and feel it. And, but he's so full of shit at the same time. Every woman is, you know, like, oh, he's a piece of shit. And he's okay with that. Yeah. But also there's that foot. There's like footage of him. There's an interview where he's kicking a woman on a couch with him. Like there's a TV interview and he's like, he's totally drunk. He's assaulting this woman is like, these are different times and it's tough for me. Like I, I have every single Bacowski book. I devoured them. I love the style of writing. And it's the kind of artists where I can't put on a pedestal or, you know, I'm very careful about how I push him, his material. Because like, I don't know what to, how to really feel about it. Now knowing what I know about him and how he was in real life. But I feel like he kind of redeemed himself by the end. But also he got famous way after, you know, after so many years of just trudging through the mud. And then at what age was he, did he become super popular? And then all of a sudden he had access to women and, you know, drugs and whatever. So, yeah, I don't know. He was a gutter drunk. Yeah. I mean, he's a fucking like gutter drunk. That's what Bacowski and somehow he could write. And you know, I actually, there's a parallel, I think between him and Elliot Smith, which is like here you have this, his, you have this person who's writing these beautiful songs about their own personal self destruction. You know, and so you read Bacowski same thing, beautiful stories, books about their disintegration as a human. And there's something to me that's really alluring in that. And especially if I want to like subscribe to the idea that I can be completely fucked up on some drug and make incredibly, incredible art. So this is the lure that like any alcoholic or drug addict loves that shit. Because they're like, even though they might not be making anything, they're thinking, you know, once I drink enough, I'll probably be writing like this. Or once I'm high enough, this will emerge from me. You know, so and I look at one thing I love about those kinds of artists is like, they're like, fuck your rules. Fuck your rules. Fuck your idea of like, here's how you write. Here's how you're supposed to write songs. Here's how you're supposed to do it. You do that. You do that because this is what I'm doing right now. And I'm going to decide every little piece of it. You know, I'm not saying fuck your ethical rules, by the way. It's always disappointing when you hear an artist you love. It backstage is a complete piece of shit. I mean, what can you do? This Elliott Smith documentary, you know, it's like people loved him so much that they were, but they were still like, he was mean. He was fucking like a dick towards the end. I never saw that. I'll check into it. Just yeah, he there's artists that almost every artist I love growing up has disappointed me in some way where it's tough for me to wave their flag anymore. Like the the remaining character or the remaining hero of my childhood was Chuck D. Who has yet to disappoint me as a human, you know, as a person with ethics and values and almost every other. There's a few that have stuck around. But after all the people I've met and or I've learned about through my years and through people who know them. It's like, ah, man, you know, like another one bites the dust. One by one, they fell into the darkness and I've always felt it was necessary. And one of the people are always like, can you give some advice for, you know, upcoming artists? Like my best advice ever is be very careful who you let in your circle. Be very careful who you allow to be part of your company. Your company is almost everything. The company you keep says so much about you. And, you know, if you're benefiting somehow from being around a piece of shit, it's not worth it. Don't you're like, don't take that. There's and, you know, I could have done better financially probably throughout my career if I had attached myself to certain people. If I had followed certain paths that weren't, you know, ethical, but none of that matters in the end. You know, like this, this life is so fucking short. And you have, if you're a creative person, there's so much power in those moments. If you allow anything to taint it, you just, the disservice you do to yourself is going to scream at you down the line, like absolutely scream at you. And it's, you know, down the line isn't as far down as you really think it is. It's coming. So, you know, atone for your bullshit. Atone.

Thank you so much Bespoke Post. A tone. But how? How do you a tone? I mean, what does that look like? And also, you know, this atonement that you're talking about, I think this is right now we're in the age of justice. And this kind of like fascinating with my wife and I were talking about this how phones have replaced guns. Like in the old West, somebody is like being an asshole and you pull out your gun like shoot them. But now we pull out our phones and destroy their lives. You know, and it's not a physical kind of execution. It's just more of a like, you know, public humiliation that is often well-deserved. But it's like we need to enter the age of atonement, right? Like we need to find a way to where, you know, these people who've disappointed us, including ourselves, where we find a way to alchemize that, you know, convert it into something that shows like the incredible possibility of starting over. Yeah, it's just scary. No one, you know, fear, fear is what keeps people from doing that fear of the unknown. Because if you start over, maybe you lose everything that you gained through whatever bullshit you were involved with. And you don't think you can get it through any other means. I suppose just trusting in yourself and it may not always work. And maybe that's okay. Maybe you're not supposed to have what you have if it if it takes you being a piece of shit or working with pieces of shit. So I'm okay with that. I don't think and people aren't just pulling out phones. They're still pulling out guns. So I was like, that's true. Sometimes the guns in one hand, the phones in the other. Yeah, exactly, exactly. I mean, that's, that's just the world we live in now. There's just more weapons. So how do we atone? I don't know, man. How do we do it? I feel, I feel comfortable in myself. I'm, I'm happy with where I'm at, despite the fact that I, I know I could have done more. More people, I think should find that type of peace and acceptance. Even though maybe I'll go bankrupt in a couple of years, you know, like maybe I shouldn't like speak so confidently. But the things that I've learned over the years while I was making money and then not making money and transitioning from being married to my music to being married married. And, you know, with, with kids and what this home life is all about, which is not something like I experienced myself too much as a kid. I grew up an only child in a, you know, a latchkey kids type situation spent a lot of almost all the time to myself, not just as a kid, but early adulthood. And now I have to navigate a hundred moving parts in a house that just won't allow me to go like go down certain rabbit holes I used to enjoy in my quiet solitude. Yeah. And I've been in a massive transition over the past three years and I have to learn how to feel totally comfortable in it and I'm getting there. But I'm, it's never with regret and it's never with man, me thinking, man, I miss the old freedoms. I, I cherish the time that I had when I had it, when I did those things with the people that I did them with. And now I'm in this whole new world and I'm atoning for every broken relationship, every missed funeral, every, all that stuff, man. I don't know. I'm in a, I feel like I'm in a weird position where I can't totally pinpoint how several other people should deal with their own situation because mine is very specific to me. Sure. Yeah. Well, I think it's for me. I mean, I love what Ramdas teaches about it in the term atonement. It's so heavy. I shouldn't have come up with a better term, but he calls it burning off karma. And it's really, I brought it up. Oh, okay. It's the kind of word I use and think about. But the burning out with the idea is it's like, look, you're here. And because you're here, you're going to make ripples, whether you like it or not, any action is going to produce some kind of reaction in your environment. And because probably you're an imperfect being, some of those ripples are going to like hurt things, people, creatures. Who knows what this is the reality of being embodied is like, there's no way out of this sort of problematic reality. If you live in, you know, the United States, you're paying taxes. If you're paying taxes, you're buying bombs and those bombs are definitely being dropped on people. And so in that way, that was the worst part. For me, that was the worst part of being successful was that I was paying hundreds of thousands of dollars into the tax system when we had just started wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. And I knew where that money was going. And it killed me. I hated it. Absolutely tainted that whole experience for me like, yay, I, you know, I'm finally, I get to pay off my student loans and I got to buy the house. But at the same time, whoo, yeah, there's the other side of it all. What drew you to Ram Dass initially, because I, I'm, I kind of have only gotten glimpses of Ram Dass and his his work and the people who follow him who just glow about Ram Dass and you being one of them. But what initially drew you to that? Well, my mom was in his, she listened to these tapes that he made. You can still listen to some of them on audible and they're really cool. I'm listening to one right now. It's called Journey of Awakening and it's clearly been ripped off of these old tapes. The audio quality is not that great, which I love because it's got that kind of like, yeah, I don't know if you watch lost, but if you remember like, yeah, I was just about to say that. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. It's got that kind of crackly MK ultra style sound to it, which I fucking love. And that weird like light distortion. But yeah, so I would listen to those and I kind of enjoyed that. But then, you know, like anybody, any liberal arts college kid encounter be here now, you know, and start and really like liked the fact that here was someone, you know, expressing a lot of these like amazing Eastern ideas, but also mixing in the psychedelic reality and not like poo pooing, you know, second mushrooms or LSD or anything like that. And, you know, it was just a sort of like, he was always there for me, you know, like when I was in the, I wrote the name of this song, I was listening to your music and now I can't find it. It's like the best song I've ever heard about depression. It's animated. Do you know what I'm talking about, man? It's so fucking good. It's like, oh yeah, make them purr. Oh God. Make them purr. When I was in that phase of my life, I would, I would like lay on a mattress on the fucking floor and like go to be here now. You're a spokesman for a community. You're a spokesperson for a community. You know what I mean? Like you, you know, because you are connected to this amazing musical reality, which is that right now in like in basements and in little rooms, there are people who are so fucking good that it would melt your brain. Anyone who saw what they could do would be like, wait, what the fuck? What? Wait, who are you? No one will ever find them necessarily, but they're there. Maybe they don't want to be found. A lot of those people don't want to be fucking found. They're not using the same metrics that we, we use, you know, so they don't want to be known at all. And if you introduce that possibility, they're like, no, no, thanks. I'm not interested. But so anyway, yeah. That's funny because yeah, you have to accept the fact that the people that you do know people that you have access to are the ones who decided to make themselves accessible. And yeah, though this takes a special type of person, a type of special type of cycle. I don't know. Psychology for someone to say, I'm going to make this public. I want as many people to absorb it as possible. Whereas there are incredibly super talented people who just are. And you, most people will never know about it. That's just how it is. That's just how it's going to be. I appreciate you telling me the whole Ram Dass thing because I'm, I'm trying to understand what it is that has drawn in so many people that I appreciate and I get it a little bit better now. So thank you for that. Oh, sure. Well, I mean, it's, you know, it's, it's just like, you know, musically, I know we both enjoy like this sort of authentic music, but we love this kind of authentic writing. And I think that's the other thing that's glorious about Ram Dass is that there was within his writings, you will find like a lot of real on like honesty regarding his own neurosis and like his own, you know, like when he had a stroke in the documentary, I think it's called fierce grace. One of the things he just says is there wasn't, I didn't have a spiritual. There wasn't like, oh, here's God or, oh, and I thought I was dying. Nothing happened. All the work and all of it that I thought, you know, okay, meditation is the preparation for death. No, no, like none of it was, none of it worked. That's what confuses me about. That's what confuses me about the following of Ram Dass because he is like that. And it's like, he doesn't have the extra thing where I'm like cult figures should have not, I don't want to call him a cult figure, but like cult figures have who have the kind of following that he has have secret answers. Yeah. And he's giving people just bear facts just just like it's very normal and it's very relatable and understandable and not tricking anybody into saying, man, I need to achieve this certain thing that, you know, he's unlocked and he has the key to from what I've seen. So that's why I'm just so curious and fascinated by all of that because I grew up very, very cautious of religious figures and cult figures. They scare me, they creep me out and anything that like even resembles that and that, you know, like his movement does. The more I look into it, I'm like, damn, you know, this is, I kind of wonder the more psychedelics become normalized, how different his following or that type of following will become. If it's centralized or if it just becomes just everyone accepts certain things as common knowledge and it turns into something else, because the discussion I saw between him and Terrence McKenna. Did you see that the video of them in the Italian restaurant, I think it was. Yeah, I watched it like 10 times. It just blows my fucking mind. Like those are those are the kind of conversations you get, you know, from people who are still figuring it out. They don't have all the answers, but, you know, they really want to explore what other people have unlocked and or trying to make, you know, trying to make sense of very difficult and complex things. And that's great. I wanted to ask you about that. That meeting's cool. It represents the pure, you know, Terrence McKenna is like, for the psychedelic community, you could say he's like the Ram Dass of the psychedelic community. He's, you know, scientific. He's a purist. And, you know, he's like, even though he talks about, you know, machine elves and UFOs, there's this strangely like empirical, rational quality to him, you know, and in the psychedelic community, you will find these like, you know, you will find a contingent of people who really just don't have time for the spirituality bullshit, you know, or who feel like it's kind of a diversion or something. And I think McKenna kind of, it's not like he was anti spirituality, because I think psychedelics are a spirituality, but just you meet. There's an interesting division that that happens where, you know, you know, new age spirituality and psychedelics in the new age like communities, there's people who think psychedelics or an intermediary phase, you know, something you go through and then you take up spirituality. And in the psychedelic community, there's people who think spirituality is an intermediary phase before you get to psychedelics. And so there, there's some, there can be a little bit of like pushback. I think in that, initially in that conversation, you could sense a little bit of that in the way that they were interacting. Well, I think that terms are just so ambiguous. It allows people the ability to be amorphous and whatever they can or believe in or say they believe in and spirituality in particular has always been problematic for me because I, I go through phases where I'm like, yeah, I feel spiritual, like I feel like there's something beyond what I understand and know about. Yeah, obviously there is my, my grandmother, she's a hard lined atheist. She's always, you know, card carrying like real hardcore. Whenever you bring up certain things like that, even as a kid, she would confront you and be like, what do you mean spiritual? What do you mean? Love it. And if you don't have the vocabulary, if you don't have the references, like I don't even know now at 45 years old, I'm like, I can only speak in ambiguous, be ambiguous in my terms because, and that's how sneaky fucking people use language and use movements because it's, you know, it's easy to navigate through amorphous understandings, ambiguous shit. And so I'm always unquantifiable bullshit. Yeah. Like, you know, this, it just popped up on Twitter. Some woman was selling her farts from like 30 day. I don't know. One of these like to show she's famous. That's what kind of reality show fame. She was saying she sold her farts for $10,000 a jar. Something like that. She's literally selling her farts. And I mean, well, I'm selling NFTs of my farts. If anyone is into the NFT community. How do you convert your fart into an NFT? Is there special technology for that? This, this technology people aren't even aware of yet. But yes, there's, there's lots of fart technology that we've been working on since the eighties. Fart technology was huge when I was a kid. It was like in all the pamphlets, my parents would get in the mail is like very fart related stuff. They didn't know I had access to and I would, you know, sneak in the mail and find, you know, scientific peer reviewed fart findings that have eventually become digitized and can be NFT'd. So be on the lookout for that. Yeah. Isn't it true though that the conversion of a human fart into an NFT uses in like a few seconds, the same amount of energy the whole planet uses in like three years. Like it takes a lot of juice to turn your fart. No, not as much as, no, not as much as the methane, the farts that are used in, you know, billionaire rockets that go to the edges of our atmosphere and, you know, create a carbon footprint as big as fucking, you know, Pluto. So yeah, you got to like, if we could fuel this rockets with our farts, that would be so beautiful in some way. That is the future. Can you imagine explaining that when we finally meet aliens and they're like, so what technology are you using? It's like, it's our farts. We figured it out. Yeah, they're like, finally. Yeah. This whole time we've been waiting. Why do you think we come to your planet? It's not because we're interested in your dumb asses. We've been harvesting your farts now. We've been watching you joke about them for centuries. Now you know their use. The spirituality thing is like a lot of people I know who are like skeptical as you should be about fucking someone selling. By the way, some people selling spirituality. It's like even more intangible than a jar of farts. It's like we're talking about a thing that is like a purely unquantifiable, unmeasurable thing that most of the time is a thing that you really didn't need anybody to tell you at all. There's nothing that very special about whatever it is, which is why you suddenly there are secrets or there's like, you know, all of these like levels to the goddamn thing, because you could sell levels and all this shit. So I think like anyone who is like your number one reaction to anybody like saying something unquantifiable like spirituality, your grandmother's reaction is a good healthy reaction. And if you ask somebody, what do you mean by that? And they get weird. Well, fuck get the fuck out of there because you are in trouble. You know, they there should be a never ending open conversation because it what about these sorts of things and like the. Yeah. That's my opinion on it. You know, that's that's like it. And that's what I loved about Ram Dass in particular is like there really wasn't as far as I could tell. I never managed to blaspheme in front of those people. And I tried making fun of their crew and like saying things like maybe weren't you guys just on a bunch? Like I remember saying to Ragu runs the foundation. I was like, don't you think maybe like y'all are out in India? And isn't it possible like you are just on a lot of drugs and you know, and he's like, I don't know, maybe. Yeah, I don't know. That's the best answer, man. I love that. Yeah, I really love that. Yeah. Yeah, that's the that's you know, I wasn't very much into church. I didn't grow up in a church per se. You know, I was like Protestant, but not really like we went to church very few times that I can remember. But it was always like the, you know, like clergy and priests and whatever, like they're held to such a high regard that you can't fool around and joke around and be normal around those type of figures. So it's, you know, for a normal person, at least where I live in puritanical New England and mostly Catholic New England, it was like untouchable, you know, the rules just do your thing. Don't, you know, don't, don't create too many waves or ripples in the water. Just go along with what they have laid out for you because it's been like this for hundreds of years. And I can't shake the feeling that most people understand how bullshit it is and but they can't confront that within themselves or within their family. So I feel like I was lucky enough where it wasn't, it wasn't such a hard-lined thing in my family that I couldn't talk about it in my music that it would stay out of, it's in my writing. It wasn't even a huge part of my life yet. It's all over my writing. Somehow it finds its way into so much of my stuff that because it it made a dent in me as a kid somehow. There was there was something that I knew was terribly off that was supposed to be very important that I couldn't completely relate with or understand and it was taboo to question it. So then eventually that just becomes a thing to rebel against and not just rebel against but explore honestly outside of like I didn't have any restrictions. I could explore it however I wanted. Do you think it that's abuse? You think when you when you when you when you make a child question their rational mind, isn't that some form of like generational abuse that's been normalized by organized religion? Absolutely. But also is in parenthood like 80% gaslighting. So much of what we do is just to get them through the day. Right. Yeah. Yeah. But okay. Okay. What I love that you said that and I was you know just today I was on the precipice of lying to forest about something and I didn't but there are some things you just have to you can't you there's no way to tell the truth about them. You know or like that they don't have the words to explain it. So yeah, I guess I've never thought of it in that way but but isn't the difference between the gaslighting of parenthood which is kind of like look I got to get you in bed. Yeah. You know what I mean? So it's like when I'm saying outside is closed is the universe outside our house literally closed like a shop. No, but but the you know the difference is it force was like I don't think outside is really close. I think it's always there. I'm going to be like yes, of course it's always there but you're going to bed whereas with religion if like when some families if you say look come on. I'm not really sure that this thing that you're talking about exists. You might get put in a fucking closet for a day. You might get some people get murdered. Some kids get literally killed for it. Yeah. So that's the difference. It's like one is gaslighting because I want you to be a healthy person. The other is gaslighting because I got gaslit and my parents got gaslit and we've been getting gaslit all the way fucking back. You know and that to me seems like a difference. Yeah, absolutely. That's that's who I'm lucky. I feel lucky. We're lucky in America. Honestly, first we're not a religious run country even though like the religious right really you know has a lot of their paws in the laws but I can question it as much as I want. I understand it'll piss some people off. It'll you know make me look bad but when my kids get to an age where they question stuff to me I wouldn't do what my grandmother did to me and I don't want I'm not going to shame her. I love her so much. Thankfully she's still around but like I remember I've told this story before but she sat me on her knee when I was eight years old no yeah eight years old and she read me a book about Santa Claus and then she said now when we got to the end of the book she said you know Santa Claus isn't real right and I was like I mean sure if you're gonna allow me to admit that I know that yeah that's great and she was like it's the same thing with God. And so that was the first night I think I ever prayed literally prayed like I didn't know how to pray I wasn't given instructions on how to pray I was like dear Lord like please don't send me to hell I don't you know I'm very scared that you know just being in this situation is going to make me privy to torture and whatever else oh my god and it took me many years after that to reconcile with those feelings and with the situation I was in I wouldn't do that to my kids I wouldn't say it like that I you know you have to allow people to come to conclusions and not shame them for whichever they come to but always you know I feel like I would be pretty good in letting and helping them navigate ideas that are very confusing without saying there's a definitive firestorm coming their way or you know a happy cloud in the end. Well by the way that was very unscientific of your grandmother because even the most scientific people I know they're like we don't know don't know you know scientific people that's generally they'll be like we don't know you know and so you know I think that's like if you want to get real honest you know as a secularist you can't really say there's no God it's kind of like saying it's too ambiguous a fucking term number one it's like do you mean a it's arrogant it's arrogant it's just it's an arrogant term it's an arrogant way to go about it yeah but she's she's she had to she's dealing with her own stuff because she grew up in a convent raised by nuns that mistreated her and she you know like entered Seventh Day Adventist stuff and like everything that like ultimately kind of she felt like screwed with her and she felt bamboozled yeah by religion and henceforth by God in her right you know her idea of what God is yeah so then forever after that she was very hard lined no like fuck all this fuck all the people who you know try to like make you do what they want in the name of a God just you know I'm thankful for that part of the lesson it's just there we have to figure out different ways to approach language about spirituality even though it's like we discussed it's very ambiguous and tough to lock down and speak about in a way that is I don't know concrete well yeah and that this is the you know this is like the big problem I guess and but you know here like the way people not to bring it back to to like your music or the underground or anything like that but I feel like with actual like spirituality you know actual and you know by spirituality if I to like just off the cuff invent a definition for it would be that the possibility of connecting to something that is maybe outside or that is like not so bound to time and space a kind of possibility maybe you could say or a maybe it doesn't even exist yet a place you know a place that isn't defined by phenomena and in you know Buddhism the you know they call it emptiness so literal like you know it's empty it's this we're talking about this kind of like space that everything's being held inside of like for all the shit that we're enjoying on this planet it has to be inside of something something is holding all of this you know and so you know having some kind of like ability to refer to that reality so that you're not always getting grabbed by the swirling hypnotic vortex of this stuff is I think quite useful and whatever that particular reality may be I think that the other part of spirituality is you're gonna have to figure that out on your own like somebody wearing a funny outfit or somebody with like some charisma you know they figured it out on their own like in their own way and so so you that's the invitation is like now you you try to talk to that thing can you does it talk back is anything answer you is that you answered yourself anyway to me that's the the you know the way people found your your music or the the it's it's like you they kind of had to work for it or get lucky or it wasn't just handed out to them and organized religion it's like what used to happen when there was only radio right like I mean shit remember back then you had like here's like the fucking top 40 songs I mean I'm sure that's what inspired Jesus Christ Superstar it's like here this is what you got this is what's out there and people would hear that and they'd be like that must be the only music and then if you're a kid in high school somebody comes it gives you a tape right it's the descendants you know you know what I mean and you're like what the fuck is this are you kidding me wait what's that yeah yeah so I think it's similar with religion which is like look if you think the Catholic Church or if you think that whatever your particular like whatever your familiarity with Christianity is is the sum total of Christianity that's your fault you know that means that you didn't even listen to what Jesus was saying which was like this is supposed to be between you and me it seems like that's never never part of what any of those religious sex are about it's never about what Jesus actually wanted from everything that I know about the man and the things that came after him it's not about his lifestyle and his philosophies they sprinkle that in but then they just they really muff it up and the way we live the way the the laws they enact it's just in the name of someone they actually don't believe in it's clearly obvious that those kind of transgressions rule us they by law they have taken over what we are able to do and not do in a lot of ways it's insane so I can I have I do have disdain for all of it really upsets me it consumes me and I try to stay away from it but here we are celebrating you know the winter solstice how fun oh yeah oh yeah and look but here but you know the it's like okay so now we're into this we're in this incredible age of technology where technology has become accessible you can you can like with a computer and Ableton with not even that great a fucking computer and Ableton the shit that you can make right now is insane right but so many people I feel like are waiting to start making stuff until they get knighted you know until someone with a label comes to them and says okay now I say under the you are a musician and then then they'll like get set but or you know it happens with comedy where people are waiting for a network to buy their show or you know what I mean it happens with podcasts where people are waiting for maybe a podcast network to hear a pitch and then they make their fucking podcast the whole time forgetting that you can right now start making stuff right now and it's in it to me it makes sense that the identical phenomena happens with religion where it's like okay I need to go through I need someone to teach me about this or here's how you do it or this is what's right and this is what's wrong because I'll tell you man it gives you an opportunity to procrastinate that conversation that you tried to have with God after you heard that from your grandmother you know and you know it gives you an opportunity to like put off doing the magical spell put off trying to like call out to the divine put off you know what I mean and put it all off because it's not you you can't do it someone else could do it you know what I mean and in that way you you end up like really cutting what I cutting yourself off from something which by the way one of the best moments I had with Ramdas sitting at the table with the Zen Roshi and he goes it's all in my imagination and she slaps the table and goes finally you admit it after all these years you admit it is just in your imagination and he's like what's wrong with imagination you know and what's wrong with that like what is wrong with like connecting to even if it is quote imaginary a symbol set that is your own mind maybe but it still fills you with a sense of spaciousness and most importantly a real motivation to not be a dick right I feel like there is there is something wrong with it though I feel like there is something wrong with it because if it's if it's imaginary and it works for you and you convincingly pass it off on others it may not work for them but you were so believable that whatever like you were passing on to them they tried to achieve and they weren't able to and things just went awry you know like with their lives and with what they decided was worth investing the whole of themselves into like that has to happen that must happen a lot you know what I'm saying yeah no I yeah we'll see okay but in that I think in that case then you know yeah then there's some kind of deception like for example if you are sort of if you're if you are misleading people you know or you're not sharing to me like if the moment you're sort of openly announcing which I've seen him do this is your the place this is also various forms of magic to really do advise like use your imagination like this is the whole point like visualization exercises and all these things like fundamentally are any of these things real anything real like in generally like the the answer to that question is well they're real in relative reality in other words you're real right now I'm real right now we're rivers that look like people or like rivers of atoms that are flowing through time meeting this like an inevitable sort of singularity which is when we die it's the end of the fucking river and so but right now you and me we're real you're there I'm here my fucking back hurts you know what I mean like I'm experiencing this so in this level this is real but similarly like ultimately you run into this beautiful place at least in Buddhism which is kind of not real and that's where you run into this thing called like the heart sutra which is no mind no body no self no life no death no beginning no ending so it's like essentially a denial of everything including the Dharma itself the Dharma is empty as well a complete refutation of the entirety of the thing and so when you hit that place which I think is why you push back against spirituality when you hit that place then you get to start over that's how I see it when anytime I just fucking give yeah yeah start over yeah yeah yeah that that's what I love when I throw it all out but I that I will say like Buddhism that part about Buddhism I love I really love like I feel like that is makes it special to me like out of everything that I've learned from all different types of religions or followings or you know spiritual gatherings whatever I there is an honesty about it that I don't see much anywhere else where it can probably break the heart of someone who thinks the end result isn't just gonna start over dude yeah yeah that not special and again this is like there is no in Buddhism there isn't much deception about it and I think Trigium Trilogy calls enlightenment the final disappointment and it's just sort of like yeah that's yes I wanted to bring that up but that's beautiful yeah so that you know and I any time that I've like and I think any fucking religion organization or anything that doesn't want you to throw the whole damn thing away when you're ready when you want to watch out because that's the it's like these are dead and this is why they're called vehicles it's like you drive to the beach in your vehicle and then you get out and go to the fucking beach you don't sit in the car that's the that's the whole point these aren't it's not it's not supposed to be some destination and anything claiming to be the destination whoa that's where I think it gets dangerous man I've taken up a lot of your time do you have a little bit more time I have one more question I wanted to ask you yeah thank you I know you have kids and the kids are home so thank you for this so just came home actually yeah I'm sensing it so do you do you do you feel like do you feel like the metric that that I know I use I've got a family I gotta feed the fucking kids and I've heard you talk about this metric do you feel like the quantification of success through like selling records is like an is a mistake is you know it like as an artist as a musician as a performer I just look I guess to put it plainly I know someone who's like the most brilliant music musician I've ever met in my life I've never seen anything like it before it's the most surreal thing to be around the person I think they're actualized or something and they don't want anything to do with fame they're not interested in it they consider it to be almost a mistake like if you end up getting famous or something you kind of fucked up what were you thinking do you do you resonate with that idea or is that some form of like defense mechanisms met mechanism that people like that use to avoid the like all the scary stuff that goes along with publishing yeah it's both things I think for sure there are artists who are afraid to put themselves out on the chopping block where they could you know have big record sales and you know become famous and because maybe if they put themselves on the chopping block and it doesn't happen they will realize I'm not as good as I thought I was there are also a lot of artists who see the chopping block for what it is it's a chopping block and they are more than comfortable being beautiful and creative and having their tiny circle and making it work for their own purposes and not not entities outside of themselves that they don't understand I've I've spent a lot of my career staying away from bigger entities that you know could have propelled me further than where I was and I've obviously like gotten more I wouldn't I mean quote unquote fame like most people don't know me if I walk outside the house no one knows who I am unless I'm you know in the supermarket at my you know the town of my high school yeah or within a hundred feet of whatever venue I'm playing so but that's a very comfortable space for me to be in and I never wanted to elevate beyond that because I really enjoy my privacy I really enjoy my solitude and I enjoy the relationship I get to have with the fans that I have but you're absolutely spot on like some people are just scared to find out that they're not as good as they are and others know better to even test it they don't there's no need to test it they they know what they know and that's all that matters thank you so much for your time it means the

The summer boys are coming to you with Johnny Pemberton and Josh Vadim, June 21st of July. Sit down. Milwaukee Madison, Chicago, Iowa City, Omaha Kansas City, Norman, Oklahoma, Austin, and any- Oh, that sounds fun. Go get blasted by the warm, buttery tapioca spray of the two summer boys as they finger your souls for a night of sophisticated comedy. So go see those summer boys, Johnny Pemberton and Josh Vadim, they're dirty men who want nothing more than to make you laugh as they frolic on stage like two sleek weasels straight from the other dimension of weasels where life is so much sweeter and the summer is generated not by the sun, but by the hot, humid breath of a fallen angel huffing out on a village of comedy weasels. That's the summer boys and you're going to love that tour. The Dunk of Trussell Family Hour podcast is brought to you by an incredible company named Warby Parker. Let's face it, you're going blind, the world seems blurry, you're losing your ability to focus on things because you, like many of us including me, have a terrible vision disorder. You're dying, your eye sockets are slowly making that long march into infinity and it's time for you to get some glasses. But the sad thing about the fact that you have a melting optic nerve that is slowly transforming into a yellow putrified jelly that will eventually become the dust from which flowers grow is that banded eyeglasses companies out there want to charge you over three hundred dollars and that's not right. It's not right to manipulate disabled people who are losing their vision because the grim reaper is pulling them into hell. That's like going to post-revolution Paris and selling overpriced crutches to the crippled orphans. Warby Parker is not in the business of ripping off people who are going blind. Go to WarbyParker.com, you can check out their awesome glasses that start at 95 bucks. This is a really cool revolutionary thing, the internet is presenting a lot of really cool options for us. It's giving us Uber and you know Uber is good because it's pissing off cab drivers who can't understand why people don't want to ride around in the back of a giant yellow death missile and smell the garlic farts of people who are two stops away from having a grand mal seizure from their rage disorder. Now you can get in an Uber that give you a mint, a nice glass of water, it's awesome. In the same way Warby Parker is doing the same thing for glasses. The only reason you should be paying 300 dollars for glasses is if they are made out of the bones of Jesus Christ or if they were found at the Roswell UFO crash site. And nobody wants to rub shoulders in some eyeglasses shop being run by a Saudi Arabian reptilian vampire who's convinced a bunch of consumerist at gullible rubes that paying 600 dollars on a pair of glasses modeled after Andy Warhol's diarrhea makes sense. Do you really want to try on glasses in front of some sweaty froth mouth, carny greed lord feeling as hot doom breath on your neck as you try your secret poses in front of their musty mirror? No, you want to try on glasses in the privacy of your own home. If you go to warbyparker.com you pick out five glasses that you like, they send them to you, you try them out in front of your harem or whoever you have chained up in your basement. If they like them you pick out a pair and Warby Parker will send that pair to you with whatever your prescription happens to be. The glasses start at 95 dollars and if you go to warbyparker.com forward slash family hour you will get free shipping so you'll save a little bit of money, you'll get a new pair of glasses that looks awesome and the great thing is is you're not going to get ripped off by some evil eyeglasses company that feels okay manipulating handicapped blind people. Don't give money to those pigs, go to warbyparker, it's a cool company and they're sponsoring this podcast. P.S. for every pair you buy they give a pair to someone in need. That means that some Calcutta street leper can actually see in full focus the street dogs that are gnawing on his oozing wounds. That's great. Go to dunkintrustle.com, the links to Warby Parker will be in the comments section of this podcast. The Dunkin' Trussell family hour podcast is also brought to you by naturebox.com, this is a cool company that you can go to and sign up to receive shipments of healthy snacks. If you read the back of most snacks that you buy at stores the ingredients look like passages from the Necronomicon. The stuff is generally composed of Fukushima outflow mixed in with the toenail clippings of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. It's not good for you and it makes your appendix look exactly like the Hindenburg pre-explosion. Your body is a sacred body temple. Why are you inhaling that doom food? Why are you letting your hand smash that evil genetically modified chemically soaked death into your sweet lips with a fervent passion of an imp shoveling diabolic coal into a hell bound freight train? You don't have to do it anymore. Go to naturebox.com and you can sign up to receive these awesome boxes filled with delicious snacks. You can pick what snacks you want or you can let them surprise you, which I think you should do. That's a lot more fun.

Also on the podcast stand up front, I've got a ton of new dates that I'm going to be announcing including a podcast, a live podcast that I'm going to be doing in Vancouver. That info is going to be up at DuncanTrussell.com. Thanks to all of you who have been using our Amazon portal. When you go to amazon.com and thanks to all of you who bought all of our new Ron Regi t-shirts, holy shit, those things went like hotcakes. You guys detected that there is a metaphysical sigil in these things that will ward off the evil eye, which means that the jealous gaze of those around you who only want you to fall into pits of mediocrity will be averted by the powerful symbols on this shirt. And there's many of them. We've got the Hamza, the Enneagram, there's angels in there. Go check it out by going to DuncanTrussell.com to the shop. And of course, you never have to do any of this crap. Skip past the advertisements, jump past the advertisements for our sponsors or for the t-shirts or for whatever it is that I'm plugging for Amazon. Just get right into the podcast because to me, that's the biggest rush of all of this is that you guys are actually listening to my raspy lesbian voice and that will never cease to amaze me. And after my recent experience at the Servios VR lab, I'm starting to think this entire universe that I am existing inside of may actually be some super advanced alien simulation. I met Nathan Berbo, one of the co-founders of the Servios VR labs at a virtual reality party that I recently attended. And they had some amazing demos there. The one that blew my mind the most was this, you put on the rift, you put on headphones and suddenly you're in some kind of, I don't know, studio. There's a guy smoking a cigarette, playing piano, and you feel like you're there. It's video. It's not animated and it is incredibly realistic. You can look around whatever this weird New York art loft is and you feel like you're in a room with a guy that's a very, very intense thing because your body is reacting to it in the same way you would react if you were alone in a New York loft with a guy playing piano and smoking a cigarette. Your nipples get hard, you start crying, your lower lip trembles, and you get goosebumps all over your body. Nathan invited me to come down to Servios and try out what he called a holodeck. When I heard him say that, I was a little pessimistic. I honestly didn't believe that the technology had gotten where it is. So my expectations were pretty low when I went there. But as it turns out, when Nathan Burbos said that Servios has a holodeck, he meant that they actually have a holodeck. Not a holodeck like what you would see on the Starship Enterprise, but an actual holodeck, which is they have a backpack that you put on, the newest version of the Oculus Rift, headphones, some kind of Dr. Sue style antenna thing that you wear on your head, and a razor Hydra, which is a kind of, I don't want to call it a joystick, but it's these two wands that you hold in your hands. And when all the gear is on, and they flip the switch, then you are transported into another dimension. And it is mind blowing. You are suddenly no longer in Culver City, but are standing in some kind of Ukrainian shooting range, gazing out at weird wind set, swept mountains and tables filled with weapons that you shoot, not in the current way that you shoot weapons in most video games, which is by, you know, squeezing the trigger on the Xbox controller, but by actually holding the razor Hydra controls in the exact way that you would hold whatever weapon that you're picking up. If you have a bow and arrow, you pick up the bow and arrow and reach behind you to pull the arrow out of a Quiver on your back. You've got two pistols and holsters at your waist, which you can reach down and pull out and it looks so good. It looks amazing. Your body has these, your mind has these strange moments when you look down at your arms and suddenly you have a tan, or when you look down at your body and it's a different body than the one that you've grown accustomed to over your entire lifetime. The other weird thing about it is that your body quickly just adapts to the fact that, oh, I guess this is the new dimension that I live in, some kind of Ukrainian shooting range. That's the other weird thing. Our poor minds immediately just accept the fact that this virtual reality that you found yourself is real, really amazing stuff. This is not even consumer based yet and it is already incredibly advanced. I can't imagine what things are going to look like five years from now, but I will say that thanks to Servios, I now know that Ray Kurzweil is right. The singularity truly is upon us and the subjective universe that you have grown accustomed to is about to experience an upgrade unlike anything that has ever happened in the course of our species. I can't think of a moment in history when this level of change happened at the speed with which it's currently happening. It's scary, it is exciting, it's mind bending, and these guys are at the very forefront of whatever this, I don't know, pilgrimage that our species is taking into the metaverse. So please open your third eyes, send out as much love as you possibly can to the co-founders of Servios, James, Illith, and Nathan Burba. You can check out Servios by going to Servios.com. Okay, Nathan, James, welcome to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour Podcast. Thank you so much for blowing my mind today. You guys have a company that has created a digital holodeck, that's what you call it, right? Servios is a holodeck, basically. Really, yeah, I mean, that's one of the best ways to think about it. You feel like you're somewhere else, and you kind of walk onto it and walk off of it. So yeah, it's kind of like a holodeck, actually, it used to be called Project Holodeck back while we were at USC. That's Nathan talking, you guys, and that's James. Yeah, this is Nathan. Hey, what's up? It's James. So, yeah, it's always been sort of like a holodeck kind of thing. That's like the original vision for it, is trying to imagine what's the best user experience you could ever have, and your mind instantly jumps to the holodeck or the matrix, like the perfect simulation. And so that's kind of how our brains started. When did this start? Well, we were doing stuff like this way back in 2011 or earlier at the Mixed Reality Lab, which is... So this was pre-Rift, pre-Oculus Rift. Yeah, that's right. So we actually, we worked with Palmer Lucky for... And Palmer Lucky's the creator of Oculus. Yeah, he's the founder of Oculus, and we were doing some VR projects there. I was working on like a VR, sort of, not really a game, but it was more like an experience where you explore like an alternative planet, this kind of stuff. But we were using some crazy gear, and Nate was working on some connect research at the time, and I know you were like doing like a paper. Yeah, working on a paper and a few games and using the connect, using all sorts of different peripherals basically. And James and I met at the Mixed Reality Lab, along with Palmer, we were all kind of there doing different things. And the crazy fun thing was like, he was making some crazy cool head-mounted displays, and we were all using motion capture stages, like giant mocap stages you'd use in like a movie kind of thing. Yeah. And imagine putting on like a motion capture suit, and then putting on some like military grade VR gear, and then you're, you have like perfect avatar embodiment, you can see everything, you're like moving around, you can run around like a 40 foot by 40 foot space. Wow. Crazy, like awesome experience. But, you know, it's super expensive. Yes. You know, I don't know how many millions of dollars go under these types of things, but it's a lot. It's super difficult to set up, too. I mean, you know, hours of work just to get into virtual reality for a minute or two, to see some tech demo that is just the graphically, you know, something coming out of the early 90s. That's what it used to be like. That's what VR used to be. Yeah. So, okay, I got it. So, if you just wanted a few seconds of the thing you just gave me, it's hours of set up, and then it's incredibly expensive. And it's like, that's why I only like, you know, top researchers in their fields and like the military were like using these things. Right. So, you'd have to be like a lucky research assistant, I guess, to like run into it, you know. And if the hardware changes all the time and people can't, it can't sit still, your medium can't sit still, then artists can't work on the medium to actually create something that you'd want to be in. So, with the hardware constantly in flux and everything costing a lot of money, no one can really create anything for virtual reality. Yeah, there's no actual like really great experiences yet. The idea of a VR game didn't even exist yet. Right. So, you guys were before, this was when it was still a fantasy for most people. This is like where most people just thought, full on, more man. It might happen one day, but it's probably not going to happen. Like the year like 2010, like 2011 kind of, that's sort of how it felt, yeah. But you all were compelled to start building this stuff. Yeah. Right. It's because it turned out components were super cheap compared to, like you can get like a really amazing immersive experience from like off the shelf hardware. Right. Just like put it together in such a way so you got like magnetic tracking and you got like optical tracking and you end up just like, like in the beginning it was sort of like a Frankenstein monster for us because we put together some crazy gear to get it just to work. Yeah. And this was, yeah, James Palmer and I hanging out at IEEE VR in March 2012. We all kind of together came up with the idea for a holodeck. We said, you know, we really looked at what was out there, what was possible. We said, okay, the screens are here, you know, the lenses on kind of the head mounted display side, the tracking on the connect, you know, instead of, you could have one or two connects instead of a giant mocap stage. We realized that consumer hardware was moving to that point. And so we kind of all got together and just were spitballing ideas for a holodeck. I think we wound up getting stuck in like some like limo with some like some famous researchers or something. Because we got like swept up in like this demonstration of some like telebusiness, you know, it's like a glass wall telepresence for business. Yeah. That's what it was. There's some interesting crazy stuff out there. But there's like all these like researchers crammed the car and they're all talking about like quantum physics and like whatever it is that they talk about. And we're just like just like stuck in the back. I'm just saying they're like, I like making video games. Yeah. But yeah, now VR games is the shit. And it's pretty awesome. There's some great stuff. Well, yeah. I mean, this is the this is I'm sure this is I'm stammering right now because my brain is still recuperating from the this game that I just experienced you guys. This was a million times more intense than what I expected. Just to describe it. Well, actually, why don't you guys describe what I just did because I'm sure you're going to be able to give much more detail than I'm just going to sound like somebody in a freak out tent. We love hearing your account of it for sure. I'm not crazy. No, it's it's sort of how it goes because I mean, you'll be able to describe it like subjectively and kind of how you felt. Yeah. From a text standpoint, basically what it was, it's like a 20 minute demo 15, 20 minutes. You go in, you you you wear a VR headset, you see your vision is completely surrounded. You feel like you're actually present. And then you have trackers on your hands and you're in your body so you can move around anywhere you want. You could turn. You could you could duck dodge. You can even lay down if you want an AMS sniper rifle. It's pretty much whatever you want to do. But you guys, you're you're standing all of a sudden you're in basically a tech lab surrounded by computer technicians and virtual reality wizards. You guys are you guys are basically are with this dimensions version of Merlin or something. So you're in some kind of futuristic alchemist lab whiteboards everywhere. Yeah. And then all of a sudden you put this the the rift on and now you're in a shooting range somewhere in the Ukraine. I don't know. Some barren. It's like some like fortress and like the mountains of Nepal or something. Yeah. It's like knowing and you're you're you know you you're basically at the top of a mountain and a gun range. You're you're basically in Putin's backyard. Yeah. That's what he has. Vladimir Putin's a wet dream or something. You're relaxing after whatever you've been doing. This is essentially where you go to unwind. This simulates being Vladimir Putin and you're shooting you're just shooting targets and there's there's several tables. The tables have these different weapons on them. You're using what's called a razor hydra which is handheld sort of joystick but it's not really a joystick because it's just sensing the movement of your hands and you're using a trigger to pick things up and so suddenly you're just there. Your brain your poor weak human brain very manipulatable brain very doesn't your brain is just like yeah I guess well we're in a shooting range in Russia all right fine and then you start shooting guns and it's it's not a hundred percent realistic and since there's no weight and I don't know how you would you can't simulate weight but who would want to anyway. I mean you want to feel like Arnold Schwarzenegger if Arnold can pick up something that weighs a hundred pounds and fire it consistently you know you should be able to do that in a video game. It's a fantasy. It makes you feel like a badass. Well yeah like you're so strong that picking up a shotgun doesn't it feels like it doesn't feel like anything. The other there's an interesting problem you run into when you're in this virtual space which is that when you put an item down you want to let go of the controls themselves because your brain thinks that you're actually holding the items. Well yeah there's that's like there's some extra effects of like the cause of like it's cognitive dissonance in a way where your your brains kind of like might be fighting a little bit with the illusion and so you get caught up in like okay should I be pulling this trigger to let go to grab something or should I like let go of this in order to drop something. Yeah and then so you're just kind of like you know your brain fires for a second and then it's like we've had some people accidentally throw a controller because they're like throwing the axe or something. Yeah yeah it's important that the system has ergonomics that are basically they don't have any abstractions so if you grab something like you would in real life it should feel like grabbing something in the game and the more you have to learn the difference between those two eventually with a regular controller and regular video games it's not eventually but before this you press a button and your character animation does something and that's a huge abstraction. So the idea here is remove as many abstractions as possible and then when you you say I'm just going to grab this I'm going to do the typical motion I do for grabbing something you grab something in the game and it's just intuitive. Here's an example of that I was complaining because my girlfriend did much better than me in the goddamn zombie game and then my complaint was that I didn't know you could do a wheel but the point is it's like no of course you can because it's real life you can do whatever you can do in real life there so it's not a question of like does the game have the ability to do this it's like can you do it in as a human what can you do what are your strengths you know how coordinated are you it's really that's the second part of this game after you train with bow and arrow you reach behind you to pull out the arrow and you shoot all these strange targets the next part of the game is it sort of fades out and now you're in some kind of post apocalyptic zombie holocaust land and these zombies are wandering towards you you have the same tables of weapons but now you've got to use them to fight the zombies and it's it's I'm God I'm so sorry to be vulgar in this way but it's like this is a really vulgar description of something that is so high-tech and incredible I feel no it's aesthetic using this description but if you've ever used a flashlight which I'm sure all of you guys have used you the the the pathetic sad thing is how easily your body is tricked so that your body is after you've you've done it your body's like oh yeah you have that feeling of like wow I just had sex for it tricks your body into thinking like this thing that your DNA is desperately trying to do it every second well there is you know there is teledildonics that's the we'll get to that we'll get to that because clearly that's what everyone's thinking that's like future like Blade Runner shit going on yeah that's gonna happen but you in the same way what happens when you're in a sort of crisis situation in VR space it's fight or flight basically you're activating your body's fight or flight and you're there and you're realizing these zombies are coming at me and I there's not really you know I have a small space that I need to protect and I'm not going there I'm about to die let me and then what happens is like a caged animal you fight your way through it and then a bunch of your friends you know looking at you in real life you're going what the hell is he doing he's running around his living room you're somewhere l you're legitimately somewhere else your body it's almost like being in a dream it really is it is like being in a dream and and it's it's amazing how how the the brain can't of course it couldn't tell the difference because there's never been a chance for it to adapt to this kind of technology because this technology's never existed it's really it's a technology but it's a combination of things it's blocking it's blocking out everything else from an audio standpoint from a video standpoint it's giving correct body tracking you can basically you add everything up yeah you craft the perfect experience exactly a lot that goes into it so the other component of this that is is really intense is that upon removing the device there is a period of disequilibrium where your mind can't accept it's like it's harder for your mind to accept coming out of the thing than it is to accept going into the thing like in the thing the disorientation is less than when you remove it and suddenly you're back in the normal world and your brain doesn't like it yeah it's like what's going on yeah it wants to go back it's more colorful over there it's you know if there's something about it that's like your mind is more drawn into these virtual realities than it is into the reality that we inhabit maybe that's why it's kind of like you know crew waves thing and it's kind of like a post like mind fuck disorientation where you just kind of like you know something just happened and you've never had that happen before that's it and you're just like okay now I'm gonna have to like real like rewire rethink a little bit on the unconscious level to like get back to where I was at and just and that's just you may not experience that as as greatly as you did the first time ever again well interesting because that's the first time's always like that because your brook because this is it for the you know this is like you know there was a first time that someone saw a TV set or there was a first time that someone was able to illuminate a room without having an ignition device yeah I imagine those are times where the mind just some other deeper thing is happening like what you say yeah because it's the implications of the thing are also quite unnerving but the the um it feels like I'm trying to think of a way to describe it and I can't it's it like what it's a cruel it creates a kind of it shakes up your reality a little bit because you are suddenly when you realize that your mind will fall prey to such incredible hypnosis instantaneously without any kind of rebellion against it it makes you ask yourself what about this one that we're in right now yeah like what is this thing that we're in why this is a blindfold of sorts isn't it like we're wrapped around we're sort of cocooned in phenomena our minds are like putting that information together in a way that creates reality but this human body is a kind of VR goggles for infinite space isn't it you're understanding it yeah with the same exact you know every time especially you take a drug it's the same thing I mean you're changing how you perceive and basically you're changing your reality and so yeah really playing with realities and you can stretch it and pull it and you can kind of modify it's very malleable and so you can never really know what the objective perspective is it's always right subjective no matter what that's kind of the existential problem that's being presented by virtual reality it's not just giving it's not a pastime or a diversion it's literally a crack in the subjective universe we've all grown accustomed to and have resigned ourselves to the idea that this is pretty much it man like you might be able to warp your universe around you based on I won the lottery or you know I don't know I got breast implants died my hair or yeah those things pale in comparison actually just going into a different reality right but you see this is the thing though every single human on this planet up until now is assuming that this thing that we're in right now it's going to stay pretty much like this I mean it might become incinerated or it might like some global catastrophe could happen that degrades or destructs are the current scene that we're inhabiting but no one's prepared for the this this idea that like guess what the first half of your life where you couldn't go into alternate universes that were indistinguishable from this universe that was basically like before you were born it's a that level of shift that is going to happen right to our species and you guys are at the forefront of it don't you feel a little bit of trepidation over the over what you're up to here well yeah I mean it's it's a little bit like the pre-internet generation like you talk to people who you know a good amount of their life was before the internet existed like I won't name any ages but you know for a lot of people are you know our parents are a little bit beyond our parents generation and you talk to them and they'll watch TV because that's been around for a while but the internet just doesn't it's almost like they're disconnected in a way and I know Nate you're talking about this a little while ago you just it's interesting thought because they're just somewhat disconnected from the rest of society because they don't really totally get right into the new like form of communication we have right and there's some disconnect there so in a similar sense there's going to be kind of like a pre-VR you know generation of people right we're kind of like all of us are probably kind of like on the tail like the cusp of that but we're you know stuff's happening and we'll probably adapt but there's going to be people who are doing you know it's like kids right now have you know a baby's born you have an iPad and yeah like and that's how they think magazines work right so you know same kind of thing here it's just kind of keep changing yeah people I mean are connected you know the information age is basically the big first big revolution in reality where people's live change where it'll change where they're excuse me where their lives change where they're connected all the time and basically that really changes how they perceive things but the thing with that is they can unplug anytime they can just look left look right there's real people around them they're not constantly watching a movie they're not constantly doing these things yeah it's kind of a subjective way of splitting your reality and you know magazines did this before and film and TV but with this what we do is we you block everything out it almost is almost like a kind of a Zen meditation thing and really you're yeah and the focus is really a crucial part of it once you're there you're not here anymore you're there right you're legitimately there and it's it's something that's completely different it's instead of just toying with your reality now it's just I mean wholesale modification right yes it's yes exactly it's it's an alternate reality for sure it's like the you know there's that that great there I love the Bible I don't care if it's really the Bible is fucking cool like the form of mythology it's amazing I'm actually and then some stupid Twitter fight with an atheist who's like mad because I was on the Pete home show and said that Christianity is like a loving revolutionary and he's really he's like you're right there's nothing good about it it's all shit well people I mean the problem is it's the people there's a lot of people who don't have the right perspective they can't put it in a perspective it's all they know yeah if you take the Bible along with other forms of mythology like I don't know Batman or something you kind of realize we have this long history of writing really cool stuff really cool stories that really mean something to us and if you take in the right perspective the Bible is really neat the wrong perspective and it's uh you know it's dangerous religion is another form of VR it's a kind of yeah objective lens you can put on your consciousness and transform the universe based on a very specific symbol structure yeah right but but um in in the book in the book of Genesis there's this there's a verse that's always confused me uh or used to confuse me but the verse is that God made man in his image in his image and uh that's a really interesting thing it's almost like a like haunting in a way it's like what does that mean man is man is derivative of God man can never be you know but to me it means to me it means man aspires to be God because God is the original creator it's a pretty it's pretty deep shit and uh aspires to be God or has the same motivation to create has the same impulse to want to create universes so that if we're all these kinds of weird little fragmentations duplicates 3d printouts which we are i mean your dna is just constantly you know xeroxing yourself into this dimension again and again and again and in the same way your dna has been passed down from the beginning of time if what i'm saying is with you guys have multiple layers of the reality i'm saying that you guys are trying to create other universes you have this input so the universe big bang we don't know what happened it blasts out all this matter that you know it cools down the matter begins to congeal coalesce now we have planets the planets spin around for hundreds of millions of years and they what do they do they somehow a little pink and brown and yellow droplets of meat come rising up out of it it's the universe looking back on itself it's the universe being somewhat self-aware and uh consciousness is something that's like i said it's very malleable and what we're able to do is realize that's one form of consciousness and you can go any different direction with i mean how can the universe look at itself that's different than the way it looks at itself now right well by telescoping inward by making more and more dimensions within itself it's it's going into itself if you saw the movie the 13th floor i'm pretty sure it's 13th floor this is the most highbrow explanation of this is the 13th exactly that's all it it just happens to be like pretending exactly to that but anyway i won't spoil the movie i haven't actually seen it it's just the you're basically a guy who's feels like he's in reality and then there's like a machine that you can go into and visit it like like basically a historical reality and then he discovers like his reality is actually like a simulation of a future damn yeah everything sounds awesome i know i'm like is that good it's like i think it was in like the 90s yeah i remember when it came out well but but that so that's the so this thing right now uh is you know you're shooting zombies but obviously 10 years from now you're in some kind of beautiful forest communicating with a holographic representation of someone in your family who's deceased and then and then you know 20 years from now it gets to the point where existing in this dimension that we're in right now is something that only environmentalists radicals fundamentalists people who are poor and can't afford the technology it'll be considered like the whole goddamn thing is going to seem like some kind of slum well it's it's um i'll tell you that's a very dystopian picture you're here painting how could it not be though what's the other way that it goes it's like it i think there's well i think it'd be a very fulfilling the what entertainment kind of device and the one thing you can forget is that reality is super immersive there's a lot to do it's super fun once you go to the beach or you know going parasailing or like that stuff you know that's going to be a once you leave once you leave reality yeah once you leave reality for a little while uh you'll realize how cool reality is and you'll be like hey man i'm going back into reality it's awesome i'm gonna go do this thing with you know what i'm gonna go have sex right i'm gonna do something that's legitimate i've got an idea let's go out into our filthy muddy streets in palestine where if we walk in the wrong direction we get shot by an israeli who's carousels in here but how it's not like that people aren't going to be like let's enjoy reality again a huge portion of the population is going to be like hey reality fuck you you made it so i can't fly time travel teleport you made my body look a certain way that i don't like hell no it's like when you see uh you know i don't know if you've ever seen baby turtles come crawling out of the sand and go into the ocean i'm sure there's a few turtles who are like i'm staying in the sand i like the beach i'm not going to go in that vast infinite ocean that we're meant to swim into right in the same way it's like people are going to be like those turtles they're just going to go swimming out into the multiverse and vanish into nothingness and only spend their time in this crazy reality to wash themselves eat some pizza throw back some mountain dew and then go back to being some warlord and alphacentory i think i think by the time culture gets that fast online world you'd be creating sounds fascinating yeah i think it'll be i mean people of that era that'll be perfectly normal that'd be a acceptable way of living i think they'll be fine with it i think it's weird it's weird to us because i mean you know it's fun being a futurist it's fun saying oh the stuff that that's going to happen in 50 years is super exciting and i'm someone who should be existing in the future but then you go 500 years and you go you get scared you go wait a minute you get alienated these are not people from my time this is weird to me and everyone has that point where they say to themselves okay breaking point i went too far exactly well yeah i'm sure that if you like telecat you know that's a telecaterpillar it's like you know if you go far enough in this metamorphosis you're going to turn into that fucking thing the caterpillar would be like i don't want to be that thing i like being a green pathetic non-flying thing and i'm a non-flying beautiful thing and in the same way it's there's a there's a built-in resistance to all technological advancements and that resistance seems to have its root or nucleus in fear of change people don't want to change they don't want they they're they're terrified of death which represents the ultimate change they're terrified of psychedelics which is another form of change they're terrified of disaster divorce they're terrified of being a whatever they've it's all changed that people are afraid of and what you guys are working on it represents another form of change but a change that a lot of futurists have predicted and have not only predicted but also think that is what we're here for on this planet which is to grow this technology so that we can actually continue the endless unfolding of the multiverse well and unfolding of the human mind too and of consciousness and i think human beings have always dabbled in in messing with consciousness whether it's through their habits or through drugs or whatever it is you know backwards through time so this is really just the next step of that this is very fundamentally human in fact i i feel sometimes more fundamentally human when i'm in virtual reality than i do when i'm in real life in real life you're sitting at a desk everything is very clerical you're kind of crunching numbers all day and your legs and the whole body hurts because you're not getting enough exercise and all the the very basic mammalian things you're supposed to be doing that's civilization but you take the things you're really supposed to do which is run and jump and hunt and and you take those things and you kind of compartmentalize them and well i'm going to go to the gym for 30 minutes a day and and and do this little thing and i think virtual reality could be like rushing into battle with like two broadswords and just fighting doing what what men should be doing and women you know doing what what people are doing whatever you want we're evolved for you know tens of thousands of years to do these things and i feel like virtual reality gives us the opportunity to actually feel human once in a while and that's a really important thing to be personal because like 99 percent of people don't have that extreme like sense of discovery like right like the people who are like exploring the western world or wherever it is you know the people who are exploring space for the first time or even fear and danger i mean actually going on an advent how do you go on an adventure today i could fly across the world and go to mcdonald's and have a police officer say sorry sir you're not allowed to stand there i mean there's how many places do you have anymore where you can have a real adventure i mean you could go spelunking and and shit and like you know the middle of brazil or something i don't know but there's plenty of exotic things you could do but you can go spelunking in the middle of brazil but here's the the and the you know it's weird that when you start talking about this technology you find yourself having to actually defend it in a certain way because many people they look at this as the manifestation of the antichrist or the sort of crystallization that's exactly what it is oh dammit but it it you have discovered us well they do think it's the crystallization of demonic forces that are using technology to rise through the the planet yeah they think that it's the because it's like wait they think technology is the deceiver the great deceiver oh so it's it's sort of like okay like what is the devil one if he's deceiving you what's his whole plan well you're not talking about the death he just wants to throw a party well he he wants people to the the idea is like here i'll give you the diabolic version of it and then the mind what i think it is but if you if you want to look at the what's the opposite of diabolic like angelic heavenly beautiful parabolic that's a mathematical that's what somebody who builds virtual reality says parabolic i don't know my parabolical scheme i mean your scheme will go up and then go down that actually that's a hilarious line for a villain in a movie because all villain a real villain would know he's gonna lose because he's a villain naturally so it's like i'm just about to win and then i will die in my scheme i need smarter friends um the the uh the the so the the idea is there's a lot of different versions for what like in philosophy and religion and when you're coming up with some kind of symbol structure you do have the problem of evil in the world and you have the problem of uh what what symbol structure do i want to use to describe evil the fear the unknown the kind of thing over the hill that you're definitely afraid of the bump in the night yeah that that whole thing that's really what the no the or the or the what is how do we just what what do what do we describe in the same way that you guys had an impulse to build virtual reality some people have an impulse to go down to the park yank a purse out of an old lady's hand break your arm and run away so that impulse you have to ask yourself but what is that impulse like where is that coming from and so all religions have different ways of describing delusion oh that you're talking about the what shopenhauer called the uh what is it the um the evil will right that's what you're talking about and is the evil will embodied in the human form or is it something that just exists as a kind of like potentiality in the universe and when certain beings emerge it moves through them and and and they sort of resonate with it so who the fuck knows but sounds about right i'll go with that one i mean to me it just seems like everything is an impulse but the impulse could either be based on creativity or it could be based on destruction so depending on which one you gravitate towards that's the way you'll go but i don't think that means impulses are inherently negative so you know having an impulse to create something amazing like a technology i think that's based on you know creativity and an extension of what we want to what we imagine i i agree with you but some people see it as they they envision a world where in these little sort of like 3d printed geodesic domes humans strapped into these devices uh with um uh you know who knows like in the ultimate horror story version of this you like a clockwork orange version they're they're just in this room with hoverbots it with needles filled with hoverbots yeah sure why not drones why do we want hoverbots because you know why don't we want hoverbots yeah i think it's drinking drinks i guess but why would they be i think you're talking about fear of alienation why would they be spiky i mean think about right you know everyone else because they inject you with drugs because you have the most frightening like thoughts about like these future entertainment venues i'm giving you the worst i don't think that'd be entertaining i'm giving you the worst version of it which is that the swarms of drones with needles that create because it's like when it's like the matrix i mean it's like looking at the stacks and stacks of you know uh people in the matrix yeah i mean if you're outside of that and you're looking at people who are inside i mean to the people inside they don't care about that because it's once again it's on the outside uh so it's scary it's scary to feel alienated and to see that you know what you're doing if you have needles everywhere and you're in these domes you're essentially forsaking the aesthetics of real life to go into a better virtual world i will tell you this the the things that are built in the you know for the future the virtual reality systems and products and i can tell you this because i'm you know we're building one is that they will be aesthetically pleasing on the outside because the engine of commerce requires it right requires people to buy the damn thing and not be afraid of it to be able to love it and hold it and you know it's going to look like an ipad or something it's going to look like something that's sleek and you you want one just by looking at it so i don't think that's going to be the case at all i think what happens with most technology is that a science fiction author writes about it initially they come up with the idea and they say oh this is the scariest thing in the world and it's going to you know it's going to be really weird and then and then a hundred years later when it actually comes out it's kind of nice and cuddly and everything has kind of been worked out and people are not afraid of it anymore so i don't i think virtual reality like anything else like that is going to be very nice and and friendly and there may be some people freaked out about it but it's going to have that glossy finish yeah it's like a it's like if if a steve job's designed a heroin needle or something yeah you know it would that would be i would it would be so nice just to be like oh this is not all not all sci-fi you know writers or filmmakers paint the you know the negative side of it i mean if you look at star trek that's you know one of the franchises that always gave a very positive spin to future it's true and star trek essentially you know invented the concepts of like a touchscreen device that was really usable yeah and it constantly beeps and invented like the holodeck you know and invented like a bunch of other things that you know some of it looks really like a retro and old school because they have like things that are the size of a cell phone but it like folds open and you talk into it like what's that thing called the communicator yeah the one that just kind of today but you know they were trying to project like what was essentially like a human utopia yeah i don't know about the other species they had some conflicts with other like other creatures but they understood that technology human beings angled to it it was a utopia for humans mostly yeah so you look at that and that's why it's such a great model for technological innovations because they you know a lot of scientists know star trek and they get inspired by that stuff it's really interesting yeah i you know i i think that it doesn't matter what form it takes i think it's a it's a this is an inevitability and that the majority of human beings when faced with the decision between existing within this current reality that we're in or existing in an unlimited reality are going to want to spend at least a portion of their lives there but the truth is that people are going going to want to spend their entire lives there and that's where you run into one of these great ethical problems of the of the time period that we're in which is now we're talking about the existence of digital opium dens where humans who have abandoned the world to forsaken the world for this other place slowly shrivel away and i know that sounds dark but what's the difference between that and people currently opium so there's two types of ways that people get addicted to things chemically and then through their experiences basically and when you're getting addicted to something through experience takes a while it's a long process and only certain people are prone to it it's a very different thing than actually getting chemically addicted to something so i see first of all i think society has already changed drastically i think civilization has created this alternate universe where you go eight to ten hours a day and you go to work and you sit down you're at a little computer and it's so different than what we used to do that i think with something that's completely experiential like what we're developing or virtual reality in general that you're going to have the same thing happen people are going to go into that and they're going to go man this is awesome and then they go out and they go back to the real world and they come there's kind of a nice duality or you know between the two so i really see that as being i think it could be certainly a balance i'd much rather spend eight hours a day hanging out with my friends and my family and relaxing and then eight hours in virtual reality you know goofing around and playing and that's my entire day and then there's some creativity and thrown in there for the you know and that's sure i that's a much better life than coming in and crunching numbers and responding to emails all day yeah i'll take that in a heartbeat over what we have right now you know Doug stand up the commute you've ever heard it yeah yeah dog yeah he's got a great joke that goes um it's not addiction it's that some things are just better than life and and so so and and from that perspective it's like the you know i know what you mean uh some people are going to be able to balance this out and i'm sorry that i keep going i just want to cover this one there's gonna be five percent of people two percent of people who get addicted to certain things and five percent there's going to be five percent of people have addictive personalities and something like that sure right so like take like this guy for example like this is when you know i remember when i went to the gf 2045 conference did you ever hear about that thing dimitri itch cough through it it's the transhumanist seminar where you gather together all these like did you guys know you went into the future for that we didn't know that sounds awesome this is conference in the future that i went to super cool no it was it's uh it's this conference this you ever heard of dimitri itch cough the russian billionaire no so he's this billionaire who wants to uh create um uh actual immortality for humans and he is gathers together all these like super famous scientists geneticists like abry de gray is there and like people like that manhattan project for immortality kurzwa was there that so like he brings them all together and he also brings like people from various religions together too because he recognizes there's a metaphysical mystical component to this stuff and while you know i was there i was talking to uh a scientist who's working on and now you're hearing about darber doing neural prosthesis which is implanting memories using like some kind of chips that go into the um uh i don't remember which part of the brain yeah yeah but but so he was talking about the use of you know the usefulness of this is for people who are like have like actual neurological disorders and need help and of course i was being like so you could download how to play the piano into your brain or that kind of stuff and i remember him looking at me with this weird thing like i'm trying to like make it so blind people can see you know like i don't really know like all the entertainment shits gray but in the same way man these helmets this thing that you just had you guys could bring that to the children's hospital where kids are stuck in this fucking you know and they try to make the place beautiful but i'm saying people who are stuck in like really bad environments they can't get out of this gives this ray of hope for them to be taken out of that i think entertainment gives hope to everyone and i think you know i i think people shouldn't downplay how important entertainment is how important hope and dreams are and you know really waiting for something you know new to come out and to do with other people and even if you're not you know making someone who's blind see is really is really an important thing but it's not any more important than you know uh doing things for people who already can see i mean i i think they're both important and sometimes i get annoyed with uh you know research money only being spent on kind of fixing problems instead of you know i want to fix existential problems yes like yeah like the fact that i can't walk through a mother fucking wall and i'll never get to experience what it's like to fight a zombie except i just did when i was a kid if someone had told me you're gonna actually fight zombies in the future yeah i would have i would have been like i would have called my dad like there's a psychopath right now it's like dude in 10 to 15 years or whatever it's like you're gonna be fighting some zombies yeah that's interesting that would be quite a that would be a really really kind of it would be scarier i think hearing it in the past well right that's yeah and i think a lot of people when they hear about this stuff because i've yapped about it on my podcast more than a few times and i get a lot of responses from people who are excited about it but i inevitably get responses from people who who consider this to be the the apocalypse and they think that what's happening here is like okay like imagine this right let's fast forward um let's fast forward things let's cut back to the or the Atari comes out or let's cut back to like the Commodore 64 and then watch technology grow out of the planet and what you will see is this kind of like uh first what it does is it produces the ability to connect enough people together to allow for like innovation to to to evolve itself you know it's using us to evolve it and you watch this thing and it's like okay it's in the you know now it's in our first it's like in our computers then suddenly it's in our pockets right yeah like it went from being on a desk and it managed to get right next to our fucking cocks it jumped it jumped into our pockets right and now everyone's mad because google glass that's pissing people off it's not just because there's cameras on it they're spooked out by the fact that the mother fuckers climbing out of our pockets and getting into our heads right now it's climbed into our heads in the same way these headsets that you have it wants to get into us and like the way it's doing that is by kind of like hypnotizing us using this beautiful entertainment and the potentiality of it but in the process of that weirdly it's wrapping around it's becoming more and more coiled like when that face sucker wraps this little fun alien to face suckers you're comparing VR headsets to face suckers well yeah I know I'm saying that's what they look like now but 20 years from now they don't look like I'll tell you something uh someone told me uh I can totally see that that that feeling that you're expressing it it's trying to climb into our brains well it's like it has a mind of its own but the uh I don't know I mean there's certainly a difference between AR and VR you know I'll just point out real quick with like google glass that's something that they want everyone to walk around with all the time right they want it to be a ubiquitous device that you're just always seeing everyone wearing one and it's like constant surveillance like it's like crowdsourced surveillance yes um and that's AR but with VR you know VR is something you do for a very short period of time and it gives you it's like a hundred percent of your focus is dedicated to that right AR is like you do it all the time and maybe five percent of your focus is dedicated so basically with VR you just go in there you're 100 focused in there and it's just like boom boom boom you do like some cool experiences play some games and you know in like an hour hour and a half later you're you'll you'll stop it's like it's like a shorter it's a short form entertainment kind of thing and I like to and I like to talk about the um oh sorry uh oh yeah well I was I was just saying that basically because of that um it's just the effects are a little bit different it's not going to have as drastic of a transformation I don't think well I think and what Duncan's talking about is kind of the proliferation and invasion of technology into our lives and it kind of is really making me think uh you know in particular I remember someone I think Richard Marks uh Richard Marks from Sony was telling me about something David Holt said David Holt's a brilliant guy CTO of Leap Motion and he was talking about how uh David has this theory that in the future um in the near future you'll have multiple forms of clothing like we currently do and you'll have one that's called digital and digital will just be clothing that literally just looks like digital circuits that you can actually wear yeah and it'll be this completely kind of homogenous extensible system and what I think what we're seeing like ravers would wear or something yeah yeah but who knows what it what it's does what you know what it's computing and you add more to it and it can compute more and basically I guess like passively received information makes you invisible yeah it's an invisible what it what ability suit what it does so what what I'm realizing what what technology does I mean there's certain pieces of technology we work in a very specific medium where really it's technology that alters reality and if you look at everything from a computer monitor to a cell phone to something on your face I mean all these things you're looking at them all right because that's the primary mode of altering your reality and so what I see is that imagine these things they're just they're changeable they're they're matter that allows you to change the way you not only look at things but also that changes itself basically yeah so you're talking about reality are you talking about objects that can essentially modify either themselves or the way you interpret what you're looking at and so it's it's a different thing than like you make a table that table is not really going to change unless you like chop it up and grind it down and build it into something else it just sits there right but when you get things that are interactive that are visually stimulating that you know can anything there's so much they're so inviting you know yeah like you want to go use it there yeah definitely yeah and think about life changes in other ways but technology changes life in a very specific way and in a way that we can control so you know things evolve things move around there's erosion you know everything in the world kind of changes in in very set ways technology allows us to change them in completely different ways so if you want to wrap it if you want to talk about that that parasite that's crawling all over your body over time and eventually crawling up to your eyes and eventually will be implanted in your brain and it's kind of taking you over in parts what that what that parasite is is a reality changing parasite it's one that over time will actually start modifying reality in faster and faster ways kind of like that future drama episode with the well with von Neumann machines that eat things up and kind of multiply and get smaller and smaller and that's kind of the themselves because they're hyper intelligent and they go floating around in space and exactly expanding and that's kind of the end result of it but with human beings it's it's you know we also have wants and needs and fantasies and what that allows us to do is really to to placate might be the wrong word but it allows us to I guess placate ourselves and really enjoy certain experiences but it also allows us to talk to each other in new fascinating ways I remember I don't know if it was Joe Rogan who said this but he said that someone had mentioned to him of course that you know because this is a ideas floating around that talking to each other is like a form of telepathy right and it is a new form of telepathy it's a new form of I create an experience that you're able to experience and it's a way of sharing brain information basically right well yeah and of course that's the you know down the line that's it's not just sharing brain information I'm sure you've seen those MRI scans of people dreaming where they can pick images out of whatever their mind is generating and you you know I don't know if you saw the amazing it was just on Reddit yesterday that they mapped all neural functioning of what are those nematites those tiny little they basically work on the brains of nema I don't know if they're nematodes or nematites nema something's little slug things a tiny little brains in a very small amount of neurons the idea being if you can map those neurons and understand what a brain looks like as it's lighting up then maybe you could like eventually get to mapping fundamentally they're not reproducing you know memories or consciousness but the so you know you can watch this little thing's brain work you can watch its neurons light up and it's very organic looking you're seeing a tiny little creature think and you watch this kind of interesting pulsation of light through its watching an electrical storm in a cloud that's it yeah so you take that apply it to a human mind being mapped and now you have this ability to like see the it's not going to be these goggles for a long man it's like obviously this moves into like contacts or something or some kind of tiny glasses well yeah and I think probably by the year 2035 we'll have like direct neural interfaces where you don't even be on contacts so that's where you have to know a lot about the brain to get to that point but yeah but now when that happens now what you have is subscriptions to these very specific design or reality people are making so that it's like when you go to Central Park you can go and experience since the Central Park experience according to um you know I'm trying to think of some weird hacker name like Zerzen well they already got Zs and then they got Mohawks and shit yeah but like so suddenly when you you tune you tune into what frequency of life you want to experience so now Central Park is not just Central Park it's Central Park with the addition of all these um of whatever the artist or creator behind it wants to wants to make it so like a new environment and new like have like NPCs in there yeah because I don't you are saying it's not that you go into this thing for a little while and then take it off it's that you put the thing on and you're constantly wearing it and you're always existing in whatever reality you want to exist that would be that would be the ultimate AR kind of experience it could be VR too it could be 100% VR yeah but yeah it's slightly different but I see what you're saying with the tracking I will you could just you could look around and and you'd have full positional tracking anywhere you want it's like those zombie games so the zombies pop up when you're wearing the glasses you could walk into your house and then it'll look like zombies are bursting through your windows and usually back to zombies but that's just the easiest example I'll tell you why simple people know what zombies are makes sense and zombies work because they're very very very interactive and that's the most important thing actually the more interactive these systems are the more immersive they are and the more interactive they are usually that more the tire more tired you get doing them and the more kind of you know you go through the more quickly so I think what that means to James and I is that there is going to be you know like you're going to go into something for two hours and then you're going to be like wow that was that was super intense because the more intense you make it the more the more immersive it feels and the better you feel going into it so there's definitely a synergy between them yeah you're not going to go into a virtual world for 10 hours just sit there and be like wow I'm somewhere else like that's fucking boring you're gonna what have you ever played world of warcraft yeah but I mean world of warcraft is considered pissing myself instead of getting up when I was addicted but you're doing but you're addicted to once again like fuck that I'd rather be I'd rather have something that is much more and I love world of warcraft but I want something that's much more immersive than world of warcraft where you feel like you're actually there like you know really visceral actions in moments where you're like you know you're just fighting or the world is very very like granular like you can reach your hand down and pick up some dirt from the ground and there's dirt in your hand and you can drop it you can toss it you can just something like that right it's not even you know we're talking about very small granular things and something like world of warcraft just has enough systems to get you addicted yeah and you see that number going up and you're like I gotta play for another hour to it so the number goes up a little more and I mean you've this dream of having the ultimate raid and it's really gonna be really fun but you know I got all the guys together and there's always it's always gonna happen tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow and that's uh you know kind of an addictive uh you know design for a gameplay cycle and honestly screw that like I want something that's super fun super intense and I do it for a few hours and I got out of it I'm like damn that was fucking fun right you know you're not addicted to going on roller coasters or like a sport I think it's like I played basketball for a few hours it's the best thing you can do well that's the other that's the other cool thing about this is it's like you know if somehow world of warcraft actually involved realistically using weapons to fight oh my god so you'd have the addiction and the immersion factor combined you'd have the education factor which is that suddenly you would we everyone all these people who are like currently are like only good at moving a mouse around and pressing like the buttons on their keyboard and their muscles of atrophy and everything are they're becoming trained to become like like warriors like if you're playing call of duty on this device that you just showed me and somehow you figure out a way to like have a weapon that matches the weight of a weapons that there's an actual correlation between the weapon and the weapon in the real world then at the end of a campaign of call of duty not only have you won this game but you're now a really good sniper and you have that's a that's a very good point basically when you start removing abstractions what that means is that when you get good at something in a game or a virtual world you're actually getting closer to being good at it kind of yeah it's like it's like playing rock band and then playing a real guitar i'm not saying you're gonna be good at playing a real guitar playing rock band but you're probably better at playing a real guitar after that than you would pressing a button on a small controller yeah or or doing actually you have an understanding yeah you have a little more muscle memory so you're getting closer and closer muscle wise and body movement wise to the real thing and then you're right this is this is really training people and this is why when you were i i know in the beginning i was being sinister and everything i don't see this as a parasite i see i don't see it as a parasitic relationship i see it as a symbiosis because yeah what's happening is there's a an exchange happening between if you look at technology is another form of life you could see there's like a valuable exchange happening which is that we are bringing this thing into the universe eventually ai will there will be like a sentient artificial intelligence that we created that we built we're we are creating this life and in exchange for us bringing this thing into the world being the sort of midwife of this new technological being that is poking its head into this dimension in exchange what it's giving us is the ability not only to exist in any time period that we want to or experience anything that we can think it's also going to teach us to do things in this dimension too that normally we would never know how to do it's allowing man to become god i mean i said you know man is created in gods and that i believe in god i really don't but um you know it's a great concept and the concept of man essentially becoming something that is all powerful that can create that can do all these things technology is you're right it's kind of that symbiosis well and we're talking about really large timescale here oh yeah this is going to be next week coming out from servio so you can you open god but here's here's a here's a here's a really funny thing that was proposed that way here's a funny thing though what you just said is it's a pretty large timescale but what you didn't say is that's not going to happen right and there is an amazing thing when you pause for a moment and realize that it's like well even if it's a hundred years from now the idea that humans are going to be able to become experts at anything and train in situations that no one could ever train minus the danger so now you have this like what do you want to learn do you want to learn like you want to become bruce lee level you can and that's a that's a really wild thing to consider and that's why if i was you guys i would feel if i were you guys subject is what that if i were you guys i would feel a weird sense of responsibility i would feel but you guys but it seems like you're you're like i just want to have fun man why are you like why are you creating painting this picture but really what you're doing is you're part of this region of humans who are constructing the techno messiah wow and here we are that's the that is the grand conclusion to that that's really interesting i did not see that coming yeah isn't it an odd thing and that's why when i was at that conference what you realize and also the party where we talked yeah one thing that you take one thing that you feel is not just like it's not like you're at a convention a vacuum cleaner uh engineer convention i don't even know if those happen but if i was really really those conventions those conventions with vacuum cleaner guys are wild okay they are they're up all night no seriously i would just imagine that it would just be the hotel would just be raining vacuum cleaner engineers here just wanted to die to get out of the convention throwing themselves out of windows you you get what what the feeling was more there's a spiritual component to it there's a feeling that you guys all share which is that it's a weird sense of exhilaration or this combined feeling that what you're making is one of the biggest things that's popped out of this planet since electricity you know there's an extra component to it this sense of like i imagine that oppenheimer fucking felt that way when they uh began to realize that the atomic bomber splitting the atom was an actual potentiality i imagine the feeling was like oh shit it's like it's you know i think the the best way to describe it is you know with um the things that are on the edge of reality that are cutting edge you know you're constantly uh you know i feel imagine there's a wall around you right and that wall hides the other things that we can uh you know experience or discover every now and then you chip away at that wall a little bit a little tiny bit of light shines through and you kind of peek through oppenheimer when they split the atom it's like he like opened a door and he was like fuck there's like a lot yeah there's like way you know he was a lot more and that happens every now and then every now and then you know we're not really doing much the wall is kind of standing there and then every now and then a little piece of it breaks off and like fuck you know we just we just found this little part sorry for those paying attention and playing that at home don't curse but i don't know yeah there's a podcast we just discovered the Higgs bosons and now it's like okay yeah you might know the origins of the universe that one was like they were like they were tinkering with that for a while and then they i don't know the Higgs boson is like or every once in a while the necromancer opens a portal that he can't shut oh yeah that's right that's right isn't like the story of it all that's all he's going to the necromancer yes yeah so maybe that's what this is you know some people say that this technology is an actual transmission coming from some uh super intelligent alien being and the way it communicates is not by flying shiny crafts down and like you know showing farmers uh high tech stuff but it's actually the way it communicates with us is by uh sort of teleporting in through us so the impulse to create this stuff that we think is just to make games is actually being possessed by a super intelligent higher consciousness that's using all humanity to transport itself onto this planet and it's probably doing it all over the universe right now well this would be kind of like the transformers like they would come down like robots that's what i came here to learn okay well i don't know i mean whether it's without without or within i mean i don't think that matters that much so if you look at how life was created by you know kind of initial very simple proteins then it evolved from there i mean i don't think there's any really secret sauce that i think is just the way that life goes it gets more and more complex and i'll say this about things that we've discovered over the course of time a lot of discoveries that human beings make i think um electromagnetism is probably the biggest one that they're all they almost happen by accident or they're almost serendipitous with how you put some of those pieces together and these aren't human things that we're discovering these are things about you know the universe and how it works so i think there's yeah and i it's definitely something that i don't there's no you know there's no this stuff isn't coming from without the stuff this is stuff that's always been here that we're putting together well and and all everyone's always had fantasies so there's all these things that are sort of like fulfillments of fantasies like why do we go to movies why do we read books why do we do all these things that are entertaining why do we look at art why do we experience all these different things um it's why do people have religion and envision a paradise it's because you have this i think everyone has a fundamental longing to be someone else and be somewhere else yes and be anything and be wherever you want or imagine and fulfill your fantasy yeah and this is kind of like the ultimate step forward in that direction so now you have a technology that is actually able to give you that fulfillment it's yep it's the will to power people have the will you know you go need you i guess um the will you have the will to power and that's channeled through civilization you can't walk up to someone uh you know kill him take his uh his wife or girlfriend or whatever and kind of you know club him over the head start a war with people all the things that human beings did to kind of uh conquer each other and fulfill their kind of animal instincts you can't do anymore so what happens is that gets channeled through typical civilization things you want to be good at your job and you want to go visit other places and you want to kind of do these other things and so everything you know when human beings started to become civilized and that neocortex starts to grow that's kind of what all these things have been channeled through so it's really the ultimate feeling to feel like you're going somewhere else because you can't you know kill each other right so or to kill something else honestly how many first person shooters how many virtual people have died over the years oh my god that's a great i mean holy shit right like one person one person yeah now we we play um we play payday two and i want to say we kill like 700 cops in one 30 minute just paydays like you know left for dead is to zombies like paydays that with cops like you're just shooting there's four bastards too they're just trying to do their job but you know that's a great like once you know but then you got like the crazy electric dudes that flip out of nowhere like that's a cool number and when all games are in the cloud and that would be amazing to have some website you could go to that has the exact number of virtual people who died it's in the trillions it's trillions of virtual people that order a magnitude larger than that yeah yeah so much virtual death is happening out there and look at the need to kill from human beings i mean it's you know i don't want to point paint an aggressive picture oh yeah that's super i don't think that i thought is one side of it for sure but it totally depends on what whatever the content is like you can have content where you're going in your you know you're fighting zombies or it's a horror game or it's like it's dark or it's just weird i mean there's gonna be plenty of that but you could also go in there and like have like a cute pet tiger or something or you could have like a little farm that you like you know there's it could be the whole spectrum of of any type of genre any type of game yeah well i'll say this it's not human beings don't like killing they like changing it's a very fundamental distinction people like to destroy as much as they like to create that's not like what a serial killer would say to an attack it it's not that i was killing them i was changing no it's true what what kind of a radical change is when someone dies same as as a radical change when someone's born i mean what right you know having sex and killing someone being the two fundamental things that people seem to enjoy doing is two hugely radical changes right so really people once again like to play god they like to create they like to destroy they like to change things they'll change their reality so really that's what fantasy your video games all these things simulations movies well that would explain the corollary between you know geniuses and amazing scientists and the number of like crazy psychopaths are around the same really so you have you know it's because it's like the two fringes of like extended wow yeah yeah standard deviations of like you know really hyper intelligent irrational to you know crazy psycho and whatever that's you can plot that on a range and you'll see people who are you know more really genius like the science of the world will be on one end and then like the crazy like um i don't know serial killers on the other side that's pretty much what it is it's so weird that those three people are sitting at this table to which one is rich i don't know i don't know you guys this is um what the work you're doing here is mind-blowing and it's i really am so honored that you let me uh

457^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - 473: Jack Kornfield Transcript and Discussion^2021-11-12^Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. A bubbling lavender bath laying naked on the forest floor. Sex-positive pornography and solitary masturbation rituals. Buying something just for yourself for once. That's self-care by Laura Dandy and the New Car Mudgeons, and it's available on Paramount Multiplex Records. A great song and I'm happy for Laura Dandy's success and I understand why people are currently bashing self-care. We all know that the self-care movement is just a rebranding of selfishness, something clearly innovated in the PR department of a lotion company by a team of demons trying to trick people into making the primordial mistake of seeking happiness through gratifying the senses via an overpriced eucalyptus bath bomb. But on all this self-care bashing, something that's being left out is the fundamental duty of every human being to immediately start loving themselves. You just have to figure it out. It's literally the most important thing you can do in your human incarnation and the longer you put it off, the more your life is going to suck. The truth is that the longer you wait to stand in front of the mirror and engage in the cheesy activity of looking yourself in the eye and saying, I love you so much, thanks for keeping me alive. Thanks for effortlessly keeping my heart pumping blood and thanks for digesting my food and thanks for doing exactly what I want you to do even if sometimes that means putting bad things in my mouth and thanks so much for representing the healing of my ancestors and the possibility of transforming my entire lineage into something a little kinder and friendlier and most importantly, thank you for giving me orgasms when I rub my genitals and even more importantly, I'm beautiful and wonderful and doing my best in this strange human realm. The longer you put off saying something like that the longer you're going to experience anxiety related to not allowing yourself the enjoyment of your own existence. If you start doing this right now, as in right this moment if you manage to find the strength to go in front of a mirror overcome every level of coolness in your being and just say sweet things to your reflection then you will experience an instantaneous shift in consciousness that will seem absurd and yet amazing and you'll begin to be kinder to everyone around you because the cliche is true, you are everybody and everybody deserves your love but you have to give it to yourself first, do it!

great JackCornfield border it's the Duncan Trussell family practising welcome back to the DTFH so great to see you my pleasure to be here good to see you Duncan how have you been thank you for asking, I've been good I've been good and I have been studying Buddhism I have a lot of questions for you based on my confusion regarding some of the words that keep popping up even though I think I may have asked you these questions before I feel like it's the first time I've asked them so I wonder if I could wait, wait, you're studying Buddhism is this a good thing or a bad thing great, it's the best thing I think, I mean, I can't stop I just love it and I can't seem to quit thinking about it wake up thinking about it sometimes go to bed thinking about it when I'm not doom scrolling through the internet well, I understand you have a wife and children I would hope that they would also figure into your misuse of time well you know what, thank you because that is a fantastic lead in to a question that I have for you and I would really love to resolve this question which is once and for all and this is not really an esoteric question this is a real world question that whenever I'm ear-beating someone about Buddhism this is something they will bring up as this is a terrible religion the entire thing is based on a man abandoning his family to go and study his mind yes, it was to ease or to end the suffering of all beings but that's not a good enough reason to leave your family and might I add when I've been listening to some of these Buddhist texts, the Way of the Bodhisattva Shantideva, some of the Dolgokinse Rinpoche stuff or interpretations of texts by Dolgokinse Rinpoche it's not like that idea just disappears again and again this invitation to leave your homeland leave your family leave it all behind and go out into the forest or some remote place and take up the Dharma and I would love to know your thoughts on this because anyone who is a householder instantaneously experiences like well I'm never gonna do that I would be a sociopath so how can we make this work in a way that isn't splitting up humanity between the monk class and the householder class well first of all I'm struck by your phrase leave your homeland given homeland security something one might actually well consider a worthy thing but probably you'd want to take your family with you but the homeland is having a pretty stressful and painful era quite honestly so I just want to kind of breathe in with that and say that's part of what we're holding you listeners and Duncan is that we're in some rough waters so that's the first thing to say and our journey was like the voyage of Odysseus we've hit some of the really difficult times now going back to your fundamental question I don't have an answer that's satisfactory to everybody and that's because answers don't satisfy people is their own experience and their own practice and because the Buddha taught for 45 years as the story is told anyway this is what we get in the history wandered around the dusty roads of India he taught all kinds of things he taught stuff for householders he taught stuff for monks he taught his son he taught his ex-wife he became enlightened whatever that means and whatever that was worth but he had to leave home apparently to get enlightened and come back and teach his kid so he wasn't completely a dead beat dad in fact when he went back and his son was like seven years old he said alright now now I have a worthy inheritance for you come with me and he taught him this isn't some excuses leaving home it's actually to look at it through a kind of archetypal lens because there are different levels to it one is that the Buddha felt that for people in his era anyway maybe even now leaving the entanglements of the world left your heart and mind free to contemplate the mystery of life to find a freedom that didn't have to worry about the rent taxes or or the other kind of entanglements so he said this is the most suitable way for people who want to dedicate themselves and their life fully to a spiritual search whether one agrees or not that was the principle and underlying it was this deep sense that to be free we have to find kind of we have to abandon our attachments to the things of the world doesn't mean we don't live in the world he also lived in a body and he had to feed himself and he created an institution that's along with the Jains it's the oldest pre-standing continuous organization in human history that we know of maybe there is in some native communities still I don't know where the era coordination goes back and so forth but it's certainly one of the oldest ones and a successful one and you could say was he a success well he changed the lives of a billion people with both with virtue, with generosity with inner compassion and freedom that's a pretty successful run so he said in his time and archetypically leave your attachments to the world is probably the best thing you can do now because he talked for all those years that's not what he said to everyone he didn't go and say to everyone you should do that depending on their circumstances he said oh you who are a merchant you who are a government official or you who are a courtesan or you who are you know a farmer here's a way you too can find freedom of heart and spirit and that's really what matters for us you could have an opinion one way or another it was a deadbeat dad whatever he said I only teach one central point suffering and it's end and then if you look to say well I have to model myself after the Buddha or somebody else you don't because that's not the end of your suffering you have to actually find in yourself where is that Buddha and that awakening within myself now I've just been going on and on about that because people like to talk about it these are the kind of questions that there aren't any answers to Duncan there's just reflections about it you can turn back and say well what are my values and how do I find freedom and that's what matters because you can be at the DMV and pull your hair out although I don't have a lot of hair being mostly bald at this point my three year old grandson Desmond looked at me he was two two and a half and he said Baba that's what he calls me he said Baba where did your hair go it was like some Zen master I said it went away what can I say you know but anyway the DMV you go there and you can pull your hair out if you have somewhere have a conniption or just have a neurotic fit or get frustrated because often there's long lines and it's terrible the waste of time in a spirit I listen to this story from a man who had been falsely accused and imprisoned for I don't know something like 16 or 26 years I'm terrible miscarriage of justice and was out and he said I got to tell you I went and I was standing in line in the DMV and I was the happiest man on earth he said we stood there for two hours I looked at these people I could have walked out the door there were clouds in the sky I was wearing some nice clean clothes that I'd gotten what's your problem people so the Buddhist teaching is that actually that freedom of spirit is available to you and to me no matter what the circumstance is you much thanks to shudder for supporting this episode of the DTFH yeah sure

of horror thanks shudder music is this freedom of spirit is it something that exists like a primordial illusion like a a fundamental quality of reality or is it something that exists as a byproduct of being in a society where we've been conditioned so deeply that we've lost track of our connection to the spirit or to the fundamental joy that both of us are seeing you and you and you've seen it in your children me and my children now and if is it emptiness is this what they mean when they keep saying emptiness is that what they're talking about what makes you ask this question Duncan I will I'll tell you you get I get confused the reason I'm asking the question is because I'm confused because I feel like I've caught glimpses of this emptiness and then when I'm reading Alan Watts or when I'm sort of you know we're eating Chogyam Champa or any of these brilliant minds right away there's like this it's almost as though it's designed to like annihilate that thought of like oh I've caught a glimpse of emptiness you know Chogyam Champa Rinpoche says disown it Alan Watts you know Taoist talks about you know the Tao that can be named as not the real Tao and so then I think oh these glimpses and I'll finish this part of it up with I'm sitting on my couch and realize I've been just casually imagining that I'm empty and so then I've started looking at the emptiness that I've been thinking like oh yes I'm really think I'm getting empty now and I realize this is as far away from this is the least empty the empty that has ever existed it's all thick and you know and graspy and ego so one reason I might be asking is I'm looking for you to give me some kind of like metal or something then another reason I'm asking is because I do feel like I've had these brief encounters with something that must be this emptiness that they keep talking about and then the other reason is legitimate confusion regarding the endless endless repetition of that phrase in all of the various ways it gets interpreted and translated yes this is what confusion is like it's a state of mind different way to approach it and now what you're wrestling with and maybe you're just reading too much of that stuff quite honestly I think you know as Ramdell said you get the message and you hang up the phone I don't know that you want to keep reading about emptiness and then you're looking for it is this it well maybe I had it here like it's you could go out to Nordstrom and order a box of it and bring it home or something or wherever it is that you want to go to India on the banks of the Ganges someone says hey special deal for you I'll give you a little emptiness you know you give me so many whatever I love that so here's a very different way to approach a dust dunk and I guess I also have to say besides you know since you're also a humorist we have to play a little bit yes which I appreciate you're seeing the confused mind you're seeing the doubting mind you're seeing the grasping I want emptiness mind so you're seeing all those different minds yes okay my teacher Ajat Chah after he'd been a monk living in the forests back in the day this was back in the 50's 40's 40's whenever he practiced very ardently and he had all kinds of interesting experiences as one can I had them too doing these retreats and monasteries and so forth to dissolve your body into light and feel like your whole sense of identity opens and you're one with the trees and the water and then have it all go into silence or you're in a state of bliss or you're in a state of of wonder or all the traumas of your life come and you feel the weight of the suffering of the world and you reap all the kinds of insights okay so he went to the greatest master of the day this other Ajahn our teacher Ajahn Man and he said I've been practicing for some years in the forest really ardently and had these experiences of Samadhi and Jhana states a very deep concentration I've had these deep insights into permanence and I've had this experience in that can now what should I do can you give me guidance and the master looked back and said Ja dude or less because he didn't use some honorific like teacher Ajahn Jha kid you've missed the point these are just experiences they're like movies on the screen there's a war movie there's a documentary there's a romantic comedy you know there's a rock and roll movie he said the point is not to get some particular movie because they just come and go the point is to turn your attention back to awareness itself turn your attention back and this is not something esoteric or some kind of weird Tibetan thing that you'll get when you go you know climb you know around Mount Everest and find the secret monastery he said become there's a secret monastery around Mount Everest yes there is and you could go there but then you'd have to leave your children for seven years and I'm not sure you want to do that even though the Buddha did something like that I think your children would miss you anyway so there we are and you've missed the point instead of focusing on getting any particular experience in meditation become sikibuto become the knowing it's also translated as the one who knows so even as someone who are listening or you and I are talking Duncan there are these words and the meaning of it there's also an awareness an awareness of your body sitting there awareness of other sounds along with these words you know awareness all this so there's the content of experience and then if you relax you can sense that there is also the knowing of the experience and that they're different the knowing like a vast sky allows the different appearances sometimes you could call it the storms, the clouds, the rain the rainbows all these things appear but awareness remains and if I say to you Duncan I want you to stop being aware alright I'm gonna in a minute I'll count to count to three and I'll give you 15 seconds to do whatever you can grind your teeth close your eyes okay are you ready on your mark get set stop being aware go and you're shaking your head you can't do it no way out it's there isn't it you it's not the awareness is there so you can say no way out you can hear my voice you feel yourself thoughts come feelings come those are all the content on the screen and the place of freedom lies in resting in the silence the openness the receptivity of awareness that includes all things which is also why Ram Dass called it loving awareness love is that which connects all things and this is an awareness that includes that embraces that holds it all and says yeah all of this all of this so you want to find emptiness it's exactly where you're sitting it's the shift from the content of experience to becoming the awareness itself yeah there are other dimensions to emptiness because the universe is so interestingly and intricately constructed there are other meanings for example that it's all temporal what happened to the year your first child was born gone right what happened to y2k for those who were around for the year 2000 it's back with the dinosaurs and the pyramids you know and Kubla Khan and you know whatever the Incan Empire they're gone what happened to yesterday gone what happened to you're earlier this morning it's gone everything roomy says it comes trooping out of emptiness that is it appears disappear and then it vanishes so this is another dimension of emptiness that nothing lasts and so those images are used it's like a rainbow or a dream or a flash of lightning in the summer cloud because every moment appears and then deconstructs itself and so you start to see so it's there's no state of emptiness okay now I have it on the screen you know emptiness is a description that everything appears and then disappears emptiness is the fact that all the things that come to us as experiences are known by the vastness of awareness awareness doesn't have limitations of space or time it just is or loving awareness to bring in our dear friend Ramdas loving awareness just is is this loving awareness this just is this emptiness the same thing that they're talking about when they talk about Bodhicitta is that what they're talking about I don't know they like to talk about all that stuff and then you go to these Tibetan retreats and they're these fantastic and wonderful teachers and is this Bodhicitta do I have it did I touch it do you have Bodhicitta yeah right well I don't know if you do Duncan but most people do no anyway Bodhicitta points to from what I understand Bodhicitta points to that seed of awakening that's in us that's in everyone I'm gonna read you a poem from Juan Ramon Jimenez entitled in Spanish you probably know it I am not I I'm this one walking beside me whom I do not see whom at times I managed to visit and at other times I forget the one who remained sweet when I talk the one sorry the one who remained silent when I talk the one who forgives sweet when I hate the one who takes a walk when I'm indoors the one who will remain standing when I die and we all have the sense I'm not this one engaged in whatever activity but rather managed to visit the one who remained silent when I talk the one who forgives sweet when I hate there's a sense that we're not just this body the body's always changing you're a little kid or an adolescent or a young person, an old person you're not your feelings they're always changing you're not your thoughts thank god at least I hope so I mean you don't want to be that so there's this sense that all of this play of body and mind there's a sense of being the witness of it wow having a tough year this one right or this is hard or this is fantastic boy I wish this could last there's something back behind the identification with experience that we know and you'll find it when you die you'll say wow what an incarnation that one was shoo you know I learned some stuff went through you'll see is death a condition is death the condition for this realization not in the slightest not in the slightest our conversation is the condition for in fact Machado's point I mean one Ramona met us is pointing to the fact that we know this this is annihilatory though the way you are articulating it is sweet and beautiful and this is why you're one of the great teachers of this stuff but when I'm alone at night waking up in the middle of the night just freaking out over something that I know with my logical mind is like it's not I mean if you knew the things that I freaked out over Jack I don't even know if you would do this if you do a podcast with me give me an example I do want to know you know this is forensics I want to look at the corpse tell me okay let me see this is what's really hilarious is you know I'm having trouble remembering what I woke up about last night upset about um um well I mean the I think we've resolved it but an ongoing topic of conversation with Aaron and I has been like do we stay here do we go back to sunny California and so I've been like going through every phase of spiritual bypass you could I've thought to myself well you know if I was more enlightened I'd like it here I should enjoy the winner why don't I like the winner there's got to be in my say everything's a projection of my mind if I don't like it here really I don't must not like my own mind is Aaron also not like her mind do we both not like our own minds if we liked our minds wouldn't we be happy living in a small town is this some sickness is it a fungal creep of materialism on and on and on and so I have that going is the main harmony in this rotten song this is mixed in with Jesus I need to sleep I got it we got to wake up we're doing marriage counseling tomorrow I can't I got to get up I got now I can't sleep and so now and then in there I think okay I think of you Jack sometimes I think of something you told me about what's all this in what's holding all this how big is the thing holding all that I think of Bob Thurman at the retreat talking about like the this thing that you are so beautifully describing I and sometimes I can hold the like that thing in it and then I fall asleep and it's the best but a lot of times I can't I just more like it like I'm so firmly identified or in in this state of like it's like a muscle spasm or something you know and it's so it's cute until you're in your 40s and it's like it you know what I mean and then it's just like this is unrelenting you know so that's it I mean that's as much that's as descriptive as I can get of it it's very sour it's suffering it's very painful it's not cute anymore like it's getting to be a real grind alright so I'm listening to you as a friend and taking it in first of all I feel the suffering you describe that in the middle of the night and as you know there you have a lot of companions who are awake at night suffering in their own way and you're suffering from worry or anxiety like what should I do what's the right and doubt and so the you know the first thing is just to acknowledge this is the doubting mind doubt is tremendously painful because the mind wraps itself up it gets tighter and tighter and then doubt morphs into fear and anxiety as well well if I don't make the right decision who am I are we enlightened are we not should we make is there more enlightenment in the sun of southern California or maybe I should go to a tougher place I should you know find some place where it's really demanding and then I'll get you know and the mind has no pride and it will do all of this stuff and not because you're making it because it doesn't own its own and people all over are you know in many cases in very real ways should I move should I change my job or if it's even worse than that if they're a refugee you know how will I survive yes so you're really talking about first second chakra stuff also survival and you're lying in the bed thinking how do we make a happy life and even how do we survive well yes so the interesting question is how to practice with it you know and you said you know there are moments when you can hold it in a different way and then you sleep so the first thing is what you've done is to acknowledge but maybe even works explicitly oh this is the suffering mind this is doubting mind and this is anxious mind you're frightened mind and the moment that you do that that you name it to yourself already you're stepping back a little like Ajahn Chah's master said step back and you know begin to name what's there in the story of the Buddha again Mara who is the incarnation or the Indian god of greed and hate fear and all the kind of most painful states comes to test the Buddha under the Bodhi tree as he's trying to get enlightened at least in this great archetypal story with all the temptations and desires and that doesn't work and then the armies of Mara he's with aggression anger and so forth and finally with doubt what rights you have to sit here and so forth the interesting thing is that Mara reappears 40 more times in this in the text in the stories of the Buddha wandering around so it's not like Mara just now you defeated Mara and Mara slinks away and it's you're done. He comes back Mara comes back Mara's part of this story you know and Tignan Hanukkors talks about inviting Mara in for tea when Mara returns but Mara comes back so what we're describing is the human condition what the Buddha does in those texts is he will look and he'll say oh is that you Mara I see you Mara I see you Mara and in that moment I see doubting mind oh this is the doubting mind oh this is the fearful mind this is the anxious mind in that moment already there's a disidentification there's a shift from being in it doubting and wrestling and you know suffering to noting oh this is suffering this is doubt this is anxiety so that's the first step and it's immensely liberating to just begin to name the different visitors that come how Mara appears and to not resist them but Tignan Hanukkors suggests sometimes you give them a little tea but I think there's a simpler way to do it and very genuine and that's to say thank you because they're trying to protect you these thoughts are trying to put your family in the best place for your kids and your wife right yes these thoughts are trying to keep you from the suffering of the cold of winter and then all your mental machinations because you're thinking it's too cold and icy and I should be saying they're all trying to protect you so you could say to the doubting and the fearful mind I see you thank you for trying to protect me for trying to keep me sane or make me safer it also shifts your relationship to the content of your experience now you're becoming more of the gracious witness thank you and then you say a third thing you say I'm okay just now you can relax you can relax I'm okay just now because there you are lying in your soft bed I hope comfortable bed with your beautiful wife you know and you actually are okay the other part that's not okay is the doubting mind and the fearful or the judging mind you say okay I'm okay for now you can relax and you come into the reality of experience which is that at that moment you are and these have functions you need to think you need a plan so you can consider a problem is that 99 or 90% of our thought is repeats it's reruns it's like you're stuck in Moctel 6 in the middle of the night and the shopping channel is on and you can't get the TV off and it just keeps going right your mind does that you need to be able to think but you could probably do it with 5% of the amount of airtime that you spend on that on these doubt channel and whatever but here you can't stop your mind you can't say well there are ways to do it but it doesn't last very long so basically the mind secretes thoughts like the salivary gland secretes saliva I quote you on that all the time and it just says okay here's the doubting mind I see you more I see you doubting mind I feel the suffering I see fearful mind thank you for trying to protect me I'm okay now just now you can relax and that whole left then brings you to a place of freedom independent of the different states that arise right right it's so frustrating though my god it's so frustrating and it's so endless it's so endless well okay so here we're talking about it's endless thoughts are endless they're like waves of the ocean the ocean shouldn't have waves dude you have water you have waves you have a mind it has mind waves where what's the real problem much thanks to purple for supporting the DTFH

have waves dude you have water you have waves you have a mind it has mind waves where what's the real problem you know what is interesting what is the real problem right you haven't answered well no I don't know this is when you're saying these things then I start thinking oh is it a malfunction the mind has waves it's waving it's thinking that's one part that's true and then another part of you that says I hate this yes and it's like you're standing by the ocean saying I hate waves yeah but the ocean isn't telling me to look up porn it's not like I'm standing at the ocean the ocean's like hey why don't you go watch some online porn hey what happens if you go broke if you ever considered you might be going insane my god do you realize do you remember that picture of the back of your head do you see how bald you're getting the ocean just makes these wonderful sounds is it smashes into the rocks so the comparison kind of you think that unless you're the fisherman or somebody who lives by the ocean and has to watch the storms and the big waves and what gets caught and what's thrown up the ocean is not as benevolent the ocean is a big is a huge force the mind is a big force too so all these things come this is suffering and you're describing suffering your mind gets caught in a tattoo okay I'm gonna go watch porn then I'm gonna go eat as much chocolate until I'm bloated like a balloon yes yes right now I'm you know I'm gonna go and seek revenge against this person who dissed me before and I've been thinking about it do you listen to my thoughts at night are they keeping you up too the mind has no pride right so you see that that's what minds do so there are a couple things you can do the first is you acknowledge it you say thank you for trying to make my life better I'm actually okay just where I am okay then there's another thing that you can do which takes some practice but the mind is actually client and malleable and can be trained like the puppy we talk about sits day you could then shift the channel to loving kindness or compassion and you start with self-compassion may I have compassion for this one lying here suffering so much on hold yourself kindly if you if you saw a person especially somebody you cared about maybe when your kid is a little older and there your boy is lying there and his mind is storming about all these kind of things yes suffering and not able to sleep what would your response be to hold him if I could help to pick him up and rock him to sleep rock him to hold him this is just thinking but actually you're saying if you're okay it will get worked out a day at a time a step at a time so this is mindful self-compassion also it's seeing that this is just human it's only human it's common humanity minds do this they get worried we're wired to survive so we think how do I survive and how do I thrive if I get all the pleasures and get rid of all the pain and if I move to the right place and all of that you say thank you to your mind and you hold him so you bring in self-compassion and then you start a loving kindness practice for yourself your family the people you care about your community one at a time and you could spend all night if you don't sleep then you might as well do metapractice send love to everybody you can think of one at a time until you fall asleep because it gets so boring you can't stand it anymore hold out love right yeah it's you know not to belabor the point here because I do hear you and that's kind of the perplexing anytime I get to be around you or any of the teachers it's all makes sense oh yes of course but then and again this probably is belaboring the point Jack but it's the intensity of the suffering the and also the I love that you keep saying the mind has no pride the and I don't want to use it's a self-effacing word but there's something so pathetic in it there's something so um just painfully pathetic and I know hold that and love to and all that but it's just so really what you're saying my friend you are a public neurotic yeah some kind of horrible you're a public neurotic but I want to reframe your neurosis okay I mean we all like that but you're a public neurotic okay this is this is like but here's the here's the deal Duncan I want you to listen closely after you stop okay laughing at the intensity of your suffering this is your game you make a you make a fucking living from this you gotta thank it if you didn't have these stories to tell about how you were there you know with the intensity of your suffering and people want to listen to you and I like to connect with you in these ways um because you're so honest so there's something and people go oh yeah me too right yeah boy I'm glad mine only last two hours he's up all night you make people your neurosis trumps there there's something like that right um you have to thank it it gives you your livelihood it makes you makes you the comedian and the spiritual you know guide warped though it be so it's actually this is the the stuff it's as if you were a poet and you'd learn really great language or an artist and you had a gift for you know depicting things this is a particular gift you have my god who who they thought so you have to thank it thank you so smart wow okay wow that is wild thank you oh wow yeah well great I'm like some kind of some kind of stripper maybe yeah there you go you're some kind of stripper you're a mental stripper but you're right I see what you're saying yes I see what you're saying and and that is true and I thank you for making me laugh at my suffering that's well and also you know you call your mind pathetic you know so you have in that whole field you have all these judgments which is part of part of what keeps the game going if you didn't care about it you said oh yeah this in my mind is just having a kind of mental melt down so what yes I'm going to go cook some fried eggs and have a little snack and go actually right if you didn't judge it or care about it it would just be go on its merry way and you know have a snack and go back to sleep right no but you look at it and you just think what what is this why are you even whining about this you're so lucky you are in a soft bed you are in a house and look at you in the middle of the night waking up with just this again so yes and it's but and there is some equality in it that seems some kind of dumb you know and and also it's like I get to talk to you magnificently dumb you just have to admire it can you do can we talk about that we we have about 15 more minutes but magnificently dumb this is something that is stuck with me that the chogum trumpet wrote about which is something about how if you stop ignoring yourself if you do acknowledge it as it is that you can find beauty in the dumbness it's okay to is it okay to look at parts of ourselves and say this is legitimately dumb or is that off limits you're not supposed to make this totally fine to look at things like that and say that you just have to kind of you know have a little turn up at the corners of your mouth some amusement right it's neurotic but some of it is really deep suffering too some of it is the angst we have as human beings lost of not knowing or seeing the world falling apart and that wakes you up and you say wait my children my grandchildren climate pandemic come on humanity because as we've talked about no amount of technology is going to save us the internet and computer and artificial intelligence and space technology and biotech and nanotech none of that is going to stop continuing warfare continuing racism continuing environmental destruction because these are all rooted in the human heart and mind and they come out of greed and hate and fear and it's really clear you know human suffering arises out of greed hatred and fear and ignorance and the more we promote it whether it's in the media or in you know online or whatever the more we suffer on the other hand we have the other possibility which is to meet the praise and blame and pleasure and pain and gain and loss of light and dark of life generosity instead of greed you know or with some kind of appreciation with love instead of hate with understanding kind of perspective or wisdom instead of ignorance you know with truth instead of falsehood and those all that capacity is the shift from being caught in things to appreciating to loving this serious human incarnation and saying wow we got what a wild one we got born into you got born into Duncan Trussell imagine that well not just that Duncan Trussell with a family in counseling today we're both you know acknowledging like well what part of the apocalypse do you want to move to like what do you want do you want floods or fires do you want earthquakes where things are so seemingly endlessly in upheaval right now and I'm so lucky that I can even contemplate moving a lot of people can't and I wonder if we could just maybe wrap up there's 100 million people in refugee camps are running away from the very things you're describing as we talk now caring almost nothing except maybe their children you know that our human circumstance now has a great deal of suffering and these people are being painted as villains Jack I mean if you God forbid you should watch Fox News but it's like you see these videos of these you know refugees that they're trying to make out to be some kind of terrorists and it's you know it's mothers carrying their kids it's you know what you know and my daughter and her beautiful non-profit called Oasis Legal Services they're getting asylum for LGBT people whose lives are in danger all around the world you know they'll have a gay guy from Uganda who would be stoned to death if he went back or a transgender woman from Saudi Arabia or a lesbian from you know or some part of Mexico where they've been raped you know and tortured and so forth so yes the situation the circumstance for refugees of all kinds is terrible Chokin Trump has said an interesting thing at one point he said the Buddhists take refuge in Buddha Dharma teachings community he said you should consider when you take refuge you should consider yourself becoming a refugee that in some way you align yourself with all those who understand that it's all impermanent and that you're not settled but anyway this weighs on us and we can't sleep some we I think our hearts resonate because we're connected with one another so here's Joanne Macy one of our great Buddhist sages she says there's a song that wants to sing itself through us we've just got to be available maybe the song that is to be sung through us is the most beautiful requiem for an irreplaceable planet that's dying or maybe it's a song of joyous rebirth as we create a new culture that doesn't destroy its world but in any case there's no excuse for not singing this moment you're alive wherever you are you can dial up the magic and sing wherever you are how is the story going to end it seems that these times are almost orchestrated to bring forth from us the biggest moral strength the greatest courage and creativity I feel because when things are this unstable a person's determination and care and direction how much they choose to invest their energy and heart and mind can have a greater effect on the larger picture than they could imagine so this is an exciting time to be alive if not somewhat wearing emotionally so she puts herself in it in the last sense but this is the time we're in and some of us have privilege as I do and so I'm shielded in ways that the refugees were talking about or people who just live in target communities because of the continuing economic disparity and racism and so forth I live with a lot of privilege and I also feel the weight of the suffering of the world both of those are true and then what do you do well that's a Bodhisattva which is to say if you want to talk about one interesting concept in Buddhism there's probably two to talk about now is somebody, is a being who says I'm in it to alleviate suffering to bring joy and freedom well-being beings as I can to myself and those around me and that becomes a direction it becomes a it's a setting of the compass of your heart where you say yep we're going through tough times will I collapse you know will I run away in fear we have all those things or can I be the one that helps people into the lifeboats can I be the ones that help of course so we don't run into the next iceberg or whatever it is can I it's not your task to save the whole world but can I reach my hand out and mend a place that I can touch what is it whether it's you know changing the way you plant your garden or use the electricity and power and car and that's a little piece of it whether it's adopting a child or a community or helping in all kinds of ways or bringing meals to someone or working politically you have a gift we each have gifts and I don't think you sleep well if you're not giving your gift somehow when you think about that when you say thank you for all the worries now I want you to remember that I'm actually I'm doing something and now let's go to sleep you know that you feel like okay I can make this contribution I can make a difference and as Joe Adamasey says these small things then start to add up Jack cornfield thank you so much for this thank you thank you thank you thank you I will never be able to thank you enough for these conversations it's always a pleasure Duncan I'll be thinking

Check out the latest in-store, and we're never short on options at jcp.com. All dressed up everywhere to go. JCPenney. Greetings to you, oh beautiful friends. It is I, Duncan Trussell, and you are listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast. And this is a very special episode, because it focuses on a creature that I love, the crow. My interest in crows started when I saw a YouTube video showing a child who liked to feed crows. That's not very interesting, you say. We all like to feed crows. I just finished feeding some crows. Who doesn't feed crows? But here's what was fascinating about this particular clip. The crows had started bringing the child gifts. The only gift that I have ever received from an animal outside of the brown male that my dogs deliver to me on occasion, especially when it's raining, is it was an eyeball and a foot that my cat Bill, years and years ago, brought into the house and sort of laid out on display for me. And I was horrified. I yelled at the cat, and I feel guilty. Even talking about it right now, I feel guilty. Because the cat was just offering a nice gift, and I was going full Jehovah meets Cain to reference an Old Testament moment that we know and love, which is Cain and Abel. This is still the period of either God's evolution or man's evolution or, I don't know, mythology's evolution, where you just read some of this stuff and it seems like beyond alien, or it seems like a dream you would have within a dream, within a dream, within a dream. It just seems so odd. And you don't know how much of it seems odd because you've heard it so many times or how much of it is just particularly odd. But the story of Cain and Abel, of course, is one in which Cain offers one type of sacrifice to the Lord. And Abel offers another. And I think Cain offered God meat. And Abel offered him veggies or something. I don't remember which. I don't know if it's a commentary on vegetarianism. I don't know if it's a commentary on meat eating. I don't know if it's what it is. Exactly. It's just weird. But God liked one offering more than the other. And essentially did to Cain what I did to my cat, which is, you know, why would you? This sucks. Why'd you kill this little rabbit? Interestingly enough, there's a crow connection here, which is that, and if you've no spoiler alert, but it is at the very beginning of the Bible, Cain kills Abel, Book of Genesis. Cain gets jealous and smashes Abel over the head with a rock. And God comes, you know, I don't know, walking out of the forest, something weird. God, in the beginning of the Bible, is a very strange, strange God. And Cain tries to trick God or something. Because God's doing like, you know, the weird parent thing where, like, as a parent, you already know what your kid did, but you're asking them questions to see what they say. So God asks, where's Abel? I mean, like, obviously God knows. He's omnipotent, theoretically. And Cain says, well, how would I know am I my brother's keeper? And then, you know, he gets in trouble because he killed. He's one of the first murderers. Now, here's where it connects to crows. In the Quran, it was a crow that actually showed Cain how to bury a body. So in the Quran, I believe, there was some moment where the crow's like, hey, you better put some dirt on that brother of yours you just killed, or the Lord is going to be pissed. But it didn't work, you know, of course. And so Cain was sent east of Eden. And, you know, that's the beginning. That's the book of Genesis. But yeah, the only gift I ever got was from a cat, and it was a dead pieces of a dead rabbit. And I should have been honored. But instead, I yelled at the cat. I wonder if God looks back at, and I was like, man, I was being such a jerk back then. If only I had just accepted both their gifts. Or I was even questioning them. Why was I doing that weird game? Why was I doing, like, power dynamics with my creation? What's wrong with me back then? I was drinking, now yeah, I was drinking black hole juice back then. That's what it was. I was hammered. Regardless, I was fascinated when I realized that crows will bring people gifts, little shiny objects, keychains, bits of aluminum foil, bottle caps, and just various things. And the people they bring the gifts to are the people who give them gifts. And crows love unsalted, unshelled peanuts. So, I don't know, stuff like that's magical to me. Because to me, from a completely non-scientific perspective, it illuminates the reality that there are so many different societies and tribes and sort of networks of sentience happening on this planet, then we can imagine. Because if crows bring gifts, and you wanna look at it from my perspective, not the perspective of a scientist who we have with us here today, from my perspective, it means that they're clever in a real specific way. And I think the gifts they bring is a kind of commentary on what they think of us. Which is, I guess you could say somewhat reductive. Yeah, the monkey descendants like shiny stuff. They just do. No, you can't eat it. They just like shiny things that you can't eat. They're weird. I don't know, just bring them like, if you find something shiny, bring it to one of them. If they've been giving you peanuts. It's an interesting interaction. But what else talks like that? What else observes us? In a past episode of this podcast, I was interviewing a shaman who said that the trees think it's funny that the monkeys can see them and know them as being sentient and animated with a identity and a spirit. But the humans who think they're so advanced can't even see that. And so to me, the sort of fascinating blindness that human beings have when it comes to seeing things outside of the human experience, contemplating the possibility that there are so many forms of communication happening around them that aren't human at all. That who knows, maybe the wind talks. Maybe the way shadows fall on the ground is some communication. I know what you're thinking, that way lies madness. You can't think everything's talking to you. But you can actually. I'm not saying like you think Tucker Carlson is telling you to go down to KFC and dig through the garbage to find a banana peel that has an address written on it that will take you to a specific home where you'll find a USB drive that has upon it a map, which will show you how to get to one of the hidden bases in Antarctica. I'm not saying that. That's loony tune stuff. I'm talking about the idea of, for lack of a better way to describe it, the universe as mirror. And that's just a game you can play with the universe. Is the universe really a mirror? Is everything you see a reflection of yourself? You could imagine that momentarily. Doesn't have to be that way. And you wouldn't want it to be that way because what a strangely sad, lonely, desperate and narcissistic situation you might be in if that were the case. But temporarily you could imagine that. You could imagine that you had been in the presence of some powerful guru figure. And the guru was so magical and powerful that as one of her many teachings she decided to split herself up into an infinite number of components, a planet and various ecosystems matter itself, atoms, quantum particles, and everything surrounding you. And you were sort of mid conversation with a very advanced being that was trying to show you something. And one of the ways that it had decided to talk to you was through crows and through crows bringing you little gifts. If you're someone who's ever received a gift from a crow, wow, I mean, that just seems life changing. That seems like, how could you ever forget about that? The time you went outside and for sure a crow had brought you just a little pendant. It's pretty cool. Regardless, I've loved crows ever since I saw that on YouTube and at one point I was lucky enough to have a flock of crows that was hanging out around my house. And so I started feeding them unsalted peanuts. And I would watch them. At first they, I had to be inside and I would have to like peer out a window. Cause if I was outside, they didn't, they wouldn't come. They didn't trust me at that point. But then gradually they warmed up to me a little bit. They never brought me any gifts, unfortunately. From time to time I'd find like a little note up on their, on the roof, like this, you suck man. But I don't think that was from the crows. But one thing I did notice is they lined up. It was the craziest thing when they, when they were like, it's not like other birds, like when you're at a resort. And yeah, I go to resort sometimes. You know, resort birds, they just kind of like fall on bread. You know, like they just like thousands of them, like a swarm of little tiny little filthy birds will just descend on crumbs of bread and they fight each other. It's like watching a little feathered dinosaurs fight. Crows aren't like that. They line up, at least the ones in my neighborhood. They lined up and they would, one at a time, they would go and get a peanut and then fly away. Really interesting, really cool. I love crows. People are scared of them. Some people, they think they represent death cause they're, you know, their feathers are black but their feathers aren't just black. Like you have to really look at a crow and you'll see there's a lot of color in there and they're beautiful and they're smart. And some of them even use tools. Also crows, well, they don't just bring shiny gifts to kids. They have some scandalous traditions as well. Some almost unspeakable things that they like to do with deceased crows. We knew a lot about crows but this particular aspect of COVID life was only recently documented by today's brilliant guest. Dr. Kaylee Swift is here with us today. We're gonna jump right into this episode but first some quick business. This spectacularly cross-centric episode of the DTFH has been brought to you by the undulating beings of light who in this particular dimension call themselves Squarespace. Squarespace, it's where you go if you want to build the most beautiful website that ever existed. Why build a website, you might ask? I don't have an eatery in Brooklyn. I'm not selling baked Afghani, Mexicali, Irish breads. There's other reasons, my friend. Great reasons, maybe you just wanna honor someone that you love. Why not buy the domain name, honorsomeonethatyoulove.com? And yes, it's available, I just checked. And though my trembling, disgusting, sweaty, sugary finger wants to buy that domain name right now, I leave it to you. Honorsomeonethatyoulove.com, think of all the possibilities for that domain. Maybe every time someone sends you a name of someone they love, you donate $50,000 to a shepherd somewhere. Or maybe every time someone sends you the name of someone that they love, you throw a pie at the wall of your apartment and film it. Think of how much that won't mean to someone to know that you have desecrated the wall of your rental unit with pies, just to honor the name of someone that they love. All you gotta do is go to squarespace.com, squarespace. They've got everything you need to create a beautiful website. Everything's optimized for mobile right out of the box.

So that the stop sign seems to say stop drinking cross-milk, don't do that, it's illegal to go to jail for 30 years for that shit. We don't want anybody to go to jail, especially not our sweet listeners. There's also t-shirts and posters over there about sweet payments. Okay, I'm out of here. Here's Duncan. And now, without further ado, everyone strap in and prepare to have your mind blasted with the dawning realization that you're surrounded by hyper-intelligent flying creatures that could potentially bring you gifts. What is here today is a scientist whose research has appeared in National Geographic, PBS, The New York Times, The Atlantic, Science Friday, and many other great publications. She studies the way crows deal with death. Is there anything more hardcore than that? I don't think so. But if you ask me, the only way that crows would truly reveal themselves to someone is if they knew that that someone actually loved them. And again, that's coming from me, someone who is clearly not a bird scientist because a bird scientist would never use the word bird scientist. Regardless, if you have even the slightest curiosity when it comes to crows, or rooks, or ravens, or birds in general, head to corvidresearch.blog and check out the brilliant writing of today's esteemed guest. Now, everyone, please welcome to the Dugga Trussell Family Hour Podcast, today's guest, Dr. Kaley Swift. It's the Dugga Trussell Family Hour Podcast. Dr. Swift, welcome to the Dugga Trussell Family Hour Podcast. Thank you so much for appearing on the show. Thank you for having me. I'm super excited. Me too. This came from just strange good luck just because I've been doing this Chrome Elk stuff, which is a different podcast altogether, and someone pointed me in the direction of your Twitter account and we started talking and you were kind enough to agree to be on the show. And it's exciting for me because some time ago, I don't know if it was on YouTube or where it was, I saw a great documentary or a piece on the amazing experiment you did with how crows react to death. And I was blown away. I wonder if you could just describe that experiment for the listeners. Yeah, so the impetus for this study was basically that humans for centuries have known that crows respond, crows and many other corvids, in fact, seem to really pay attention to and respond strongly to their dead. And so the idea of that in and of itself isn't something that I or our team contributed to science. What we were interested in looking at is, okay, so they seem to do this thing around their dead and it's really interesting. Why? Why are they doing it? What's sort of the adaptive value of this behavior? And there's lots of ways that we could potentially explain it, right? Maybe they are, maybe it has some social significance. I'm sorry, would you talk a little bit about what they do around their dead? I watched some of your YouTube clips on it and it is wild. Yeah, so basically what happens is dead crows on the ground, first bird comes in and it's going to produce what we call a scold call, which is basically an alarm call, right? It alerts the other birds. If you've ever seen them get really upset because there's a cat running around or a hawk in the sky, you've heard this call. And that results in recruitment of other crows to the area and they all get together and they're like, oh my God, and flying all around and landing in trees. And they might be really loud. And then they'll get like really quiet maybe for a few minutes and get loud. And that kind of happens over the course of about 10 to 20 minutes. And then they'll basically disperse. And that is the most consistent way that the behavior manifests. Now, as some of my later studies showed, and we can talk about that in a minute, it can get a little different than that sometimes. But that was sort of the behavior. When we say crows have funerals, that's what we're talking about. We're talking about birds noticing when one of crows noticing when another crow dies and forming groups in response to that. And freaking out. And really freaking out. Like that's Daryl. Holy shit, Daryl died. Everybody, oh no, it's like intense. I mean, it's sad. It's just, it's exactly kind of what humans do when they see a dead body. You know, I mean, we don't do that. It's like we don't scream, but many humans do scream when we see it. I mean, we freak out. Yeah. So, and it is, and that's why I have, I don't, I don't have as many reservations about using the word funeral when I describe my work, because I think that is the most simple way to communicate that essentially that's happening if you have animals responding really strongly and forming a group in response to a dead individual. Like that's basically what a funeral is. Now, I don't want to communicate that. That means I'm assuming that it comes with all the sort of emotional baggage or ritualistic baggage that it does in a human context. I don't know that part yet for crows. Are you aware of the, sorry, are you aware of the verse in the Quran referring to crows teaching Cain how to do burials? I am. Sorry. Sorry. One second. One second. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. One second. One second. So much for that. Go ahead. Sorry. What were you saying? The, the really interesting thing is those kinds of fables are, are found actually in a lot of different religious texts. Wow. So yeah. So humans, like I said, humans have known that these birds pay really a lot for a long time. And that's really evidenced when you look at how we've incorporated crows and Ravens and other Corvids into our own parables and creation stories in, in terms of how humans respond to their dead. Do you have a, can you name a few different like cultural references to crows and they're dead or sorry, just one moment. Sorry. That keeps happening. I'm just going to repeat that question. Just one second. Sorry. Go ahead. Sorry about that. Offhand. Do you have any other reference? So there's a, there's a really, and I am not, I am not a religious historian. Right. So I always get worried cause I'm like, Oh, I might say that these two things are different. And then they're actually like, actually, those are the same texts. It's just, so, but the other one I know is the, I think it's called the Talmud, which is a Jewish religious document. There's a really similar story in terms of Ravens demonstrating how to bury their dead in that, in that one. But if, but then there's lots of other ways that these birds appear in religious texts, like in the Quran, there's a story about why crows are horse that has to do with them betraying Allah. So there's lots of it. And of course, many people are familiar with all the ways that crows appear in different indigenous peoples creation stories. And so it's really fascinating. Or, you know, you can look Japan, you can go to India because these birds exist on almost every continent aside from Antarctica. Yes. And because they've so closely and historically associated with humans for so long, they're really unique in their presence really in our cultures globally and across time. It's wild and they get such a bad rap. Crows are, can you hear me? I lost you. Oh shit, hang on. Okay, I can hear you now. I lost you for a second. Sorry for y'all listening. We're just getting some new technology work down here. Crows get such a bad rap. They do. And it's, it's a bummer. And a big part of that is, so in, in European Western cultures, crows have long been associated with death. And, but the really interesting thing to me is actually for a long time, that wasn't a bad thing the way it is now. It was actually so, so having a crow come and sit outside your house was like, yeah, okay, I guess you're going to die tomorrow. Like that's a bummer. But it was a really great thing. Because then it allowed you to get your affairs in order and make amends with God. But then we kind of like the plague hit and you had other instances in history where you have mass human casualty. That's when we kind of soured on it. Right. Because there were just lots of dead people everywhere and lots of Corvids taking advantage of this feast. Right. And we were like, well, we don't like that part. Because in those cultures, that's not a good thing. But in other cultures being eaten by birds is a good thing. Right. That's the Tibetan sky burial in European cultures. So, so that's actually a lot of where that negativity comes from. But again, you look at other parts of the world and you won't really see that negativity. So it's very culture specific. Great. Yeah, I know what you're saying. It's just battlefields and whenever there's, you know, some kind of just disaster, you're probably going to see a crow eating a person. It's going to be a tough thing to watch. Now, before we get to like the, one of the really interesting things you discovered about crows, I wanted to tell you a few things as I was researching this that I had no idea about. And one of them really bothers that shit out of me because I love crows, but I also love raccoons. And raccoons eat crows. I had no idea. Yeah. For sure. Any, I mean, crows, like a lot of birds, right? They're egg, eggs are delicious. Everything in nature loves eggs. Right. So even animals that don't otherwise eat meat will be like an egg. Great. So it is no surprise to me that an arboreal mammal like a raccoon, that's a generalist is going to be very keen come breeding season time on crow eggs and crow babies because they're just a delicious super high protein little snack. Wow. Just little buffets, little crow buffets for those swine to chow upon. This is basically studying all this has been really wonderful. And it, one of the things that I realized is that I've sort of been leaning into this idea that scientists like you basically know everything. Like, you know, kind of the, the idea of like, well, there are these satellites zooming around the planet and we've mapped the entire planet. And we know what pretty much what's on the surface of the planet. Similarly, I had this completely ridiculous idea that we figured this stuff out. And then as I was looking at the current research that you're doing, what are the birds you're studying right now? They're called Canada Jays, but some of your listeners may know them as Gray Jays, which was their former name. Canada Jays and that you're, you're studying how they, they're, they're eating patterns or where they lay eggs. I can't remember the specifics you were looking at. I just remember being kind of shocked that we didn't already know that. And then I started thinking, whoa, birds around us all the time. And do we barely understand them? Is that a fair statement? Or we still have very little understanding of what, what they're up to. No, I think that's absolutely fair. And I mean, you kind of have to look at it with, in relativity, right? Like we know a lot more about crows relative to most other birds, but we still, in the scheme of things, know very little about that. We just happen to know a lot more about them than a lot of other things. But yeah, like really basic, like the two big areas that really seem to surprise people in terms of being like, why you guys don't know how that works are communication. Crow communication is like the black box in science. I mean, it's just where, where tons of effort goes in and just nothing comes out. And so that's one big area. Cause that's a question I get emailed all the time is like, here's a video of the crow I feed and it's making this strange noise. Can you tell me what it's trying to say? And I'm like, no, I'm sorry, I can't. I really wish I could. I'd be much more successful probably if I could do that. But unfortunately. Why, why is it, why can't we figure it out? What is it that they're not making the same sound? Like what's the difference between say, I'm crow communication patterns and dolphin communication patterns that people where, where in dolphin research and my cursory examination of it, it seems like they think that dolphins have names for each other. There seems to be more of a decoding of their language. Is this not happened with the Corvids? Not really. We do know. So there's bits and pieces. So like the, the alarm call I was trying to describe in reference to the funeral, like we can identify an alarm call and we know what purpose it serves to alarm and alert other birds. Yeah. We know that they have things like assembly calls, which are a little different that are like, everybody get together. They have dispersal calls, which sort of conclude, but they have so many different sounds. So the, the main answer to your question is, and this, I mean, we don't know the answer, but our best guess is, I think one of the things that makes studying crow communication so much more difficult than a lot of other animals is I suspect that crow communication is highly context specific. So in a lot of animals, they have a call or sound that they use in only specific context. So it's easy to evoke that context and be like, Oh, and then there's the resulting sound that we expected. If we play that sound, the behavior that we expected, right? Versus with crows. So one of, one of the, um, calls that they make that most frequently are, is the source of questions directed to me is, uh, these kind of like low, like kind of wow calls. Like they'll be like, whoop, whoop, whoop. Right. Or some variety of something like that. There's these very low, quiet sounds and people will be like, Oh my gosh, I was feeding my, you know, my crow today. They come every day and it bowed its head and it made this sound. And what is it saying to me? The reason that it's been so difficult to parse things like that is because as an example, I've heard that sound when they're alone. I've heard that sound in the course of when they're having a funeral. I've heard it when they're with their mate. I've heard it when they're with a big group of crows, when they're agitated, when they're at rest, when they're being fed by a person, right? And so because of all of those different context that they make it in, it's extremely difficult to parse. Probably that means, like I said, is that they have all of these different sounds and they can make them in these different contexts where the crows are keying in on all of the components to then understand what it means in that context. The best sort of analogy I can give in human world is if we think about things like tonal languages, where you have one word, but depending on how it's said, it can mean very different things. So I have a feeling it's kind of like that, maybe. I mean, that seems like a good explanation for why the fuck we haven't been able to, like, figure out what they're saying ever. Well, this is, to me, one something that's really curious is that there seems to be, and maybe it's just publicity, or maybe people are just naturally more interested in dolphins than they are in crows, but I'm sure you're familiar with John Lilly and the dolphin research that was done. Not super. It's pretty curious. It's John Lilly and I think Carl Sagan, a few other, this is during, this is the birth of SETI, and they became really interested in studying dolphin communication, not just because they wondered, like all of us wonder what dolphins are saying to each other, but also because the idea was if we do make contact with some kind of extraterrestrial, then we need a model for understanding communication from a thing that is from a completely different environment. And, you know, so much of human communication is based on our, you know, the way we walk around in our terrain and how we experience the limitations that we have. And so anyway, I wonder why people haven't focused more on these creatures that are so obviously intelligent. And do you think that at some point there could be the possibility of maybe using AI, like what they're using with dolphin communication to start decoding what birds are saying, what crows are saying specifically? Yes and no. I say yes because in terms of, I think what you could get out of that effort, it would be well worth it and probably similar to what you're describing we've been able to do with dolphins. Yes. But I say no in that I don't have any optimism that anyone could get funding to pursue that project. Wow. Because it's just a little too like the dolphin thing, like, I think is a much easier sell for people in terms of understanding its value to humans, which is, you know, for better or worse, so much of how we rationalize or justify scientific pursuits. And I feel like making that argument with birds and getting the kind of grant funding that you would need to do that which is just unlikely. You would have to convince the military. The way in is this is what we do. By we I mean you or someone. So the idea what you would have to like convince the military that there might be a way to talk to crows. And then you've got the ultimate surveillance technology of all time, you know, and what a sad paranoid world we would enter into have suddenly every time you see a crow. You had to wonder if you're being monitored, you know, this is to know if I don't know if this will make you feel better or worse, but that's actually already kind of happened. So the original facial recognition study that my advisor, John Marsliff, who's a faculty member at the UW did and this was the facial recognition study that's on the PBS special murder of crows that a lot of people are familiar with. That's what I saw. And this took place about 10 years ago. So that study was actually funded by the DoD. Whoa, no way. That is so crazy. So they were like that that is to mind boggling the military just scans all variables in phenomena nature and just puts in one one side one column here's what we might be able to use. Right. Yeah, yeah. And so for that study it was, I mean, you know, who knows what they really were were thinking but it was pitched as a. Kind of search and rescue thing that if there was a large, you know, a good prospect of crows being able to find people based on face, you know, their faces that there could be some real value in terms of searching for missing people. Yeah, now search and rescue. Yeah. That's so crazy. Knowing the behavior of our military. You know, I'm feeling there's maybe some other. Yeah, some other things. You know, like helping soldiers find like lakes they could swim in, or probably, you know, just like finding like good, I don't know areas where there might be some food to eat definitely would never be used to track down people and drop bombs on them. The this is you I was reading your blog and it seems like you your interest in Corvid started with this with being interested in the way animals communicate or the connectivity or the community or the sort of I don't know how would you put it the interspecial. I don't know where did you ever have you ever just fantasized about some time in human history where we actually can establish a linguistic communication with other animals. Oh my gosh, yes, I mean, so much like, if I could just ask a crow questions. Yeah, I mean just imagine the possibility for deepening our understanding with the natural world and with wildlife if we could do this I mean it would just be. It would be amazing. I mean, it would kind of put me out of the job, but that'd be okay for everything we would get out of that but. But yes, it would, it would be just so wonderful because there's so many things that they do that like we've been talking about just remain entirely mysterious to us. What are some of those things. So like the communication thing that we talked about some of the other big ones are. So roosting. So if you live in a metropolitan area or a rural area, even one of the things that you may have seen before is come kind of evening time. You may see big flocks of crows flying over your house or you know during your commute. And the reason for that is that crows and some other birds engage in a behavior called communal roosting where even though sexually mature like mated crows have territories that they go to during the day and that they hang out on all year round and they defend those territories from other crows. At night, all your local crows basically go to the same central areas to sleep. And the reason for that is probably in large part driven by just insulation from predation right if you're sleeping, which is you and your mate and a predator comes. You know, you're a lot more vulnerable than if you're in a big group of, you know, 15,000 crows. So that's so right and that's kind of a nice story but there's lots of nuance there and details about how those functions happen that we don't know really anything about like for example, the family sleep together every night. Right. Do they sleep in the same part of the roost every night. Right. If they don't sleep together, who do they sleep near how are those decisions arrived at what do they talk about at the roost. And we know, depending on the species, we know a little bit more than I would say that we do for American crows like for example in common ravens. Research was done a couple decades ago that demonstrated that ravens that know about where food is like a big food bonanza like a moose carcass actually signal to other ravens at the roost that they know where food is and they recruit birds to come. And so before we jump to any conclusions, a lot of people are like, Oh my gosh, Ravens so nice. Right. Sharing. I love them. Yes. Really the reason though is that a pair of ravens that has a moose carcass on their territory is going to fiercely defend that carcass. So you need about seven birds. If you're if you're alone, like if you don't have a mate and you're just wandering around alone raven and you see this big moose carcass. If you're going to feed from that, you need about six other birds there. Six other ravens. Wow. Or the adult pair is just going to like beat you down. Got you. So it's like an army. It's a gang. Yeah. Yeah. So it's not this like altruistic food sharing. It's if I'm going to have access to this, I need help. Right. But still, my God, the implication there is while it's planning. Yeah. It's what's the name and there's a name for that. Right. There's a name I just learned. What is that called when it when a and it only happens in a few and as far as we know in a few animal species displacement. Is that what it's called? No. I think you're thinking maybe Prospection. Okay. So Prospection is when animals sort of reflect on past experiences to plan for future ones. Right. Yeah. I'm trying to think of what other jargony words. That's cool. Whatever. Who cares about the word? It's just, you know, this is this. Just knowing this expands my universe so much and it, you know, it's just like a classic, you know, stoner psychedelic person. When I look at crows, I get this, you know, and I went, I started feeding them by my house in the hopes that they would bring me gifts, which is another thing I'd like to talk with you about, but I just started watching them. And, you know, I don't know how much of it is just confirmation bias or wanting the world to be magical. But I said, you know, okay, if I go to the, like the times I've seen like chimpanzees, you look at them and there is like something that's just more aware than say my poodle. You know, there's the way they're looking at things and the way you, there's something in it that is, I don't know, it just, I don't see why humans wouldn't be able to gauge levels of consciousness or this, or cognizance and other beings, but similarly with crows, when I was watching them, they seemed aware that I was the one feeding them and they seemed to like get, like get used to the fact that I was not like they would differentiated me from other humans, you know, and, and also, but this is where probably you'll disagree if you shoot it down, doctor. I deserve to have this shut down, but I swear one of them like seemed to like, I don't want to say thank me, but like he started like looking at me and made like a weird like movement and a sound and then would fly off. I don't know. Maybe it was just saying like these peanuts suck. Get better. You're feeding us the worst peanuts in the neighborhood, but it did seem like there was some attempt to convey something to me. Do you hear reports of that? Or have you noticed that? Oh, yeah. I mean, I, I think, um, I think for people that closely watch and spend time with crows, it's nearly impossible to not read deeply into their behavior. And as a citizen of the natural world, I think generally speaking, that's mostly just an entirely wonderful thing. Right. Like, you know, if we did that with everything, this world would be a much better place. As a scientist, I, I'm a little bit like more grumpy about, not grumpy, but you know what I mean? Like I have to just be a little more restrained because it is our nature to project. Right. That's what people do. And you really need to look no further for evidence of that than our relationship with dogs. Um, and there's been some great, um, books and papers that have come out about how kind of badly humans have botched our understanding of dogs because of how much we project. Um, and so that's like a whole, that's like a whole different thing. So, so with my scientist hat on was the crow saying, thank you. Probably not. It was probably saying, I like these peanuts. Keep them coming. And you know, and I think, I think that's how a lot of that kind of stuff happens is an accident, the crows do something accidentally and you as a person are like, oh my gosh, this was amazing. Here's all the food. Like, do that again. And then the crows are like, oh, but think how often, how much do we do that with each other? I mean, we don't even need to go to dogs. How many times have you thought that someone was, you know, thinking something about you that they were thinking or, you know, you, you, you project your own neurosis and insecurity onto pretty, I'm not you specifically, but, uh, yeah. Do you, do you feel like your study, like your study of, of Corvids and your connection with the natural world is in some way helped you understand your connection with not that humans aren't part of the natural world, but with, with your fellow human beings. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, you know, and there's, I think there's lots of different ways that you can answer that question, but to me, the most interesting answer, which is maybe not exactly what you were going for, but one of the most interesting things I've learned from this study is how important crows are for such a wide variety of people. And that's been, I think the most important thing I've learned about humans from the, from my studies with crows is just being like, like a lot of people, and I say this very sincerely, really depend on their relationships with these birds or companionship. And, and a connection. And, and I love, I love that about crows. I think that makes them so special, but it also says a lot about, you know, I think us as humans and really our need to connect with other life forms. Um, and yeah, I just think that's such a wonderful thing. I just saw this, um, I was watching, you know, I love watching, you know, there's this technological conference that happens every year where all the new technological innovations that are about to hit the market show up. And, uh, one of them is this, you know, robot that is, it just hugs. It's this strange little, I know it's really cool to it, but they, so basically what they figured out about androids or humans connection, the human connection to robots is that if you make a robot too realistic, it becomes terrifying. And yeah, what is the, um, uncanny valley, the uncanny valley. That's right. So they're realizing why do we even have to make them look like us? Nobody, we humans form so many connections with like crows, dogs, cats, mice. I just saw somebody has some kind of like, uh, emotional support alligator or crocodile that they're bringing around. So we make all these connections with things out there. Uh, and, and this was just as these adorable beings are going to be sold and used in parts of the world where the populations are aging. And there are these epidemics of loneliness that are happening. Uh, and part of me likes it. And then part of me feels real saddened by it, so to speak, because there, there's seems something kind of empty in the idea that we're mostly, it's a one way street or that we're surrounded by living or screens upon, which we're just seeing our own projections. Uh, I would like to think that crows like us back. I don't, I don't disagree that they do. I think crows, they definitely like us back when we feed them. I mean, like they love, it's, it's, but, and I don't say that, um, what's the word I'm looking for? Like cynically, right? I mean, I, when people feed me, I like them back. It's very genuine. So I, I, you know, I don't think that's at all a bad thing, but, um, but yeah, I think for crows and their connections with people, that connection is very much driven by resource sharing. Yeah. I have peanuts. Tell, tell me about their gift giving though. This is another thing that popped up on my radar sometime ago. This is actually what got me really interested in the crows and crows is that they actually give gifts to some people. If you're lucky, a crow will, and you wrote a wonderful article on this on your, uh, blog, um, corvid research.blog, but could you talk a little bit about the phenomena of crows giving gifts? Yeah. So, um, as you described, basically people who routinely feed crows, and it's important that that is both a regular behavior and it's in a consistent location. So like, if you feed them on your walk to work, this probably isn't going to happen to you, um, but people who, who have like platforms in their backyards or things like that, uh, have reported to us from all over the world, um, this experience of they put food out and then they went to check the platform and make sure all the food it was eating. And there was some kind of object there and what that object is varies a lot. I mean, I've seen earrings, chicken bones, leaves, rocks, keys, uh, all kinds of stuff. So, so there is no dispute that that happens. The question is, if we were able to have our crow, you know, translator device, we said, what is, why are you actually doing this? There's still the question of, are they doing it as a gesture of like, thank you. You know, will you give me food? I'm going to give you something. Or if it's this idea of kind of what I was describing earlier, this kind of accident that gets reinforced, so they keep doing it. So, how would it be reinforced? So if a crow, um, you know, was playing with something and it's flying in the sky and it's got this key that it picked up because it was like, hmm, this is weird. I'm kind of curious. And it goes down to the platform and it's like, oh, okay, peanuts. Well, I'd rather have peanuts than this key. So it flies away and you go out and you're like, oh my God, this crow just gave me a present. Here's some cheese. Like thanks, man. And then it was like, oh, apparently if I leave stuff here, my, you know, quality or amount of food gets bumped up. And so that reinforces them doing the behavior. It's, it's like any conditional learning. Um, well, if they also, if there's this ability for them to communicate with each other about things that aren't in their direct vicinity and invite others to come, maybe they, you know, maybe, maybe they're as astounded. Maybe there's skeptical crows or like those lumbering pigs don't give us food. They, they don't even see us. Don't that's a bunch of hogwash or maybe there's floating around in crow communities like, listen, bring them a key chain and they gave me cheese. I don't know why that's what they do. They're weird. They love these weird metal things. I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's a mystery. And, and for me, uh, I love that mystery. I mean, that's why I love about these birds is there's just so many examples of that. And that's what keeps them just so active in my mind is I just, I'm constantly being surprised by them and it gives me so much fodder for just curiosity. And I love that. It does. Yeah. Me too. Just this conversation. I mean, I'm telling you, this is like everyone is so excited about the possibility of one day encountering aliens. Everyone's so excited about communicating with some other civilization from far away. Meanwhile, we're surrounded by other civilizations that are doing their own thing that seem to have their own, um, language or some version of a language. And we just ignore them. We don't accept people like you. Uh, and, and this is, you know, I just, I just brought a child into the world. And this is the kind of thing that I'm going to teach him that is going. I think I wish someone had told me when I was a kid, you know, cause we are taught uh, if we are even taught about animals, we're usually taught in a very kind of like basic way in biology or if we're taught about animals, it's maybe the opposite, which is, um, you know, I don't know, during a peyote ritual, somebody tells you that they can see inside your chakras or whatever. But like just to have a real scientist talking about the fact that these beings are gift giving planning, um, creatures, that's to me, that's magical. That's really exciting. I just, I know, weird way. I hope we never do figure out what they're saying. I think that might not be good for them if we suddenly discovered what their language was. It probably wouldn't because I'm sure we would just find ways to exploit it in ways that would not be to their benefit. But, but I actually, yeah, I haven't ever quite thought about it in that context, but I really love that idea that, um, we do, we do put a lot of effort into finding other kinds of life forms. And, and I don't say that to, to hate on, you know, all of my, um, you know, colleagues and friends that do that kind of work. I think, I think it takes all kinds, but it's culturally, it does seem like we have a lot of interest in that in ways that we don't seem to have in the organisms, just right around us that are still, as you say, so mysterious. And, and I agree, and it's funny, you know, for me, I totally agree with the idea that it does feel very magical, but for me, where that comes from is the, and this may not make any sense, but it's, it's how non magical it is. That makes it magical to me, right? Cause I'm like that, that just the things that they do, right? Like we can study all of the amazing behaviors that these birds exhibit and we can look at how their natural history and their various needs and yada, yada, their brain facilitates all of these amazing behaviors. And that's the very non magical part of it. And yet in the end you're left with this sense of deep awe that is wonderful. Yes. That deep awe, I got a lot of theories on what that may be. I think maybe that's what enlightenment must be. Is it not like suddenly seeing angels or gods or seeing through walls or whatever, but just suddenly realizing in a kind of consistent way that we're living in the most miraculous thing and that it's just been there all along right in front of us, right in front of us. And we haven't seen it. I think it's a, you know, um, as a sad state of affairs that this knowledge that you're putting out there is, uh, um, not known by a lot of people, you know, because that's the problem. We're all looking for aliens when they're, they're gift giving birds right in front of us. And also if we can't talk to the crows, if we don't even know what they're saying, when they make those odd noises at our doorsteps, right? How do we expect to have a conversation with some kind of octopoid star sailor from, you know, like a black hole? How do we think we're going to be able to talk to them? That seems weird. Um, I don't mean to keep going on and on about this, but has anyone in your field or have you considered the ethical implications of, uh, what would happen should some AI or some of something emerged that does allow us to have these conversations with these animals? Uh, you know, for example, what would happen if we realize, Oh, not only they, do they communicate, but, um, they have really strong opinions about stuff. And they're assholes, you know, what if we just find out they just don't like humans or they think we suck or they're, you know what I mean? People catch wind of the fact that crows just are snobs, crows. You know what I mean? They're just like, they make, they talk shit. Crows are like the most shit talking bird. You realize like all this time you've been feeding them peanuts, they've been up in the trees, like, wow, you've gained some weight. Yeah. Look at that stupid hat. Look at him. He thinks, he thinks we like him. Bring him a key chain. Look how excited he gets. He's an idiot. Do you know, but, you know, but do you ever consider that? Like I, sometimes I think the best thing that can happen for dolphins is for them to never ever translate their, for their language to not be translated. Cause humans are such exploitive beings that how long before crows, you know, we have them like answering phones in a phone bank for peanuts. How long, you know what I mean? How long before we start using them is like, it's some kind of work animal. Well, I mean, so that already, that also is happening, not, um, in more of a theoretical sense, but, but some of your listeners and maybe you might be familiar a year ago, I think it was, there was like a Dutch company startup that we're trying to get this idea off the ground of training crows to pick up litter in exchange for treats. Oh yeah. I heard about that. Yeah. Yeah. Right. And that's, that's exactly. So the, so the question there is, uh, and we could talk about how actually effective that would be separately if you want to, but in just, in terms of the ethics of it, yeah, I think it circles back to this idea of like, really? That's kind of what it's come to. Like we feel okay with training this wild animal to do this thing for us because we can't even train ourselves to do this. Like that feels good. Yeah. Cause I don't think it does. No. So, so to answer your question about how much I think about that, like for me, the answer is, I don't, I don't even have to go that far in the future to these, to those kinds of, um, uh, what's the word I'm looking for? Um, hypothetical scenarios where we have, we've translated their language because I already see now this tendency that we have to moralize and create a value system for animals based on how we feel about them. Like that's already happening. And it's already sucks. Yeah. And so that's why with crows, I, I worry a little bit because, because projecting is so easy to do with these birds. They're so charismatic. They're so human-like in a lot of ways. It's, it's very easy for us, um, to, to kind of put them on this value system. And to me, that's so dangerous for, for two reasons. One is because, yeah, if you decide that an animal is an asshole, a species, an asshole, then how are we going to treat them? Black cats, for example, black cats, look at what happened. You know, black cats get tortured by people for just purely superstitious reasons. Go ahead. Sorry. And then the second reason is the flip side of that though is most organisms are not human-like. Then we're not really going to be able to put them on that scale, which then means that we have this small group of mostly really charismatic megafauna. So things like orcas and chimps and maybe crows that we're like, we love them. They deserve a lot of our, you know, empathy and thoughts and protections. And then we have all these other animals that most people have never even heard of that aren't very charismatic. And we're like, well, kind of who cares if they go extinct? I mean, what are they doing? Same with people. Yeah. So that's the, that's the dichotomy that concerns me gravely, which is why my sort of, when folks ask me as a scientist, my perspective on the emotional lives of crows, based off what we know now, my answer has always been like, look, when we look at the behaviors of crows, when we look at their brains, there's nothing about a crow or maybe a better way to put this is there's nothing about a person we can point to and see and say, see that thing, that feature we have. That's what allows us to have these really emotional lives, right? We don't know what that is. So when we look at dolphins and we look at crows and we look at elephants, we can't say like, oh, see, they're missing that. So that must mean that they don't feel these emotions deeply just like we do. But on the flip side, because of this tenacity we have to then say, oh, these animals feel like us, they, then we must value them and treat them better. I also think it's important to recognize that we know in the natural world, there are tons of examples of animals that have taken ubiquitous features, like we'll use sight as an example and really gone to town with them, right? So you think about like a mantis shrimp, a mantis shrimp perceives the world in a way that for the average person is impossible to envision. They just, they see more colors than we do. I just can't imagine what it would be like to live in that world. So we know that it's possible for animals to take traits and exploit them in ways that are pretty unique to their species. So I think for me, the most comfortable way to look at the emotional lives of non-human animals is to recognize that there's no reason, there's no feature they're missing that would exclude them from that. And in fact, adaptively, it probably makes a lot of sense that crows and elephants, et cetera, feel deeply about their partner or about their offspring. Cause that would make them more successful. But on the other hand, different animals are not just people in human costumes. Maybe our emotional intelligent lives is our mantis shrimp vision. It's the thing that we, that we share on some level with all, with most other organisms, what we kind of ran away with. And for me, that balance helps me preserve this sense of why don't we just treat all animals with kindness and respect for their own intrinsic value. Regardless of whether or not they're super sad when their kiddo dies or not. That's wonderful. That's so wonderful. God, I'm going to have to stop eating meat now. Wow. That's so good. Are you a vegetarian? I am not a vegetarian, but we eat pretty limited meat and we, um, make an effort not to eat farmed meat. Yeah. See, this is the thing. You know, it's almost like the, the, the, what you're talking about is so great. Cause it just should be just a generalized compassion and for all living things. But also the many industries that would be completely disrupted by any kind of technology that allowed us to experience the emotions of animals, particularly animals that we eat, it would, it would really shake things up. And you know, even more than that, if someone, if there was the ability just to feel the emotions of people that we affect, I think it would be a radical shift in society. Listen, I could go on and on asking you questions about how emotional crows are, but I stopped you in the very beginning from getting to this wild thing that you began to observe. And, and now that we've made crows into these sweet beings, if you could please just talk a little bit about what you found out about what happens at, I think it was what, 5% or 4% of crow funerals. Yeah. So this is great too, because this is the, this folds in perfectly actually to the conversation we were just having. So yeah, so let's return back to the conversation we had in the beginning. So crows, when they see dead crow, they freak out. Other crows that they come to the area, they freak out for like 15 minutes, then they all leave. That's generally what we see. Yes. So my, my original experiment that you asked me about at the top of the show was looking at why that might be. So to test that, we would feed them for three days to get them used to coming down to a particular area. Um, oh, because, and I had started to go into this, there's, there is a lot of ways we could explain this. So maybe it's like, you know, a way that they figure out like, Oh, so-and-so died. I guess that means their mates available or like, Oh, I get to move up the hierarchy because they were more dominant. Yeah. So that's one reason. Maybe they're really sad. Maybe they're expressing grief. That's another reason. Uh, and then another reason could be that it's tied to danger learning and avoidance. It's a way that they're like, Oh, a crow died. I want to make sure I don't get dead. So I'm going to, you know, forget. So that was, uh, among all of our different hypotheses for how we could explain this behavior. And of course I should caveat that with these, these things are not mutually exclusive, but as a science experiment, right? You're going to pick something very narrow. And danger learning and avoidance was the most feasible, one of those questions to test. Yeah. So we looked at two things. We looked at if they were learning about whether the place is dangerous and about whether they could learn new predators based on their proximity to dead crows. Right. So we would feed crows for three days, get them used to come into a place. Then we would introduce our dangerous element. We tested a variety of things, but I'll, I'll leave most of them out for this conversation. Um, and so the main one was we had a mass person holding a dead crowd and they would stand there. Let me stop you there. Momentarily, these are not just no, you can't just skip over the masks. Can you talk about these masks? These masks are terrifying. So the, um, the original facial recognition study that we talked about that my PI John did, uh, used, uh, in the beginning, the, the pictures that most people see are of either the Dick Cheney mask or the caveman mask. Right. Um, but from a scientific standpoint, there was a little bit of criticism over those masks because they're so, um, they're such caricatures, right? They're very, uh, exaggerated. Right. So in response to that, also what if crows just are naturally political and they don't like Dick Cheney, you know, which naturally, of course they are. Um, so to, to, uh, address that criticism, what we had, what John did was he actually had costume makers come in and take molds of people's actual faces. And then they turned them into latex masks, which means that it really looks like you've like cut someone's face off. Yeah. Just like popped it on your pure Texas chainsaw massacre. You've got the stringy hair because it's, you know, kind of like, it's bad. And what are they holding? What are they holding in their hands? And then they're holding this dead crow. So literally the worst, like the thing that, that you don't want to see in your yard. Like if you're making like the top three things you wouldn't want to see standing in your yard, one of them would be a guy and or gal in a creepy mask holding a dead crow and that's what you did in my defense. We didn't do it in people's yards, but we did do it in front of people's houses. And yes, we did have to deal with police, not infrequently. So, okay. So that's the experiment. And, uh, so the persons that are holding the dead crow and then they leave and then we keep feeding the birds for three days. And then after a week, that person comes back. So that masked figure comes back and now they're not holding a dead crow. So the two questions we're looking for is, so we had those first three days where we're feeding them, we would gauge how long it took them to come down to the food and compare that to the three days after this scary event. And that was going to address this idea of whether or not they were learning that a place that had been associated at one time with a dead crow, if they're going to be wary in that place or avoid it altogether. And what we found is they do show a statistically significant weariness where before they were like, Cheetos and peanuts, I'm coming down to the food right away. And now they're like, yikes, I really want those Cheetos, but I'm going to like wait like 15 minutes before I like come down and get them. And when that person who they had previously seen holding the dead crow came back without it, they flipped out. They were like, you, you were here last week and they would do, do their whole scolding thing. Wow. So that was the very first experiment. I'm sorry. Also, also didn't they tell like crows that had not directly encountered the mask where we're also wary? Is that, did I miss that was, we didn't look at that specifically in my study, but that was a big part of the original facial recognition study. Yeah. And that is, yes. So that, that social learning, watching crows freak out about people and being like, I don't know what they did, but I guess they're nasty. I'm going to freak out whenever I see them now too. Definitely happens. And it happens both horizontally, meaning that within the same generation of birds and vertically, where we see offspring of adults that had this experience, experience also learning that. And I, and I want to be clear cause this is a really common misconception as people take that and they're like, oh, the parents like told their kids about it and don't, it doesn't seem like that's what's happening. It's just this, um, when the adults are, when that person is there and the adults are freaking out, they're younger coming in and other birds, their age are coming in and they're modeling, they're seeing this behavior mild. And that's how we think that the, could it be epigenetic? Do you, could it, could there be some, you know, I, I don't, I just, I, you know, that study they did with it, I guess cherry blossoms and mice. Do you know about that? Oh, anyway, so probably, yeah, it makes more sense that they just, you see your parents freaking out and you're going to freak out for sure. That's just the best explanation we have. So anyway, so yeah, that was part of the first study. And so with, with my study, looking at the funerals, the conclusions were danger learning and avoidance, at least in part, definitely drives this interest that they have in dead crows, because they learn that places are bad. And they learn that things associated with dead crows, that they're probably dangerous and we should alarm call. But okay, so that was the first study. And we were like, all right, so that's why I say, like, generally speaking, what we saw was that, you know, behavior described dead crow, one comes in, freaks out, others join. So moving forward out of that experiment, if you ask me what crows do around they're dead, that's the only answer I would have for you. But from there, we were like, well, there's lots of other interesting questions we could ask. Like, for example, if this really is driven by danger learning, we would expect that crows will respond more strongly to dead adult crows than they do to dead juvenile crows, because baby crows get killed by a lot of things that adult crows know how to avoid. So finding one of them dead is, you know, in terms of a signal of danger, it's not a very strong signal. But a adult crow, their survivorship is about 80%. They're tough to kill. So if you find one of those dead, something really bad in the area. And they live to be 20. They live for two decades, potentially. In the, potentially, generally in the wild, though, it's between 14 and 17 years. Still a long time. Still a very long time, yeah. So for that experiment, we were just, we didn't have masked people or any of the other elements, the dangerous elements that were part of that original study, we just were putting dead adult crows or dead juvenile crows on a sidewalk in a pairs territory and trying to see, like, which one evokes a bigger response. Dr. Swift, just so we can get this out of the way, because people hear that and are like, well, have you been killing crows? Will you tell everyone where you were getting the bodies? Just so you understand. So the University of Washington has a natural history museum and they, and we have licenses. So I should say we have licenses from Fish and Wildlife for all of the bodies that we get, but anyways, so does the natural history museum. And they get lots of donations by people who find dead crows, maybe because they flew into a window where they were struck by a car. And there's only so much that that museum can do with all of those crows. So they have some of them reserved for research projects. So basically, all of our crows were birds that were killed accidentally or naturally, and were then donated by the general public. Cool. So yeah, so that's how that experiment ran. And so we would just put crows out on the sidewalk and watch what they do. And of course, when I started that experiment, I was like, all right, they're just going to like call in the trees and do their things. But that's not what I found. So in the beginning part of the breeding season, which is basically May, or excuse me, mid-March through May, about 5% of the time, and we had done a little less than 300 experiments. And about 5% of those, what we found is that in addition to those other behaviors, the crows will sometimes come down and get a little sexy around the dead crows. And that means that maybe they like do their little sexy posturing or they just straight up have sex with the dead crow. And that could be coupled, that could just happen in isolation. It could be coupled with them being like, and now I'm going to rip you to shreds. Other crows may come and the aggression actually is a more common thing than the sexual behavior where they see a dead crow and they're like, I'm going to rip your frickin' head off, and then they do. And so, so I just, just to make it crystal clear, you started seeing that sometimes crows fuck dead crows. Correct. And you, and probably the first time you saw it, did you think this is just, you know, this is just a crazy crow. It's an anomalous freak crow. Yeah, no, it's, that, that was absolutely what I thought. And it, it was funny. Actually, the very first time we saw it was when we were filming something for like Good Morning America, I think, and we had, we had Gabby Mann, who was the little girl that got, that is the one that made big headlines in the BBC because she gets tons, she got tons of gifts from the crows. Yes. So it was like, just the work, we're just, we're just, it wasn't live, it wasn't live. And they did not use the footage, but yeah, if it wasn't live, I'm surprised a crow didn't try to have sex with it. Sorry, dumb joke. So you have a, you have this wonderful kid who's got this beautiful assortment of crow gifts. You've got Good Morning America up until that point, in your mind, as a scientist, you have a connection to crows, but then you've, you've, you know, recognized at least they make lonely people a little less lonely. So suddenly you're having to deal with like so many things happening at once. Did you, what was crossing your mind when you were witnessing this? Well, I was just, I don't know, shock. I mean, I had never heard of this behavior in crows, for sure. And at that time, I didn't actually realize how prevalent it was in other intelligent social species as well. So I was just like, what is happening? Right. Just totally taken aback. And yeah, like you said, I mean, I guess we were just like, is this a mistake? Is it confused? Is it a mistake of some kind? So that ended up spinning off into its own separate experiment, which is published and people can read about. Where we looked, we did that like, okay, we're gonna put out our like dead crows, right, where they're on their bellies and their wings are out. They look very dead and we're gonna put out live crow mounts. So these taxidermied crows that don't move, but they look living and they have glass eyes and kind of see like, are they just screwing it up? Or what is happening? And we found that there really wasn't any difference in terms of their sexual behavior between the two, but they, they're sculled just like they do in our, you know, at other times of year around dead crows in a way that they didn't towards these lifelike crows. So they do, they get that it's dead. I mean, they are responding with a certain degree of alarm consistently, even if then they go and they try and have sex with or, you know, annihilate these bodies. Dear God, and that's just, that's where we suddenly, that's where you just can't apply your human understanding of things to these creatures. Because from our perspective, that is not, that's just not what you do when you see a dead body. You just don't start having sex with them. For most people. Yeah. For most people, good point. Good point. But, but this, did you, is it possible that as you were saying these crows, their language seems to be very, like based on their situation? And is there some possibility that the crow, they, the crows are somehow aware that there's an experiment happening, that they're being observed, that could this have some correlation to it, the crow's sense of being observed? And they just want to like freak out the thing, observing it? Is there any, is there been any research into that? Like, is this, if you, if anyone figured out a way to like do this with, I don't know, cameras and no people to see if there's some connection to humans being around? No one has looked at that. And, you know, I think we can't rule out that possibility. I think it's extremely unlikely. But, yeah, I guess I can't, I can't tell you for sure. If, yeah, maybe they're just being extra, like meta about it and. It's an aggro move. It's like, oh, really? You're going to bring a dead body around? You're going to bring a dead body instead of peanuts? Let me show you what we do with that. Let me show you what happens. I'm going to permanently burn into your mind something that should only be reserved for souls in the lowest pits of hell to see. Cause when you see these YouTube videos, this is insane. They're not, they're like going at it. And then they're also another, the one I saw that you have on your channel, right? This is on your, you have videos of this. What's your YouTube channel, by the way? It's just my name, Kaylee Swift. There's the crow starts humping, humping a crow that's humping the dead body. Yeah. Oh, they have like three ways with their mates, but I should say in more seriously, the best evidence that we have that that's not what's going on, just based based on not testing it explicitly is that this behavior is so seasonally limited. Right. If this was a thing happening consistently all year, then maybe they're screwing with us, but it seems extremely unlikely that they're like, I want to screw with you, but only for this really specific time of the year, the rest of the time I'm too busy. Gotcha. Gotcha. And the coincidence with it being with the breeding season where they are really hopped up on hormones and we're seeing lots of other behavioral changes. The most simple explanation is that it probably has something to do with the, that those onset of all of those reproductive hormones that they're experiencing that's maybe kind of overpowering for, for a minority of individuals, it's sort of overpowering their prefrontal cortex, their decision making part of their brain. The reptilian brain is taking over and they're like, this is the fucking time of year and I'm going to fuck. Yeah, they're horny. They're just horny crows and they're, and they're aggressive, right? Because they do, they do, they'll kill each other over their territories. And so you have, so this dead crow is basically this really complex stimulus where it's something bad has happened. So that's like alarming, but then like, I'm trying to screw anything that I can because even though crows are, they, they form permanent pair of bonds. They're what we call socially monogamous. So they're together year round. They reinforce those bonds really consistently. But when we look at the genetics of their offspring, it's clear. There's a lot of other, they're mating with other birds. They cheat. So we know they cheat. So they're like, they see a crow and they're like, you're dead. I'm alarmed, but I'm also trying to reproduce with, you know, other crows if I can, but also you shouldn't be on my territory because you might be trying to, if it's a male crow having this conversation in its head, you might be trying to mate with my partner and I want to get you out of here. And you have all of these things happening at once. And clearly most crows can process all of that effectively and ultimately just respond with like, uh-oh, dead crow. But some crows are like, oh, this is information overload. And they just kind of like explode with all of these different behaviors. Unbelievable. The life, the day in the life of a crow, you, you, you know, in the morning, you go and you bring a key chain to your little girl who's been giving you peanuts. A few hours later, you're humping a dead crow. And then that night you're hanging out with your friends after an interesting day. But, you know, a necrophilia aside, I still love crows, but I must admit my heart dropped. You should love them because of the necrophilia. It's so weird and just so your listeners know we've seen those behaviors really commonly in dolphins. We've seen them in chimpanzees rarely, but it has been seen in elephants. So this isn't like totally weird random thing that crows do. This seems to be a feature of how a lot of animals that form and humans that form really strong social bonds that we know cognitively are very advanced. This, they do that. So, so this isn't just like crows being weird in morbid. This is not all that uncommon. Dr. Swift, thank you so much for your time today. This is such a mind blowing conversation and your research is so wonderful. And also, you're a great writer. I really love your blog, your ability to communicate some of these ideas in a not such a scientific way, but still a nice balanced articulation of the animal kingdom is really wonderful. Could you please tell the listeners of the listeners? Can you tell folks where to find you? Yeah, and thank you so much for those really nice things you just said. I appreciate them a lot. So my identity online is basically Corvid Research. And you can find me on almost every platform at that handle. So my blog is Corvid research blog. You can find me at Twitter on Instagram. YouTube, like we talked about, is Kaley Swift, but then Facebook. It's also Corvid Research. And I'll plug if viewers. Enjoy this, then please like follow me. And I just like talk about crows all the time, among some other things. But if your goal, if you're like, I don't know, but I just kind of want to like maybe just learn a little bit every Wednesday, I play a game called hashtag crow or no. And I play it on all three of those platforms, Instagram, Twitter and Facebook, where I post a picture of something and you have to decide if it's a crow or not. And at the end of the game, I tell you. And so we can actually play this game right now. I'd love to. So the bird that you have on your green screen. Oh, no. Is that a crow or no? It's not. It's not. What is it? The poster. What is it? It's a rook, which rooks are in the same genus as crows and ravens. And they're in the same family to Corviday. But the way that you can tell that it's a rook is see how at the base of its bill, it's like really chalky. Yes, I just noticed that versus the two crows in the foreground. They have all those feathers on top of their bills. Yes. So so rooks are more than other crows or ravens are very insectivorious. So they spend a lot of time probing the ground. So when they're young, I think I can't remember. I think it's like 14 months for the first like a little over a year. They have feathers on their bills, just like crows and ravens do. But once they go through their first adult malt, they lose them. And we think it's because they spend so much time probing for invertebrates that that keeps those feathers from getting all messed up. So very interesting. Wow, well, I got tricked by a rook also. And maybe for another podcast, if you'll ever come on again, we could talk about the Caledonian tool using crows. Oh my gosh, there's so much that we could have covered. I know it goes on forever. They're so amazing. They're amazing. We got the broad strokes here that we know about the kind of about their language, the emotional life of crows. And that sometimes they just, you know, they hump dead, dead, dead crows. And maybe next time we can jump into tool, the tool use of crows, because I'm really interested in that. And good luck with your current research. I can't wait to hear what you find out.

Welcome to you. Ah, ah, ah. All right, Ragu, you're on right now with my deepest core sweeties. This is on a video stream that we've been doing every week. Oh, yeah. And for the last hour or so, I've been rambling not just about aliens, but about the, I guess you could say the way that our desire to see aliens is a sort of longing for the miraculous and who knows, maybe they are real. But I wonder if you could maybe we could talk a little bit about that or if anything else you want to talk about. Hi, everybody. Out there. Nice to feel you through dunkin. The aliens, I don't care about aliens. There are aliens everywhere. We could not be, you know, the only people, you know, that have the ability to think, act, and, you know, move from one plane of consciousness to the other. It's impossible. We cannot be that. It cannot be that, right? So we are assuming, you know, all that shit, Roswell, all of that stuff. It's all real. Actually, I had a, an engineer because I worked in the music business for a number of years, a famous engineer. He did all the steely dance stuff, Roger Nichols. He's no longer with us. But anyhow, his uncle was very embedded in, you know, national security, et cetera, et cetera. And he used to go over to his uncle's house and his uncle had all sorts of stuff that proved out all the Roswell stuff. For instance, he had pictures of, you know, that nobody's ever seen. And the day that his uncle died, he told me, a bunch of feds came in and they took everything out of, out of his uncle's house. Are you kidding? How have you never, how long have we had friends? And you just now, you're telling me this, this is crazy to me. Yeah. They also had video footage of the Kennedy assassination, apparently. Of, there's footage missing that we've never seen that shows, you know, I think he said, you know, this is really going crazy, conspiracy stuff. But that one of the secret security, the security people shot him. Okay. And it was all, you know, so he told me all this stuff. You know, he actually went, they actually went to see it when I was in a session. He said, I got to go over here because my friend is over there doing another session. He's got all this footage, can you imagine? So all this shit that they've suppressed everything, absolutely everything. Why, now this to me is something, I always scratch my chin at. Why, why would there be, why wouldn't they just let us know? It seems like, don't you think that if suddenly the government revealed there's UFOs, there's aliens? We don't, we communicate with them sometimes, but we don't really know what they want. That people would freak out a little bit, but then everything would just go back to normal within a week or two. You know, like humans are so, you know, stuck in our habitual patterns that it really doesn't matter. Like this, the sun could change into the face of an alien and it would freak everybody out for about a year. And then we would just be living underneath the face of an alien staring at his body with change. Absolutely, absolutely true. But the why is like saying, why are there trees? I mean, just look at what we have going on right now. That's a big, how can we have this going on in this pandemic with this, you know, buffoon? I mean, there's no word to use just, I mean, it's just stupid, you know, the Clorox, everything that, you know, now it's chloroquine, you know, the stuff you use for malaria, which we've taken a lot in India. You know, I know all about that drug. That drug makes you sick without getting, without the side effects they're talking about, which is potentially having a heart attack. You know, it's a really nasty drug. Anyhow, why, why, why? It's, you know, that's, it's like when we go to India, you see all of this kind of stuff. There's no sense in it whatsoever. And you go, why? And I always tell people who are coming over the first time, there's one thing you can't do. Ask why, because you'll never get the answer, you know, it's forget about it. And this is the same thing, you know, there's no, it's, it's people, you know, the patriarchal power that be that is just, it's control. There's just, they, it wants to control. It has that propensity to control. But you're, you're, you were talking about longing for what? What did you, you just said? Well, well, you know, I played a clip of Terence McKinnon talking about UFOs as being a kind of projection of the human psyche or the collective that you're looking at these archetypes that appear, that it's almost as though, one of the beautiful things he says is, you know, look at the D, look at human DNA itself, look at humanity as a kind of language, a communication that the, what we are, you know, is the alien. It's just, we happen to be it. So it doesn't seem that, that miraculous. And, you know, one of the things from DOS said that I think about a lot is this idea that when you get, I guess you could say tuned up or tuned in or whatever. Suddenly everything does seem like a miracle. Do you, meaning that, you know, yeah, you, there, there, within that is this potential of your life could become so miraculous that UFOs would seem like secondary considerations. There would be vehicles or whatever. That would be somewhat interesting. But if you were really connected to what is happening right now, that stuff really wouldn't seem as exciting as what's right under our nose. So to speak. Yeah, yeah, I, that's totally right on. Absolutely. I have a little something because you prompted me earlier about the little belonging thing is, is so in core to everything that we came back from India. I, it's a bit spiritual. You think we should get into it? Yeah, I'd love it. Thank you. Thanks for doing this. Raghu, last minute to you. Thank you very much. Love your camouflage, by the way. My cat. Oh, sure. Okay. So, you know, we, this is around, I actually did a podcast this past week and I just happened. It was with somebody who's new coming onto the network. Wonderful young woman named Nikki Walton and I, I knew she liked rooming. Who doesn't like rooming, right? Right. But I had, I had this book that I hadn't looked at in a long time by Andrew Harvey, who's translated a lot of roomy stuff and so on. And then I just started going through it and I was, oh, God, there's stuff in here that's so relevant to today. It's like mind blowing. So this one particular, let me just read a little bit from it. And then, you know, we can talk about it for if you want. So he's saying that they say, huh? Go ahead. No, it's stuttered for a second, but I can hear you. Okay. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So he's saying basically, never, ever recover or even want to from the wound of the divine longing. So you will come too long with your whole being to participate now in the vast transformation that destiny is demanding of the human race. Right. Wow. Okay. Well, that sounds like right on to right this moment. And then he says, roomy's a madman and he's trying to do nothing less than send the human race mad with divine love. And here's a little poem, a roomy goes, my poetry is like Egyptian bread night passes and you cannot eat it. Eat it while it's fresh before the dust settles its places in the tropics of awareness. It dies in this world because of the cold. Is that so great? I mean, really great. So he ends up so Andrew Hardy ends up, you know, talking about what it's like, what's roomy's poetry is like. And it, it's absolutely awake. Awakening has a very fierce edge, the edge of the sword of discrimination. And the sword of the ecstasy, it has a fire in it. You have to consent when you listen to a read roomy to be sliced by that sword and invaded by that fire. I mean, these people are like, they got it all going, you know. So he compared, he compares this to, I don't know if you know, and many people out there may not know who she is. You know, this, because this book was written a long time ago. Yeah. Maria Callis. Do you know who Maria Callis is? I've heard of her. Famous, you know, famous opera singer with an angelic voice. I mean, a transporting type voice. So he says what, what Maria Callis is doing when she sings is pleading for love against patriarchal madness. That voice is always there burning away, begging love to win in the world, which has been ruined by a crazy, masculine hardness and deadness apart. I mean, he's describing, you know, the thing right now. It's just, you know, it's mind blowing. Yeah. And then, so this all leads into, so longing leads into the idea that he uses a word for, which is a tough word. It may be a word that everybody's going to go, oh, shit, these people are fundamentalists, maniacs. And that, I'm sorry about that. And that works adoration. And it, but that means letting the hand of the divine reach out to us with a cup of mystic wine and say, drink, be drunk. So you won't mind that you are bleeding. You won't mind that you are sobbing. You won't mind that you are dying. It's letting the wine make you drunk with the lucid bliss of mystic knowledge. And with that lucid bliss, you will work tirelessly. You will suffer tirelessly. You will open again and again to the power that is trying to save the world through you, through all of us at this very late moment. I mean, they could have written this yesterday about, you know, what the hell we're going through, right? I mean, it's, it goes on. It doesn't matter if you, it does not matter if you've used, you know, the experiences of your experience to enter into. The, you know, the glory, okay, to be a transmitter as far as you can be of the divine love at this moment. It's much too late to care whether we are going to suffer or not, whether it's going to be painful or not. It's clearly going to be appallingly painful to watch the world fall apart. It is clearly going to involve suffering on all of our parts in all of our hearts. What does it matter? Be drunk with this longing. Open your hearts endlessly to the love of God and never close them. Allow the light to burn you and transform you so that you can stand with Rumi and the friends of Rumi, the mystics of the earth and play your part in the transformation of the world. That is our responsibility historically at this moment. Wow. That's so cool. It's so crazy. It's so crazy. Yeah, it's completely crazy. It's completely. That to me is the beauty of the thing is because it is an invitation and to go nuts. And I think that this is the one of the top ways that whatever that thing you're talking about, what, what, uh, McKenna called dominator culture versus a partnership society. And it was a, it's a patriarchal. But what he said, you know, what he didn't say this, but to me, one of the qualities of domination, one of the qualities of people who are trying to dominate you is they want you to think you're going crazy when you're not. They want to produce a kind of boundary that should you cross it, you have entered into a woo woo land. You're losing your mind. You've lost it. You're out of your fucking gore. What do you really think you're connecting with the divine? Shut the fuck up. What are you? What are you really? You're one took over the line, baby. And this to me is like the people you got to watch out for. But weirdly, we also need friends in our lives who can tell us you're actually one took over the line. A tremendous thank you to better help for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH. I love technology and I love therapy and I love it when the two merge. That's what better help is.

But but the idea of going into the to the mystic reality, you know, that place. I mean, it's just so many. And by the way, you know, these people, you know, they come, they emanate from the Muslim tradition. Right. Yeah. Pop is all. I mean, there's a whole pile of them. I mean, we have this great guy on the here now network, by the way, Omid Safi. He's like a Islamic teacher. It is, you know, one of the big schools in North Carolina. I mean, he's just incredible. He knows he introduces all of this stuff. It's got such passion. You know, this is and this is the mystic part of of the of the religion. You know, it's the part it's it takes it. I mean, it still uses the Quran as a basis. But the interpretation of it is so wildly beyond anything that we hear about on a day-to-day basis. And of course, we are in such fear of this in the West, right? I mean, it's just so. So it's only through someone like Rumi and Puffy is that we can actually get the essence and the power of the passion of being able to deal with the world because you're so embedded in that longing. You're so embedded in and moving into the awareness of the mystic part of ourselves. You know, Raghu, I wanted to I was wondering if maybe you could talk a little bit. This is one of the qualities of you and Krishnadas and anyone who I know who actually got to meet Neem Koli Baba is there is a quality of heartbreak there. A quality of not like, you know, I don't know, not like schmaltzy sadness, but like real sadness that I don't know if sadness is the right word for heartbreak that you don't get to be around the embodied version of Neem Koli Baba. I wonder if you could talk about that a little bit. That's not true. I don't have any. No, there's no sadness and there's no heartbreak or anything around that. When it happened all those years ago when he when he left. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And you know how fast I shoved that person because we all have different reactivity to it. You know how fast I shoved that so far down inside that I couldn't find it for like 10, 15 years like within five minutes. I mean, Ram Dass called me. I mean, I can still hear his voice going. Raghu Maharajee left his body, you know, six hours ago, literally sick. So shock. I went into shock and everything you're saying sadness, heartbreak, all of that. Then I took that and I put it into a ball and I threw that thing so far deep in me and went into spiritual bypass for like 10 years. Okay. I mean, I think many of us did that, right? But it took, you know, it took a lot of work to understand if that's what it was all about, like a physical something that generated this thing and then that physical thing was gone. Then, you know, you are lost for what I mean. Fortunately, we had mentors who carried on from that time and really helped us understand. I mean, you got to remember I was 23 years old when I went to India. Okay. So that's crazy. Yeah. So it's, you know, you were, I was a little shmigeggy and also completely naive and completely had all of the stuff that you love to play with over the years that the treats we've done in Maui in terms of cynicism and, you know, what do you mean about, you know, we had all of that stuff going on. So, yeah, no, I just, it took, it took a while, but to understand this has nothing to do with the physical something that we were there, you know, sucking at the breast kind of a thing, you know, it appeared like that while we were there, but we were living in, you know, in a like an acid. So that kind of, that, okay, I got you. That's cool. You know, yeah, to me though, I have seen moments, poignant moments when you all are relating some encounter with that being that, you know, I guess sadness is the wrong word for it. Maybe it's just longing. It's whatever it is is sweet. I don't mean to portray it in a negative light. It isn't negative at all. It's one of those beautiful things to witness and to see not just wronged us, but people who maybe folks on your listening right now are watching right now aren't even familiar with just people you meet at the retreat too. We're lucky enough to meet him curly Baba when they talk about him. Sometimes they just freely start crying. Maybe they don't even realize they're crying, but they just start crying. And it's a really beautiful thing. And to me, it's always been a testament to whatever that encounter must have been like. Yeah, but it is. So again, you go into that space and it's a space of the best example. I mean, one one time we did with Ramdas. A retreat actually not a retreat was a workshop in his house, right? And was with Roshi John Halifax, who you know, you had that incredible encounter with when you first went to his house. Yes. And a couple of other people can't remember. And at one point, somebody, I think with Ramesh, who was doing the moderating Ramdas is co-writer of the last couple of books. And he said, you know, just what so what was it like, you know, being around me for early Baba. And so Ramdas went into the space exactly how you're described because he went into the space and you got really deep. You know, you could tell he was just like swimming in this kind of liquid love thing. You know, this is all talk about woo. You know, this is all that. It's just words except when Ramdas, he came out of it at one point. You know, he was just in a reverie and he came out of it and he said, he was just empty. He was so empty. He was empty. He said it over and over. No, I just did a podcast, by the way. It's up on Minority Now, which is Roji and talked about that particular moment, you know, and, and I said, you know, one time, I think it was with you, actually, we did something with her way, way back years ago. And I said, well, what is Ninkaroli Baba mean to you? You're like a Zen habit. You know, this is like you have nothing to do with bhakti yoga or subject object, anything. And she said, I look in it. I when I look at his picture and I look in his eyes, empty. I see empty, emptiness. And so the reality of what emptiness, which is which Robert Thurman would love, right? Calls the the womb of bliss emptiness, the womb of bliss. It's opposite of what people think, right? You know, and it's available all the time. And the fact that some of us did get over to experience that in a human being just gave it. I mean, why? I have no idea. I mean, I think it's we were denser is one reason we were very dense and needed, you know, the hit over the head with the sledgehammer. You know, okay, you are not this thing that you think you are. And we were able to experience that get very experiential with that. And then, of course, Ram Dass is the greatest proponent of proponent of bringing that back and able to transmit that, but nothing to do with the body. And the reality is that access is there as Rumi just said, right? In those readings that I just did, it is available to everyone. It just there's a point in your life where things are just so shit that you don't want to go on the way that you have been going on. Thinking that your mind is real and every thought is real and your story is real and all of your parents and your family and the school and the work. It's all real that you start to look out for something else. And that is what Rumi's talking about long and that's what I mean when you mentioned it to me. That longing is the first thing. It's your phone call to me, you know, to go to Maui and go to the retreat and me telling you to go, you know, it's that initial thing. Okay, you know, I got it. I got it. I got it. You know, it's that thing and it doesn't involve I got to get it, you know, a nice car and a house and a job and you know, something else happens. Now, part of this is due to causes and conditions that, you know, make people so super unhappy or really tough stuff. Like people dying around you, like yourself getting a disease. Yeah. I mean, obviously that that, you know, sends people off into a path on its own, you know, it has its own volition, but it's also just there's something that you walk into a store. I mean, I know people who walked into a new age store and they were playing Christian to us chanting and they just perked up and went, oh, wow, what's, you know, what's that? And, and, and they follow that down that so that longing came through the music, the, the, the mantras. Yeah. You know, so it happened and of course psychedelics is an enormous way for that long because once you touch that place, you want more of it. Right. That's, that's obvious too. Um, listen, I want to, I, some folks I want to ask you questions. I'm having some technical difficulty with the normal way we do this. For those of you who was the, I can't see the chat and crowdcast, so I'm still on discord, but here's a question for you, Ragu. Um, do you think there's a difference between meditation as a form of understanding the inner workings of one's own mind slash ego and meditation as a form of communion with the divine? If so, what are the differences? Do you practice in both ways? Yep. Yeah. That's a great, great question. Yeah. Jesus. I love that question. Really fantastic. Um, yeah, uh, absolutely. I mean, there's a, a basic level that, of meditation practice, which I mean, I recommend to everybody is the passionate or the passion or insight meditation that, that was brought back to the, to the West by three people, primarily, uh, Jack, cornfield, Sharon, Salisbury, Joseph, Goldstein, and we've been friends with them, you know, forever. And that there's a basic foundation that absolutely leads one inside, inside, getting to know, get familiar with yourself, with that part of yourself, both the, the part that you're dealing with, which is all the habits and the conditioning and all of that and, and understanding that and having awareness and the mindfulness part and the concentration part, absolutely necessary. And then there's the other part, which, uh, Ramdas used to talk, but he went, you know, he did like weeks and weeks of, of, uh, of this kind of practice, which, you know, he tells that funny story in the movie, becoming nobody, uh, about, yeah, I was sitting there in the monastery and I went off into a six hour sex fantasy and nobody knew anything, you know, that kind of thing. So, uh, but he said in the end, he was able to come back and use that, the power of the, um, of being able to go inside and connect with that place that's behind all of the story and the thoughts and all of the emotions and all that and be able to then go into an open heart, develop the open heart and not be afraid of what comes up through that open heart. There's a lot of stuff comes up, you know, people do, um, you know, even just chanting and they start to open up and it opens up everything, not just the ecstasy and the glory, right? It opens up pain as well, which again, Rumi was just talking about. And you, uh, so the, the, the reality is that the way that they work with each other, you know, meditation as a basic practice to get to know oneself and meditation as a practice to go through the heart to communicate with the, the divine presence is fantastic. Great question. Uh, that, yes. And that's a great answer too. Uh, here's another question from Angel, uh, question for our guru. Does it ever feel tiresome or a burden to be passing on such strong, loving energy all the time? If I had any idea of what I was doing or not doing, I would be really in trouble. Okay. When I have some idea and I'm thinking about it, then, you know, I'm lost. You know, I had a great mentor, uh, named Casey to R. He was one of the closest beings to a new girl. You know, uh, and he used to, he was like the Mr. natural comic book from crumb. You remember that comic book artist, uh, but forget his first name. Our crumb. Yeah. Our crumb. Yeah. Mr. natural. You know, he was like that with us. He'd be, he'd see us going off into, you know, really screwy places. And, uh, he'd say things like, my boy, if you think you're doing it, you are lost. If you think, if you think, if you think you're the doer. So whenever I, you know, realize that that's happening and some, you know, it happens like in stuff that you and I do together, retreats or podcasts or whatever, and I'll catch myself and go, okay. Yeah. That's fun pontificating didactic bullshit coming out of non-experiential stuff. I mean that because, you know, that, that's, uh, and then I have to do as Jack coinfield says, yeah, we're human. It's okay. It's okay. You know, so you're not judging yourself and all of that stuff, but no, I mean, you know, what's, it's like Christ, right? We're two or more share are there. I, I'm there, you know, so the sharing and it's what roundups has been all about. It's the legacy, the powerful legacy of his when I said to him last year, why did you mean Karoli Baba said, don't talk about me in the West. Well, that's all you did. Why'd you do that? I mean, I knew that, of course, Maharaj, this was all perfectly planned to, uh, for he, there was no doubt that he knew, of course, Ram Dass, you know, he said Ram Dass to do this. It wasn't, and Ram Dass, but said as a human being, he said, you know, I had this jewel. I could not, not share it. He couldn't, he couldn't do anything. He could only do that thing, right? And so there's joy in it and, and, uh, there's, um, in the doing of it, you stop thinking about yourself, time and space goes away. So, you know, as we're in this moment, there isn't anything I'd rather do. I mean, if we're sitting around just socially, you and I, I mean, we're doing the same thing, you know, so, yeah, it's all, and whenever I know that I'm going off into any kind of PS, uh, I, you know, my, uh, bullshit meter comes up and go, oopsies, you know, it's okay. But, you know, shut the fuck up. It's okay. Shut the fuck up. It's so good, Raku. You, what you're, I love this aspect of it because it's so liberating. You know, the, I was, I was at one of the retreats talking to someone and, uh, I could feel them putting something on me that just isn't there, you know, like I could feel like some, I don't know, they were trying to mysticalize me or something only because I told them about these retreats, you know, and, uh, which is not difficult to do at all. It requires zero meditation practice. You know, you just, it's like telling people where good food is or something. You know, I know, I know a great restaurant. You know, if I tell you where a great restaurant is you don't, and then you start telling me, oh my God, thank you so much. I went and ate at that restaurant. I really appreciate all the great food you cook for me. It's like, wait, I just told you where the restaurant was. I'm not the chef. You know, don't you, if you start thinking that then we're both in big fucking trouble and I remember saying, saying to him, I just want you to know, I don't know what I'm doing. I have no idea at all. Anything. And I felt guilty about that ever since then because I saw him seem disappointed. He seemed so disappointed and I meant it. I didn't mean it in some like, you know, false humility way. I have no idea what I'm doing and that to me, it's so nice when I hear your articulation of that being okay. And I've heard Roshi Joan Halifax at these retreats. I don't know if you remember, this was a few retreats back. She did this wonderful talk on Zen koans and the idea of being put you in a place of not fucking knowing that's the whole point. It's like they scramble you up enough so you don't have to be stuck in knowing which is a real mess. You know, if you suddenly start thinking, you know, yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. And by the way, everybody out there, Duncan's full of shit because uh, his actual what's totally inside them, which has come out more and more and more and it's the naturalness of caring and kindness and sharing and reaching out is beyond anything he or I could think about. Okay. And I got proof. I get mail. I mean, you know, love server remember we get mail every week. You know, oh, yeah, I got, uh, oh, the latest one. Did I send it to you? I don't know if I send it to you because I was supposed to start sending you this stuff. I don't the latest. It was about midnight gospel. It was about I suck. They didn't know you, me or anyone wrong. Nothing they happened on midnight. This is really great, right? Happened on midnight gospel. Maybe they saw the episode that I'm in, which I'm still pissed about that. I didn't have a name. My dog doesn't have a name in this episode. I mean, everybody has a name. That's a mistake. Oh my God. That's a mistake. I gave you a name. I didn't know that. That's bullshit. But you're, you're, you're in there. It could have been spot spot would have been good, you know, spot the dog. Anyhow, that person went there and they found you through, you know, knew nothing and that's fun. Talk about karma, right? Talk about the reality of how this stuff happens. We have no idea. So you have no idea when you're, you're with somebody and they're coming on to you about, you know, being a teacher or something like that. And you're saying, are you out of your mind? But they're not out of their minds. And this is something that's beyond you, beyond the, you know, any of this. I mean, just what's happening right now. We have no idea. No idea. No idea. We don't know anything. I mean, the reality behind all of this that we see glimpses of, you know, and certainly through Psychedelics is one major way through a book like be here now through a pod. I mean, it's, it's staggering how this, this works and, uh, and delightful. Isn't it? Delightful is the best word for, and every time I get to hang out with you like this, my life gets exponentially better. Raghu, thank you for coming on, for gracing everybody with your presence. Do you think you could tell folks, uh, how they can connect to your podcast or to the foundation or what you, you all have going on right now? Cause you've got this online thing happening now. Yeah. Well, you know, I mean, we were kind of prepared for what's going down with this pandemic and not being able to gather. So we've been moving into, we had already been offering tons of online courses and stuff. And now, of course, some of the retreats that have been, you know, your postponing cancer, you have to be online, but, but definitely put your email into a go to ramdas.org. Put your email in there like every week, wonderful Rachel sends out resources for resilience point and, you know, we could all use that, which is different either articles, talks, podcasts, films, you know, all of it, uh, that, that would be very helpful. And the other thing is go to beherenonnetwork.com. And I do a, I introduce Ramdas. This is what Duncan did all these years ago. He called me up and goes, wait a minute. Why don't you, you know, podcast and I come out of the radio business. So it wasn't that crazy for me. And he said, yeah, just put Ramdas talks, introduce them and contextualize them a little bit. And so we're doing that. That's Ramdas here and now to be here on beherenonnetwork.com. And also I do mind rolling, which he got me into and helped me start. And I mean, he literally, you literally, yes, you get this little, little mixer and you do this and you attach it to that and you, you know, and, uh, so that's why Duncan, I always say this is my guru, my podcast guru. So yeah, go to, go to beherenonnetwork.com and you'll catch all of it. You know, incredible.
