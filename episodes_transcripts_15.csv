But first, I'm pleased to offer you the premiere of Clint Tricks' new song, Yeah, Right. For those of you who aren't aware, Clint Tricks is one of the top country singers in the country right now and he's part of the No Washing Hands Movement, which I'm proud to say I'm part of too. Here's that track. And then we'll get on with the podcast. Take Uncle Sam's rear ender. I don't believe in washing hands. I think we live in a pretty clean land here, right? You think I believe there's germs everywhere. Come on, yeah, right? You think that I'm gonna wash my hair? Come on, man. Yeah, right? I like the way it smells when I touch myself at night and take a big inhale. I'm not gonna wash my hands for the man. Focus on washing your hands for about 20 seconds, about the time it takes to sing Happy Birthday twice. For more information, visit www.cdc.gov. CDC, you can take your microscope and shove them in a lead sack with all your perfume and soaps. While you're jumping off of the nearest beer, you'll find me at the local bar and join a cold beer. My hands will smell just like working man. That's right. My hands will smell like motor oil and glands. That's right. My hands will smell like assorted cheeses. My hands will smell like my children's cheeses because I'm not gonna wash my hands for the man. Friends, don't get sucked into this crazy leftist liberal conspiracy being perpetrated by the media mob that wants to waste water on nothing. Like, you really need to wash your hands and do you really believe there's tiny little germs everywhere? It's time to wake up, gang. We got a great podcast today.

He's a musician who's got a wonderful album out called May 20th. He's also one of the stars of the upcoming Mortal Combat movie and you've probably heard him on Aubrey Marcus's podcast. He is a brilliant human being who died and came back from the dead. We talk about it in this podcast, so now please welcome the great Makad Brooks. Makad, welcome to the DTFH. I'm so excited to have you here. I was researching you. The first thing obviously that pops up right now is that you are going to be Jack's Briggs in the Mortal Combat movie coming out, which is badass and is somebody who plays Mortal Combat and gets into arguments with 12-year-olds, which is just the... that's why I stopped because I realized I was like actually... That's why I stopped too. Really? Because you're talking shit to someone that's 10 years old and you don't realize that. Yeah. Like, until you do and then you're like, I can't continue that DTFH. I was sitting next to my wife and getting enough argument with someone who definitely was maybe, I don't know, maybe 16 maybe. Maybe. And I realized... At most. At most. At most. And I was like a little mad. He was kicking my ass. Of course they are. And I remember, yeah, no shit. That's all they do all day. But the look she gave me, it wasn't like disgust. It was just a look of like sad, pity that I was like engaging with the universe in this way. And I'm like, I gotta quit playing this game. Yeah, I've gotten that like once or twice. But Jack's Briggs. Holy shit, man. That is so cool. Yeah, yeah. I mean, listen, it's a dream come true. And also, it stopped being that very early on because I knew how much work I had to do. So it became this very practical thing that I wanted to do as close to perfect as possible. Right. So, yeah. And we, I think, you know, we all went down there with an idea of what Mortal Kombat was going to be. And like, obviously, we've lived with the game and the characters for 26 years. But none of us had any idea it was going to be what it's going to be. It's going to be fucking fantastic. The way that Tim Burton's Batman changed comic book movies. Yes. The comic book genre. It went from kind of Corny, Adam Utopia, Bang Boom Pow, Adam West, right? Yeah. Like, you know, Superman, Richard Donner, and like, it's a romantic comedy about a guy who shoots lasers out of his eyes and can fly. Yeah, right. They can crush coal into diamonds. Great. That's cool. But somehow, Jack Nicholson and Tim Burton and Michael Keaton turned that genre into something dark and grounded and real and based in physics and like, but also, you know, I think, I think without Jack Nicholson, I don't know if we'd have a joker because he played it. He played it in such a way where like, if you believe what he's doing, he's got to be mentally ill or he's got, there's got to be something wrong with this guy, right? Right. Yeah. And so like, when I approached Jack's, I was like, okay, well, he's an assassin. He's a killer. Yeah. And he kills monsters. Yeah. So he has to be a monster. Right. You don't get a, you don't get a human to kill monsters. You get a, you make a monster. You make a man into a monster to kill monsters. And I was stuck on this, on this Ernest Hemingway quote, and I'm sure I'm going to fuck it up. But it goes along the lines of, once you've hunted and killed trained men long enough, you have very little taste for anything else in the world. And that's who Jack's is. Like, I had to go into this dark space of like, how did I start? Where am I from? He's from Houston. Okay. So how'd that happen? Army boxing. Okay. So he got into boxing to get out, get away from his family life. Okay. Cool. Now his family life was so fucked up that it made him super angry and he was breaking the adults' noses at 14. Okay. Cool. Got that. I'm journaling that down. Then I get into a place where the best thing he, the best option he has is to join the army. Yeah. I know he, he did six tours. I knew that. Like that was part of the character. So cool. So I'll incorporate that. And what does that mean? And if somebody's doing six tours and there's special forces and they're picking where they want to go, that's a bad motherfucker. Yeah. It doesn't have the same sort of moral compass that you and I do. No. Like it couldn't be there. Like maybe it never was there. And if it was there, it's not, it's not intact in the same way that it was before, before the six tours. So I had to go through who did he kill? How many? Why? When did he feel bad about it? Is this, is, is he just a murderer or an assassin who's like, you know what? The government sanctioned it and I'm a patriot as well. And so I can make it, I can make it okay in my mind, okay in my head. And that's a dark motherfucker. And it's like, to me, he could be a bad guy if he's fighting for, if he believes the cause of something else, right? If he buys into your cause, he's just an assassin. So that's how I found this sort of this, this, this, this grounded realism in him that like, well, who was he before he was killing monsters and hunting monsters? And like, that's a really cool, you know, I think we all did that. We all sort of approached it in the way of like, how do I make this person real? Because in today's, today's age, like, you can't play a video game character. You can't play, you can't, you can't play this, a character who's been canonized, right? Like comics or video games and just play them how they've always come off. They have to, they have to feel and look real to people these days. And so that was, that was a level of engagement that was kind of interesting and hard to let go of. And hard to let go of. Yeah. Like those, those memories like stuck in your head or something, or you, you, you, whatever being that you manifested in that exercise you just described, is that living in you a little bit now? Whatever, whatever place you, okay. So for instance, realistically speaking, unless you, unless you have a psychotic break, right? As an actor, every, every character you play, no matter how different they are than you, has to lend to a part of your personality, right? You have to be able to, to go down this neurological pathway that is something, you know, I'm not an angry person. I could be. I've had a lot of things in my life that happened that could have left me really angry. And there's times where I get angry, obviously, but it subsides very quickly. I've learned how to like, how to deal with that. I know anger doesn't serve me. I know that it creates other pathways and other patterns that you now have to deal with based on what you, what, what you, how you reacted instead of responded. My girlfriend tells me all the time, make sure you're reacting instead of responding. Right. And so I've really tried to live my life that way. And Jax has two, but headed down that neurological pathway in the part of my psyche that is angry, that is, that could be a killer, that could be all these different things that I had to like tap into. Yeah, that's, that's difficult to, to, to turn on and off. It's not like, you know, I'm, I'm walking around Australia wanting to beat somebody up. It was just like, I just kind of had to stay in the house and like, you know, allow the other things that were happening in my life, not to make me angry because I was in this space, in this space. And like, when they said action, it really helped. It was great. It was great to be in that space. Right. It was great to be in that space. It's great to be in that space of like, you know, we did three takes of something and I'm screaming at the top of my lungs and tears are running down my face and like, you can't, I don't even have a voice after 15 minutes. And we all had to take it there because it's such a heightened reality that this is until these interdimensional beings jumping through portals who were trying to kill us, you know, and then we're coming back for them and like, who are these people? These are some bad motherfuckers and you have to go there. You have to go there. Well, that's nuts, man, because you have to go there. I love that. You know, I remember when the Walking Dead came out, the comic book, did you read the comic book? So suddenly there's a take on the zombie genre that's acknowledging what would happen psychologically to people if a zombie apocalypse broke out. People would lose their shit. You're not going to be okay. You're not going to be okay with that. Some people have trauma from like, you know, just getting punched in the face. You know, if you went through a day in a zombie apocalypse, you're going to slowly or quickly lose your mind. So, you know, yeah, it's cartoony to imagine hyperdimensional beings jumping out and attacking people. But if you were in that place, who would you, who would that make you? Yeah. And who and what kind of person would you be to be putting yourself in the place in the first place? Right. Well, you would be some kind of sorcerer or some kind of, yeah. And then there are sorcerers in the movie. But my character is an army boxing special forces commander. Yeah. He's not a sorcerer. Maybe maybe he's an alchemist in his own way. Right. But he's just, he's like, to me, he was on, he was on the SEAL team that killed Bin Laden. He was on the team that went and got El Chapo. Like, he was, he's one of those guys. Oh, I mean, you're the sorcerer. Oh, sorry. You are. Because the sorcery you're doing is a form of summoning a spirit. And that, you know, because when people hear about magic and all that shit, they imagine Hogwarts or whatever, a temple and a thing on the floor and other, but you're the temple. And when you're doing that level of acting, you're doing as ritual of summoning that literally brings a being into existence, some amalgamation of ideas that comes to life. I mean, this is like, that's for one, I'm so excited to hear that the movie has gone deep and it's gone dark. It's gone deep and dark, man. That's cool. Like, when does this podcast come out? This podcast will come out this week, I think. Okay. So I was going to tell you something, but I can't tell you that now. Bummer. But there's, there's, there's a moment in the movie that we didn't expect to put into the movie. And then our Simon, our director, wrote it. And he added a few scenes. He was, he was doing that here and there. And it just made, whatever he added made the movie so much more enriching and just, and just really tied things together. But he gave me, he gave me one scene that everybody's going to take a look at and go, oh my God, I get it. I get it. I kind of get something about this character that I didn't think that I would get from this movie. That's so cool. And it's such a real moment. And I really put myself in the situation and, and the film gave us room to do that kind of stuff time and time again. And so like, it's the, it's, it's like, I think it's going to be the kind of film that, that breaks some box office records and also could, could get nominated in some ways. It's really, it's really a fantastic piece of art. It really is. And no one's going to expect that. Great news. Yeah. It's like, well, this is also, we had, we had to, we had to. This is when you, to me, that is one of the most nefarious, and I mean that in a beautiful way, forms of evolving culture is you take a thing that has, you know, listen, when you go and talk to somebody about Mortal Kombat, nobody's thinking, I'm going to see some kind of like Kubrick film or something like that. People are just thinking, you know, it's going to be some gory, violent, cheesy action movie. So then you take that, this is an ambush, essentially. Now you get to theater, fill with people who are expecting that. And suddenly they're getting the real deal. And they're getting that too. Yeah. They are getting the fatalities and the brutality. They are, they are getting the hearts ripped out, their heads being exploded, the spine is ripped out. They're getting that. But I think, I think what's really cool about what you're saying is, and it's so true, is that there's this unknown payoff that's going to happen where, yes, you're going to get all the fatalities that you're used to, all the fight moves that you want to see. You're going to get, like, of course, we had to put all that stuff in there. But you're also getting a real story about real people that you can connect with and identify with. Right. And identify with their struggles. Yeah. Right. And like, that's the part that I think is going to be really unexpected. That's cool. I love to hear that. I think that's that. Do you think that this style of film, the, I don't know what you call hyper realistic, comic book, video game remake is happening because we're in a dark period right now in our, in our culture and people are, it's a, you know, movies just kind of reflect the situation. And, you know, is that why it's happening? I mean, first of all, do you think we're in a dark period in our culture right now? Absolutely. We're in a, I don't know if we're in a dark period in our culture. We are in a dip of consciousness. A dip. Yeah. I think we can easily get out of it. I think that we are on the precipice or the breaking point of something. I think that we are either, we are either going to break apart and what's happening right now is going to cause us to fall apart as a culture, or we're going to heal and the choice is ours. You know, it's either going to bring us farther apart and we're, and because of that, you know, we will restructure and that probably won't be a good thing for a long time. Or we're going to say, you know what, this restructuring that's happening anyway, should be bringing us closer together. Yeah. Right. And we should be, we should be bonded in that we want to make sure that we're going in the right direction. Right. And so I think we have an opportunity here. We're in the precipice of change. Either way, it's going to be healing and it's going to hurt. Right. And we have a decision to make as, you know, a collective consciousness in our culture. I'd say the hyper realism of comic book movies and superhero genre, and the superhero genre, I think we've always had our superhero stories, right? Yeah. They were just mythology. Right. Right. So like, no matter where you came from in the world, your ancestors told superhero genre stories, we just called it Zeus and Achilles and Odin and Simba from, from, you know, the Mali people. We had Olin Dumar from the Yoruba tribe. We had different folklore, Gilgamesh, whatever it was, that people, that we had these superhero characters in it and supernatural beings and super heroics and people that represented our fears and people that represented our different emotional states and our heightened emotional states. And they were able to take those emotional states and persevere through the story as a protagonist. Right. Right. So we're not doing anything different. I think the difference is we're now taking the stories that we saw as escapism and we're putting, we're putting a very grounded, realistic and modern, I'd say, God, I don't want to go with the darkness. I don't either. Yeah, but it's like, I think you and I sitting here in Silver Lake Hollywood, right? Yeah. We don't have a dark life. Right. Right. But there's the person in Iowa, in Nebraska, who's making 12 bucks an hour. Right. What do they think the future looks like? Yeah. I don't know. I don't know. But I can see why Joker became the number one rated our movie of all time. Right. Because people are looking for escape out of, I think, what they think is a dark situation. So I'm not sure if we are projecting in Hollywood or we're reflecting. I'm not sure which one we're doing yet. Yeah. But I know that we are doing something really, really smart. We're taking all of our sacred cows, we're taking all the things that we've had, all these trademarks and titles that we've had for 60 years or 50 years or 20 years, whatever the case is. And we're reworking them to an audience that needs realism. Yeah. Right. No one wants to have their hand held and like, let's escape with me. No, I want to escape, but I want my feet on the ground. Yeah. I think, I know what you're saying. I think that that, I think, I don't know if it's projecting or reflective. I think, you know, number one, I mean, I don't think I'm having, I'm having, I thank Christ and all the gods I'm having a good life right now. But I don't think it's geography necessarily. It's more of a kind of like, God, what I was just talking to someone yesterday and they're saying, well, one, one of the things that makes us all a family is we're all going to die. We're all in the family of mortals, meaning we are facing this, this, this, this finality. Yeah. If anything, you know, if you want to find someplace where we can share in the suffering, certainly that's it in the sense that we're all going to die. But to get back to this reflective versus projecting thing and especially this taking superheroes and gratifying them or whatever it is, you know, giving them a struggle, giving them a struggle. This is what I love about the Christ Jesus, because this is a, this, you know, he was a gritty dude. Gritty dude. And he didn't want to do it. Yeah. That's my favorite thing about him is in the Garden of Gassethomy, there's that he's like, please take the cup away for me. I don't want to die. I don't want, I want out of this gig that to me. I don't want to be a martyr. I don't want to do it. I want to see, I want to see the changes made. Yeah. Yeah. That I love, you know, with like, I know Odin got hung upside down. I know all the Norse mythos, they're all neurotic and fucked up. But you look at like Shiva, Krishna, that, that pantheon in general, there's a kind of like, I don't know how you would put it, that grittiness, that, that thing in there, Shiva's the, you know, of being that is terrifying and powerful and on your arm. But, but you know what I mean? There isn't like the, I don't, as far, but I'm not aware of the Shiva mythology. I'm not aware of a moment where Shiva is like, I don't want to be the destroyer. I don't want to be this thing. Right. Right. And these types of, you know, movies that take a superhero, and suddenly you've got a person who's now you're like, oh, shit, they're human. It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's personify, it's personification of gods, isn't it? So it's like, it's, it's, it's instead of the gods reflecting, sorry, it's human beings reflecting the gods. We're now taking the gods of old, or the superheroes of old, or the heroes of old, and we're now making them more like us. And we're now making them fit more into our time. Yeah. Like, of course, of course, Joaquin Phoenix had to play the Joker as somebody who was mentally ill. Yeah. Right. And, and go down such a dark path as that character that we didn't judge him for doing what he did, that we judge the system for, right. Yeah. And that, that, that speaks to our society on a lot of different levels, but that's the cool thing. I think what's going to happen with Mortal Kombat is that I think even some of the bad guys, you're going to go like, they just want the same thing. You know that, like, and it's okay if the kids come in and they're fans of, I'm not going to give away who's, who's, who's the bad guys are, but like, we had some really great actors playing those guys and those characters and they, they came in with the same energy. They came in with the same complexity. They came in with the same realistic and grounded history of why these people are who they are. Right. Right. Yeah. See, this thing that you're talking about, the circumference of justice in our country stops right around there because you, if you go too far, if you, if you're compassion, take the most monstrous being you can imagine, John Wayne Gacy, for example. Pretty about. Severely abused. Right. He was abused and, but let's say he wasn't. The question is, is this person like any monster, you know, because you, Jack Spreggs is killing monsters and he didn't start that way. He didn't start that way. But that thing about any monster, some video games I play, I'm like, who's is the fucking monster? The monster just wants to win. Yeah. Just like the other guy. You're playing like World of Warcraft. You're running through some hyper colored landscape, just killing things that are hanging out in the forest. Who's bad here? Yeah, exactly. You know, like, they're just chilling. You're the one going around incinerating them. Right. These monsters are like. It's a very sort of old colonial sort of perspective of heroism. Oh God. Can I ruin something for you right now? Sure. Sure. You might be already be aware of this. Can I ruin something? Yeah. I love when things get ruined because the truth is being shown. This is so depressing because I was thinking about the apocalypse and I think one of the, you know, apocalypse means the lifting of the veil. Right. And if you look at the Wizard of Oz, the man behind the curtain, they lift the veil. It represents the apocalypse and they finally witnessed the worst case scenario, which is it's just a human running the whole fucking thing and your whole journey was just to get to a fraudulent con artist freak behind the curtain. And you know, this also there's like a terrifying story in Buddhism where Buddha visits Brahma and you know, he's like, get the hell out of it. Don't leave all the gods around. And then he comes back to where Buddha's meditating later and says, I'm sorry I kicked you out. This is God in this mythological story. I'm sorry I kicked you out. I know you came to ask how I can help in human suffering, but I want you to know that I'm not really God. I was just the first one here. I don't know who made this shit. And if you want to figure out how to end human suffering, you have to do it yourself. But when God, you go to the gods for help and they say to you, no, I don't know. You're gonna have to help us. Oh, God, that's terrifying. Anyway, the creator, I'm sorry to finish the point, the creator of the Wizard of Oz, Frank Baum, was a genocidal. He was into eugenics, wasn't he? I don't know if he was into eugenics, but he sure as fuck was into killing Native Americans. There's two quotes kind of goes hand in everything. Oh yeah, I guess you're right. I mean, he's like... When you have specified genocide, that's kind of like... I guess it's a tool of eugenics in a way. Eugenics is I guess the more subtle form of that. It sounds nicer. You could do it over time without having to be violent about it. You breed out certain genes or something. It's more scientific genocide or something. This son of a bitch, and also because it's the Wizard of Oz, it's a huge franchise that you find, I don't know, publicists for the Wizard of Oz movie, clearly a battle is happening on Wikipedia where they're trying to be apologists for this guy saying, I can't remember what he called them, some awful thing. Savages. Savages. He's like the savages, we must respect their noble heart, but nonetheless, there's nothing to do but exterminate them. Something like that. He said it, the creator of the fucking Wizard of Oz. I mean, that was pretty normal talk for a lot of minority groups to hear in the 20s and 30s. Yeah, not just in the 20s and 30s, I mean. But I'm saying, I think it was still, it was public in America, you could say that and get away with it. You could say that and not get canceled. Exactly. Like yeah, you could say that. I think through the 40s, it was like pretty... Open game. I'm gonna twist your mind on something too. Please. Apocalypse. I had this thing about how we code words, right? I think everything's based on codes. I think we're coders. Because university learning is a bunch of code. You mean like computer code? Code. Yeah, beyond computer. Beyond computer. But I think the way that, mathematically, the way that we could probably identify it is computer code. But if you look at apocalypse, what does that mean? Apoc? Epoch, which is a time period. Elipse. Elapsing of an epoch. So the ideas of all the last epoch are gonna go away when the apocalypse happens. So there's all these, we code words all the time to tell us what they actually mean. Holy shit. That's one of them. Hard drive, wipe. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. All the shit you thought meant something doesn't mean anything. And we're kind of seeing that right now, right? Trump is Trump. Listen, I'm not a Trump supporter by any measure of the word. Really? I wouldn't have guessed that. By any measure of the word. Any measure of the word. But I do respect one thing he's doing. What's that? He's making us question if any of the shit that we thought mattered matters. Wow. Do laws matter? Well, only the ones we enforce. Huh, that's interesting. Does decorum matter? Only if it works. Does this matter? Does this matter? Does so on and so forth? Does being nice to people matter? And yes, I think it does in daily life. But I'm saying on a larger scale, all the stuff that we were taught that was supposed to get you ahead in life and supposed to get you to the victory doesn't work. Let's go through what those are. What is it? Be polite, follow the rules, turn your blinkers, turn the other cheek, bow to your opponent, bow to your opponent, be gracious, don't lie, be honest, don't overtly mislead people. It's kind of interesting. It's kind of interesting that human beings are willing to see somebody who tells 40 lies in a week and then they believe the one that speaks to founding what they believe anyway. That speaks to supporting their own beliefs with some anyway. That's confirmation bias. So it's less of an exploration on what he's doing and his behavior. It's more about what we're willing to accept. I think any despot or any totalitarian leader is willing to change the course of history on Thursday. Anyone. But what stops them is a willingness of a citizenry and its representatives to stop that from happening. And we've proven that we're not going to stop them. We've proven it. Hasn't happened yet. We've proven that we're not going to stop them. I'm not disagreeing with you. I mean, you look at what's happening in Paris. That's what it takes if you really want. I'm not even sure that would work here now. We'll find out this year. I think Donald Trump is going to die in the White House. I don't think you let a man like that into a house like that and expect him to leave. Good God. Hold on. I feel like the bottom just dropped out of my house. We're talking about the veil. We're talking about the apocalypse. We're talking about the epoch lifted, the lapse of the epoch. And the knowledge that we thought was that you had decorum, that you would pay attention to the rules and the laws that we set forth in this country that, well, you get eight years. That's true until it's not. Well, all men are created equal. That's true until it's not, until you give me an example. People should have equal pay for equal work. Well, that's not really true either. All these things that we think are, they're buying our ethics and buying our morals and buying our values, they're really just suggestions. They're really just suggestions based on the opulence that we've been able to obtain. And once we have fear that some of that opulence may go away, we're willing to change those morals, those values, and those belief systems. Right. And that's the interesting part. Holy shit. That's the interesting part. We're cutting to a commercial on that one. This episode of the DTFH has been supported by Squarespace.

Thank you, Squarespace. Yeah, sorry if I went too dark. You went exactly the right amount of dark. This is exactly where I hope to link. Listen, this is, to me, as someone who grew up taking me to the next level of my life. I'm not going to go into the next level of my life. I'm not going to go into the next level of my life. I'm not going to go into the next level of my life. To me, as someone who grew up taking LSD and looking at politics and the news, and watching it, and thinking like, oh, this is kind of fake. Like, we're believing it, but they're definitely not following the rules. And they don't believe it. And they don't believe it. No, they don't believe it. But you know you, as above so below. So if you've ever been in a job that has a certain set of rules and then you rise up in the ranks of that job, you realize those rules don't apply to you. So why would it be any different for the elite, so to speak? Especially because they're making the rules. They're making the rules. They're printing the money. Yeah, they're making the rules. So, you know, like, there's someone who works every day in a place where $100 bills are being printed on paper. And like, who's that person? Who is that? Why isn't it even necessary anymore? Yeah, it's crazy. Why is it even necessary? Yeah. But when you think about just that, someone who probably goes home smelling like money from like being next to the ink, stinking of $100 bills. And if you think those people aren't peeling off hundreds. Of course. Come on. Of course they are. Of course they are. And who are those people? And you're not even supposed to talk about it. Because the moment you start talking about it, people are like, what are you, a conspiracy theorist? They don't want to hear you. And what are you, not one? Hold on. What are you, an idiot? Because if I worked, hold on, I'm an honest person. I'm an honest person. But if I worked in a room that was printing money, I would be going home with $1,000 extra a day. Yeah. Easy. Yeah. What are you talking about, on a government salary? Yeah. Me and all the boys would be going home with a little extra. Every day. Whoops. Oh my goodness. I did it again. $50,000 made its way into my pocket. Whoops. Oh, we overprinted $75,000 today between the three of us. That's so weird. Whoops. Whoopsie, David. Also, it's ridiculous. It's ridiculous. It's ridiculous. But especially when people can play with the interest rate the way they do, they can play with commodities, they can play with futures the way that they do, which is devaluing money in many ways. It's like, I'm not going to take this extra $5,000? Right. Whatever. But I go back and forth with this in my head all the time, because I think, well, it seems that we're in some kind of. And actually, when I was doing research on you, and maybe your opinion has changed on this. Could have. My opinions changed a lot. Mine did, too. But you said that you feel like, and maybe before, actually, well, I'll just say it. You said you feel like this incarnation, we choose our incarnation. It's a kind of school in that we're here to learn. Am I misquoting you on that? That's close to what I believe. Yeah. Okay. That's close to what I believe. Okay. And this seemed to be in conjunction with an experience that you had. Several. Yeah, which is wild. You have a beautiful song about it called May 20th, and an album called May 20th that was inspired by this. Can you talk a little bit about what happened on May 20th? Yeah. I don't know if I can talk a little bit about it, but I can talk about it. Talk as much as you want. Thank you. Thanks for providing the space. I know for a fact that we have something that I call the original agreement, which is the agreement that the soul makes with the body to be here, and it picks a space time. You know, you're geolocated where you were born, from the parents that you're born of in the time that you're born there to accomplish something, to learn something, to observe something, to engage in something, and to create certain results and pathways based on your existence. That is an agreement that the soul made with the body. And I was confronted with the reality of that agreement for the first time in my life. Well, the first time I realized that that's what it was. I think we all had that confrontation over and over and over again, and it's just not loud enough, right? Mine became very loud May 20th, 2009, and I had been in the hospital for off and on for about a month. It was during the HVN1 or whatever thing, H1N1. Avian, was that? No, that's wine flu. Okay. And they thought I had twine flu, they thought I had leukemia, they thought I had everything under the sun, and I had been in the hospital and it wasn't getting better, and I was losing a pound a day for like a month, and I think I checked out a couple times because I was so tired of being there, and this last time I checked myself in, I just couldn't take care of myself, and it was bad. And so they found out that I had this parasite, and it was, well, they found I had liver abscess, and then they figured it was bacterial or viral or something, because that's 99% of liver abscesses. Mine was the less than 1% chance it was a parasite that I had gotten in Africa two and a half years before, and I should have been dead within 28 weeks, because I didn't have any treatment, but I was this medical anomaly and I had had it for two and a half years, and they were just like, that's impossible, there's no way you should be alive, there's just no way, like you should, there's no way, like 28 weeks, the parasite should be in your heart, they should be in your intestine, they should be in your brain, your body should have shut down by now. It's two and a half years, you're fucking kidding me, how? How did you, how did you, so I guess, I mean, I was so healthy, and like I did all these cleanses in my body, and like I had a really strong immune system, but it had taken over my liver, it caused a hole in my liver, and like this abscess is like this defense mechanism that the liver has that balloons around the hole to try to protect it, but the problem is like when your blood goes into your liver, it's not being cleaned obviously, because there's a hole in it, it's coming out dirty and coming out full of parasites, so. So you have parasites in your blood? I had parasites in my blood, but somehow, some, which normally goes straight to the heart, somehow, my body blocked that from happening, there's no way, there's no way that that should happen. Were the doctors, they had to fly people in, because they were just like, what the fuck is, and like, and for the first few days it was just poking and prodding, and like not trying, like almost like not trying to make me better, so they could study me, because I was the third case in 12 years, and the other two cases died. Well, because yeah, if they could figure out why you were surviving this, they could maybe come up with a cure. Yeah, I don't, which I wasn't really happy about. I was like, I literally got to the point of yelling, yelling, fucking make me feel better, because like, help me, I was like pleading, help, like literally yelling and screaming, crying, firing people, because they were just poking and prodding, firing people coming and going, help me, I'm dying, help me, right? Oh my god. So finally, and maybe I should have held my tongue, because they gave me, so there's three major parasite medications, at least that I know of, at least at that time, and they gave me one, the reason I found out there's three is because people are allergic to one or two of them normally, and I was allergic to the first one they gave me, and. Allergic like how? Swelling up or like? With the amount of drugs that I had in my system, with the other medications that I had in my system, and the allergic reaction that I had, it stopped my vitals. So I passed over and I crossed, I passed away and crossed over. The medication killed you? The combination of things that they put in my body, yes. That is so terrifying. Right, but I didn't even know that that's what, that's what had happened at first. So I was in, it was one night, so let's just get into it. So May 20th, 2009, it was just this one fucking long night. Like, I don't know if you've ever laid in bed and you're just like, you kind of feels really small in the bed, and like the room feels humongous, and like you kind of just, you feel sunken into your own energy kind of, and you don't, you're not aware of time, you don't know what time is, and then next thing I know, and like I knew every, like clockwork, like every, I don't know, hour and 40 minutes or something like that, or maybe less, maybe hour and 20 minutes, like when the blood would fully go up in your system, I would be in the most severe pain in my life for 15 to 20 minutes, because the blood was coming out dirty and going into places, right? This was in a hospital, this bed? This a hospital bed? Or, okay, okay, so you're in the hospital bed feeling sick and small and sunken down in the bed? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, like this was weeks and weeks and weeks of that, and so I knew that the IV drug drip was coming in, and like that always made me kind of like loopy, but feel better, and like, you know, and then they had the parasite medication come in and, The first time? This is the first time they gave? The first time, every second. Okay. And, but I had a bunch of shit in my body, I didn't need to have, because they had been treating me for all types of other shit that I didn't have, right? Okay, yeah. And, so I remember, I don't know if I get this, so it's night time, and I'm laying there, and I just sort of feel like, you know when you're about to start feeling like shit, and like you feel it, you're like, oh man, I'm gonna feel, oh, I'm getting sick, right? And it was just a little moment of like, oh, I'm gonna get the flu, this sucks, right? Like, and that kind of happened, and I was like, okay, well, something's about to happen, this is, this is like, I'm gonna, I'm gonna get sick again, this is gonna be horrible. And then it got worse, and then it got deeper, and then worse, and then deeper to a place where I was like, wait, that's not, that's interesting. And then it got worse, and got deeper, and got worse, and deeper, and deeper, and deeper, and deeper, and then it got frightening. Why, when you say deeper, what do you mean? I'll tell you. So, it started, it starts like, when you feel like you feel unwell, you can localize that. You're like, my lungs hurt, my throat hurts, my stomach hurts. There's something off, and I feel like my whole, like I'm starting to get like a little sensitive to touch on the body, or like, you know, like when you're about to have a fever, right? It was kind of like all of those, like not so much through my throat or whatever, but it was more like sensitive to touch, feverish, but on a level I had not felt. I had never felt. And there was something in the stomach that was like deep in my gut, and I don't know if it was metaphysical, but it just did not feel safe or right, right? Yeah. And I was just kind of like, this is not good. And like, I started to like, I couldn't really feel pain because of the IV drug drip that I was on. Yeah. Right? And so I started yelling, and I realized my dad's over there, asleep on the cot, and he can't hear me. Oh no. Because, and I'm yelling for the doctors. Oh shit. And nobody can hear me. So I had this button I'm supposed to press, I can't move. I can't move my hand. And I'm like screaming and crying, and no one is, no one hears me. I'm looking at this door, this door with this light in the hallway is, and people walking by like, nothing's happening. And I'm yelling at the top of my lungs like, help me, help me, help me. And as, as this is happening, when I say deep, this is, this is what I mean. I go into a place where I go into, I go into that reserve of intestinal fortitude, right? Where you dig deep down in your own gut, to your sacrum chakra, and you, you grab your fucking courage. Yeah. And you come back up and you go, I got this, or we're going to fight. Yeah. And I dug as deep as I possibly could, because it just didn't feel right. Like, whatever was happening, just, this does not feel right. I don't know what's happening, but this is not, this is new. This is different. This is more severe. I, no one seems to be able to hear me for, like, I'm calling for help. And I, I reach down to where my intestinal fortitude is, where my courage is, and there's a bottom, like a fucking table, like a floor. Wow. And like, these energetic hands I have that are reaching down for this courage are surprised to feel this floor too. And then it just sort of broke what I knew. I go, there's a floor to that. There's a limit. There's a limit to your own intestinal fortitude. There's a limit to your courage. There's a, there's a limit to your strength and there's a limit to how much fight you can, you can give something. Oh my God. That's terrifying. Bro. And like, and that in and of itself broke me. Like, you're not strong enough to do this. So all of a sudden when I, when I did that, it was almost like I, I woke, I woke something up and then there was this little calm voice. It was just like, yeah, man, you know, you're not fighting this one. This is it. And I was like, no, no, no. I was like, sometimes I talk to the voice. I'm like, no, no, you the fuck out of you. You're you're ridiculous. No, no. And then the voice is kind of like, it just kept going. Not this time. Not this time. Not this time. But like almost in a, almost in like this sort of supportive way, like just not this time, not, not, not this time, buddy. Like pat on the shoulder, like, you don't have it this time. And like, I sort of was trying to deny that voice and not really hear it and like just sort of keep going. No, no. Right. Just keep going and keep pulling for that courage. Keep digging for that intestinal fortitude. And there was the floor and the floor was impenetrable. It was impenetrable. And sorry. It's fine. And then that in and of itself makes you feel like you don't know what to hold on to. You don't know what to hold on to. And then immediately, like I started to feel severe pain and that was physical and that was also emotional and metaphysical. You're looking for anybody to help and you're yelling and you're doing all these things. And they say that your life flashes before your eyes. In my case, it did not. What I noticed was, all of a sudden, as soon as I got a little more comfortable with accepting that this voice was telling me something, not accepting the message, but sort of accepting that it was telling me something. And once again, the first reaction I had from accepting the voice was telling me something was shame. Shame that I couldn't, I couldn't fight. Shame that I didn't have enough strength, that I was letting myself down at the very moment I needed myself the most. Right? And I was thinking to myself, well, if I wasn't in the hospital, I could definitely fight this. And it was just like, not this time. Not this time. Just kept this nice, this calm, my voice, this calm voice is not this time. It's not it. And I can't believe you're just talking about the Garden of Cassathymia of Jesus saying, I don't want to die. If that happened to you in your hospital bed, you were having that conversation. That's the conversation. No, no. And it's saying, yeah. And it's a very calm voice. It's not going to argue with you. Doesn't need to. Like it knows what's happening and you have to accept what's happening. And so I got to a place where while I was feeling this great shame, while I was feeling this great torment about my own abilities, my own strength and shattering any sort of illusion I had about that strength, I, I started to see images of my life. And I started to see myself when I was three years old. And I started to see the other part of that conversation, like almost like this omnipotent perspective of every conversation of every experience I've ever had in my life, non-linear, more like you're on the edge of this orb of existence of your own life. Right. And everything is like in this sort of VR and here you are last week with having coffee with this friend and she told you something crazy. And, but now you see it from her perspective as well. Now you see it from the waiter's perspective. What happened when you, next is what over here, it's not next, it's all happening once. You were 12 and your mom said this to you and it felt so great and you, you're, you're immediately thrown back in the emotional state of how you felt when you were 12. And this is yesterday and you're thrown into the emotional state of how you felt this and you're interacting with them in such a dynamic way that they all feel real and that they, time, time ceases to exist because you are engaging in each one of these things in a way that you can process. So you're, you're thinking this must be eternity because this is, I'm going over the whole life, non-linear, but here, here it all is. And I'm watching this conversation, you're going to see this conversation when you pass away 60 years from now. You're going to see it from every perspective in this room and you're going to learn different things from it. And this is the crazy part. Like this, that's your identity. The constant observer has put all these files into this hard drive of yours, right? And you identify with that story. You identify with this orb of existence. It's you. It is you. It is, it is what makes up your character. It is what your decisions come from. It's, it's what creates patterns and neurological pathways and it makes up your energetic body and it is you. And then they start to go somewhere else. Like I'm watching something happen when I'm six and I'm, I'm, I'm fully engaged and I don't feel the physical pain and I'm like there and I'm like, wow, and I'm, I have so much compassionate forgiveness for this child who I am. And I understand something that my father's telling me in a much different way. And I'm like, wow, oh man, that's what he meant. Oh, wow. And then it goes away. And I literally am trying to take, I guess I'm imagining it or I don't know if I'm physically doing it. I'm literally trying to hold on to it with my hands. I was like, what the, where's that going? Where could that possibly be going? That's mine. I lived that. That's mine. Where's that going? And the answer is it's going to a different version of yourself. What? And I got that answer pretty much immediately. Like this little, it's like a light beam that pulls this VR from your perspective, from out of this fear that you're, that you're sort of on the edge of engaging in and it pulls into this light beam and goes up and you realize that you were just here to record all that shit. What? You were here to be part of the observation. You were here to record it. You were here to be the first person observer to a larger part of self that needed the experience. That is the trippiest thing I've ever heard. I got goosebumps, man. I'm like, it is, that's so, so crazy. That is exactly how I felt too. I was like, wait, then what am I? What are you? I'm not important. What, wait, macabre is not important. But, but I'm macabre. I'm not macabre. What? All these things. So once you realize that you are a tool of your own consciousness, you're the human body of human personality, I realize in that hospital bed, it's a tool of your own consciousness. Is it a projection of your own consciousness? It is, it is, it is more metaphysical than it is physical. It is a, a data point in space time that allows your source self to pick up certain lessons or observations or engagements that it needs, right? And like, that was sort of kind of obvious. And it's like, why am I trying to stop my own memories from going into the, from being uploaded? This is a waste of time. And I started to feel shame again and like all these other feelings and I still have my conscious mind in some ways. And you ask yourself one question in that conscious state. You've already accepted. You already kind of, it's weird. I can't say you've accepted death. I can say that you've accepted. You cannot fight. You accepted that I'm just, this is, I'm along for whatever ride this is. And I don't know how this ends, but you don't know. I didn't know it was death. I thought it was like, I didn't know what it was. It was, it was happening too fast and too, it was, everything was too new. Right. And this is before I'd ever done any earth medicine. What? Yeah. I was 28 years old before I'd done anything. Like I had not done any psychedelics. Holy fuck. I had not done any plant medicine. I had not even done mushrooms. You've got no maps. I've got no guideline. I've got no guardrails. I'm like, what the fuck is happening? The only thing you can think of is I am dying. Right. And you obviously, your mind doesn't want to go there. Obviously, your mind doesn't want to go there. And so what, what, where my mind went was back to the conscious state trying to hold on. And I asked myself one question. And you, and I think, I think I've talked to a couple of other people who had similar experiences and they've asked themselves the same question. And that question is, did I do what I was supposed to do while I was here? And that's a very, that's a layman way of saying, did this soul fulfill the agreement it made with the body before it took the body? Oh my God. And my answer was no. And I, I felt more shame and more, I felt worse than I ever had in my life. Knowing that I had, no matter, you know, I had a SAG award. I was on a hit show at the time. I was on True Blood at the time. Like, I was, I was, you know, I had more money than I knew what to do with at that age. And I, I, I had, you know, I woke up with, with women in my bed that were on magazine covers. And none of that shit made any difference to me. None of it made any, I'd been very generous to my family and friends and, you know, given my parents a better life and done a lot of really, really cool things. On paper, it sounds amazing. On paper, on paper, it sounds amazing. And then, but in my own conscious state, in my own self-conscious, I knew I wasn't shit. Because I didn't do, I didn't fulfill, I didn't even try to fulfill the agreement my soul made with my body. What was the agreement? Storytelling. Starting with music. Storytelling. Yeah. Taking what's in here and putting it out there. Yeah. And it's because I have, I think, I think it's because I have a very particular perspective of what, what all this is. And in these, in these experiences helped. Anyway, so I, I got to this, this place in my consciousness where I was ashamed again. And like, this is, this is, this is the darkest, this was the darkest period of my life, period, like the moment before the lights went out. And then this fucking crazy shit happened that I can now explain through plant medicine, but everything that you, that you identify with, all the senses that, that you think make you, you touch, smell, sight, all that. And also, like cognitive senses, right? Yeah. They became geometric shapes, represented as shapes coming out of my body. And then they kind of spiraled together and they spiraled really, really quickly. And I could feel the touch leaving my body and I could feel the sight leaving my body. I could feel the sound leaving my ears. I could feel any sort of conscious thought I had going like just leaving and becoming a part of the shades. And they started to spin together in this little, this huge spiral that was so fucking big. And it felt like the energetic body. And then it spiraled so fast that it became like this one color and this one beam of light thing. What color? I don't know if I've ever seen it. It's like a future, like a pink. But then sometimes it's green, sometimes it's blue, and sometimes it's this color in between the colors kind of. And then all of a sudden it gets smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and it's gone. Fuck that. I don't want that to go. That's the one. I don't want, at least give me the spinning color thing. Like, you know, the memories, shit, that sucks. But now what? Now what? What do you got? It's hard to identify as a human being what's left because there's nothing left as a human being. So when I say blacker than black, I mean like a turned off cell phone is not this is it looks like the afternoon compared to this, right? Like a black television screen looks like the afternoon. Like it is purple, blue black, like black wood cast a shadow. Yeah. Bye bye black. I think it's the Crayola name for it. And that's where you are. And it's infinitely large. And you're just kind of and you're aware that you're floating. You're aware that you're sort of hovering and it's this little bouncing sensation a little bit. And I remember the first thing that I felt was an overwhelming sense of bliss and harmony immediately. I wish you'd led with that. Take us through the valley of the shadow of death man. Oh my god. I had yeah I had this overwhelming sense of like I don't even I can't even tell you I've never felt that I've never felt that happy even till this day. Wow. That's what people say when they come back. Yeah. There's nothing it's like you're dancing. It's like your spirit's dancing. That's the only way I can describe it. But like this beautiful sort of ballet of like experience and time and it's more than human. Like it's just it's just there's nothing there's nothing human left in that. And like you don't think about your family. You don't think about yourself. You just start laughing and saying oh my god I forgot that I was also here. Wow. What a fucking what a fucking great cup of coffee that was that human life. Wow. Right. And like you're like so I don't know if this is accurate but I say the soul's memory starts to pour back in like your your consciousness leaves the identification of the human being and becomes like this the spirit entity again. And in that sort of awareness of that spirit entity that memories come back and you realize this this dark place that you're in it's not dark. It's a field of pure potential. It's it's where you it's where you always are. Part of you is always there. And wait always there. What do you mean? Part of you is always is a human body. Like part of you always is in this incarnation. Like it's the thing weren't right now loops. But then there's this space within which it's being held. Is that what you mean? I mean I mean the best way that I can describe it to you is this. The human body is a wonderful interactive projection that has been I believe that has been encoded with let me think of a different way of putting that. The human body is wonderful as it is. It's not the most important part of your existence. Not even close. It is the vessel that carries out in this state of consciousness what what the real you wants to do. It's how you interact with the universe on a physical level. But it is not who you are. It is it is this wonderful tool that we have that gets to interact with all the different codes that gets that gets to interact with all the different patterns that gets to different act with interact with all the different experiences of childhood trauma. You don't have that as a spirit. But we want to remember what that's like for some reason. Coffee. You know how that is a spirit. Sex. Friendship. All these things. Wait you didn't say whether we had sex or not. We don't. You don't. Sex is so once again think think of think of the player playing the video again right right and like let's say your avatar has sex in the video game. It's cool. Oh yeah right. It's cool and you have some sort of emotional response to it. Sure. But it's not what it would be if Duncan put the video game down when it had sex. Yeah right. You'd be a weirdo if you were like bragging to your friends about humping in your video game right. Exactly right. Yeah right. And so it's kind of the same. The human body is this vessel for the spirit to go engage in and play in in this little playground that we have and we've constructed to take lessons back to the spirit. So it's the spirit is evolving then like what you're saying means that the spirit itself has a consciousness and the spirit itself has a life. It is a species of thing. Does that friends. It is a species of thing. And I don't know if it needs friends. As a matter of fact I don't even know if I don't I think I think that species of thing is the singularity. I think I think we are we are all that thing. I think that we are just complex projections of one thing. Wow man. So here so so I'll continue linear on this path on this story. Thank you. So we're in the future. I'm in the field of I say we because I think I'm in the field of pure potentiality or whatever you want to call it. The the abyss the I don't want to call it something negative because it's not and you're aware that you have a body. The body feels a hundred times bigger. It feels pulsating and I start moving forward and I could feel air interacting with me. I like somewhat like not like wind but like you're obviously there's something happening. There's some movement happening right. Electrons are going that way right. And I can I'm affecting. I'm looking down on my body. Well I shouldn't say looking down. You're aware of like 280 degrees right. Okay. Right. Yeah. It's not quite 360 but it's like wow that's I can see a lot. Yeah. And you're aware that the body is fucking massive and you're making ripples. You're affecting what I thought was a flat surface but it seems to be now you will and I don't know if it's liquid but it has the quality of of of of a liquid. Okay. Because it's like when you throw a stone in a stream and it makes those like ripples. Yes. Something was responding to my movement. Right. Yeah. And I'm going towards this horizon that I'm starting to make out with mountains and trees. Okay. And I recognize them and I get so happy. I'm like oh yeah. I know that place. I know that place. That's where we go to kind of as a layover till we decide what we're going to do and go somewhere else. What. Yeah. And I'm going to that place pretty fast. It's like it's you're moving fast and the horizon is coming up and it's an eternity away it seems because you didn't see it at first. Right. And here it comes here it comes here it comes and then all of a sudden I see I feel and see these different orbs zoom past me. Come from behind me and all the side and they're smiling ish like once again there's no mouth but you know they're smiling. You know they're dancing. You know they're in bliss. They go oh these are other souls crossing over. This is cool. And there was a lot. A lot of them. And none of them are regretting. None of them is like my wife this and my kids this and my husband like no. Nothing. You feel their energy and they're all just laughing like fuck we all forgot. We all fucking forgot. We thought we had to hold on to that thing. Yeah. Oh cool human. Right. And then I start to slow down and then I stop on my I'm almost out of stop and I realize oh I'm not going there and I got upset kind of like yeah like no no no no no I want to go there. I know it's there. I know it's over there. It's over there. It's great. I like I don't want to I don't want to go back to that. I don't want to be McCarty again. No. Like I'm done with that. So we get to I get to about halfway. No I'm pretty close. And like there's this and I think I start to make out like a moon or a star or something right here like in the horizon above the mountains right to the right of it. And I start to go towards that. And I start thinking like this is interesting. I'm the only being doing this and I know that this doesn't feel like this doesn't feel like this is the natural state of occurrences. And like it wasn't like my human mind came back. It was more like I just knew this was a different path than that. Right. And I started to get these messages again like you're going back kind of like not like so much you're going back more like there's more to do. Right. It was it wasn't in that language but the communication was there's more to do. Right. It's like okay. That's what everyone says. Yeah. It's like there's more to do. And I go okay. And I kind of knew that the physical body was going to feel pain again. I was like I wasn't excited about that. Right. And like all these things that I had just just remembered I was like I hope I don't forget these things. Right. And then so I got closer and closer to this light. I'm closer and closer and closer to this light and then all of a sudden that light becomes those geometric shapes again and they become they're spinning again and they're slowly moving back into the body and then I'm aware and that light's still there. It's just like this focal point that kind of holding you in and then it becomes the light in the hospital. Geez. And then I remember a sound was the first thing that came back and then just felt like like kind of like like this reverse sucking almost and I could and see I could you know it was kind of blurry. I could make out people and I could make out things happening. The lights were on now and then the pain came back in my experiences and like it just the pain was so severe because I just felt bliss. Right. Yeah. It was the worst pain. I had been in pain for over 30 days but that was the worst and then I remember the pain. It was like it wasn't just physical. It's psychological. It was everything because because I remember right before that I gave up quote unquote. Yeah. I reached down to where the intestinal 42 was supposed to be the reservoir of that and is a bottom. Now I knew that there was a bottom. Now I knew if something like is happening and I don't know if I can fight this or like should I fight it or all these things are happening. Who am I like I just gave my memories up to something else and like mind you this is me talking about it nine or eleven years later. I didn't know what just had happened. I knew that I had given my memories up to something. I knew that I was not strong enough to fight and that's what I focused on. I was beating myself up right and I wasn't so much pain. I just wanted to get out of pain. So like it wasn't really until couple years later I really figured out exactly what happened. Right. But let's fast forward because you mean wait two years later is when you know it was it was it was a little it was like it was like May twenty two thousand nine. It was like it was like around twenty twelve and I figured out exactly what had happened to me. Okay. Right. Around twenty twelve and I felt like wait is that what happened to me. Yeah. Because like it's it's it's like when I when I tell people I go hey yeah you know I lost my life once I flat line and they go oh how long were you gone. You go it's not a competition. Like you don't ask you don't go hey how'd I do. Yeah. It's not breath work. It's not like you're you're taking push ups. Yeah. You're not you're not going swimming and going minute minute forty one like it's not what happens in nor do they go hey good job two minutes nine seconds. Yeah. No I have never met anybody who actually knows. So when people go yeah I was I was out for forty eight I was like okay cool. Yeah. Like I'm not saying not to take anything away from anybody else's journey not to say that I'm the expert on this because I'm not but I've never the few people I have talked to who had the same experience don't fucking know that answer. It's a ridiculous metric. They don't know and you don't ask. Yeah. It's not it's not like you're either happy to be back upset that you're back. You have a million and a half fucking psychological and emotional and metaphysical questions. Yeah. In my case I was in the worst pain of my life physically. Right. So like no it's you know so like you don't really know unless you're in a space where like you get shot and you and you know you're not in like I'm blowing you and you and you I think I think of something like that happened you would know but when it's like something you're not expecting maybe it's a car accident or it's whatever the case is and the lights go out I don't think you even know right like I didn't know and so made so we're talking about May 20th May 20th 2010 I'm in India I'm trying to like I'm doing my e-pray love thing I'm trying to like get over this this experience. Sure. And that by the way that is a courageous choice for a person recovering from a parasite. Trust me. To head to Southeast Asia. Wow. And I drank yogurt out of a fucking barrel and a neighborhood in the middle of that. You drank out of a yogurt barrel. To prove to myself that this would not define me. Wow. On the anniversary of that I drank out of with my hands out of a barrel out of a yogurt that they made fresh from cows there in this fucking nowhere village. Hare Krishna. Yeah. Good for you. But like I got to the point where like look I'm not gonna let that kind of shit define me. I'm like I'm not gonna let like I'm hard to kill. That's one thing for sure. Yeah. Two. If you start to live your life in fear based on what could be considered your strength. Right. Right. You might be gaining the wrong lesson from the hardship. Oh shit. You might be gaining the wrong lesson from the hardship. Whoa. The hardship is not supposed to make to minimize you. It's supposed to it's supposed to maximize your potential. That's what it's there for. It doesn't happen to you because you're supposed to minimize. It happens to you because you can handle it. It happens to you to unlock that potential. It happens to you to unlock the mystery. It happens to you so that you can you can be more expansive and more evolutionary. And and it's an invitation to be courageous not to shut down. It took me a while to learn that too. Took me a little while to learn it too. But so May 20 I'm in India May 20 2010 in India. I go to this Naughty Reader. Naughty Reader. I won't bore you with the details but Naughty Reader is somebody who reads these ancient scrolls called Naughty Scrolls and they were written in between five and two thousand years ago. And legend has it that half of the people that come to India looking for Naughty Readers will find their name on a scroll that's 2000 to 5000 years old. I happen to be one of those people. What? I saw my name on it. Get out of here. It's not like you've got a common name. Nope. I had to practice your name for I had to practice your name for 30 minutes. Yeah. That's a little extreme but that's cool. I appreciate it. I appreciate it. That's great. And and my parents' names were on it and it had my last blood meaning it had my past life. And my past life was in India and like this guy had told me all about it and so and so forth. And as soon as he said the name I said the name out loud as like my crown chakra blew off and it was like my brain goes hey I thought we said we're not going to say that name anymore. I was like do you know that name? And like my conscious is like don't worry I got this don't worry don't worry like there's some shit you don't know don't worry right. I was like huh oh god. And so like all that was happening and as I'm leaving he said the same thing I said do a friend maybe two hours before that because he said be very careful driving. I was like that's interesting I just said that to this other guy like. So last thing you want to hear from a guy who reads scrolls by the way. I agree with you. I agree. I never thought about that. That's so fucking true. So I didn't think anything of it. Go back to America. I love my life. I hadn't done the music yet. I was recovering from all this kind of stuff. I hadn't done the storytelling yet. And I'm on a new TV show. I'm in Atlanta where I just wrapped the third episode. I think the day before and it was about to start the fourth episode and I'm minding my own business and I'm leaving the mall and I'm in my I'm in a car at a stoplight minding my own fucking business and this lady hits me head on going 65 miles an hour. Fuck. On May 20th. What. On May 20th 2011 and I go into a coma for three days. Come on. And it was a very very similar experience to the the parasite experience that I had. And but this time it was a lot more interactive with the universe when I lost when I lost the human consciousness. I kind of I was kind of like OK I'm back in the same space. Then I started to voice. What is this. What's happening. Now I didn't mean I didn't put together that these were both my 20th. I didn't put it together yet. But I was just like OK what I'm back. What's happening. And it gave me the same answers. Do the music. Do the storytelling. I was like wait. So is this like a did I choose that I choose for this to happen until I start listening. Yep. So I'm just going to continue getting hurt or dying until I listen. That's what you coded. Oh my god. This was your choice. You said wake you up by this age if you don't start doing this. Oh my god. I was like oh OK. So this is a it's my fault. Yeah. You are fucking around. I was not fucking around. That's like you're doing like when I'm like that's the beginning of a game. You're playing your difficulty too high man. You got to reduce the knobs if you hit it. Listen. One parasite. I'd be like give me one parasite after that if I don't figure it out. Forget it. I'll just do it next time. I'll enjoy my life. I'll enjoy that one parasite but the car. So evidently like I had made an agreement. My original agreement with the universe was that if if I don't listen if I don't wake up and start to and start to make storytelling part of the forefront of my life then I need to start over because because that's what my soul needs right now. So like once again the human body I think is a projection of that original agreement. How do you how do we fulfill that original agreement without a body without engaging in the physical universe. How do we do that. We can't. So we're only here to serve our higher selves. That's why we're in this thing. So like you know when we get jealous we get angry. We get upset. We get sad. That was OK. That's real but understand it's happening so that you can you can report about it. I gotta tell you this is pretty trippy. I wasn't going to even tell you this just because I thought whatever I never do this but I'm like I'll draw three tarot cards for this podcast and see what pops up. You want to hear what they were. Sure. Card number one the devil card number two the universe card number three strength. It was exactly what you're talking about. You were in this sort of incarnational trap. You look at the devil card. You see these people chain to a sort of you know thing that chain to an idea chain to an idea chain to a actually chain to a black cube that represents matter and then the suffering and suffering is matter. Yeah. And then the universe you know anyway to me your story is a story of redemption but with this addition to it which is this incredible awakening experience both experiences coming from violence coming from like one of them parasitic violence which is the other one 65 miles per hour head on a May 20th. Let me just add one more piece to this because I want to keep talking about what happened after the second experience. Right. So I looked up May 20th having read that you experienced this twice. If you looked up what happened on May 20th in history. In history. Yeah. Well I know I know the the next May 20th May 2012 was it was an annual eclipse solar eclipse and I that was the first time I did ayahuasca. That's cool. May 20th is actually a really fascinating date. It's when Constantine held the first economical council where he basically where they yeah that's decided with Christianity essential. Well you know you need in Buddhism they've got it you need some not politically. Yeah. By the way I belittle it all the time when I'm super eyes are Constantine. We don't know what it is man. But then I'm but I think what's really what I found really interesting about the date was all these aviation things like Amelia Earhart became the first woman to fly across the Pacific. Wow. Before that I think Lindbergh that was the pilot right. Yeah he flew on May 20th at that he flew across the ocean. Wow. Isn't that wild. And then it was also great feats of aviation. Yeah. The first commercial airline flew on May 20 encouraged and also exactly what it you know even before I told you that you were talking about the experience of traveling of going across a great distance of seeing it's just fascinating all that you should look it up. It's pretty trippy man. Yeah. That date means a lot to you. It does mean lots of me. So it's my spiritual birthday. It's your it. Well right. That's do you do that. My friend told me the story about a Taoist master and when you asked him how old he was he would say three because he woke up three years before and before that he was essentially dead asleep. So I'm like 11. You're 11 years old. And also I want to point out something the look on your face when you were describing that place was like I could feel it. I could for a second I felt you know it. Yeah. We all know it. We all know it. We all know it. And once we all get back there we're going to be laughing and surprised that we forgot about it and how permanent that place is and how it's home and how it's like it's we it's our workshop. We spin the elements of I guess you put it this way the particles of potentiality. We spin that into the molecules of existence here. Good God. That's the most beautiful thing. Will you say that again the particles of potentiality. Yeah we okay so it's a place where we go where we like it's it becomes this really fun and creative place in these in this place that we have this incredible attachment to and in harmonious bliss attached to the feelings of that place because it is the place where particles of potential are spun into the molecules of creation. That's what it is. That's where we live man. That's where we always live. Yeah. And like we go there sometimes we meditate. We go there sometimes in breath work. We go there sometimes in trauma. We go there sometimes in peace. We go there sometimes in I even think people get there by blacking out Navajo. Like they just go to this peaceful place and they fucking pass out right like yes you having a physiological reaction but the consciousness is like I'm leaving. Right. I'm out. Even your consciousness is yeah like fuck get the fuck it bro. You drunk idiot. Wow. You just pissed in your pants. I'm out of here. Like you're going to pass out now. Right. I think there's several ways that humans get there and we're and then once you really find yourself embodying that space and remembering what that space is it's fucking hilarious that you forgot that you live there. Right. And as I'm saying is I'm laughing at myself for things I've done in the last week. I'm like in arguments of engaged in. This is why you're supposed to do this. Yeah. Because you know there's this you know something that I heard there's one there's a Tibetan teacher named and we'll wrap up. I know you got to go and thank you for your generous. No no no listen we have we have another 20. Okay great. If you have that. I have it for sure. There's a Tibetan teacher called Dilgo Kinsey Rinpoche and he was one of the Dalai Lama's teachers and you know there's a great documentary on him but one of the things they like he said something to somebody that just you know sounds like something you read on the back of a milk carton if you know if I if I say it to somebody whatever like your yoga teacher says it's sweet or whatever he said something along the lines of be more kind but because it's coming from an awakened being it means why it shatters you carries my way. Yes so when you say a storyteller it's not that's exactly what you are clearly I mean I was riveted listening to the story that you're telling but it's carrying the extra weight of somebody who is had an experience that transcends physical reality because a lot of us haven't got I mean I've gotten there through DMT I've had a version of it. Well you absolutely have trust me you absolutely have gotten there on ketamine you absolutely have but I think those substances to some degree color it a little bit you know like when you're wearing like colored glasses or something they have their own little they add their signature to the experience. Absolutely there's a different perspective in which you're relating to the space because of the pathway you took there absolutely. The coma was a different experience than the death experience and then so like when I got when I was in the coma and I got out of it it was like everything was really foggy for a while and like I had a really traumatic brain injury was really crazy and I couldn't remember people's names and the people I saw every day can remember the names. Well there's no guarantee you're ever gonna come back man when people like it's not like the movies. They didn't think I would they honestly didn't think I would I almost lost my job at the time I was on a TV show I had I had to relearn how to read. I didn't yeah I remember my I came back to work two weeks later just to I had to go in and do a scene or I would get fired because the other way insurance worked or something. How does that conversation sound I'm sorry just from a business perspective who the hell to call you like listen I know you've got it. They had to they had to they're like look and like but also no one people just thought I was being a bitch like no one really understood how bad it was because I obviously wasn't communicating with people right like so like first three days I'm out then after that you know they're getting second hand third hand knowledge from people like I couldn't communicate in the first week or two like so finally they're telling me like yo you gotta you have to go to work. I was I literally took my phone I threw it against the wall like this is bullshit I was like yes and then I had to have somebody go give me a new phone so and then I got so but I get to work and I they gave me the script and I look at it and I'm like something's going on my eyes and I'm kind of shaking my head and I'm like looking at the script and like and it just looks like windings what I'm just like you're fucking kidding me right I'm like and I started kind of like smiling like thinking like this is a joke or something and then I flip it to the front I can't read that either and I know what that says that says the name of the show so like holy shit but that doesn't look like that and then like the color drained from my face and I was just I didn't know what to do I was like I can't read this and the more I try to concentrate the more I would get a migraine and like anyway so like that's a whole that's going in the book that's a whole crazy hell on earth hell it was fucking hell just the pressure of like this clearly the scene is important enough to get someone you just recovered from a coma to fly there with a traumatic well I was there I was already there I couldn't have flown whatever it is it's like if you're like making a show and you're like yeah get the traumatic brain get a person who was just in a almost fatal car accident come and do this yeah there's no they had to do that like if you're summoning someone they hadn't they had to oh my god so and so you're you have already just have the pressure of that but then to suddenly not be able to read and then to not know if you're gonna be like that forever bro it was crazy who taught you to read again I did I had to hide it I couldn't tell anybody what you do I got a PA personal assistant to read me my dialogue and I matched it up to what he was saying so he would record it he would record it on a phone and then like I would he would uh he would read my lines and I would little by little maybe 30 minutes a day 30 minutes a day at first and then an hour a day then as the time went on and I could focus more like is it because focusing on anything for five to ten minutes at first was like pounding headache right it's horrible but then I got to a place for us three or four hours a day and I could look I could hear him saying what he was saying and I knew that was the top of page two so I know that this meant possibility this meant purple this is this and eventually as time went on six months into it I was able to like to look at the scripts and go I'm pretty sure I know what this says and and I still and for maybe a couple years it wasn't completely accurate and people thought I was just lazy and they thought I was rude and disrespectful and considerate about their words and like the showrunner sat me down and had to talk with me like listen you need but this is like this is getting kind of crazy as I go I finally go I can't read wow and they they to my surprise they they held me they hugged me because they saw they saw everything I went through right and they go you why don't you tell us they go because I would have been fired they go yeah you might have actually like and we couldn't we probably couldn't have protected you from that that that would have been a network decision but and then then they ended up hiring somebody to help me and um you know that's how it happened so like it took me about three years to get back to where I was holy shit yeah but like I didn't tell anybody except for the stuff like maybe until like a year year and a half in uh about the fact that I didn't know what that sign said you're good at keeping secrets let me tell you if I couldn't read as I'd be like I can't read I don't know how to anymore I wouldn't be able to keep quiet about that for three minutes but it was it was it was weird because like I was like a kid like I would like you'd be at a coffee shop and I'd see a book and I'm like world atlas and I was like Starbucks I was just like reading everything I could possibly could just to make sure I got it right and I was like mate mate and like latte like oh yeah latte like and like there was all this stuff that like and like I'll have people correct me all the time and words I used to know I didn't know anymore and like I would I'll be talking to people and they're like you're misusing that word I'm like well how do you use it like oh yeah so I had to be dumb and and have my pride leave me enough to leave me enough room to learn from people who you know three months ago I was schooling so um that was difficult can I read you something real quick sure I never do this by the way I don't know why and also like I'm not getting all biblical on you honestly I'm not really a so this is trippy to me ma'am okay so like when I'm getting ready for interviews I don't usually read tarot cards and bible stuff is for some reason for you I did I have no idea because I haven't read the bible in so long well me yeah well I can't anytime I start reading it my eyes bleed let me but this um this is this this is this now I get it like this is what this is I just opened up to this you know it's it's called bibliomancy actually you can do with any book you know about that if you have a question you open the book up and you read it and then through confirmation bias you'll get an or oracular of it so this is what I read this is from this book called sundays at the magic monastery it's all these like homilies I don't know what that is from the trappists of st benedict's monastery and this is for the fourth sunday of lint which we are in lint which I'm not positive what that is I'm Catholic I was raised Catholic it's a time of reflection and symbolic suffering to honor the Christ body oh but it's it's it's it's a symbolic thing that's beautiful my friend's not eating sugar for lint right um smart friend smart friend as Jesus walked along he saw a man blind from birth his disciples asked him rabbi who sinned this man or his parents that he was born blind Jesus answered neither this man nor his parents sinned he was born blind so that God's work might be revealed in him we must work the works of him who sent me while it is day night is coming when no one can work as long as I'm in the world I am the light of the world when he said this he spat on the ground made mud with his saliva and spread the mud on the man's eyes saying go wash in the pool of something I don't know that how to pronounce that silo arm then he went and washed and came back able to see was that wild yeah it's weird I would open up to that uh because in that seems to be exactly what you're talking about which is that we these catastrophes that happen in our lives when you look at them from a materialist perspective it's just catastrophe yeah it's it's absurd it's just why me why me it's horrific absurdity but from your perspective and this perspective in this book here it seems to be that our catastrophes have been placed in our lives as gifts that we are giving ourselves to help us remember when we've gotten too far off track from the original agreement from the original agreement right and and that is so in retrospect wonderful yeah but also when I hear someone say things like that I think oh fuck am I doing my agreement and also because I don't want to get can't I have one ball left man that's what I said right that's how weird I am you were like give me a car accident in Paris I'm like cut off one of my balls cut off a ball and now I'm like I don't know what exactly why did I want one of my balls cut off well well let's examine that why did you what is it taught you not to play world warcraft with my laptop on my lap but that's for sure man okay well there's that there's that I'm sorry I don't mean to reduce your question no no no not at all like but I mean there is that it taught me I was gonna die and it taught me that like the thing you're talking about hitting that place that it taught me that because you know when you get when you get cancer yeah they they uh you don't know they they're not just like oh it's just in your ball you're fine it's like with your parasite it's like they're like it could be all over your body it could be in your brain yeah you know so that's what it is and they have to prepare you for that what's that they have to prepare you for that scenario right that's the first thing they say is we don't know how far it's spread it could be all over you and so that was that moment for me it wasn't as unfortunately and fortunately I didn't I wasn't in the hospital but I did have that moment of like oh fuck it's real I die I can die yeah holy shit yeah and then the invitation I think whenever you get that cold water splash in your face is to if you can stop taking people for granted as much you know and yeah absolutely it teaches you that but you have a certain kind of glow that like that makes me think I have not I think I'm I'd I hope I'm doing I'm doing the right thing I think people listening to this to me it's terrifying to imagine and I know I don't want to feel like I'm disregarding what you're teaching us here which to me I'm not I'm not teaching anything about oh oh see it's not wild I'm not teaching you want to be a storyteller who doesn't teach good luck now well the reason I say that is because you you can't teach anything that you don't possess and I don't possess that that harmony yet I don't possess that that level of of enlightenment or consciousness that I can pass it along yet I'm still learning and I hope that I think that people can also learn from someone who's learning on their own journey sure right if they're astute enough but I'm not here to teach I don't I don't have it yet I don't I don't possess it yeah so I can't give it yeah not yet I'm on I'm on the pathway to try to do that but right yeah not there yet not there yet I know that why you're saying that last thing you want to be is some guru you're too busy you don't have time for it man you don't want to start the cult yet he doesn't you don't know you're like absolutely no way it's too much time man keep in track everyone's name what's your lifestyle it's a light it's a choice that's a choice that's a choice you don't get to be a star of the Mortal Kombat franchise and simultaneously run a commune nope I don't think you can I don't think you can either but you could oh you watch out you ever watch the life of Brian no oh you would love it it's a Monty Python you know it's a it's like making fun it's not making fun it's a brilliant satire but one of the things is this poor guy gets confused they confuse him with the Christ and it's a great scene where he's running he's running from people trying to get away saying like get away from me and they're like he says to get away get away get away he drops his sandal I like his sandal we touched his feet he's like I just want to be alone but the problem is you know and it's I think it's actually a weird I think it brings us back around the where where the you know because you do have this power and this charisma and because you're very good at telling stories when we're talking about Trump potentially becoming like a czar or something it was powerful and it made it creep me out I have a friend who's very good at talking about bear attacks I don't an animal attacks and we describe animals attacking people if Joe Rogan it freaks me the fuck out because it's like he's too good at it and so like you get there's that extra that's what a storyteller is so but what I'm saying is the there is a weird little thing right now I think happening among certain people which is they don't want to take on the mantle of being a teacher thing because a it's an embarrassing thing to call yourself like what are you a teacher really what are you gonna get sell me a crystal be it's a lot of responsibility it is but it is funny to me that you would say you're not quite there yet I'm not how do you get to decide that and how do you know well I think it goes back to that principle that you cannot you you cannot pass on anything to anyone that you don't already have possession of I don't have possession of that sort of consciousness level yet like I'm learning and I have been put through the ringer and I've come out clean in the other side but I still have but I still I have daily struggles with jealousy and and daily struggles with fairness and daily struggles with reacting versus responding and I have daily struggles with all these different things and so I don't think I'm qualified right truly I don't think I'm qualified to to take on the mantle of teacher guys thank god people like you exist because when they when you don't have that yeah that's a jones town right there yeah you get a jones town I don't think people like that should learn on a job right like I don't think I don't think your guru should be learning on the job whoa I'm sorry I just don't think it should be happening wow like I think I think everybody's learning on the job I don't think you should be able to teach me anything that you don't have mastery over yourself wow now you can I can learn from your journey yeah right and I can learn from what you've learned from your journey sure but don't teach me shit yeah please don't teach me anything that's the worst when someone who's like clearly incredibly unhealthy in some way are completely fucked up is like how many years I'm a life coach like what what how what's your life like though yeah like do I want your life or do I want do I want your life experiences coaching my life experiences yeah and how you qualified like I don't know I I'm not taking anybody's I'm not you know talking shit about anybody's hustle but I just kind of feel like there's a lot of people coaching lives who haven't really lived one yet it's a big business huge business life coach yeah that's a half a billion dollar industry really alone online life coaching is a half a billion half a billion half a billion wow gang um also I decided today I'm starting to do life coaching that brings me to my next point Duncan I have a I have a life coaching business that I'm starting next week coach my life it's a funny name for I know you mean it's it's such a it's a ridiculous like your life is the life coach your life your experiences of life should be what coach you to a better life right otherwise you're doing it wrong that's right there's no wrong way to do life but that's the wrong way to do it and you don't by the way the guru thing at least the way I've been taught is it's not like you just like if you run into your guru that's it man that's like game over you that's your your that place you are talking about going to that means that you've like not only are you going there but like while you're here you somebody from that place has shown up to like help you to some degree you don't just run into a guru you don't like I have a belief that you are your own guru oh yeah yeah oh yeah and that like really truly the only guru that you're ever going to listen to is yourself and that there's a part of you that is in that guru consciousness there's a part of you that that knows like you said something interesting maybe 15 minutes ago you said am I doing the right thing yeah I don't know if I'm doing the right thing yeah yeah you do oh there's a part there's a part of you that's very calm about what you what the decisions that you make right and how you spent the majority of your time in the last 10 years or how long you've been doing this podcast right you're doing the right thing right you fucking know it yeah I thank you for calling me out on that and you're right and I don't know why I play that game of like am I doing the right thing because because because a lot of well and you weren't looking for that a lot but you are looking for a false sense of humility yeah which we all play along with but that only belittles the guru energy that's in you right right you shouldn't do that because you've done the work you've done the research you've done you've had enough experiences to trust that portion of your consciousness you have it's it's written all over you I'm headed there the moment you finally open up the whatever you want to call it your center it's the guru conscious I'm headed there you're doing the work no you are like this is exactly this this brings us back because it's like to me the your you are the perspiration of the divine and you're dripping into this particular sector of time space and it's just the right time that and I perspiration is a lot do is a better word I want to say you're like I like your god sweat and perspiration because it's like it means you earned it yeah okay yeah I think I've I I could say this we just did a plant medicine ceremony the other night and people kept coming up to me and saying you're a king you're a king your energies just yes it's majestic and like you know like you're like a you're like a peaceful warrior yeah yeah and like I just kept saying thank you very much I really appreciate that I've earned it and I said and the king energy in you recognizes the king energy and me and that's why you're saying that otherwise you'd be a hater and you're saying who does this guy think he is oh yeah but you see a reflection of of the compassion so like to me king when people talk about king energy or a queen energy or a royalty they're really talking about compassion well compassion means suffer with them suffer to suffer with yeah if I can put myself in your shoes if I can have compassion for your experience that is the most royal thing you can do that is what takes a leader that's that's what that's what we look at we look at the kings that we celebrate from the old the queens we celebrate from the old the leaders we celebrate from the old they had compassion so diving into the the place in your consciousness where you can have compassion for all things is what we think it's what we relate to royalty it's why it's purple compassion is purple it's red and blue red being the suffering blue being the camaraderie of aura and then it makes purple and that's why compassion and royalty are come off as the same color and in the aura structure we we we don't know that's what we're saying but that's all we're talking about when somebody's like oh my god you're a king you know thank you I I realized that you see the compassionate center has been opened up with me and it's open it's opening up in you because you can see it holy shit right my mind officially blown no thank you so much a lot of quite you answered a lot of questions for me today and I am so grateful to you for your time I hope what you're y'all come back on absolutely sometime I'm sure we'll do some work together I would love that thank you would you mind telling people where to find you you've got a new podcast yeah well man uh just had I just pitched the new podcast we were talking about this people are actually pitching podcasts now and the company said yes and we are yeah so we're we're gonna start this summer don't know the name yet maybe you can help me figure out one show um be cool like I'm thinking of I never agreed or cheat codes something like that it's kind of cool right that's cool that's what I think I think I think trauma and learning from trauma and just being that that like you said that god perspiration or in psychedelic journeys I think those are the cheat codes that we have in this in this in this realm that we're in right and when once you earn those things you can now play the game a little differently can't always play with the cheat codes on right but now you know you can and you can turn them on and you can access them right yeah and that gives you a different perspective about how this game can be played right right so I think she goes could be a cool name I have a book we're doing too called I never agreed to be black which is about which is about servicing the original agreement which I learned in that hospital that I spent a good 30 to 40 percent of my time on a daily basis servicing inherited agreements meaning agreements I never signed up for that I inherited because of the cultural and sociological structure that I was born into wow meaning there's these intersubjective myths that become agreements with my participation so if I refuse to participate in the agreement it's just a myth and then your myth has to has to die with you and your myth and you have to deal with your myth I don't have to agree to it I don't have to agree to you me doing my existence you're demanding my participation in something I never I never consented to and if we can understand the me too movement you can understand I never agreed to be black I never agreed to to to adhere to what your privilege tells what your what what your confirmation bias and your privilege says about me I never agreed to the person who looks like me that I have to adhere to your expectations of what my blackness is and in doing that we were imprisoning ourselves and taking our spiritual energy and our guru consciousness and belittling it based on sociological structures and intersubjective myths that were created by people who are less woke than the average 13 year old today yeah right and like wait hold on so we've updated science we've updated travel we've updated our diet updated health care we haven't updated our sociological structures right how we think about our sociological structures or our interest our intersubjective myths and agreements we haven't we haven't decided that we need new agreements based on our new consciousness okay and so like I think we have these three agreements we participate in on our daily on our daily lives and too much of our time is taken up with inherited agreements we should be spending our time on chosen agreements and the original one and your chosen ones should serve the original the inherited ones maybe some of them are good maybe some of them serve you chances are many of them don't and so that's what the book's about that's what the podcast is kind of about just redefining what our agreements should be and how do they how should they serve us in the 21st century because we're still adhering to you know 16th century or 17th century myths regarding my hue for sure regarding my color for sure yeah for sure the weaponization of my skin tone has been the exact same since 1619 why 16 I mean isn't it older than that I don't know I know in particular in America it's august 30th 1619 is the first day that 22 African slaves stepped foot on to a place called Point Pleasant Virginia uh summer of august 30th 1619 on a pirate ship called the white lion the white lion right really absolutely and so I know that the weaponization of skin tone started there and this is crazy this is in the book too you know it started no so there's a there's a very old company I forget the name of the the the acronym on the stock market but it's it helps start the stock market it's called the dutch east indian company right and they had a partner called the dutch west indian company they're both based in instagram in london now they traded commodities they were shipping magnet and they had their own army of mercenaries and they were they were uh quasi-governmental agencies think haliburton okay uh with ships okay right got it now this we're talking about 1580 and 1600 and now we have the new world quote unquote right so what were they shipping people now was the number one commodity so spices textiles blah blah blah blah salt or whatever and humans and they started humans were such a a lucrative commodity because they were free you didn't cultivate them you just kidnapped them or you worked with the local governments in africa and who are your enemies and they ambushed these people and they took 20 of these people 30 of these people or they had a meeting between two tribes and then the other tribe would ambush them and then they would get this tribe and then they would get their land all this kind of fucking you know really fucked up you know local political you know rivalries that turned into a slave trade right but in the first 10 to 15 years you had sailors jumping ship killing themselves coming back with PTSD you had investors saying I can't do this this is horrible yeah this is like look how these people are being treated so the dutch east indian company the dutch west indian company closed their doors for the first time for a little bit for i think it was the little less than a year and they hired a bunch of doctors and psychologists and scientists that created a myth that africans were a product of satan's last stronghold on the planet and that ripping them from africa was actually doing them a favor taking them out of their savage nature and giving them christianity was the most humane thing that they could do and if we didn't go get them there they would eventually spill up into europe and take over and they're brutal and they're strong and they're this and they're evil and they and they and they and this was these were pamphlets that were handed out by a private company to insure profits never heard this story before and they and they were also to make 16 or 17th century sailors feel better about themselves about going into a ship and kidnapping children from their parents well these are savages these are these are demonic beings subhuman subhuman and all these things we have in our heads today all the same agreements we have the myths that we have in our heads today that when i participated in them they become agreements were written by dutch and english scientists doctors and shareholders in 1610 that's the most evil shit of all time wasn't even supposed to sustain it wasn't so so we have this thing called um it's called humes problem right it's it's it's a it's a philosophical it's a philosophical sort of question humans don't like having a lack of information it makes them afraid right right that's a natural state of being right so when i have this chocolate shake right here this keto smoothie yeah you've never had it before no let's just say you never had it never had it but you go let's chocolate and you go and i say it's got avocados got walnuts it's got almond milk almond you go oh i know what they taste like but you don't you're only comparing it to what everything else that you've already had right that's humes problem hume says if humans don't have any reference point of something specific they compare it to something else not to feel afraid and that is what we base our society on we've taken a pamphlet that has made pirates and sailors and shareholders of a company that no longer exists and tried to make them feel better and created a sociological structure based on that that i have to participate in today come on man nah so i'm just gonna so with the book and the podcast it's the first time i and i know of that someone who looks like me is just saying no absolutely not if donald trump can live in his own reality so can i if i don't have to if if if you can understand the hashtag me too movement then you can understand i never agreed you can you know what consent means wow and i i do not consent to what thomas jefferson thought i was i do not consent to what the east indian company has told you i am holy so let's get the conversation started i love so that is so radical it's actually you know for a lot of it feels like it's you know it feels like it feels futuristic man it feels like it feels like all of us all of us to some degree are starting to realize in the grand scale we're not we might not like just like what you said our bodies are a tiny fractional part of what we are we actually are yeah i mean to me what's amazing is your i can i say can i say this based on that point our bodies are the least are the least important and and and the least identifying part of our presence right sorry sorry they're the least important and at least i at least identifying expression of our spirit your your skin tone your hair your gender your sexual preference has nothing to do with your spirit and we are mostly spirit and we built a society based on what i think in 20 years we'll look back and say that any inherent bias was a mental illness it's a delusion right we have we described racism to somebody like you go i feel like that person's existence bothers me so much that my cortisol levels go up i wish i don't wish them well i don't hope that things to work out for them i want them to have a harder life because they deserve it there's all these inherent biases that i have that i hold on to even though there's no empirical data to support them hmm they they make me paranoid they make me worried in fact i'm so paranoid worried my cortisol levels are so high that i think i'm gonna put this t-shirt on and try to go hurt one of them it's a fucking mental illness hey man we have we have we have a determination for that it's called delusion disorder it's called delusional disorder but we're trying to be nice to racists who is as a society we are because we have it we it's misdiagnosed mental illness or undiagnosed mental illness i see we used to treat schizophrenia with exorcism oh so happy we don't do that anymore right so we haven't always been right matter of fact we've gotten a lot of things wrong in 20 years mark my words maybe less we're gonna know that if you're part of the alt right if you're the this is something we should be able to study the cdc should say okay there is something in the brain that makes people paranoid and delusional about other people's existences and we should try to figure out what that is well it's a it's a i mean it's like a viral it's a it's first of all it's a it's a a meme in the sense that it's the kind of thing if you take a terrified dumb person you can make him scared of just about anything absolutely anything but it's so but it the to me the creepy thing about racism is that it's viral and intentionally spread it's a weaponized philosophical virus that people to this day continue to propagate and they evolved the ways of doing it and you know so when you're talking about the alt right you know you're talking about a thing that has its roots and fucking storm front you ever go to storm front don't you want to chip bricks go to like go to one of these i don't know do you go to the white supremacist websites ever like when you're super baked and why freak yourself out i i i did back in the day because my dad my dad's a civil rights attorney so he joined the kkk what yeah your dad i thought because you want to get the newsletters you want to see what they're doing want to see what they're up to see what they're saying oh shit yeah they were mailing a civil rights attorney they're like schedule they're not that smart no they're not but man you go you go and look at these people they're like this is the problem they pray on and again uh why am i saying i don't want to i don't want to finish race they pray on idiots so like what they so what they do is they go to places where idiots might congregate like flat earth message boards for example if i if you don't believe the earth is round i can i can sell you anything anything i can definitely make you afraid of jews if you think their earth is not round then i it's just a couple of steps to like you hating jewish people or black people whatever women or anything they pray on them so like let's and i always give people this example too which is kind of interesting i give people two examples when they when because i don't even get mad at racism anymore how i'm amused i'm curious i have so many questions when it when it rears its head but i don't engage because a bully needs a target right so once you remove the target their entire the reason behind the why of i'm doing this shatters and you just watch it you watch this flimsy ideology just crumble in their face and you go what do you mean oh that's that's interesting but why and you just start instead of going fuck you you go what do you mean and they go they can't explain it well they have to defend racism or sexism they can't it's it's a it's really really it's kind of an interesting thing and i'm amused by it so like i tell people i give people these two examples kind of it's really funny if there is a homeless guy right houseless person chronically houseless homeless person yeah i don't say that disparagingly and there they have you know dirt under the fingernails and like they smell like they smell horrible they smell like a subway clothes are raggedy there's dirt everywhere and they're having this disgusting vitriol of this of this of this of this racist um um spout right yeah what do you do you walk away why because they dress like shit so if that person took a bath and shaved and got in the suit why does he have why is why why is his voice more important oh yeah right why did i just walk away right aren't they just the same crazy yeah also the other one i i give is if somebody comes up to you and you know on a chat board or anywhere else in the world and goes dunking i gotta talk to you man these leprechauns they are fucking just fucking raping these unicorns man and they're taking all the jobs and they're doing this and doing that dunking we have got to get rid of these fucking leprechauns right yeah and people you'd be like this motherfucker's crazy yeah but you've replaced leprechauns with women or blacks or jews people go fuck you man i gotta fight you now right what are you fighting right what are you fighting i got you your engagement is making it real i got you that's the one thing we haven't tried yet whoa just going i disengage with crazy people i don't talk to crazy people like i had we had an experience in vegas um over new years and this girl was saying this crazy racially insightful shit and everybody was so angry and upset and i'm the black person i'm the one black person in this in this scenario and i'm sitting there laughing going you need help she's like well let her not go you actually need help you have a mental dysfunction and she got so offended and she's like why can't you just talk and talk about it i go because i'm not going to talk to somebody about eating feces sandwiches or i would rather or punching chihuahuas in the in the third rib because you think that brings them good luck whatever whatever your mental dysfunction is i can't engage with it right whatever it is right that's so smart whatever it is yeah man that's really i don't know i don't know i mean like the thing is if you haven't guessed yet i'm a white dude so my experience in this regard is like sadly limited and and and the way you're explaining it to me it's like i feel embarrassed because no i shouldn't be it just in the sense like i didn't know that about the i didn't know that about the pirate company i didn't know i don't know the name of the ship you know i don't know any of that that's my brain doesn't can like i'm not attached to that and that's to me a little bit embarrassing but also to me it's kind of incredibly inspiring that you would be this patient because if somebody you know man like i remember once i was sitting eating and this girl at the time this girl was dating her friend was there and she didn't know i only had one ball and honestly i don't give a shit that i have one ball right but it still works it still works it works i made a baby wait but we're a better work um but we're this girl she's like talking about someone she knows who had a i guess had one of his testicles cut off and she goes and he's half a man that's not what makes a man i wouldn't think so but i'm sitting there and just that i almost was like what the fuck are you talking about what the fuck are you talking about when what you're saying if i'd applied it in that moment it's like this is a dope like i don't know if she's mentally ill but she has a myth in her head that you can either validate with your attention or allow to be in the ether right and it makes no difference if it's just floating around right doesn't require engagement at all at all and then in fact engagement gives a power it's a it's a parasitic force it's a vampiric force and the engagement speeds that needs a host you're a parasite fighter i'll take that i'm not a teacher i'm a parasite fighter you became a super hero that's what a parasite man yeah yeah that's you're you're like what you're teaching well i'm sorry to call you a teacher what this what you're talking about is a what i've learned what you've learned is a it like crushes exactly what they need they need people they need a host so any mental illness and i say this with with because i said this on my instagram before and people fucking ripped into me as if i was talking shit about people who have who aren't completely mentally fit i was like no no no people can have depression people can have this schizophrenia i'm not or delusion or whatever i'm not saying there's anything wrong with a mental illness that's the stigma you're attaching to it i'm saying racism is one yeah and if you're you're fighting to defend the racist's feelings that's not a fight i'm sure that you really want to take on no and then if you're if you're putting words in my mouth and telling me that i'm saying all mentally ill people are fucked up i'm not however i am saying it is the mentally ill person's responsibility to realize that they're mentally ill to get help that's right one it is also the people around that mentally ill person's responsibility to make sure that they get help right if they need it they want it and three if you engage in anybody's mental illness who's sick now oh yeah now you're sick holy shit now you're the one who needs help yeah right not not because there's there's no getting through to a delusion there's no getting through to a paranoia there's no getting through to something that doesn't make sense in the real world right so what are you fighting what are you doing and how much of your time and energy are you wasting on someone else's myth agreement or mental illness wow i love it this is crazy i had a friend who uh pat i work for she passed from parkinsons and and thanks in the towards the end you know she was having like she had a she was a brilliant wonderful person she she was having a moment where she's having an illusion and she thought something about a robot's attacking her and one of her assistants at the time was like confirming those are so afraid of her that was like saying something about yeah i know the robot we have to watch out anyway when she came back to herself the first thing she said to that guy was why did you why did you let me believe about the robots why would you say it was real i was going crazy and she was pissed at him because it was he it was the last thing she needed was the confirmation of the insanity every mental illness is attack on one's own self a racist is attacking himself or herself first you ever met a happy racist no exactly they are constantly attack yeah they are in constantly attack mode first themselves and then it becomes outward so of course what is their only response when you engage attack that's it that's all they can do right they are in a constant state of self attack yeah mental illness is an attack on one's own psyche that's what it is right like an autoimmune disorder or something so if once i engage in your self attack i can only be attacked and it's not even anything about me and you're holding it up yeah you're you're how i'm making it real i'm making your fight real i cannot wait to read your book yeah that's what's about yeah that's so cool it's so funny though me reading it is gonna like no it's no because it's it's not even just about like people are gonna see me reading but like no shit you didn't it's it's it's and that's the only thing that kind of makes me that gives me pause about the title is because i don't want people to think like i realized in my own experiences i never agreed to be black because i was in a hospital bed and i crossed over and i was in a car accident and i if i'd done it i wasca 30 times and it's made me realize that your race is the is the least important expression of your soul and race and gender and that that's true for all of us and then it doesn't just have to do with race it has to do with your sexual preference it has to do with your story the stories you have in your head about who you are has to do with your your age has to do with your your your social economic structure all the things that you think are definitive about your story and could and can set forth a pathway they are real and they are made they they are they are formed and conformed by the guidelines that you give based on the stories that you have in your head the attention you put into them when i go and watch the Mortal Kombat movie and see you as jacks briggs it's gonna be the trippiest shit of all time it's like if ramdas were an action hero like my brain my brain is gonna break it's just gonna it's gonna it's like you're gonna be like whoa that's the best thing ever thank you so much for being on the show it's my pleasure brother thank you

You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Greetings, pals. Watch out. I just got back from the Ram Dass retreat that happens twice a year in Hawaii. So I'm going to be way too sappy. I'm going to be too. I'm going to attempt to be poetic. And even worse, I'm going to attempt to be spiritual. So get ready to get annoyed with me. But I don't care. It's my podcast, an invisible dark critic who floats out there somewhere in the periphery of this fucking listening audience. I don't know who you are. I don't know where you are. I don't even know if you exist, man. Most people seem to like it when I go on and on about spiritual stuff. But in my mind, there's some dark, arachnid-like creature that sits hunched over his awful web made of piss and fucking bitches about my podcast to himself, which, by the way, might be a little on the self-flattery side. Because who the fuck am I to think that there's actually arachnid beings out there, especially critical arachnid beings out there, that listen to my fucking podcast and talk shit about it? But this retreat really got me. This one, I mean, the people who come to these retreats, they're the sweetest people. You're looking at the entire spectrum of spiritual seekers. We've got folks like Jack Cornfield who maintained a vow of silence for something like a year and a half, no words coming out of his mouth, to people like me who are drinking my ties during Kirtan. But something happens with that mix of people. I don't know what it is. But I have some of my favorite conversations. I meet people that are some of the coolest people that I've ever met, and you run into folks who are experiencing every single possible thing that can happen, just about. There are people who come there with only a few weeks left to live. There are people who come there pregnant. There are people who come there freshly divorced. There are people who go there and get married. And so you get this wonderful combination of various incarnations, but seemingly a shared intention, which isn't so specific. It's like, oh, we all want to be enlightened or some bullshit like that. But I think in this case, the intention is figuring out, is it possible to open your heart? And what does that even mean? It sounds cheesy and embarrassing. It sounds like something you might see on a hallmark card sent to you by an asshole. But it's a real thing. And I know for me, it's a real thing because I, over the course of my lifetime, I'm a fucking master of shutting down. If shutting down were a talent, I would be like one of the top shuttered downers in maybe on the planet, like outside of like hardcore sociopaths. Like I can lock down, I can numb down. When I was younger, when I was a kid, I used to take some weird dark pride in the fact that I didn't really feel much of anything. And that's all a natural reaction, depending on what your incarnation is to your past. Because good God, in heaven, some people get blasted into an insane fucking childhood. And, or during their life, they run into a thing that is so unbearably fucked that they're just like, well, you know what, we're closing down shop. I'm going full robot mode here because I don't wanna deal with the catastrophic heartbreak that comes from my apparently unintended incarnation as a human body in the time space continuum where everybody you know is gonna die. And so this numbs you down. And this is where you run into like the fashionable cynic, the fashionable jaded person, the eye roller, all the different things on the great buffet of sadness. Cause that's one of the forms of sadness. Let me tell you, take your most sardonic, cynical, jaded friend. That is your most hurt friend, guaranteed. Nobody gets that way naturally. How do you know this? Hang out with babies. They are the most open-hearted beings on earth. They don't, they just cry and love you and laugh. And there's no like neurosis in there. They just are open-hearted. Then take like a typical like, I don't know, teenager, who's beginning to really feel the burdensome weight of human identity and having to be a thing and going to fucking high school and wanting to be cool. And you'll find like this a like, really like hyper-cynical personality that emerges as hyper-skeptical personality. Like a person who is in a fake way, hardened themselves based on some nonsense or some person or thing that they've seen that is shut down. Cause shutting down is contagious. And you end up with certain people, they basically invite you to shut down by embarrassing you, making fun of you, raking you against the coals. Anytime you say anything that involves love, joy, bliss, the idea that it's okay to feel, these kinds of things that are basically a result of the heart opening up, which by the way, it's like a chakra right there. It's a real energy center and it's, you know, it just, it hurts for it to be shut down. It's essentially a compass. You know, I read somewhere that there was a time when people used to think that the brain was in the heart. There's neurons in there too, by the way. And so if you're not utilizing your heart because you've numbed down, you're living up in the top floor of the skyscraper, then basically you've got this incredible, God, this is a nerdy way to explain it. It's like having, oh God, I'm sorry. It's like having all of these wonderful modular synthesizers and you're only using one, I'm sorry. Listen, as I, I'm gonna give you a chance to recover from that profound bit of wisdom coming from the DTFH. We're gonna cut to commercial, we'll be right back.

Chessel, chessel, chessel, chessel, chessel. Jack, thank you so much for coming back on the show. My pleasure. I, my first question for you is difficult to ask. Good. Okay, great. Let's get down to it. Okay, good. Get down and then, downer than that. Okay, let's go, we'll go down, down, down. Go full down, yeah, mom. But also, you know, I interviewed someone recently, we were talking a little bit about how with Buddhism in particular, all of us love it, but, you know, people will blaspheme Christianity all day long without even feeling bad, you know, except for Christians, you know, but, you know what I'm saying? It's like cool to blaspheme Christianity. It's the stuff of death metal bands, and as opposed to almost all the world religions, and even other world religions get it. I've never heard anyone blaspheme Taoism, but with Buddhism, we feel, I feel, and many other people feel like it's the one thing you can't touch, don't mess with it. It's, we feel really, I feel superstitious talking about it, and also in the podcast, and forgive me, this is gonna be a long question, and then I'm gonna shut up. But with, anytime I've talked about Buddhism on the podcast with people, and admittedly, I don't know much about it relative to scholars, you, the great teachers, which you are, I will get strangely like, I don't know how to put it, really warning emails from people saying, watch out, don't tell people about that, you're corrupting the Dharma by doing that, you don't understand, you better watch out. And I always get spooked by it. These are people who, in their profiles, they're on robes, and I'm like, oh, I don't wanna mess it up, you know, yet simultaneously. You could be in trouble, dude. Oh, really? I'm not huge. Ah, ah, ah, ah. So, so. But it's good trouble, keep going. Okay, well, here's my question. I'm listening to this wonderful audio book, which is a compilation of Ajahn Chah's teachings. Some of them are to monks. Some of them are for lay people. I believe you did the Ford to it. I'm pretty sure you did. I realized that after I was sufficiently pissed off at one of these lectures that I'd listened to, I'm like, what is this? And then I'm like, Jack did the Ford. This was one of his teachers. He, if you're upset with this person, clearly you must be in the wrong. That's where my brain goes. But here it is. This guy Ajahn Chah, he talks about the human body as stinking. He seems to have a really dark outlook on human existence in particular. And I guess the end of my rope with this audio book, which by the way is a really good audio book if it gets you like where you're driving and you're like, what the hell? I was talking to my wife about it. The end of my rope with the thing was when he said something along the lines of how easy it is to raise a baby. He said something like, they just want a banana. And I'm thinking this is a person who has clearly never raised a baby. And how can a person who seems so distant from the day to day human experience that is supporting the monastic order? How can someone like that actually purely see already birds are screeching at me to stop? How can someone like that purely transmit the Dharma truth if they haven't, you know, this is the, we flew here with a baby, it wasn't disastrous. But I remember thinking, what if the Buddha had flown with a baby? What would the teaching remain the same? And this is so my question is, how do we deal with this? Some of these great teachers, they never had a family in the way that we do. They never had a baby. They never had these experiences. How can someone like that? How do they have the right to talk to us in a way as though what we're doing is somehow hierarchically lower? Isn't that a corruption of the Dharma? Corruption, it's always had a corrupted side because the bigger the front, the bigger the back, they sometimes say, or everything casts a shadow when you shine light on it. So here we are, we're starting your podcast and you're talking to me as a former monk with Ajahn Chah and a lay teacher. And you're kind of looking at this and you've been inspired by Buddha, but at the same time you're listening to say, you know, a lot of great stuff in this, but there's some BS in this shit too. And how some of it doesn't smell good. What do I do about that? Yes. Right? I thought Buddhism was all good. Yes. Tell me something that's all good, baby. Give me an example. Okay, color. Color? Yeah, color. And I'm stealing that from Chogyam Trumpa. He was saying, you know, look at color is this elemental thing. You know, color can upset you if you ask for someone to paint your wall of color and it's the wrong color, but you can't really get upset with color. It's perfect. It's... Well, that's your mind, whether you're upset with it or not. But what makes it good? I said, you know, you're looking for something to be all good. Yeah. What's all good? I mean, I don't even know. I never asked that question quite in that way, but this is what I'm hearing, my friend. There's a kind of idealism in your question, which we all have. We start and we say, well, somebody out there must have the answer. And when they have the answer, it's all good, right? Yes, that's right. That's sort of like a kid on a good day and they're very little thinking their parents know everything and they're all good until they get frustrated and then they hate their parents and they're, you know, they're all bad. And it takes a while for that child to finally develop what in psychoanalysis is called ambivalence. Now, ambivalence in this psychoanalytic meaning, it doesn't mean that you're not sure whether you love your parents or not. What it means is that you can hold the opposites, that you realize that on a certain day, your parents are pretty cool on another's case. They're stupid, blinded, not mean, bit you've been bad moods do. And then you start to realize, oh, as Whitman said, we are large, we contain multitudes. And you start to see that. So the same thing happens as you grow up spiritually. Now, Buddhism has a good rap. And I think it has a good rap because it has really, really good teachings. There's a book that was published last year called Why Buddhism Is True. That was a big best seller. I didn't blurb it because I was kind of put off by the title because you could also say, why Buddhism isn't true and that would be a whole other volume too, right? So it seemed like it was a little excessive. But nevertheless, we love it because there are a few things because it doesn't require you to believe a lot, even though you bring your crazy belief systems to it. But it's the Buddha says, no, test it out for yourself. See for yourself, what's good, do that, what's not beneficial, what isn't helpful to you and others, then discard that, even if the Buddha said it's not valuable, trash it, dump it, all right. So we like that. Maybe because we're these hyper-individualists in the Western culture, we like to think I can find out for myself and all of that. But nevertheless, having been brainwashed by so many systems, by the monotheistic systems of Islam or Christianity or Judaism or science or whatever it is, the Latter-day Saints or the Latter-day Physicists, it doesn't matter. It's like, okay, you can actually look for yourself. So we like that. Also, it offers practices rather than belief. It says, if you want to live a life that's awake or liberated or free, here's how you do it. Here's the eight steps to it. Or it teaches ways that you open the heart. It doesn't just say, be loving like, you know, whatever their particular version of deity is. Here's a practice where you can learn compassion. You start step by step and you become more and more compassionate. So it's cool. It's got all these good things. Yes. And we need them. In fact, we desperately need them right now because the world is a mess, an effing mess, at least, if not worse. I don't know why that's a swear word. It's actually a really kind of fun and wonderful activity. Why should we use it as a swear, you know? I mean, we should maybe swear saying it's a celibate mess, right? It's a mess that people have like lost the fun of life. But anyway, it is. But the thing that's really clear, Duncan, is that no amount of outer development, computers, internet, nanotechnology, space technology, biotechnology, all the amazing things where you have, you know, your cell phone in your pocket and it has the great library of Alexandria and, you know, three and a half million cat videos or whatever is gonna stop us from continuing warfare, continuing racism, continuing climate destruction, continuing tribalism, because all those are rooted in the human heart, in the mind. Who is your enemy? Mind is your enemy. No one can harm you more than your own mind untrained. Who is your friend, says the Buddha. Mind or heart is your friend. No one can help you more than your own heart. Mind, it's one word, jitta and Sanskrit, than your own heart and mind, awakened or trained, not even the most loving family member or friend. All right, so the thing that Buddhism at its core teaches is how to understand your own mind and heart and how to transform it, awaken it, bring yourself to live in a more liberated way. Blah, blah, blah, blah. I'm doing a kind of infomercial here about why we like it. I love it. Now there are things not to like about it as well. People may have read, for example, that in these Buddhist countries, and those who are monks who don't have any hair to tear out, would otherwise be tearing their hair out, that there are fundamentalist Buddhist monks who are saying, kill the Tamils, kill the Muslims, kill the Hindus in Sri Lanka or kill the Rohingya or kill the Muslims in Burma and things like, wait a second, you're a monk, you're supposed to be teaching peace. I went to Burma. I brought this beautiful book we translated to Burmese, The Buddhist Teachings on Mutual Respect and Social Harmony by one of the greatest scholars in the world. I went to these temples and I said, here's what the Buddha taught. He didn't say like, protect the religion and go kill Muslims or who you think. Did they listen? Some listened, some didn't. So then you start to get disappointed, but I was disappointed early on. I actually had a very, very, very helpful disappointment. And if you've never been spiritually disappointed, then you obviously have never done any spiritual practice. Because the first person you get disappointed with is you know who, right? You say, okay, I'm gonna train my mind and make it quiet and open my heart. And your mind goes, are you kidding me? And it goes crazy, right? Because of Mara who attacked Buddha under the Bodhi tree, the night of enlightenment, the great Buddhist myth and the Buddhist sitting there or archetypally, I will not get up until I freed myself and awaken. And then Mara appears and Mara comes in all these forms. Mara comes in the form of desire, the most beautiful sensual desire. You know, do you want the most beautiful dakinis and women or the most beautiful thing? I mean, in those days it was the golden chariot. Now it would be, you know, Lamborghini and, you know, okay. What do you want? We can give you anything. Get off your seat. The world has, is your oyster, baby. We got something really good for you. Why would you be sitting here, like gazing at your navel when you could have, when you could taste the tastes of the world, when you could have the pleasures of the world? And the Buddha says, yeah, thank you. I've been there, done that, tried that. Basically what he says is, oh, I see you Mara. This is Mara who's in India is the archetypal God of disruption, of desire, of fear. Is there, I've heard various descriptions of Mara, what it means. Is it synonymous with Satan? I've heard that's a misunderstanding. Satan, you know, there's a whole theological thing about who Satan is, fallen angel and stuff. I don't know that you can make equivalence from that. But he holds some of those roles, the role of temptation, the role of unconsciousness, all of this, a lot of the things. He and Satan at least are in, you know, the same industry. Let's put it that way, okay. So then the Buddha says, I see you Mara. I've tried all that. And the cool thing is that he was a householder and he had his pleasure palaces and he had all these, you know, orgies and all these feasts and all, you know. He had a harem. He had a harem and he had not only that, you know, and he was trained in all the great arts and he had all the beauties of the world. And a harem. And a harem. And you keep mentioning that. And he had a harem as well. Although I personally have to say that having maybe, I mean, one wife is already quite a lot. It has to be, but, you know, I mean, we all have. Yeah, when you're asking, you're the first person that gets disappointed, it's your wife. So then Mara comes back and Mara comes back in the form of aggression. The armies of Mara come and say, all right, if I can't tempt you by my daughters, the most beautiful daughters in the world, the most beautiful temptations, then I'm gonna unseat you in another way and all the armies of Mara come of anger and violence and attack the Buddha. Right. And when you see the paintings that are done of the Buddha seated under the Bodhi tree, looking so peaceful, and you see the armies of Mara shooting, flaming arrows and spears and all of the weapons of that time. And the Buddha has one hand raised in this very delicate gesture where his thumb and his forefinger touch and make a circle and he reaches out and you see him touch one of the flaming arrows or the spears and it turns into flower petals and falls at his feet. And he does that by not getting angry about the aggression and all the hatred, but by touching it with love and saying, oh yeah, this is painful, touching with compassion, touching it with his heart. There's a little red line that goes from his heart up through his chest and out his arm to his fingers. And when he touches it with love, the aggression melts and turns into flower petals. Finally, Mara comes and says, dude, what right do you think you have? Who the hell do you think you are, basically? To sit on the seat and think you can get enlightened like you think you're special. Isn't that like another big ego trip? Why don't you get off it and be a regular human being? Come on, who do you, what do you think you're doing? What right? And the Buddha pauses according to the myth as we could pause when we have self-doubt of all kinds, which will come. And he reaches down and touches the earth and a lot of the Buddha images, the statues that you see have one hand reaching down like it's touching the ground. And he calls upon the goddess of the earth to bear witness to the fact that he's lived a hundred thousand maha culpants of lifetimes, practicing patience, compassion, love, generosity, steadiness, integrity, truthfulness, over and over and over again, and that he has a right to sit on the seat and awaken. And I love this moment because it's, he did all these years of wild austerities and meditations and in the end, he can't do it himself. He has to call on the feminine. He calls on the goddess of the earth or so and say, you gotta help me, baby. Cause I can't just do it under my own steam. I can't do it as a guy. We're gonna trans, you know, we're gonna win the Super Bowl, right or whatever, the spiritual Super Bowl or the war or whatever it is. But in fact, at the moment of the final moment of being attacked by Mara, the Buddha reaches down and asks the goddess herself, the goddess, the infinite goddess, to say, you have a right to be here and you have a good heart. This is what's true of you and you have a right to awaken. And then Mara says, oh no, I've been defeated and slinks away and the Buddha gets quieter and quieter and opens himself and then in the story, as the last star in the sky, the morning star is about to fade. He looks out on the world with the eyes of infinite compassion and he sees he's nothing in everything and his heart is free. That's the story. Jesus, that's beautiful. That is beautiful. I didn't know, I did not, this has always been a mysterious part of the story to me, the touching the earth. I never attributed it to the feminine. I never attributed it to reaching out to the feminine. And that is, to me, heartbreakingly beautiful in that the earth is just... Well, it happens in another really critical point in the Buddha's enlightenment. And then I'll get back to your question about your spiritual disappointment. Don't get back to that. And you are a disappointment. I know that's true. But then again, we're all disappointed. So okay, so I'll get back to that. But in the myth or the archetypal story of the Buddha's life, everybody who's looked into it even a little bit has heard the story. He was a prince, he had the palaces and he was supposed to become a king. And then after years with the harem and the prince thing and stuff, he got bored. Okay, there gotta be something more than this. And he was taken out by his charioteer. He was protected for all those years. And then he had the vision, the sights of the four heavenly messengers which he'd been protected from. And he saw first a sick person, really sick. And he said to the charioteer, who does that happen to? And the charioteer said, well, actually everybody pretty much Buddha had to reflect a little bit. Whoa, I've had such a good life. Uh-oh. Then he saw a really old person, like, you know, tottering with broken limbs and just barely able to move and no teeth and shaking. And he said, well, who does that happen to? And the charioteer said, well, everyone, if they're lucky, if they live long enough, they would have said, okay, all right, whoa, well, this is our fate, huh? And then he saw a corpse for the first time. And you can remember this, Duncan, I'm sure the first time you saw a dead body, it's like your eyes kind of fly open and you go, whoa. Right, holy shit, this actually happens. And not only does it happen, but it's gonna happen to you know who, as well as that person. And he said, who does this happen to? And the charioteer said, why? Everyone, of course. And then the fourth heavenly messenger, when they were out riding, the Buddha saw in the distance along the edge of the forest, walking with great peacefulness and serenity, a yogi wearing an orange robe with shaven head and a bowl. He said, who's that? He said, this is someone who's renounced the desires of the world, the grasping of the world to find the highest truth, to find liberation before they die, to find liberation. So then after that, the Buddha renounces, he sneaks out of the palace, he cuts off his hair, he sends his horse back, and he becomes a wandering mendicant and being a young man. Young men like to say, is there anything dangerous to do around here? It's like you wanna test yourself. All right, let me show you my chops. Let me show you what I got. In the Masai, you'd be sent out as a young man with a spear to go and, you know, kill a lion and bring it back. And then the tribal people and your people would come and say, this young man is now a man. He's not a boy. And there are initiations for women that are the same, powerful initiations among the Maya, you know, in the Central America, incredible initiations for women. But anyway, so the Buddha takes on the most difficult ascetic practices of the time. May I press pause on this for a moment? Yeah. I'm sorry to cut you off. But this, before we skip over something, I can't think of a better person to address it. It goes back to my original question. I have tried to do revision on this thing. But let's just face it. He's a, on paper, that's a deadbeat dad. Oh, right. Cause I didn't say that his wife had a baby and then he walked out. Right. Yeah, let's not forget that what happened is. But he did negotiate with a couple of lawyers and make sure that there was the king and the queen and so forth, that there was like good child support while he ditched his wife and his kid. What happened to the Buddha's kid? But he's a deadbeat dad. You're absolutely right. I'm with you. What happened to his kid? Oh, his kid grew up. When his kid was seven years old, the Buddha goes back. Oh. His wife says, like, where the hell have you been? She's very upset with him, as you could imagine. Seven years, that's everything. Yeah, seven years. Just think about it, seven years. He comes back, he gives teachings. Everyone goes, oh, he's so wise, he's so good. He said, I had to leave in order to find these teachings to liberate the hearts of human beings and beings everywhere. Right. And now I've come back to liberate you and he teaches his parents, who at first think he's nuts. Yep. And he has to do miracles. But that's it. It's like when Ramda says, if you think you're enlightened, go spend a week with your family, right? Because they know who you really are, or at least who you were as a kid. So he teaches his parents, he teaches his wife, or his ex, and she becomes a nun. And he teaches his, he says to his son, now come, I will be the father that you have needed. And his young son becomes a novice, becomes a little novice monk. This episode is sponsored by Blue Chew.

Loves, I would not promote something on this podcast that I hadn't tried when I was approached by the Boner Warlocks over at Blue Chew. I, you know, hesitated. You know, I thought to myself, do you wanna do that commercial for that kind of thing? And then I thought, what? Am I erection adverse? Am I somebody who is not gonna admit the fact that if not for a hard cock, I wouldn't exist. You know, everyone, Carl Sagan spends all day yapping about the Big Bang, Neil deGrasse Tyson, the Big Fuckin' Bang. All these physicists are talking about the Big Bang. What about the Big Boner? Look, we live in a boner adverse culture. Let's just admit it. We live in a sex adverse culture. It's weird. People already feel weird about it. That's why Blue Chew's awesome.

So if you're in some kind of hurry, which I don't know, maybe it is time to start meditating if you find yourself in a boner hurry, but I don't know what you do. Maybe you're somebody who only has like 20 minutes at the airport and you need an erection. Whatever your reason may be, I tried them out and they work.

And there are some scholars who say this is all made up later. I'm not sure that's true. I think they're just trying to put a little gloss on something that's too painful to acknowledge. The way I tried to do it was, okay, back then was having a son and that was a big deal. All right, you fulfilled your karma. You gave the king and queen a grandchild, a son and your wife. And leaving was sad. Leaving was, you did, and they had enough, they had alimony, they had whatever they needed, they took care of it. Right. But again, no matter what, you tell this to a mother, and they get to that part, and most mothers have encountered like, what kind of religion is that? What kind of man is that? Yeah, exactly. That you would do that. Well, religion has a lot of really weird images. I mean, think about having your main religious symbol as somebody who's being tortured on a cross. Okay, that's like your happy religious. People go all around wearing an instrument of torture without any commentary on the religion itself. That's a pretty weird symbol for, it's a symbol of transcendence. That's right. And in a certain way, this is a story of transcendence. It's a story that says you're in your ordinary life, even if it's a glorious ordinary life with, you know, king and queen father and mother and harem and prince and stuff like that and a young child, but there's something bigger that you have to find of who you really are. This, what you're saying I've heard as a methodology for interpreting all the antiquated stories, and which is- We hope. We hope, but if you, regardless of the historic, whether it happened or not, with Christianity, with Buddhism, I don't know as much about Islam, but with these two at least, I have a little bit of experience with them. If you look at them as a psychological process, which is you are in some kind of palace. There is some kind of thing you're living in that you imagine is that's keeping you from reality. That's how I've thought of it. It's like, okay, he's actually leaving the comfort zone that people are invited to leave by any bona fide, great religious tradition. Is that a fair interpretation of it? It's a healthy interpretation of it. I mean, if you take these religious myths completely, literally, because there's a part of a Buddhist myth that the Buddha was born out of his mother's side or her armpit or something like that, I ain't seen it. I don't think it's how it happens. Any more than virgin births happen. But they have a very deep meaning. There's something about a virgin birth if you understand it in a different way, which is the original purity of it being. Instead of original sin, and Buddhism has it quite explicitly, is original goodness. And you can see it in a child, yes, where they get hungry or cranky when they don't get their way. But there is a child of the spirit that was born in there with such wonder and innocence and beauty. And that's really what it speaks of, that we come to this world, virginally, if you will, not tainted by all the culture and the fears and the language itself. And so it's not only appropriate to look at these stories as myths rather than as literal, but it's the only thing that makes sense. Right. And that's not blasphemous to do. That's not something that is- Well, the blasphemy, all right. So if we look up the definition of blasphemy, which I did a moment ago while we were preparing for this, let me see if I can find it again. And it says, blasphemy, the act of insulting or showing contempt or lack of reverence to a deity or sacred objects or toward something considered sacred or inviolable. Some religions consider blasphemy to be a religious crime. Right. So all right, so now we have a definition of blasphemy that you are disparaging something that's sacred. What's sacred? If you say, you have to believe every word that's written in this sacred text as it is. And if you say anything other than that, it's blasphemy, because this is the word of the divine, whatever that sacred text is, you could be in a lot of trouble. Yes. You know? I could. You could, okay. Methuselah lived 900 years, okay. And his wife got pregnant at age 850 or whatever she was. I mean, we're doing really good with IVF and there are now women who are giving birth at like 60 years old, but ain't seen nobody at 865 years have a baby. Or do anything other than mold her. Perhaps to someone it would be blasphemy for you to say, that's not a literal story. That's a story about that teaches that it's possible someone who's been barren in their life as I recall that story in some way can have a new birth even in their old age. There's something new that can come to them. And it comes in a way from a spiritual awakening because it happens because they love God or whatever it is in that story. So you have a choice. You can either interpret things literally in which case almost anything that you would have to say about it other than saying, yes, it's all true would be blasphemy. Or you can say, these are the great human stories. And they point to something as you would say that in our own human heart. I had a friend, we're just riffing, right? We'll get back. I can feel the thread. It's gonna come back around. Don't worry about it. But anyway, excuse me for being sniffly today. No problem. Those of you who are listening, please get me a tissue. Thank you. Do you want me to get your tissue? Anyway, I have one. So a friend of mine, Dr. Roger Walsh, MD, PhD had been on the faculty of Stanford Medical School, very smart guy who's been a whole series of books and done a tremendous amount of meditation in every tradition, insight and, you know, Vipassana and Tibetan meditation and Zen practice and shamanic practice and mystical Christian, all these things, he's interested in it. So Roger sat down one day, scholar that he is, along with practitioner and said, I'm gonna read the Encyclopedia of World Religions from a Hora Mazda all the way to the last volume of Zoroaster, right? And it's like a number of volumes, it's a big read. Yeah, I bet. He wanted to understand it. I said, so Roger, what did you learn? And he said, the main thing that I learned is that life in this world is a mystery, the vastness of the universe, the existence of the sun, the existence of consciousness, a mystery. And each of these religions has a story about how it started, about who we are in some way, about what happens before life or after death. And he said, basically each one of these religions is a group of human beings placing a story on the mystery. Wow. Now the depth of the Buddhist teaching, when he holds up a flower to teach, you know, his first Zen disciple, Mahakasipa, the wordless transmission is not to use words, but to hold up this lotus flower with its muddy roots and its pure, beautiful white flower, and say, do you get it? Without any words at all, do you? Wordlessly, can you see the mystery that out of the mud comes beauty, that they're intertwined, that we're everything, all of us together? But he doesn't use words for that. He says, here's the teaching, and he holds up this flower. So now we're ending our way back to Mara and the Buddha under the Tree of Enlightenment, where you paused me for a moment, as I recall. Yes. And the goddess came, and I said, there was another really important point where the feminine comes in, and this is, I was telling the story of how the Buddha left home, and he became this kick-ass ascetic who fasted so that, as it said, when he touched his belly button, he would touch his spinal cord. He was so skinny, he was eating a few grains of rice a day. Look this up, y'all, the starving Buddha, there's statues that are scary. Yes, starving Buddha and lying on beds of nails and being out in the sun and staring at the sun in the middle of the day, all those things, trying to beat his ego and his mind into submission. Yeah. And it didn't work, because what he found was that the person who was trying to get enlightened in that way was still there, trying to be something. So it was sort of like that ego that says, now I'm gonna do those intense ascetic practices, and I'm gonna triumph. That didn't really get him where he needed to go, which was the freedom of the heart. So finally, as the story goes, he was wandering and he sat by a river, a beautiful river, and he had a memory of being in his father's garden. This whole part is really beautiful. We never heard this. He had a memory of being in his father's garden at seven years old for the spring plowing festival. And he was seated under a rose apple tree, and watched his father and the court prepare and then the bullocks draw the plow across the field with his great sense of stillness and contentment and then closed his eyes. And when he did, he felt this enormous sense of wellbeing that opened up into the joy of a totally quiet, beautiful state of inner peace that later is talked about as Samadhi and Jhana. There's different words for it, but it was the spontaneous stillness of heart that children can have on occasion. So there he was sitting by the river and he realized, okay, I've almost died doing seven years of these ascetic practices, six or seven years, ain't got me where I wanted to go. Maybe I'm going the wrong direction. He remembered this moment of the original purity and he said, maybe the solution is not to grasp after enlightenment and try so hard. Maybe there's a middle path where I neither beat my body into submission, which hasn't been working, nor go back to the harem and the feast. Maybe there's some other way of being still in the midst of it all and finding a freedom that isn't rejecting the world, nor is it grasping after the world. And when he had that revelation, as the story is told, he realized that he had to change his path and who should be wandering by? But a young woman named Sujata, I believe was her name, which means good birth or good karma, I mean this way, birth of good karma. And she was carrying milk rice, a kind of beautiful sweet porridge. And she saw him and she made an offering of it into a little bowl for him. And it's the first time he'd taken anything sweet in six or seven years of this wild austerity. She gave it to him in this bowl and in a way she was the second important incarnation of the feminine because he again had been trying to do it with will and then finally he remembered as a child, no, there's another way, there's a goodness and purity that's borne in us that I don't have to make, that's who I am. And I have to find another way which is neither rejecting nor grasping. And then the goddess appears and says, yes, let me nourish you now that you've found this way, now that you've discovered. And he took the milk rice and then as the story is told in one version, he took the little bowl down to the river and placed it in the water and he said, if I found the right way, now I'll place this bowl in the water and instead of going downstream, it will float upstream and it did, which is a very unusual thing. Which again, we can look at these archetypally. It, you know, the phrase is against the stream. There's the stream of desires and fears and the ordinary life that we live. And there's a way of turning instead of following all that, turning back to say, well, who am I really? What is freedom that is not following that stream but seeking something deeper? Okay, I love that you're bringing this up because it has been mysterious to me. I've heard this. Against the stream thing for a long time. In titles in Buddhism, like stream-enterer. That's a whole other thing. We'll get to stream-enterer. That's a whole other thing. That's different from this. That's different. This was just realizing that he couldn't follow the ordinary program, you know, get through high school, go to junior college, go to college, get a job, you know, get married, buy a, you know, Chevy, whatever. He was gonna have to go off the map. He realized that he couldn't go in the ordinary way. And he'd already realized it, but the against the stream, it kind of cemented in him this understanding that he had to follow something that was different. But this is, to me, so... We're getting close to answering your original question, right? Okay, great. It's fabulous. It's amazing and really beautiful. I just said, I'm sorry, I've never heard these two. In Buddhism, these get left out. The ladies get... So we need the ladies get... And the truth is that if you look in the tradition of Zan or Theravada, all the stories almost with a few very rare exceptions are about practitioners with penises. Yes. And it turns out there are killer, great yoginis and practitioners in all these traditions. They weren't written down. So there's some rare oral tradition and there's some from the time of the Buddha. There were nuns and some beautiful stories that Terigata, but mostly of the thousand years, 2,600 years, they've been erased. And yet they were there from the beginning. And in fact, you can't get enlightened without the goddess of the earth saying, yes, I hold, protect you. You were showing you the way without the goddess coming by and saying, you need to take nourishment. You can't just fight against yourself. You need both of them. Anyway. But this is an imbalance. You're identifying a real... Well, it's... Buddhism has been insanely patriarchal. And all you have to do is go to these Buddhist countries and see the monks are treated like princes. You know, the nuns get like the scraps from the table. This is the answer to the... This is... Okay, so now we're wending our way back to your big question at the beginning, your disappointment in some way. And what I'm doing is further disillusioning you, but at the same time, what I'm trying to do is giving you, is open you to a bigger picture and a bigger perspective. So now we go back to Buddha and Mara under the Bodhi tree. And there he says, I see you Mara and he doesn't get lost in the desires and he doesn't fight against the aggression and take it, identify with you. Just, oh, that's anger and that's hate and that's aggression. He touches it all with love. And then doubt comes and he touches the earth. And the goddess of the earth says, oh, you were right to be here. We all do. We're all born with Buddha nature. And then he has his awakening. Now following that, he sits very quietly there for I don't know how many days the myth goes. And then he casts his eye out across the world and he sees that there's many beings who are suffering. And some with but little dust in their eyes and he realizes that he could by teaching that the miracle of communion that we have with one another, he could wander the world and the delight and the joy and the liberation that he's experienced. He could show, tell, demonstrate to others and they would share in it. And the great heart of compassion that is awakened as part of his enlightenment motivates him to get up and walk for 45 years to the dusty roads of India. Now, he mostly did really, really great things. No question about it. He was bum all the stories extraordinary. Yes. And when the women came and said, we want you to ordain us and let us be like monks. He resisted that. He still had his patriarchal conditioning going in some way. And it was only when his own aunt first came and said, listen, I was the one who wet nursed you after your mother died. You grew up on my milk. You have to let us. And then Ananda, his cousin, his closest disciple, the one who took care of him, came and begged the Buddha. He said, you have to, these women, Ananda did a cool thing actually. He said, I have a question to ask you, which he asked three times and the Buddha can't refuse the third time of the question. He said, here is the question. Are women just as men are? Are women capable of getting enlightened? And the Buddha, having to answer truthfully, said, yes, they are. And Ananda said, you have now said it. Now you have to ordain them. And he did. Anyway, so now- Why did he not want to say that? What is going on with this? Because of conditioning. Okay. Culture. Who knows what was in his mind? We don't know. And this is all an archetypal story. Maybe he was afraid that if they were renunciates, they would be molested or raped. They weren't there in the household compound. Maybe he was afraid that somehow they would tempt all the monks and everybody would disrobe and go have a big party. Who knows what he was thinking? We weren't there at the time, but it didn't look good. We'll just say that. Still doesn't. And it still don't look that good. That is correct. All right, so now your question from the very beginning was about blasphemy about Buddhism. You don't want to say anything bad about it. That's a piece of it. The other piece was how can someone, and you're answering it. But it's the way you're answering it. I love it because I think it's just an invitation to deal with the fact that if you're trying to find some perfect religion on this planet. Good luck. You better start making one. So right, so you go to Sri Lanka and some, not all of them, there are beautiful, wonderful monks and nuns, but then some of them are encouraging violence or Burma, encouraging hatred. So when I was a young monk, Yes. I had first, the wisest teacher I've ever had in many ways, which was this teacher Ajahn Chah, and I spent some time in the forest monastery with him, learning. And then I went off because I'd heard there's really killer intense meditation training from Mahasi Saito and Burma. You have all these experiences and things that I'd read about in the Zen books and things. And I wanted them, you know, I was 23 or whatever. So I went and I did a 500 day silent retreat, sitting and walking, you know, for 16, 18 hours a day for 500 days. That is crazy. And the only person that you talk to on the retreat as a teacher every couple of days, you'd go and have five or 10 minutes and the teacher would say what's happening in your meditation, give you some instruction. So I started to meditate really intensively and although it was difficult, after some weeks or longer, cool things started to happen. My body filled with light and dissolved into light and you know, waves of bliss or rapture or joy, visions, images, all the kind of stuff that you read about and more. Yes. Not all at once, but in a, you know, and then insights about the way things happen and the emptiness of the world and, you know, phenomena and all the kinds of stuff. Meanwhile, the teacher, the sayadaw, this particular sayadaw means teacher, he was not a very nice guy. He was kind of a mean tempered, bit of a bastard. So I would look, I was given a really nice cottage and I could see his in the distance in this particular monastery. And sometimes he'd be out just kind of schmoozing with the prettiest young nuns and eventually apparently he had an affair with one of them. Sometimes he would be out, you know, yelling at people because they weren't doing what he wanted or throwing rocks at the dogs that came in his garden because they were gonna mess up his flowers or something, you know, smoking his Burmese cigar and belching. And I thought, okay. I'm learning from this dude. Ah Jin Chao was this like model teacher. But then I would go and see him and I'd say this is happening in meditation and he would give me exquisitely detailed and skilled instructions. Do this, invite that, turn your attention there and all these cool things would happen or I would, you know, work through things that were difficult. And I had to realize that I could take the very good teachings that he had without imitating the teacher. Right. And so we tend to wanna bring our idealism to everything that's good and Buddhism. Okay, we can't blaspheme it because, yes, but because it's all good. But it's not all good if you look at the teachers and all you have to do, you know, because I'm in the industry. So I know swamis and llamas and mamas and gurus and reverends and whatever, many are good, but there's a whole bunch of them that have messed up. Right. You know, me too is not just the movie directors and the athletes, but there's Zen masters and swamis and mamas and llamas as well. All of whom have messed up, right? And so you start to see, okay, now this is the ambulance that I was talking about where a child begins to realize that their parents aren't all good or all bad, depending if they fulfill their wishes or not. And you start to see them a little bit more as the complexity of a human being, which Buddhist over these thousands of years and people, you know, has complexity in it too. It has beautiful, amazing teachings. But at the same time, it has things that either aren't good, as I described, or that aren't right for you. And so let's talk about Ajahn Chah. You had a question about monks and family and stuff like that and babies. He clearly doesn't understand. Give me that question. The question again is this, the summary is, one of the things he said is having a little baby's easy. All you have to do is give it a banana from time to time. This was, I mean, again, I have to say, the preface that I think you wrote, you were involved in this somehow, was a lot of these teachings are for monks. They aren't for- That is correct. Right, so don't forget- This is a sales pitch. He was a quite non-dual teacher. In many ways, what I mean is that he would talk about stepping out of good and bad, of resting in the pure loving awareness that's your true nature, which he called the one who knows puru, when you can be the witness to all things, then the heart is liberated. All those really beautiful non-dual teachings that you find in Zen or Zogchen or non-dual Christian teachings or whatever. But then on certain days, he would say being a monk is better than being a layperson. I see that. Or to monks, women will be your downfall. And stuff like that. And I go, wait a second, is this the same dude who's giving these beautiful non-dual teachings? What is this about? Yes. Is he just hypocritical? Is it just his cultural conditioning? I don't think it's only that. There is cultural conditioning. And there's problems with that for sure. And that a lineage of conditioning that projects danger onto women as if they're the danger, rather than men having to actually deal with their own greed and desire and all of that. But what I think is true is if he'd said, be a monk, be a layperson, they're really equal, have his monks would have left. They would leave. But he had to say, no, this is better. And he believed it. He wasn't just lying about it. He believed that if you dedicated your life in that way to liberation and not to just open a stall in the marketplace or getting a career in business or whatever it is, that you were more likely to find freedom. He did believe that, whether it was for a monk or a nun. But part of it was advertising. Do you believe that? Do I believe what? Let's get it clear. You're more likely to find freedom as a monk than as a layperson. I think it's a false question. You're more likely to find freedom, depending on your level of dedication and intention. I've seen a lot of monks who are not all that dedicated and they're not all ain't that free. And I've seen some laypeople who really wanna know, who am I? What is this? How do I live with freedom? And maybe because they're in difficult circumstances. And I mean, I think having a kid is like having to live in Zen master. At the Zen temple, you have to get up really early in the morning, you stay up late at night, you do long hours of sitting, you have to work in the kitchen and so forth. But if you get sick, you can go lie down and rest, right? But if you have a sick kid crying there, you can't say, I'm sorry, somebody else take care of that. You have to get up. Your Zen master is saying, get the hell out of bed and 10 your child. And there's something so intense about the surrender needed to be a good parent and a caring parent. It's not enlightening in itself, although it does mature us and you see it in all these ways. But a lot of the things that teach in the monastic life, patience, endurance, selflessness, dedication, compassion, steadiness, equanimity, you learn as a parent. And they're here as well. So then you have these teachers. I mean, we also projected on them. I had, there was this Tibetan lama who had moved to Switzerland. He was living in the mountains and he had a bunch of disciples. Some of them also came to teachings I was doing. And there was this woman who was quite pregnant. And she said, I went to see Hutsi Tutsi Rinpoche, whatever his name was, something or other Rinpoche. And I asked him about childbirth and he gave me these instructions. Now it turns out, and somebody else in that community had gone and asked Rinpoche about relationships. He'd never been married. He'd never had a kid. And what he told her was some stuff he'd heard from the old wives in the village before he'd gone in the monastery. He knew nothing about childbirth. He'd never been there. He'd never seen it. But he was giving sort of the old Tibetan, this is what they say in the village. Is that where you wanna go and get your instruction? No, there's this halo effect. You think, well, he's supposed to be enlightened. He must know everything about how you birthed a child. Complete nonsense. I got you. I think I'm getting it here, which is, it's- You are slow, but I'm- I am slow! I'm messing with your child. I am, I like being slow. It's the, well, no I don't. I'd love to be enlightened. But it's, I think what you're talking about, there's two things that are really resonating with me. One, you really did detect a naive idealism in me regarding it. Yeah, and longing for that, which is a beautiful thing. To find something that's so pure, but it's, I remember going to Jun Chao one day, I'm interrupting you. I don't mind. Because he was sitting there and he was like picking the dead skin off his feet. I do that all the time. And I thought, he's sitting there. And I thought, now, how mindful is he? Because he was talking to somebody while he was picking the dead skin off his feet. When we walked barefoot to go our arms around stuff. I thought, is this guy really mindful? And then I saw him say something to one person. And I saw him say something the opposite to a different person. And I thought, wait a second, he's not even consistent. Maybe he's not even honest. And so I said, hey, you know, Westerners are no shame. I mean, we just, you know, the people around Jun Chao from Thailand and Laos were so reverential. And I said, listen, I said, I've been watching you. And sometimes you don't seem that enlightened to me. Well, you know, you say one thing, then you say the opposite to another, you know, you don't look so mindful. A laughed, he thought it was the greatest thing that someone would say that to him. And I said, why is that so funny? And he said, it's a great moment for you. Because if I fit your model of the perfect teacher, you'd still be in the illusion that you can find the Buddha out here somewhere. And he's not out here. Oh, wow. Ah, man, we can't top that. Jack, right before you said that, I was about to say, well, you seem enlightened to me, but now I feel like I'm insulting you if I say that. So you do though. And you are one of my favorite teachers. I don't know how you do the magic trick every time. I was certain this particular question I was bringing to you, you weren't gonna be able to turn it. And yet you have somehow. Thank you. I feel like you've given me permission to be disappointed in Buddhism. Well, hallelujah. That's pretty great. I think that's, there must be a Buddhist word for hallelujah that's the equivalent of it. Yeah. What I've given you is the permission to be real, to trust yourself. If you're a teacher, what you want in a student is dedication, somebody who's actually willing to look, to do, to practice, to do whatever it is, and common sense. Right. That's all, to see what's true. And that takes you really far. Wow. Thank you so much, Jack. Is this it? This is it, we did an hour. Oh my God, I thought we just started. We have to do it again. We have to meet again. I would love that. When shall we three meet again? The witches say, when shall we two meet again? Well, you know, the funny thing is, I realized if we live in the same city, I was telling Aaron, well, I'm gonna say, before we came to the retreat, I'm like, you've gotta listen to Jack and Trudy. These are my favorite teachers. They're just incredible. We're so lucky to get to see them. And then I remember, y'all are at Inside LA. You live in LA, you're up in San Francisco. It's not like you live on the other side of the planet for me, and that's pretty cool. Yes, we should do that. The other thing is that I've got all kinds of stuff online, jackcornfield.com. And I have a wonderful teacher training for people who are really crazy or inspired or both, who wanna learn how to teach mindfulness meditation to other people. When did you start doing that? I didn't know you did that. In the last few years, and we've had a couple thousand people from 46 countries do this training, and it's really fun to work with people in this. Where do you do it? Well, we did some of it live, not a lot of it live, little bits of it, and most of it's online where you get mentors and teachers that work with you personally for the course of a couple of years. It's quite fun. Couple of years. Yeah, well, that's a little training, really. Well, I know, I'm saying like a couple of years of somebody who was quiet for how long again? 400 days, did you say? 500. 500 days. Who's counting, right? Okay, now. A little X is like you're in your prison cell, one more, one more day. That's a long time. Now, this is the, thank you so much, Jack. All the links you need to find, JackCornField are gonna be at duckatrustle.com. Thank you, I really appreciate it. My pleasure. May I just throw one thing out? Here's a bonus question. I don't know why I- I thought you'd have some hard questions. This was like- I'll give me a break. I, this is to me- Like death or something, come on, next time. Listen, I'll tell you, dying is a lot easier than dealing with the fact that some aspects of Buddhism that you thought weren't that great might not be that great instead of just realizing you were wrong or that Buddhism was, I was wrong. I would rather be wrong is what I'm saying. I would rather be wrong and Buddhism be perfect than to find out, oh no, actually your instincts might be right and there's pieces- So here's a tough thing to say to you. That's why abused children stay with their parents. Yeah. Because it's still their parents and they, not only they stay with them, but they think it must be that they did something wrong. I know, Jack. I know that, unfortunately, very well. Here's my question. Yeah. When you told the story about the cottage they put you in and right across from you- Yeah, some distance was what the master's called. Teacher demonstrating these aspects that seemed to you to be completely not cool. Yeah. I don't know if you would call it paranoia or pronoia. The idea that actually things are going your way all the time, but I thought, perhaps here is an enlightened being. Who's doing just what I needed to get. Yeah. Aware that you're watching him. They put you there on purpose and he's coming out and doing these shows. It's actually a beautiful question because archetypally it talks about how the universe gives us the difficulties that we need to awaken our mind and open our heart. Now, would that it were true that this guy was actually doing that? But unfortunately, some years later, he was run out of the monastery by his own monks when they found him in a nun's cottage in the middle of the night. So, you know, it was a good story that you spun, but I'm sorry about that, Duncan. More disappointment. Jack, thank you so much. What a pleasure. Thank you. I hope you're not too disappointed.

Greetings friends, it's me, Duncan, and this is the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast. And wow, we have a high level super guest with us here today, Lily Reinhardt is here. Now, before we jump into this very exciting episode, I wanna share something with you. New listeners, you might not be aware of the fact that I am a huge fan of this very obscure musician called Fergus Blanders. They say that Fergus Blanders is the musician that inspired Tom Waits. Don't know if it's true, could just be a rumor. Regardless, Blanders is a mysterious person with a crazy history. His albums are almost impossible to find. And supposedly, again, I don't know how much of this is true, Fergus Blanders' music career ended when he went searching for a secret monastery somewhere in Tibet. He was never seen again. Nobody knows what happened. And a lot of his music just vanished in the wind. So you can imagine my excitement when a mysterious anonymous email sent me a wave file that has a Fergus Blanders song on it that I have never heard before. Here's the thing, the audio quality of this sucks. A lot of Fergus Blanders' music was bootlegged. People would bring tape recorders wherever he was performing. This was clearly taken from one of those bootleg tapes and I am thrilled to share it with you today. Everybody get ready, especially for the Fergus Blanders fans out there, for as far as I'm aware, I never before heard Fergus Blanders' song, Abandon All Hopes Afruition. This song was taught to me by an old dying clown. And I saw him erode in Italy one night. I was there for syphilis treatment. It didn't work. Once I saw a dying clown laying in the street, his stomach and his legs bore the tire prints of a jeep. There was nothing to be done as he sang the song to me. Abandon All Hopes Afruition. Abandon All Hopes Afruition. Abandon All Hopes Afruition. Abandon All Hopes Afruition. I've lived both ways when we crossed the streets. This guitar sucks. I need another whiskey. If you're a hoe, feels like a kite. That you're flying in a hurricane. I'm not a hoe. I'm not a hoe. I'm not a hoe. I'm not a hoe. I am in a hurricane. Let go of that damn stream that's causing all that rain, sing this song to the clown in your heart that chose to bleed instead of me free. Abandon All Hopes Afruition. Abandon All Hopes Afruition. Abandon All Hopes Afruition. I've lived both ways when we crossed the streets. Listen to me calling... Thank you. Thank you. A big thank you to the anonymous listener who sent me that track. Please keep them coming. Friends, today's guest. You already know who she is, because she's super famous. You probably already know her from the hit series Riverdale, or maybe you have caught the newest movie that she has just released called Look Both Ways, but now, by some act of divine grace, she is here with us today on the DTFH. We're gonna jump right into this conversation with Lily. But first, this. You know, a lot of people talk about the powers of microdosing, but I think very few people actually understand what that means. And by very few people, I mean me. So many times when I thought I was taking a microdose, I ended up taking a mega-dose. What was supposed to be a nice walk around the neighborhood turns into a scene from Friday the 13th, except it's not some dude in a hockey mask chasing me. It's just a random dog that scares the shit out of me, because the edible marijuana that I consumed was too strong. But thanks to the genius alchemist at Loomi Labs, that experience is a thing of the past for me, because I use microdose gummies. Microdose gummies are available nationwide. I'm telling you, friends, this is the perfect dose. This is it. They dialed it in. I take them on the road with me. It helps me fall asleep at night and wind down. I absolutely love them.

And now, without further ado, welcome to the DTFH. Lily Reinhardt. Welcome to the DTFH. I'm so excited to meet you. I'm so happy to be here with you and tell my friends that I got to speak to Clancy from the Midnight Gospel. Clancy with a beard, 48-year-old Clancy, please use your imagination and you could turn me into cartoon Clancy, maybe. I don't know. I'll envision that I'm talking to cartoon Clancy. Thank you. It makes me feel better. He's much younger than me. Now, this is something, you know, I've got to ask you about this only because it, like, completely mirrors an experience I had. Can you tell me about the movie you have coming out today? Yes. Look Both Ways on Netflix. Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. Yes. Look Both Ways on Netflix. It is, I feel, very in line with your podcast, you know, multiverse, parallel lives, all that good stuff, sort of concept. It follows Natalie who, on her college graduation night, takes a pregnancy test and the movie then splits off into two different realities, one in which she is pregnant, she decides to have the baby and move back in with her parents in Austin, Texas, where you currently are. Yes. And while also trying to still pursue her goals, career, ambition, you know, all the good things. And then in the other parallel life, she isn't pregnant and moves to LA to pursue a career in animation with her best friend. That is so cool. I did not wait to watch this. That is right up my alley. I love it. And when I was reading about it, I did feel like a little bit of synchronicity in the sense that one of the creepy moments, I had many creepy moments in Asheville, North Carolina, we just moved from Asheville to Austin. I grew up in Asheville. It was raining one day. I'm putting gas in the car and I don't know how to call it, but I had this moment where I, for a second, I thought maybe my life as a comedian and a podcaster was just some kind of hallucination and I never left home. I'm still here in Asheville. And the whole thing was like some flickering dream. It filled me with the strangest sense of dread. Like just, oh God, oh God. That would have been, I don't know if it would have been horrible, but in that moment, it felt horrible. But I feel like you could also have a flip side of that and feel sometimes when things are going so horribly wrong in my life. And it always kind of happens when I'm driving, maybe because there's so many like driving simulation video games and stuff. That's where I sit there and go, maybe I am actually just in a simulation and there's this alien version of me that is in this body, just clicking buttons and controlling things. And I'm just this vessel that's experiencing it. And in a way, that is a little, I'm like, that's a little comforting because it almost tells me, well, this shit's out of my hands. Right. Well, you mean you can sort of surrender to the simulation, sort of just give in to the concept that this is not real me. There's a real me somewhere else. But then you got to ask yourself, I mean, is it me's all the way down? Like when does it, when does the Russian doll version of it? Is there someone in another simulation playing a video game of someone playing a video game of that person? That's where that trips me out. That's where I have to check out because that causes me dread. Yeah. Well, there, I mean, isn't there something dreadful about it? It's that, that, you know, simulation theory. It seems to me to be some kind of revamped version of like the old wisdom tradition notion that this whole thing is an illusion. But it's just that with technology, right? It's an illusion. None of this is real. But yeah, within something within that sort of telescoping, never ending possibility of infinite iterations of the simulation. Yeah. At some point, what are you? What are you? What the hell am I? What am I doing here? I mean, because it is like I look out at, I'm, I'm, okay. So when I went house hunting in LA, my goal was to find a house with a view. I wanted to be able to look out and see and, and know that I'm someone with a lot of anxiety and someone who just in general kind of can feel very isolated in my career, in my life, whatever. I like to be able to look out and see physical proof that I'm not alone. Yes. And, and even though I live in a very quiet neighborhood and like don't see a lot of other human beings when I look out, I am looking out at the city and I see mountains and I see trees and I see houses and the notion of every, you know, out there, there are so many people that have their own complex lives that they're dealing with. And that is a comforting feeling to me. And recently been going through just a little bit of a difficult emotional time. And I've started to sort of just be a little bit more aware of human beings around me. And, and when I'm, when I'm driving, I kind of, because I've been crying in my car a little bit, I've been driving, having to drive a lot. And I'm like, okay, this is a good, let's just cry in my car and listen to sad music and just sort of looking at the people to my left and right as I'm driving and, and just wondering and taking that moment to think, what does that person struggle? Is that person struggling? Right. What do they deal with? And, and how, you know, how are, how do they keep going? And I think that's something that I'm on the journey of trying to connect with people about is a, is someone who, who does, you know, struggle with anxiety and depression and a whole load of other things. How do you, how do, how does everyone just keep going? And I think, especially grief and, and, and in this movie, my character is going through when she is pregnant and does have a kid, she's, she's grieving the identity that she thought she was going to have. Like she's, her whole life changes in, in, in that moment. Yeah. And having to break from the idea of what she thought her life was going to be. And I think I personally am also dealing with how, how my life is just genuinely not, not for better or for worse. I'm just saying my life does not, I don't know what tomorrow is going to look like. Right. And grasping the concept of I just genuinely cannot plan a damn thing because life has its own agenda. Yeah. And like letting go of that sense of control and the word flow has been in my vocabulary a lot lately and something I, I work with a, a channeler who I call my life coach. So she's psychic. She's amazing. Her name is Alexia. I turned to her for, for everything and she uses the word flow a lot and it encourages me to let go of control and because I think control is what takes you out of being present. And, and as an actor, my whole job when I'm, when I'm acting, when I'm on set, when I'm playing a role is to be present. And, and it can be, you know, it's incredibly hard to be present today in general, just with, you know, the little black box that's always one, one foot away that we reach to the moment we need space to fill, you know, You mean where I keep my heroin? Yeah, a hundred percent. I'm just kidding. I know you mean the phone, but you know, that's the, with acting like my acting friends, that's the thing that is like impossible for me to like wrap my head around the, the way y'all are able to somehow and the, you know, especially acting for TV or movies. It's that kind of acting is not like stage acting, where at least there's, you know, freedom of movement or improvisation or something. I mean, it can be so technical. Like, so not only do you have to, all these balls that you're juggling, you got to memorize the lines, but not just that you got to know where the cameras are, but not just that you've got marks that you exactly have to hit or the shots not going to work. And then somehow in the midst of all that, you have to, like you're saying, be in the moment as someone, you know, different from you. That to me, it's got to be of like outside of acid dealer, one of the most schizophrenic jobs out there. For sure. And it really, like it truly is so weird sometimes to as, as an actor and you see my fellow actors do it as well, just, you know, one minute, you're literally on set with tears streaming down your face. And then they call cut and five minutes later, you're in your trailer eating a sandwich and you're TikTok. And then 10 minutes later, you're back on set crying again. And it's, it's this weird, constant roller coaster. And, and it can be, I mean, it can be exhausting, but also I kind of just live for it because I myself am just a very, I have, I feel that I have heightened emotions. I'm a very highly emotional, deep, deeply feeling person. I think it's called an, like an HSP, a highly sensitive person or something. Um, you know, of course, it's a very modern term. And I, you know, also sounds a little bit condescending as if other people don't have the capacity to feel as deeply as you, but I myself believe that I feel incredibly deeply and internalize a lot. And I am very cerebral and, um, you know, mental illness has something to do with that constantly in my head, but, um, but I acting and, and kind of having that outlet of that roller coaster in a weird way is very cathartic for me. It's just like a direct channel to my emotions and my soul in a weird way. Is it, do you, do you think of it as an escape from the, from, from the version of you crying in the car? Well, it can be, but it's also in a weird way directly correlated to that version of me because I get to the same way an artist who paints a sad melancholy painting. It's, uh, me as an artist channeling my own sadness through another, through just a different channel, through a character. You, like, so what was your channelers name again? Alexia. I don't know Alexia, but channelers I know. It's, it's a really fascinating thing that happens to them. Like they are, I don't want to use the word possessed because there's all kind of negative connotations to that, but I don't, you know, in, in, in some, uh, mystical traditions, like they say you're mounted by a spirit. Like this thing comes into you that isn't, you know, and, and, you know, I think that they have methods to deal with that. Like there is a, they have ritual, you know, prior to allowing the thing in and they have ways of like energetically, you know, cleansing themselves. And, but with acting, you know, even though if you ask me kind of seems like the same thing, uh, but, because it's so modern, it seems like many actors might not even think to themselves, Oh, I'm being mounted by a spirit that I've summoned via discipline. And they're just like, Oh, I'm acting. And sometimes though, when I'm like hearing about the, uh, the problems that beset some actors, you know, I think to myself, of course, of course, you're opening yourself up to this, you know, if you want to put it in like secularist terms, archetype, you're opening yourself up to a disastrous archetype that is completely taking you over. And then like you're saying, now you're just sitting in your trailer, you know, default reality, you, and I don't know that actors are given like any kind of tools or any kind of spiritual, anything that to reckon with that bizarre pendulum. It just seems like it could be dangerous. And I'm like, maybe that's why you see celebrities constantly just on vacation. Because you just, everyone's always just on a beach somewhere, um, being photographed. And I think in a way it's because, yeah, act. I mean, look, we're not saving lives here. So you can only take yourself so seriously. Um, and I very much try not to take, you know, I know I'm not hearing cancer. I'm an actor. And yes, artists bring so much to the world, but you gotta keep the ego in check. And, um, I don't remember where that train of thought was going. I'm glad you're bringing that up because to me, the other in my thinking about that, that strange profession, your strange profession, the, the, the other thing that sometimes pops into my mind is, Oh, you can't really complain about it. Can you? Because if an actor, if a celebrity actor starts complaining about how, okay, yeah, sure you go on vacation, but you're in some strange Orwellian universe where now, yeah, you're on vacation, but everyone's staring at you. The cool people might ignore you out of like knowing they're on vacation. Let's not just freaking stare at them and like whisper or whatever. But some people, they don't care. It's like spotting a wild animal. It's like seeing Bigfoot or something. And if you see Bigfoot, you got to do something. You got to take a picture. You got it, whatever. So, but, so you're, you're, you're, you, not only are you having to enter into the bizarre world of portraying these characters, but then outside that world. Whoa. You might as well be in an alternate dimension compared to what the majority of people are experiencing. It's trippy. I'm not going to lie to you. It's so trippy and weird. And I don't, I cannot come to terms with the word famous or celebrity in association with myself. First of all, it feels gross. It just feels like I'm feeding this gross ego monster, like this gluttonous thing. And even though, you know, you can, it depends on how much power you put into those words, fame, celebrity, influencer, what an act or whatever. But, but I try to, I, I'm like, I, I don't feel famous. Unless I'm walking on a carpet or when I, and even when I turn on Netflix and see maybe, oh, there's, there's my show Riverdale and there's look both ways. My film, it's, it's not, it's weird cause it's almost like a disassociative. Yeah. Oh yeah. That's me, but, but okay. Cool. Moving on. Right. I don't know. You almost become desensitized to yourself because you're so overexposed to yourself. Right. And that's something that I never expected going in the, you know, who would have, you just don't really think about it unless you're, you're in that position, how, how sick of seeing your own face you can feel and, and just your own image and, and how I know who I am in the comfort of my own home and around my friends. And it's genuinely the same version, it's the same thing that you see when I do interviews and when I'm definitely not when I'm acting, but I try to keep that performative aspect of myself only in front of the camera. I do not try to put on any persona. That would be exhausting. I bet. I'm just, I'm fully just me whenever I can be. And then I use obviously when I'm directly in front of the camera as my opportunity to perform, but just in my regular life and walking on a carpet and then coming home. I'm the same person. There isn't this weird shade that I pulled down over my eyes and I go, okay, we're going to be Lily Reinhart, you know, but I think some people do do that in order to protect, maybe protect themselves. And that's what you were talking about, like a channel or kind of creating that boundary or mounted by a, by a spirit or something. It's, I try, I mean, it was never a conscious thing, but I'm glad that I don't feel the pressure to perform outside of my job that I'm just me throughout my life. Okay. Do you have a place that you can think back to, and this is maybe a lame question because the idea is you could instantly summon this up. So forgive me in advance. Do you have a place in your life where there was the fork in the road between you ending up an actor who no offense, I got very excited when I heard from you. Are you freaking kidding me? I told my wife, look at this. She's like, no way. And I'm like, yeah. So is there a place between that part of the, that part of reality that you are now inhabiting in a place where it might have gone the other direction where you wouldn't be in LA experiencing this strange, thriving kind of life, but you'd be somewhere else. Can you think of that? It's a node where these potentialities were just standing there, sitting whatever in front of you. I mean, there's a couple, but I'm trying to think like the youngest, my, the earliest moment. And I'm almost thinking back to when, to when I was, when I was young and doing theater and, and I first, and you know what, and I booked the role of Alice in Alice in Wonderland Junior, which was this. Wow. Yes. Holy shit. I was 12 and I was playing Alice and I was so stoked. And I think, and I'm, and I'm thinking back on it. It was, although it was, yeah, it was community theater and it was like children's theater, but, but people were coming up to my parents and coming up to me and kind of saying, Hey, you're actually good at this and me in that, you know, 12 year old brain going, I am. Thank you. And, and sort of, it was sort of like the beginning of a moment of me taking myself a little seriously, I guess, because you can grow. I grew up being such a performer. I was like the performer kid who sang in front of my family on Christmas day. Like the annoying little, let me show dances to you, you know, but you don't actually think, you know, especially because no one in my family is in the industry. So there's, there was, it's, and it's such a hard industry to break into. So there was no idea how you could even enter that world. Right. But being young and being told that, Hey, you actually have this talent and you could pursue it. And these people are telling me that I should. And, and it was sort of like a light bulb in a way, but a shove in that direction that maybe otherwise, if people had, you know, kept their mouth shut or if I had not done theater. And sort of put myself out there in that way. Artistically, I wouldn't have been encouraged to actually follow what when you're that age seems very impossible. Yeah. But like me to my parents, my family, who, who would have thought I not, not me until suddenly I was, you know, driving to New York for, I wasn't, my mom was driving me to New York from Ohio for auditions. Holy shit. And putting myself in those weird casting rooms and those nerve wrecking, such imposter syndrome filled. Yeah. Situations and, and then it just slow and then it just happened. Yeah. Totally. Hey, you know what? Nobody told me when I was in high school theater. Nobody told me you should pursue this. What would have happened if they had? I don't know. I would have, I don't know. An Oscar today, maybe. Maybe. I don't know if I, maybe in some version of the multiverse, but you know, that's wild. You know, Ohio, are you kidding me? That's nuts. Like the, like, yeah, like a place where no one, your parents must have had zero idea how to do anything like that. And were they encouraging you at first or were they sort of like, come on, this is just a phase. I mean, I think, and I have to sit down and ask them this question because I haven't. And I, and I genuinely am curious myself, why the hell they believed in me enough to just say, okay, she's not just this 12 year old kid who wants to be an actor and you're going, okay, sure. But I genuinely think it was the, the encouragement and sort of validation that I was getting from other people cast, you know, theater theater people and then local, local, like modeling agencies who were also doing local casting and Cleveland and it was just sort of a, this encouragement, I guess. And so they were, my parents must have just looked at each other and thought, okay, I guess we're not, we're not crazy and we're not just blowing smoke up our kid's ass. Like she's being told that, you know, because I feel like as I'm not, I'm not a parent, but maybe you like to look at your kid and go, my kid is special. My kid is talented. I certainly do. Well, sure. And because you created them, but, but I think just the encouragement from outside sources is what led them to just go, okay, maybe this isn't so crazy. And they also saw, you know, was an old soul as a kid, super mature as a little one, just like introspective and very deep feeling and, and, you know, dramatic. And I, and I think that also that aspect of that personality, maybe kind of was, was just warming my parents up slowly to the idea that I was a performer and that that, that was not something that was a phase or that was coming out of the blue. It was like in my identity. Okay, let's talk about souls for a second. The old soul idea. We'll get away from the acting stuff and dive in. The, the, I'm curious, only because you do have a channel or do you believe in the, that you have a soul? I do. What is it made of? Oh, yes, I think you definitely have a soul. I don't have one anymore. I sold it. But the, but what's, what is the soul made of? Like, what do you consider? What is the, to you? What is the soul? To me, the soul, I think stems from, it's all energy, right? So we're, we're all energy. And I think, and this is an interesting point when you, if you've ever seen a dead person in real life, that person looks empty. Like if you have ever been to awake a funeral, open casket and seen a dead body. Yeah. To me, at least they look empty and almost hollow. And maybe that's, you know, on the gross side of things because they're, they've been drained of their organs. Yeah. But I know what you mean. Waxy, statuary. Yeah. But on a, so on a different, but on a different level besides the physical, they've been, you know, preserved. There, there's just, there is no life. And so there can be bodies where bodies, but you can, you die, but your body's still there. So something leaves, something has to go, something dies, something ends and your body is, is left there. So it's sort of, to me, inconceivable how someone could think that you don't have a soul. I'm, I'm like, okay, then what's the driving force behind life and death? How are you, how are you alive one moment and dead the next? Like what, what happens? What causes that? Yeah, it's, it's on a, you know, human level, a body, a body level. Yeah. You can, you can get sick and die, but there's just something, there's just more. And so I think I like to think that we all kind of started out as energy and just sort of maybe, I mean, I don't know, but celestial beings floating around. I don't know what we were doing. And it's almost like a, like creator God, whatever you want to call it, because there's a million names, sort of plucks you from this, this vast sky. And basically, I like to think of it this way, as if you were just this celestial little star being this angel, this, this, this thing. And God creator, the universe said, hey, do you want to go to earth for maybe 80 to 200 years, if you're lucky, and experience every possible emotion and feeling and struggle and, and grief and joy and ecstasy and sadness? Like, do you want to, do you want to do that for just a blip, just a blip in time? Do you want to experience that? Fuck yeah. Why would you not? So you say, okay, I'm going. And then your soul, your soul is sent, is sent to the earth and inhabits a vessel. And, and then you just go, then you just go from there. God bless you, athletic greens for supporting this episode of the DTFH. First, some anecdotal evidence for the power of athletic greens. When I drink athletic greens, it's like my body is singing. Thank you to me as though I were some kind of massive meat God and all the cells in my body were bowing down at the altar of my decision to drink athletic greens. It feels like my body knows it's good for me. That's me talking. It's not on the sheet here.

Have you heard of the term the guff or the columbarium of souls? Oh, you'll love this. So like, at one point I got into this, like, cobalistic stuff. I was reading all these old cobalistic texts and then I started having weird dreams and I stopped. And especially because I was talking to a rabbi friend of mine and I was like, I'm reading this cobalistic stuff. He's like, how are your dreams? And I'm like, oh, no, it doesn't mention in there. It gets into your dreams. But the one of the one of the ways that they you just described it. That's what's so cool. You are an old soul. You remember a little bit, but at least according to this, there's a thing called the columbarium of souls. Columbarium is a fancy name for birdhouse. I had to look it up. And in the birdhouse are all the souls that are to ever to be born. Now, before I go on with that, I must say, you don't have children yet. But if you ever decide to, your idea that it's a floating situation prior to birth will be confirmed because babies, they'll just go off a couch. It's like they think they can fly. It's like they remember a little bit or something and they don't understand gravity yet. But that being said, columbarium of souls is an angel. Plucks this each soul out and drops the angel to the earth or to the soul to the earth. The soul descends into the womb of their mother. And when the last soul is dropped from the columbarium of souls, that's when the Messiah will return. Meaning that every person on earth is like a link in a chain leading to paradise, leading to, you know, the, I don't know, redemption of the planet or something like that. I love that idea. I just like the term guff. It sounds cool. But yeah, you got it. Sounds like a Lord of the Rings concept or something. Lord of the Rings concept or a great name for like a trucker character guff. But regardless, it's a cool sounding name. The old soul thing. Some, one of my, someone I've worked with spiritually thinks that anyone being born right now is like somehow like, like, I don't want to say extra special or create a hierarchy of special lives in this world where there's been so many lives. But the idea is if you are so nuts that when that being says to you, hey, do you want to get, you want to go dropping down into this planet? You want to go experience a planet you're going to feel sad, happy, lonely. You're probably going to starve or run out of water or be incinerated by a nuclear blast. Or you're just going to deal with a background hum of the stress of some future instability caused by the myriad of things that are causing it. Anyone who's saying yes to that is saying yes, because they think they can help. Is that what you mean by old soul? You ever play around with that, that idea of like, wow, I wasn't just that I came down there for an experience. I came there to do something. That's a good, I mean, I never thought of it that way. To me, old soul has always maybe been, I mean, it was like a term I heard growing up when adults would throw that at me. And I'd be like, okay, that just means I'm mature and maybe not as happy of a stupid of a kid as the other ones around me. But to me now, the old soul concept means that I've been here a couple times and that I've had past lives and that I've... I have returned to the earth multiple times getting higher and higher in frequency because I don't think it's a coincidence that I have been called an old soul my whole life. And then really what I find to be a young age, which is 23, was when I really had my spiritual awakening. And I think that, you know, some people never have that. Some people have that on their deathbed. Some people have that when they're 50. I feel fortunate enough to have had that introduction to spirituality. And I am sure that everyone who listens to your podcast and we're all just a little bit more awakened. We're all maybe just a little bit more lived in souls in a way. At least that's how I perceive that. How do you... What was that? Oh, I'm sorry. What was your spiritual awakening? Like, how did that come about? You know, it came about from... It was the beginning of COVID and it was a really difficult ending of a relationship for me. And I feel that spiritual awakenings often come out of a breakup or death or whatever the case. So in my case, it was sort of obviously the lockdown of COVID, but also a very huge part of my life, my relationship ending. And sort of being stuck alone with my thoughts and trying to think, this is the worst feeling in the world. I need to do something to make this feel better. And that led me on my inner work. And that inner work slowly turned into reading self-help books. And those books were touching on subjects that just made me think. And then that just kind of grew deeper and expanded. And I was weirdly just... You start watching YouTube videos listening to Joe Dispenza talk about your brain and rewiring your brain. But then I also, because I, jumping back to what I said at the beginning, feel like I feel things so deeply, which I believe is why I'm an actor, but it almost had me stop in my tracks a little bit at one point and think, does anyone else around me feel the way that I do? Because if so, how the fuck are we supposed to keep going? Because this is the worst shit I've ever felt in my goddamn life. I don't know how people wake up and continue to do it. When there's grief at the ending of something, the ending of a relationship, of a life, of a future, of an idea, when that ends and you're just left to yourself, it's like, God, that's a lonely feeling. And so you crave a community and you crave answers. And so that genuinely came from me searching for answers. I was searching for solutions to feel better because there's no worse pain in the world, I believe, than grief. And grief has so many different shades. And I think grief in the sense of relationships ending isn't talked about enough. There's a million books on what to do when a loved one dies or when people pass away because the person's just not there anymore, but when the person still is there. Oh yeah, and they're on Instagram. They're there. They're making posts. You can watch them seemingly get happy and you're like, what the fuck are you happy right now? What is going on with you? I know exactly what you mean. And it's a pandemic. I mean, let's not forget this happened. If you're going to schedule the worst time for a breakup, it's going to be at the beginning of a global pandemic. That sucks. Isn't that just so ironic? But also, to me, was a blessing because I don't believe I wouldn't have dove head first into that healing journey if I didn't have that time off of work and I didn't have that isolation. It was the isolation and the time off of work that truly allowed me to do the work on myself. Right. It was like a forced spiritual retreat. But then I went on a quest to, you know, at one point after panic attacks and genuinely, you know, when you open your eyes in the morning and feel that wash and that build from your stomach going into your chest and your throat and your face of anxiety, you think something's not okay here. And I need help. And I was very much feeling that feeling. I was feeling that I needed help. And I was doing research and calling these different places. Because, you know, I've seen articles, celebrities, celebrity checks into mental health, whatever. I'm like, where are these places? Check these places out. And there's somewhere in Malibu where it's like $90,000 and you have, you know, you can go there for, first of all, I'm like, who has the time to do it? They're like 21 days. Who has 21 days to just go do that? Who has that? We have jobs. We have shit to do. And I guess, you know, but also ironically, the pandemic, we all had that time. But I also am a cheap fuck and was not about to spend $90,000. $90,000 is a lot of dollars. It's a lot of dollars for just sort of, I think, like the label of this is a mental wellness retreat. So I said, no, I'm not doing that. And I, but I did Google, I believe mental or wellness retreats in California, because I didn't really want to, you know, travel too far out of the, maybe out of my comfort zone to travel alone. But I found Mount Shasta in California. I'd never heard of it. And it's, you know, I'm researching it and talking to my therapist about it as well and being told that it's this incredibly high vibrational place. And there's healers there and people travel all over the world to go. Lily, I believe it's one of the entrances to the hollow earth. I don't know if you've heard that before, but that's what they say. I'm pretty sure it's Mount Shasta internet. I'm sorry if I'm wrong. Well, they say it's, what is it? There's a telos. There's a city under the mountain of fairies and angels and all the things. So yes, they've likened it to Tibet, vibrationally. And so, you know, not maybe not wanting to travel to Tibet by myself, I said, I shall go to Mount Shasta by myself. And I did and I met with a woman there who we worked together for three days. And I don't think I've ever cried so much in my life, but it was, but it was exactly what I needed. And I felt on that little trip by myself. So when I'm doing spiritual work and fully immersing myself in it in that way, like genuinely I flew to that location for healing for myself by myself. The intention was just on healing when I'm in those spaces, even though it's incredibly difficult because I know I'm doing the most intense, you know, shadow work on myself and staring straight into my own eyes and going, let's figure it out. It's a little hard, but it's also genuinely when I feel the most at peace with myself and the most at peace with my anxiety. Right. It's almost like there is no anxiety because I'm just tackling it head on. Anxiety is the anxiousness is coming from, what do I do? Where do I go? How can I get help? And so when I'm actively helping myself and letting myself cry and talk about it and talk about the answers and what can I do and work with healers? The anxiety almost dissipates because I know that I'm exactly where I need to be to solve what's causing the anxiety, if that makes sense. Totally. I've been thinking about this. In Buddhism, there's three root poisons and one of them, if you want to come up with the ingredients, if you want to mix suffering, there's three primary ingredients. One of them is ignorance and ignorance is considered to be like an active form of ignoring because it takes energy to ignore. So basically, like you're talking about the jumping off point for your spiritual awakening was heartbreak. But for a lot of people, heartbreak is actually a jumping off point for, I guess you could, what would you call it in a sleepening? Like it's, you can go the opposite direction. You're like numb down, freeze up, don't feel anything. Fuck this. I'll never let, I'll never love again. I'll never let anyone in again. I'm never going to do this again. Fuck that. I am a rock. All that garbage. No offense, everyone. I'm saying it because I've tried that. I'm not like Lily here. I run in the other direction. It kind of makes sense. It hurts run away from it. But doing the thing you're talking about, which is very hard for a lot of people, I think it's the same. It's the same thing that makes vaccines work. It's like, you take a little tiny bit of this disease, and you put it in your body, and your body figures out how to like deal with it to fight it off or whatever it by looking right into the thing. You know, somehow it does the same. It has the same effect. It's like, but it doesn't, I get why people go awakening or a sleepening. I get me a sleepening because it seems counterintuitive that by diving in to the pain that it would somehow help the pain heal. There's not much that I can think of like that in the world. Well, and that's where I think I truly started to embrace the term compassion and also just empathy and knowing that when people seemingly do wrong by me or hurt me in whatever way they have, I try to look at the situation or that person with compassion because not everyone has the strength to lean in. And I think it's the act of leaning in to what you're saying is that little drop of the disease that you let yourself experience. So you can, you know, it's the, I get it. I get it. But that numbing, that process of running away, I knew from like reading these self-help books and every lesson I've ever learned was only going to prolong the hurt. Right. And I was saying, no, I can't do that. I know, and I remember laying in bed one morning. I think it was like April or end of March and, and just saying to myself, and, and it was almost like a putting, like taking the armor off in a way and saying, this is going to fucking suck so bad. And so hurt, like I've never felt hurt before, but I am choosing to go through this dark tunnel that I know will be long and I know it will suck. But I'm going to go through this tunnel because I know there's a light at the end. I know there is. I've seen how to, I've seen it. I've seen it. You, you, you, how does anyone carry on after a breakup or after losing someone? People do. And so you know that people can do it. And I knew that I could do it. So I just said, that's what I'm going to do. I'm going to lean in and I'm going to let myself feel fucking terrible. And I did. And, and I now approach heartache the same in my life and in grief and any sort of bad emotion. I fully have given myself permission to feel like shit. I've got to ask, okay, cut to present moment. Lily crying in traffic. What's going on now? Oh, um, you know, a little bit at some, some heartache. Again, again, again, but, um, but it's actually, it's, it's very different this time. I've learned an incredible amount, but also, but also I'm at the point where I will not tolerate or accept less than what I deserve. And I know because I am such a deep feeler. Um, and I love to the, I am an all or nothing person and I love to the, to the depths of the ocean, you know, the deepest, I just, I'm a, I'm a lover and I'm a fighter and I fight for the people that I love. And there will be people who don't care to fight for you or don't see your value. And I refuse to ask those people to stay. I will never again in my life ask someone to stay if they're choosing to leave the doors right there. You can go. Wow. Yeah. Well, I wish I'd been smart like you when I was in my twenties. I didn't start out that I'm 25, but I didn't start out that way. You know, it's like when I was first experiencing heartache or what loss it's you immediately because of, I don't know, codependency or attachment. You go, no, no, no, please don't, don't, don't leave, please don't leave me. I'll fix the things. I'll do what I got to do. Yeah. You know, because you're, you're like, Oh, I'm the problem. So this is, you know, it's become a matter of learning not to take things personally. You know, that, you know what that makes me think of my friend as a tattoo artist. And he was telling me that the, whenever anyone comes in to tattoo their partner's name on them, he knows they're about to break up. You know what I mean? Because it's like, Oh, maybe if I get their name tattooed on my flesh, they will not walk out the door, you know, but it doesn't, it doesn't work. And, you know, God, there's so many like other versions of that, aren't there? When you're in a relationship, you're not tattooing their name on your flesh, but you're like shifting yourself, altering yourself in ways that feel unnatural or dishonest in some attempt to get them to stay. You know, and yeah, that's, that's a really rotten feeling when you, when you start going down that slippery slope. I mean, but also don't you think Lily sometimes in a relationship, there's, it's not codependency. It's like, you know, communication. It's, it's like having the ability to. Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, communication. Yeah. Like sometimes it's like, there's a way to work it out. But people can't, but you can't if someone doesn't know how to communicate. Right. You know, like I can only do so much and then if there's no communication, okay, then that door's shut and it's already shut. And I'm not going to be on the other end of it trying to break it down or pull the door open. I'm only, I can only do so much. And it's like, you got to meet me halfway. And if, and if you're not willing to do that, then, then I don't want that in my life anyways. Right. But I think as I've learned communication is you have to be willing to be vulnerable to communicate. It's our words talking to someone, looking in someone's eyes and telling someone how we feel, whether, especially when it's a shitty emotion or if we're feeling bad or sad or confused or hurt, whatever the case, it takes pure vulnerability to do that. And, and I think it's, it's a cowardly thing when people choose not to, to do that. I mean, I mean, but you can't blame people. Again, this is where compassion comes in because some people just aren't, instead of leaning in, people run away and, and you can't blame them because it hurts and it sucks and it's hard. You're talking to a professional coward here. I mean, my God, like, oh, sure. Are you kidding me? There's like, it's so seemingly so much easier to just like take whatever the thing is that you're wanting to say, like, you know, that really, that really hurt my feelings. I don't want to say that. I'm going to go, I'm going to go play Minecraft or something, you know, like just hopefully it'll like vanish into the darkness. It's, I'm not, I'm not advocating this as a, as a mechanism for having a great relationship. I'm just saying, I get it. I get it. Like, you know, I get it too. I get it too. I just choose to do the hard thing instead. Yeah. Yeah. And also, my God, you must be so busy. Like, how would you even have time to pull off a codependent relationship right now? Yeah. But it's also, I mean, yeah, I don't, there is no, I don't want a codependent relationship. And I wasn't in one. But yes, I guess that's, yeah. Sorry for implying that you were, I don't know what was obvious. No, no, no, I mean, I don't know. No idea what was going on. No idea at all. So yes, I'm sorry if I projected that on you. No, you didn't. Because, because I, I used to be that way. And I, when I was going through my spiritual, and that's the whole thing to me was finding my independence when I was going through my spiritual awakening was, okay, who am I outside of every other role out of being a girlfriend, out of being a daughter, a sister, a friend? Who am I just as an individual? Because, you know, all you over here is the best relationships happen when it's two individuals coming together, two people who are fully formed, can be happy on their own self sustaining, you know, yes, people who decide to share a life together. Yes. And I said, okay, I want that. So I'm going to do that. And I'm going to be an individual and be okay on my own. Because otherwise any other partner that I'm going to attract is going to be, you know, is going to have this codependency thing where I'm not fully ready and this person isn't fully ready, but we're both like lonely. And so we're just going to be together because it's, it's easier to have someone next to you during the process. And I think a lot of people are unfortunately in codependent relationships because of how terrifying it is to be alone. I mean, I don't know. I don't know what other people's relationships are like, because I'm not in them. But I think it's kind of a common occurrence that there are relationships out there that that are there because people are scared of the alternative. I've heard that can happen. You know, there's something that Ram Dass said to me once. I was asking him, how do I, how can I be a good father and to my son? And he goes, father, role, son, role, soul, not role. Like, you know, that it was so deep. I think about it every day now, which, you know, because if I get too much, if you get too much into the father role, husband role, girlfriend role, boyfriend role or whatever, you're suddenly, there might not be cameras around, but you're putting on a show. Whereas the, the soul, whatever that thing may be, you know, it doesn't really, I don't feel like it identifies with such specific modalities, you know, it's so much bigger than that. That the, the thing that was floating in the guff or whatever, it's this trance outside of time thing that's dipping its finger into time just for a second. It's just so easy to find to, you know, or even if you are in a gray relationship, you know, at least if you're me, you can, I could find myself just getting like, burrowing into some, oh, this is who I am, or this is what it is when it's sometimes outside of words or language or the ability to, to trap it in the box of definition, you know. And I think one of the most important lessons that I've been learning and have learned is to truly trust myself, which can be, that's the hardest shit to do, you know, like to not talk yourself out of something or say, am I being too needy? Am I expecting too much because expectations are such a huge part of a relationship of any relationship in just life in general. So it's sort of like, oh, am I having too high of expectations and whatever the case may be. And it's, it's a lot of self doubt, I feel, which, which makes people unhappy because they choose to stay in something that isn't actually fulfilling them. And again, the alternative being alone is just worse. So you're like, okay, well, I guess I'm just going to chill here and settle or whatever the case because I don't want to be alone. Yeah. And not just for the relationships. I mean, my God, it happens in everything. It's like, you find yourself in a thing and you're there because you're in the thing. And you're like, is this really making me happy? I don't know. But I'm in the thing. That's what I do. And then before you know it, you're old and you're dying of some awful cardiovascular disease. And then that's it. And then you go back out there again to the God. Yeah. But that's where I'm saying me personally about presentness and trying not to live my life on autopilot because that's a very autopilot thing to do is to say, well, this is fine. This is easy. Like this isn't maybe necessarily challenging. This is making my life, you know, I, oh, I'm filling this void and I'm checking this box. So things are good. Things are fine. But you're not actually stepping outside of what's happening and checking in with yourself, which is why I think it's so important again to be so in tune with yourself and know who you are and what you want before you're in a serious relationship so that when you are in one, you can ask yourself, am I feeling fulfilled? Right. So you even know what that is. Some people don't even know what that feeling is. Like what is that? What is that? I'm still trying to figure it out. Yeah. I'm trying to figure it out myself. I think what is, what is feeling fulfilled in, in by myself and then what is feeling fulfilled in our relationship because it can be two completely different things. But all I know is I just want to feel happy and fulfilled without having to rely on anyone else to give that to me. And that was my biggest, my biggest thing and my biggest like tagline throughout my 2020 summer of healing was I want to feel okay alone. Wow. Very existentialist of you. I mean, it's a, that feeling is just, oh God, well that's suffering. You know, I think the feeling of alone and suffering are probably there's an equal mark between the two. It's just we, it's a flavor of suffering. It's, I don't know how, how happened an hour has passed. Do you have a little bit longer? I know you're probably really busy today because of your. No, I'm actually not busy today. Oh my God. Okay. Fantastic. Let's talk to you about the feeling of fulfillment or whatever. It brings me to a question I had earlier for you, which is you were talking about being in the present moment this. So soul and present moment. These are two words everybody throws around, but sometimes people don't really have a good answer for present moment. So if you had to define the present moment or presentness or how would you, what, what is the present moment to you? Well, I personally, because of my anxiety, tend to live in the past a lot, whether it's memories, looking back on things, having in a weirdly like few living in the future in a way, like having conversations with myself that I think may or may not happen in the future and so I can be prepared and know what I'm going to say and all those. And I think the, I mean, it's so hard to be present. It genuinely is, but I, because my mind travels a million miles a minute and I get distracted by the tiniest things. And it's very easy for me to feel like a little, like if I'm triggered by something or I see a picture and it makes me think of something. It's so hard for me to just continue doing what I'm doing. I need to like stop and say, wait, I'm actually not okay right now. I can't focus on this. Because I think, I mean, the worst thing that I've ever done is try to push through for the sake of pushing through when I need to actually step away. And I think there's a lot of, and it can be really hard with my job, you know, I, you know, I think that's where being an actor can be very difficult because people don't, you know, no one in working in a laboratory, no one's going to use the word diva to describe someone just like in any other job except for the industry. Wait, you've got to look up. I found this out. I was reading a book on quantum physicists. Oh, they're all divas. I actually believe it or not like Oppenheimer, all those people. Oh my God, the worst sort of diva you could imagine because it's quantum physics. But people don't use that title on them. You're right. They're just, they're either just assholes or whatever, but I think the moment you're in the entertainment industry and you, you're kind of, it's hard because you're, you have to almost not be a human sometimes. And it's, it's so incredibly difficult when you have 200 people on a set waiting for you, you know, I've been in a position where I can't stop. I'm in my trailer. I can't stop crying. I have an AD knocking on my trailer door going, set's ready for you. And you know, there's 100 people waiting for you to walk onto set and do your job. While getting paid by the, just, you know, we're talking money, just burning too. Just money. Burning. Yep. Yep. Yep. And so you, you're, you're thinking to yourself, I have to put my emotions on pause right now and go do this job, but when you're dealing with heartache and grief and the bitch feelings of life, that is, it's the worst feeling ever because it's, it feels so fake. And I hate that, but it's, but truly as, as an actor, as a performer, it's happened since the beginning of time at you, time is money and you're wasting people's time. And even if someone you know and love just died, well, the set's waiting for you. You know, and it's, it's just, the show must go on. The show must go on. And it's the most horrifying concept ever. And I've, I've experienced it myself, but I've also experienced seeing my, my co-stars, people around me dealing with the same thing and it's, it's gut wrenching, knowing that my friend, my coworker, I know what they're going through in their personal life. I know that they were just crying in their trailer. I know the anxiety that they're feeling, you know, two seconds before they step onto set and then suddenly they just have to be, is it's brutal. It's brutal. You're a shape shifter. It's like you're, you all are, you have to be tuned in to that deep emotional component of yourself and you're, you somehow have to be able to turn it on and off like some kind of faucet. It is nuts. It's nuts. It's, it's, there isn't a, there's so many like, like, you know, one of the most dangerous jobs is I read, I don't know if this is true anymore, but I just caught my butcher. Did you know that? Like the people who are like chopping meat in the grocery store, it's a very dangerous job because like if you aren't in the moment, you're going to cut your finger off and they're always maiming themselves and just like spraying blood all over the, the lamb meat or whatever. That's my vision of, I don't know if that's the case, but I read it's a very, very dangerous job. So because it's a dangerous job, all this stuff is put into place to protect them from like that accidental amputation. But with acting, it's like, even though it is a dangerous job, clearly look at our actors, look what's happening to them all the time. I mean, every year they, this, they either lose their minds or they like overdose themselves or they, whatever. But it's like, it feels like there, there isn't that same level of protection for you. You're just supposed to figure it out and, you know, God go with you tonight. Like, truly. And I've experienced the, the largest episodes of depression in my life within the last six years and knowing that I'm not okay and I feel close to like, you know, I can stop. I'm a pretty self-aware person and when I can stop and say, I can't actually keep going. Like I am on the phone with my manager and agent saying, I'm not, I'm not okay. I can't, like I, I know I'm not okay. I cannot actually, I cannot be here right now. And there is, you, okay, but here's, there is an alternative. You can leave, you can quit, but then you're, you're sued. You have, you then have a reputation as being difficult. Uh, your, your fellow cast and crew lose respect for you. There are rumors about you. People assume things. You're just all of a sudden a diva, whereas it's like, you know, no, I'm actually just being a human and like any other person in the world, maybe not like a surgeon or something can have a mental health day or say, I'm not okay. I need to go figure this out and then come back. You can't do that in this industry. And it's, I have experience personally being truly at the end of my rope, but then somehow still having to do it. And it is just the weirdest thing to dig, to be fully at the end of your rope saying, I cannot fucking do this. And then still having to do it feels like such a betrayal to yourself. And also so dehumanizing that you're just a product at that point. There is no protection for actors in that space. And it is inherently just because of the industry. And like I said, people throw the word diva around if you're five minutes late to set. Oh, damn, she's a fucking diva. She takes her damn time. Oh, well, actually, I was just on the phone in my trailer hearing about, you know, how my grandpa's not doing well and is in the hospital. You know, you have, but no one's gonna, no one's gonna, I don't have that chance to explain that to people. Right. They just are going to assume what they're going to assume. Yep. You got to cry blood. Here's the thing. If actors cried blood, it would be a whole different ball of wax. The butcher cuts his finger off, cuts her finger off. They're not like, you got to chop meat, Gary, even with your blood springing everywhere. You know, you got to get in there. You're a diva. You're the most diva butcher at Ralph's. No, nobody does that, but, you know, because you're like, I think y'all are tuning in to like some deep, heavy duty, metaphysical, occult level stuff, summoning all kinds of, aside from your personal life, you've got to go from that and then summon the spirit into your body, mix it in with your personal life. You know, there's no blood. There's no blood. And so this is, I think, you know, I don't know, they'll never fix it. It's too expensive. It's just too expensive. Like running a set is not, it's nuts, like how expensive that is. But yeah, you know, I don't know. Maybe they will fix it one day. I guess they did fix it, Xanax, that's how they fixed it. We got the Xani prescription on hand if we need it. I mean, this is, this is the, this is what, this is, this is why when you hear about like the actors that are going to rehab, you know, this is the reason it's because they have to, they're getting help to mitigate this. Because you need to genuinely, because it ends up being the most extreme version of needing help, which is rehab or people are, you know, committing suicide because you are not taken seriously until you are at the end of your rope. Right. You're just, you're just not. You're like, okay, okay, you get it. You're having a shit day. Well, you got to go to work and it's fine. And until you throw the word suicide or overdose or mental exhaustion, but even people don't take that seriously, it's, you know, unless you have an IV drip in your arm and you're like physically incapacitated, you are a cash cow and you are meant to be on set when you are called. That's right. The udders have got to be bleeding. They got to be, the cash has got to get covered in blood and they're like, all right, send it to the vet. Damn it. Let this person have their fucking day and then they'll be, and then they need to come back tomorrow. Oh, wow. Well, um, all that being said, I hope you keep acting. I'm a big fan. Don't stop. Don't stop. Don't stop. Don't stop. Keep going. We need you. We love you. You got to keep doing this. No matter what, ignore your deepest self. But I'm not going to stop and, and but the beauty of it is I have my own production company now and producing my own content, which is amazing and feel very fortunate to do that. But I, um, it's, it's different when you're on, you know, a TV show contractually, you're meant to be there for nine months out of the year, um, where, you know, you kind of have this like itinerary in front of you. It's different for me because I'm moving into my last season of the show that I'm on. So I know that when the show ends, my schedule is going to be different than how it usually is. But, um, but the, I took this summer off of shooting. I have a, like a, an extra long hiatus this summer before my final season. And I chose not to film anything because I knew that I couldn't, like because I knew how much I was struggling back in November when I felt truly at the end of my rope and I couldn't do anything about it, even though I had to push through for six more months in order to, like at the end of my rope, but you got six more months to go. I was saying to myself, okay, well this summer I am going to let my body regulate itself and not work, not have this, even though I love acting so much and I'm like sad that I'm not filming something this summer. I also know that it's genuinely what my body needed eight months ago. So I'm now going to let that happen and sort of let my anxiety, like my cortisol levels return to normal and do my craniosacral therapy, which I love. Whoa, you're doing skull manipulation? That stuff creeps me out. I don't want to think my skull is some kind of like loose puzzle or something that people can push around. It's not, it's kind of more like, it's more like energy and almost fluid, fluid in your brain, I don't know how it all works, but I know that when I go to my craniosacral therapist, I'm laying on a table and she's touching certain parts of my body and all of a sudden I'm bursting into tears. So something's happening. Yeah. Yeah. No, I've heard great things about it. Someone, a long time ago, one of my mom's friends tried it on me and I was like, I guess she didn't explain it like energy. She made me think that it's like you could push bits of your skull around, which now that I'm saying it, what an idiot, I don't know why I thought that. Your skull can't move around literally ever since then until now, I've had this fantasy of being able to push chunks of my skull around. Boy, I'm dumb. Well, I don't think that's what's happening, but I understand why you maybe would think that. Lily, thank you so much for coming on the show. It's really a joy talking to you. You're a real inspiration. You're taking care of yourself. Right now, especially folks need to hear that this is a possibility and thank you. I'm personally inspired by it and yeah, I got to meet your channeler. Yeah, I'll set you up. You let me know. She's great. I mean, she's my, I call her my life coach and a good friend and very fortunate to just have, again, same with like a therapist, just people in my life who are helping me grow and conversations like this as well, help me do that. So I'm thankful to you for letting me have this conversation with you. Thank you so much. That was Lily Reinhardt, everybody. Thanks for coming on the show, Lily. That tremendous thank you to our glorious sponsors and thank you for listening. I will see you next week or maybe I'll see you at the Miami improv this weekend.

This is a mega-episode, one of my favorite episodes of all time, so I'm not going to do a long intro because it's already a two-hour episode. We're just going to dive right into some commercials, and then after that, Chris Ryan will be blowing minds. So now, a word from one of my newest sponsors. Sup y'all, it's Tyler here coming at you. I just want to promote my new dispensary called Chinese Hills all the way out in Glendora. It's near the Auto Center for Kia. So this is a great place, great place to get weed, great place to get all your pod accessories. We got hash oil, we got dabs, we got pieces, bubblers, bombs of ash catchers, ash catchers, you put ice in it. You know, we got a lot of stuff. We got all girls working at the store, we got Lacey, they're all super hot, like Dorith used to be a suicide girl, but if you come in for some customers, you get a taste of our weed, you get a taste of our lady, all right? So what I'm trying to say is that we have a massage parlor in the back, but what you do, so if you buy some weed, you can actually get a happy ending. You don't even have to get a massage dude, you can just get the happy ending too, you know? Like you don't have to go through like them touching your back and stuff. Come to the my dispensary, Chinese Hills, in Glendora, next to the Kia Auto Mall, I've been sent by Dump Trust Family Hour, just spread the word out there. First time customers give you a free little pocket pipe, and pocket pipe is good dude. Just like have a little quick full sesh to yourselves, all right y'all, it's Ty calling out, peace. In the old days, back before people had gasoline powered cars, when everybody worked on farms and it was quite common to get gangrene, or to hear the screams of your younger brother coming in from the winter fields of your farm because he was being mauled by a rampaging pack of deadly rabies infected bears, or when it was common for your sister to get dragged out of your house by fundamentalist Christians and burn at the stake because someone's milk cow had suddenly started producing sour milk, or the days when most people only had one eyeball and teeth were considered more valuable than gold, people weren't able to go into their cars and drive to Target or Best Buy or Wal-Mart if they wanted to get products for their farm homes. They had to order from a catalog and it would take six months for their barrel of salted pork or their liniment ointment that they used to rub on their laprodic wounds festering on their arms because for the entire year they had only been eating possum entrails and dirt. By the time your product arrived it would more than likely be covered with the blood of the delivery people who had brought it to you. There would be bits of scalp and brain tissue smattered on your new work pants. But you had to deal with it because there weren't stores nearby. Well now we have stores nearby, but going to stores is an existential horror story. Going to a store these days will put you in the exact same place that reading SART will put you. You don't want to go to Target or Wal-Mart and be reminded that we're all slowly being sucked into some kind of plastic, vapid ocean of meaningless symbols. Nobody wants that reminder. You don't want to stare into the sad eyes of the cashier who's dreaming of the few hours that she has at her house not having to find Sopranos DVDs for morbidly obese abusive husbands drunk from Budweiser midday. You don't have to deal with that crap anymore. Let me tell you a story, something awful that just happened to me. I ran out of toilet paper and I wandered down to the local mini-mart right down the street from me and bought toilet paper. This toilet paper was somehow a combination of, it was thin grit. It's as though somebody used a scalpel to shave the three-day beard from the face of an alcoholic sailor who had died while floating on a raft in the middle of the ocean. And somehow thin yet very, very painful on the asshole. This is bad stuff and it's what I get for running out of toilet paper. Well as it turns out, Amazon.com, they don't just sell books, DVDs, computers, pressure cookers, screwdrivers. They also sell basic stuff like toilet paper, like toothbrushes, like dental floss, like toothpaste or shampoo. All of this is really good news for me because I don't like going to Target. I don't like breathing that alien air that feels like it has been burped into your face by some enormous ancient hell being that's trying to rot the very soul of all humanity. I like to order from the safety of my cathedral home. I am a rock. I am an island and a rock does not go to Target and an island does not go to Best Buy. So if you're thinking about buying anything, whatever it is, ask yourself, do I want to drive to get this thing or can I wait two days and order from Amazon and have the thing delivered to my house? And if the answer is I can wait two days and order from Amazon, then why not go to the Amazon.com portal located at DuncanTrussell.com. If you go on the comments section of any of these episodes and click on the portal, you will be taken to Amazon.com, order whatever you need to order and we will get a very small percentage at no extra cost to you. So that's a way that you can simultaneously support the podcast that Barack Obama called the safest and most family friendly podcast of 2013 while also supplying yourself with all the various things that a home needs without having to rub shoulders with freaks who are buying implements for their rape kits. Play it safe. Go to Amazon.com and go through our portal at DuncanTrussell.com and the comments section of this very podcast that you're listening to now. We're also sponsored by audible.com. You can get a free audio book by going to audibletrial.com forward slash family hour. If you sign up for a trial membership, they will give you a free audio book and audio books are great, especially if you're someone who finds themselves unfortunately stuck in that metallic river of hell that we call traffic. If you have a commute, if you're someone who has a bunch of auditions, if you're a delivery driver or for whatever reason, you end up trapped in that terrible, slow moving river of desperation that consists of metallic shells that have at their nucleus sad, lonely, unhappy people trying to hold back their anger and not scream in existential agony at the realization that they are one tiny moat of sadness that has somehow been pulled into a cyclone of consumerism that is at this very moment powering the engine of the United States government, which recently just shut down. You don't have to spend your time in that terrible metal coffin drifting down that river to someplace that you don't want to go and listening to terrestrial radio, having your poor little ears filled with the conditioning of the reptilian overlords who have managed to infect music with their sick messages of consumerism and meaningless empty hump sex. You can spend your time listening to Shakespeare, Stephen King, or if you really want to have a blast, why not roll up your tinted windows and listen to a thousand shades of gray and have an erotic car ride? That way you can at least orgasm on your way to work or wherever you happen to be going. Go to audibletrial.com forward slash family hour, sign up for a trial membership, you can download an audio book, and they send us 15 bucks. And if you want to cancel, I think you've got 30 days to cancel, so you can actually cancel your membership, but you're probably not going to want to because it's fun to get new credits and download audio books that you can listen to. It's also a great way to pass time when you're on the treadmill, or if you've grown bored of walking your wretched little dog around the block, then you can, I'm sorry I called your dog wretched. I love my boy, I love my little fox, but sometimes it's boring to walk him. And I like to put in an audio book and listen to that while I'm walking him. I'm still listening to Stephen King's The Stand because it's something like 900 hours, so I'll probably be listening to that for the next four years. So go to audibletrial.com forward slash family hour and sign up. We're also brought to you by Sure Design T-shirts. Sure Design T-shirts create some of the softest T-shirts on earth.

And if you really want to go wild, you can even donate. But we don't expect any of this from you. We just want you to listen and enjoy the podcast. And if you don't like these advertisements, you can always skip ahead. You don't even have to listen to them. So Hare Krishna, I hope you all are doing well. Today's guest is returning to the Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour podcast. He is an author who has written the incredibly interesting and deeply controversial book called Sex at Dawn, which explores the ideas of monogamy and open relationships from an anthropological scientific perspective. It's a fantastic book. It's one of those books that can really shift your thinking when it comes to monogamy, or it can help you understand why sometimes things might get a little weird in monogamous relationships. Highly recommend the book. I also recommend his excellent podcast, Tangentially Speaking. There will be a link to that at dunkintrussell.com. Now everyone, please welcome back to the Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour. My dear friend, Dr. Chris Ryan. Welcome back. It's so good to see you. It's so good to be here, man. We're just hanging out. Before the podcast started, we've been drinking wine, catching up. You're always in and out of LA. I'm in and out. That's me. I'm your in and out man. Wow. Is that such a thing? It's like a back door, man, I guess. I remember when I found out, because you know that song Back Door Man by Jim Morrison. The doors, yeah, I just heard it. Yeah. I didn't. I swear, I didn't know what that was until way too late in my life. I didn't know that means he likes to put his cock into women's assholes. You know, I thought for a long time it just meant doggy style. That's back when I was innocent. Yeah, I remember when I used to, yeah. I can remember watching the Howling 2 or 3, I don't remember which Howling it was. Remember the Howling movies? I don't think I saw that. Even if erotic werewolf movies, but I remember watching the Howling with a friend of mine and people were fucking doggy style and I remember saying to my friend, they're doing it in the ass and my friend's like, no, you can have sex doggy style and it doesn't mean it. And I was young, but I remember the look he gave me, I've been ashamed every three years. What is, what do you, is, um, what are the, let me start off with a really big question. What are the secrets? How do you make anal sex work? Uh, well, first of all, of course, you know, consent is, you know, obviously that's not a place to go uninvited. Right. And it's all about the, you know, I want to say the woman and be heteronormative here, but it's about the receiver being completely relaxed and the way that happens is by getting into it very gradually. So it's a lot of lube and it's a finger first. And it's not, and it's giving that person complete control. So when she says, stop, you stop, right? Right. Always. When she says, that's too much, take it out, you take it out. So that, you know, and then that person is able to trust you that you're not going to, because, because the, you know, you, you fear and every sphincter muscle in your body compresses, right? It tightens up. The thing you're trying to overcome is her fear that you're going to hurt her or I am, if you're gay. And so the, the key is that that person knows there's nothing to fear here and then they can relax and they're amazed at how much they can relax. And then once that, once they get through that psychological hump, so to speak, then, then it's easy. Is it as pleasurable for what? Or so they say. A friend of mine told me. Right. Like you have to hide that. I hope my mother's not listening. And when I do a podcast with you, I think, I hope my mother's not listening to this. You wrote a book. Not about ass fucking. That launched photo, photon missiles into monogamy. Yeah. Isn't everything fine after that? I don't know. I honestly have no idea. Do you think your mom would be offended if she heard you talking about anal sex? I don't think she'd be offended. But I think it would make her uncomfortable and it would make me uncomfortable to know she was listening. Oh, moms. Yeah. Moms and dads. Yeah. Well, let me ask you this. And Mrs. Ryan, Ms. Ryan, if you're listening, I apologize. I don't think she's listening. I'm asking for a friend. Yeah. Is it more, do you think it's more pleasurable for men than it is for women because of the prostate? Oh, to be fucked in the ass. Yeah. Well, I've never. I've never. I've never. I've never. I've never. I've never. I've never. I've never. Oh, to be fucked in the ass. Yeah. Well, I've never been in that position. Me either. So I don't really know. I, you know, the whole prostate stimulation thing, I've looked into it a bit and I don't know whether I've just got a faulty prostate or what, but it didn't, I didn't really get it. Maybe I didn't do it right or whatever. But I don't know. I mean, I think it's, I think it's a very psychological thing. Right. You know, and the older I get, the more the whole sexual enterprise becomes psychological. I, you know, it's, it's, it used to be a very physical thing for me, like just pleasure. And I kind of felt like I was, you know, a day I didn't have sex was a wasted day. Yes. And, but now I'm 51 or two or somewhere in there. And I feel like it's, it's become more about the mind now. You know, I'm much more interested. So to the extent that that's interesting to me, it's interesting because it's forbidden and it's like maybe something this person's never done before. And so she trusts me to, you know, and she wants to do it with me because she trusts me and it's this deep thing. So it's all about the mind and the relation and the connection. Yes. The, the sensation, whatever. Man, I have always been damned to the mind with sex. I have never been able to enjoy in any real way, just like that physically just fucking I'm way too in my head. So if I, and I haven't done a lot of it, but the times that it has happened where I find myself, you know, in a one night stand as they call it, I always end up like one. I'm drunk probably. I'm not sober. So maybe that's part of the problem, but I go into my mind and I just think, what is this? Look at you. It's not like I'm ashamed, but it's like, you're like, when the dog humps, my dog has a humping frog. It's got a, he's got a stuffed animal that of all the stuffed animals he likes to hump. You just see it, like whatever happens, it touches this cock, activates something and he just starts humping this frog. Does it have a semen receptacle you can put in the dishwasher? It's whole body is a semen receptacle. I don't know if he can jizz because I think his balls got chopped off. We're talking about a fox here? Fox. Oh, I should give you the picture I took of you and Fox. You can put up on the post, right? So your listeners can see Fox. But when you see that thing, you know, whatever it is that happens where all of a sudden he goes into a humping mode and he's just humping and humping and humping, kind of even looking at you and this kind of like, I don't know either man, it's just happening. I know that look. Something about my mind. When I see myself doing the exact same thing, it feels so absurd that to really get into that kind of like, yeah, baby, yeah, take it. I can't do it. Yeah. But the mental thing when I feel like a woman wants me and I want her and there's this sense of like connection. I mean, these days, everyone's so crazy. I feel like a pervert saying that that's what gets me off. But that really is the thing that turns me on the most. Yeah. I mean, I don't know that you're cursed by that. I would say there's a maturity and a sophistication in that. I wonder, I wonder about that. Like I wonder, is it maturity or is it fear? I wonder, is it maturity or if it's disidentification with the body? Is it the, you know what I mean? Good point. Yeah. Isn't there something glorious about the Dionysian festival? So can you take a shit without like watching yourself take a shit? I can't take a shit without ejaculating. There's your problem right there. I think we've identified the problem. That's why anal sex doesn't work for you. You gotta be going out. You got Santorum all over the place. Shitting doesn't bother me. I don't really have many problems. I mean, I don't like, you know, I would prefer to shit in private. I don't want to shit in front of a person really, you know, like. Have you ever done that? You ever shit in public? Never have. Dude, I have shit in public so many times. I've had the most public shit imaginable. Where? You want to? This is a horrible story. I've never told in public. This is one of these stories. I've got this idea to monetize my podcast, intentionally speaking. Yes. One of the ideas is that I'll tell these crazy fucking stories and you can pay 99 cents for them, you know, as opposed to the interviews. Yeah. So this is one of the stories. I was in a place called Pushkar, India. Long time ago. It was like 89 or something. Yes. Pushkar is the second holiest place in the Hindu world. Why? After Varanasi. Because apparently Krishna was walking through the desert and he saw something. I don't remember what it was. A woman, a girl who'd been raped or someone dying or something terrible made him cry. His tear dropped up in the desert and it formed this perfectly round, beautiful lake. Pushkar Lake. And I came to this place in India. I was hating India. I'd been there a couple months. I'd been up to Kashmir. I'd had all these adventures and stuff. But I was like, I hated it. It was overwhelming for me. All the people everywhere and the sensory overload just blew my mind. And I got to Pushkar and because it's a holy place, no internal combustion engines are allowed in the village. The village is beautiful. It's built all around this lake. They have what they call ghats, which are like steps leading down into the water. Yes. Every night at sunset, the holy men lead their followers to the water's edge. They have these lanterns on chain swinging and they like wash their faces in the holy waters of the Pushkar Lake. And there's no meat in the town at all. So it's all vegetarian. Wow. And they have bang, you know, bang. Marijuana. Yeah, it's like a marijuana tofu preparation. Yes. And they put it into lassi. So you can get these bang lassi. Yes. And it's like the best marijuana brownie you've ever had. You're like just, it's so subtle, but you're just pleasantly stoned for like five hours. Sure. It's fantastic. So when I got to this place, I was like, fuck it, I'm not leaving. This is, I'm going to stay here. Yeah. So I got, there's this place called the Pushkar Palace Hotel, which had been the Maharaja's palace for years. It's all white, washed, you know, pale. It's kind of like Greek, you know, with bougainvillea growing. Wow. Walls around it and beautiful courtyards and all that. And, you know, rooms were like, you know, two bucks a night or something. Oh, India is so great. Yeah, India. Or you could stay in the dorm room, you know, for 50 cents. Yeah. But I, you know, pushed it a little further and I, and this is desert. Okay. This is like really desert. And there was, it's like three stories. And then there was a water tower and you could climb up this ladder and you're up on top of the water tower. And it was like a three meter by three meter square with a little wall about half a meter high. Yes. And I just, so I said, can I just sleep up on the roof? And they're like, yeah, 25 cents a night. Okay. 25 cents a night. Wow. And I've got the best spot in this fucking town, right? Wow. I swear, the first night I slept there, I was lying there. There's so many stars because they turn off all the electricity at 10 o'clock. So all this, there's, so it's just dark except for, you know, around in the desert. You'll see like someone out in the desert with them. They have a camel festival there every year. This was before the Rafter, the festival. I don't remember. But anyway, so I was there and I was lying on this rooftop. It's completely dark. Stars like everywhere, fucking stars, man. Like shooting star, boom, shooting star, boom, shooting star. I saw two shooting stars cross in the sky. Wow. Who sees that? You know? Amazing place. You know, just incredible place. So I stayed up there for a long time. And every night. How long? Well, I was there about three weeks until the story I'm about to, this thing happened. And then I left and went to Gisle, Mary, and did some other stuff. And then I went back for New Year's. Three weeks sleeping on top of a water tower. Yeah, it never, it never rains, you know? And so I met this Australian guy who's still one of my best buddies, Sean, and, you know, he really knew how to travel. I didn't. I had flown there directly from Manhattan. I got a one-way ticket from Manhattan to New Delhi. And I'd packed like 70 pounds in my backpack. I had a tent and a sleeping bag and all, you know, water filters and all this shit. And Sean was cruising around with a shoulder bag. Wow. You know, he knew what he was doing. Anyway, so I, so one night, you know, it's India, your stomach gets messed up. So one night I'm lying up there and I felt kind of queasy. I woke up and it's like, oh shit. You know, you get that feeling where you're like, I'm going to puke in 20 seconds. Yes. So I don't want to puke on my little square area here, right? And on three sides, there are rooftops of the other floors, but on the fourth side, it goes all the way down to the, the cafe breakfast area where there are like tables set up for breakfast in the morning and there's a table with a juicer and all this. And there's a sidewalk, but between the sidewalk and the wall is a strip of grass about half a meter wide. Okay. So I, and there's no wind. It's completely dark. So I lean out over this wall and just let it go. You know, and it goes straight down and straight down. And you know, I was sound asleep when this happened. So then I went back to sleep and forgot all about it. So I got up in the morning, went down for breakfast and I was waiting in line at the juicing machine and I looked and there was this tiny little puddle of completely dried up vomit giblets because it's desert dried up overnight. Yeah. And I was like, and I was reminded of Ernest Hemingway's line that courage is grace under pressure. You like targeted a puke. I was like, you know, hey, I had little time to think. I was in a tight spot. I executed. I conceived. I executed. I'm a fucking pro traveler. I am a cool dude. Right. So OK, a week later, I'm up there. Same thing. Sound asleep. Wake up in the middle of the night. In 20 seconds, you're going to shit. Right. So I've been here before. Right. So it's called the lights are off. Everything's cool. There's no wind. So I leave my ass out over this wall and I let it go. You know, it's like I did the test run, man. So I let it go. I like wipe my ass off. I fall back asleep. Forget about it. OK. Now I should tell you the hotel was owned by a British Countess who was married to an Indian guy. Some upper class Indian guy. And for some reason she liked me and Sean. I don't know. We're intellectuals or something. Right. She liked chatting with us because we were sophisticated or whatever. So we used to have breakfast with her. So the next morning I get up, I go down and her two cousins had arrived from England. So they're at this table and I sit down and she said, oh, Chris, this is my cousin. I know. Would you like some juice? And we're talking and I sort of look up and my shit is running down this white wall four story wall all the way from the top all the way to the bottom. Just shit. And everybody knew. Like I was the guy who lived up there because they'd seen me up there watching the sunsets and so cool. Like, oh, that guy's up on the water tower. He's cool. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh my God. So what did you do? Did you fess up? Well, no. I tried. So I'm like stunned. Right. I was like, it was like, you know, you get the call like, you know, Los Angeles is gone. There's been a meteor. Yeah. So I just like got up and I walked to the room where Sean was sleeping. Yes. And I woke him up. I said, Sean, you're not going to believe this, man. And what? Like, man, I just, I shit down the wall. Like, it's what? And he jumps up and he runs out and he's laughing his ass off. So of course that, you know, so then. The shit down the wall. Of the palace. Sean. Sean, wake up. I've done it. I've done it this time. So then I'm walking. I go to the shower, the shower bathroom area and there's this little tunnel and like the groundskeeper was named Serendra. Beautiful. Beautiful name. So, and he like confronts me in this tunnel and he says, you're just there. And I said, what? What? You're just there. I'm sorry. Serendra. I don't understand. You're just there. And then finally somebody, because now we're blocking traffic through the tunnel and somebody says, he's asking if you have dysentery. Oh, yeah. No, that was a monkey. Great. Great save. I said they were monkeys. Were there monkeys in the desert? There are lots of monkeys in Pushcar, but none of them up on my tower. Yeah. And so the Indian people were like, come on dude, no monkeys. There's no monkey. So yeah, so I have shit in public. Wow. That is the most glorious story of shitting in public. There's so many shitting in public stories you hear. Many of them are like when someone talks about a dream. You don't really care. It's like whatever. That is like a world record. That was pretty dramatic. Shitting in public story. Like four months later, I went to Kathmandu and I was looking for Sean's sister who I'd never met, but he told me she's in Kathmandu. Look her up. So I get to Kathmandu. I go to this guest house and I go to the room where she's supposed to be. And it turns out it's like 15 Australians like hanging out, getting drunk and high and partying, right? And I come in and I'm like, yeah, is Diana? Diana? Is she around here somewhere? And I'm like, who are you? I'm Sean's friend. We met in India. And they're like, are you the guy who shot down the wall? I'm so glad that you told this story for the first time. Is this the first time you told it? It's the first time I've told it publicly. What an honor. Send me 99 cents if you enjoyed that story. Yeah, but yeah. Tip Chris Ryan for that beautiful shit story. Tip Duncan for the shit story. I'm going to get some wine. Hold on. Let's cut for a second. You know, man, when I went to India, I did not have a good experience with bonglassies. That was not a gentle high. It was a wretched, not wretched, but we were in Varnaasi and wait, no. Yeah, Varnaasi. That's where the burning got. Right? Yeah, we were in Varnaasi and we were staying at some, for the people who've never been to India or even thought about going to any, they don't understand that this is an alien planet. It's like going to an alternate dimension. Yeah, I remember thinking when I was there, this is as far away as I could get from New York or wherever my life was without leaving the planet Earth. Yes. Yes. Yes. It is like going to an alien planet, still inhabited by humans, but the culture there is so vastly different. Their relationship with death is so much healthier. In the West, you know, we were freaked out by death. We hide it. Like right now at this moment, guaranteed probably enough two mile radius, there's at least three people dying right now or two people dying. Rough neighborhood. Is that not a good statistic? I just made it up. That's a hippie statistic. You know, that's a funny thing about Google is you could like search hippie statistics, hippies ramble about and shut them down. The point is, many people though are dying around you at all times. We don't see it. We put them in a car, drive away, whereas in Varnaasi, this is the city of where the Ganges River runs through and it's where it's considered a sacred place to get your ashes tossed. Straight to heaven. Straight to heaven. So when you're in Varnaasi, you just see bodies everywhere. Bodies coming down the street, bodies on fire, bodies being incinerated. The smell of barbecue in the air all the time. People selling. I want one surreal experience I had in Varnaasi. There was a lot of surreal. The whole thing's surreal, but like I was walking, I was sick. This is when I finally got sick in India. So I was just starting to get nice Indian diarrhea and I was sick and heading to like try to get some Pepto Bismarck and I was getting something that I thought might help and I passed this man selling wood for the cremation gods and it's like it's morning. There's smoke in the air from burning bodies, stacks of wood, the Ganges River. This is not earth anymore. This is really is like a midway point between this life and whatever might lay beyond. It's futile. He's like, how are you doing? And I'm like, ah, I'm all right. How are you? And he's like, I'm wonderful. This is Varnaasi, so I'm in heaven. And it's like fucking bodies being burned nearby. It was really intense, but when I drank the Bong Lassi, there were a lot of like we went out. This is, I hadn't gone on the Ganges River. It was just one of these spontaneous things where we're like, ah, weed Varnaasi, you can get bong. It's weed. And I asked the people at the hotel where they were staying at, can you make us a Bong Lassi? And they're like, yes, and they had that glitter in their eye, that fucking glitter that now I recognize because it's the glitter Rogan gets and Joey Diaz gets whenever they give me weed to eat. And I'll always eat a third of it. You see it coming. Yeah. It's that thing where like we're about to send you to Venus, but at the time I didn't know that glitter. So I'm like, great. We're going to go and gulp it down. And the, the, we're walking out of the hotel. Is this your buddy from the podcast? Emel. Yeah. Emel, the other guy, right? We're walking out of the hotel. Musician. Yes. We were walking out of the hotel to go to the Ganges River because like let's get stoned and go float down the Ganges River. Not nothing. There's, that's the thought. I didn't go deeper into the thought. You go deeper into the thought and you think, wait, you're going to eat marijuana, a quantity you don't understand and then take a boat onto a river that is considered to be the most sacred river on planet earth where from the middle of the river you're going to be watching bodies getting incinerated and parts of them floating by babies, dead babies floating by and on the other side, wild dogs chewing on the remnants of carcasses that washed up on the shore. No consideration of any of this. We get into the boat and I'm starting to get really high and the oarsmen are paddling the boat. It's that, we sounded just the boat and the water and the oars touching the water and then the sun's going down. You could see Varanasi, the funeral pyres are rising up. The old men with the beards and the bells standing up to their waist and the water and the bells ringing and people are dancing around funeral pyres and then my friend Emel is like leans in to me and he goes, the oarsmen are using telepathy to control our minds. I just had a hippie thought for you. He said it was such certainty though from his paranoid state, I guess it made sense. Such certainty, not like joking, he just realized they're implanting thoughts into our minds. That was one of the most intense marijuana trips but bonglassies are not always smooth and soft. No, well I only got them from this one restaurant in Pushkar and the first time I had one, I had been, like I said, I had been in Kashmir which is Muslim and I had had a lot of really intense experiences up in Kashmir and now it's like you can't even go there, it's all Pakistani terrorism and it's a really intense thing. I stayed on a houseboat on Dal Lake in Srinagar which was really interesting but that's a whole other story. Why? Why is that another story? There are so many different stories but the point I was going to make was when I got to Pushkar, I had a bonglassie and I was walking back to the hotel from the little village and the first thing, the thing as often happens when you eat marijuana, you don't realize you're getting high and then you just notice something and you're like, oh, that's right, I must be high. You're like, wow, that red's really red. I was walking back and I saw a cow, there are cows everywhere and this cow just sort of looked at me and there was a woman by the side of the road who was talking about shitting in public, an old lady who was taking a shit by the side of the road and she saw me and she smiled and she put out her hand asking me for a coin or whatever. And in that moment I was like, I get it. I get India. I get it. It's cool. Everything's cool. Now I get it. And I stopped resisting. It's kind of like anal sex. It was that moment where I was like, oh, okay, it's not going to hurt me. I can relax. And suddenly like, oh, this is great. And from that moment on, I really enjoyed India but for the five or six weeks before that, I was suffering. I hated it. Have you had that moment in the United States yet? No, I'll never have that moment here. No, because coming to the United States is a surreal thing for me. It's because obviously I'm American. I grew up here but I've been living overseas for more than 20 years, more than half of my life I've been out of the country. So coming back, it's like a recurring dream or something. It's like, I know exactly how this works but it's still foreign. It's still weird. Weird. I've been in LA for four days. I've been driving around in my dad's car. I don't have like an iPod or whatever to plug into it so I listen to the radio, right? Classic rock, whatever I scan, you know? I've heard Frankie goes to Hollywood singing, you know, relax, don't do it, like nine times in the last four days. Like what the fuck? What is that? I don't know. It's like going back in time when I come here. Well, you're listening to FM radio. I'm listening to FM radio and it's just like... Which is like listening to toilets flush. Yeah, and also, I mean you get some good shit or whatever but the point is it's like... Or TV, you know? I'm at my parents' house so the TV's on and the commercials. Like, I haven't watched commercials in English. You know, I don't watch Spanish TV at all but, you know, I download shit on Netflix or whatever. I never watch. And it's just like, wow, this is fucked up here. But they're speaking my language which makes it... How do you think it's fucked up? How would you define the type of fucked up that this place is? Like in India, you might say it's fucked up because you'll see lepers crawling through mud and women shitting themselves while they ask you for money. In the United States, why would you say it's fucked up? How would you say it's fucked up? I would say it's fucked up sort of... And this is why India is so interesting. It's almost like a 180 degree difference in its fuck-up-ed-ness. In that India is so in-your-face reality. You know, like poverty, that's fucking poverty. That's like someone who's starving right in front of you, right? And the disease is like everything is there, visible. Whereas in the US, it's like an entire culture built on denial. You know, the whole... This is this giant edifice of distracting you from what really matters and what really counts. What is that? What are we being distracted from? From the reality of life. Like as you said, the fact that people die, right? And deal with that. And you're gonna die. Deal with that. Like have that be part of your awareness of what life is. Like poverty, you know? Like, oh no, poverty, whatever. It's not happening right in front of me. In LA, you see it. You know, there's real down and out shit in LA. It's kind of like America is this gothic, the classic southern gothic plantation house where in the basement is the incest child that they're ashamed of. So they keep it down there as much as they can. Because in America, you know that there are people dying of AIDS. Well, that's happening right now. You know, I don't know when you're gonna post this. But right now we're like an hour or something away from a government shutdown because the Republicans don't want poor people to have health care. Yes. And what the fuck, man? And let me just say this. I need, this is a good time for me to say this. Because I rail against Obama all the time because I don't like the drone program. Oh, yeah. It bugs the shit out of me. But I must say that I got a letter from my health insurance company saying that I now get to reapply for a different plan. And in the letter, it says we are no longer legally allowed to deny you based on pre-existing conditions. Which means that because of my ball cancer, if I wanted to do a different plan to get more coverage, I couldn't do it. Right. Because I have ball cancer and so now I had a pre-existing condition. Lucky for you, you had insurance before you got the ball cancer. Yes. How many guys, single dudes your age, have health insurance? Man, since I got it, you know, people, guys, you know, I was at the ice house and a guy came up to me and he's like, man, I don't have insurance and one of my balls is like really swollen and I don't think it's good and I don't know what to do. And of course, I'm like, look, man, it doesn't matter about insurance. Like, you got to go. You'll die. It'll spread and it'll just get, you won't die. It's generally survival, but it'll spread and be more and more expensive to cure. Yeah. But the fact that there are a group of these withered old shit fucks. With government insurance, by the way, for them and their families. Yes. Trying to roadblock this thing is quite dark, isn't it? Yeah. That's dark. Yeah. So that's, I mean, in that, that's part of the whole picture I see in this country, like the whole thing, it's just all bullshit all the time, you know? Like, oh, let's watch the NFL this Monday night football. You know, oh, let's, but let's not talk about brain damage. Let's not talk about all the, you know, offensive and defensive linesmen who at 55 can't fucking walk or hold a cup of coffee in their hand. You know, it's, or let's talk about poisonous friendships. Let's take it to a deeper level in the fracture fractal. What about the poisonous friendships that can spring up? I don't know if it happens in other parts of the world, but where you have a relationship. What about the poisonous relationships where in the relationship you're acting like, oh, we're so in love or we have this marriage yet you are both cutting each other to pieces at any chance that you get pretending that that's not happening. Well, I think that happens in other cultures too. Oh, it does. Yeah. In Spain, there's a, there's a really bad problem with men killing their wives. All right. Like old, old couples who've been together 30, 40 years, you know, they just like throw each other out of the window and shit, you know? And it's, yeah. Yeah. I think that's more about the institution of marriage than it is about American culture. Yeah. But I mean, the other thing American culture like war, we're the most war-like society in the world and yet it's 1% of the people we never see them except for when they freak out and shoot a bunch of people, you know? They're not getting healthcare. They're not getting medical care. They're a three year waiting list to see a psychiatrist if you have PTSD and you're a veteran, you know, the highest prison population as a percentage of population in the world. Yes. And it's like this country is full of shit, you know? And they're still saying we're number one, bullshit. There's nothing, you're not number one in anything except throwing people in prison or executing them or turning your back on the poor. It's, so I think that on the good side, it's a very dynamic place and it seems like we're at a turning point. It seems like we're at a point where people are listening to your podcast and reading books that, that question the dominant paradigm. So I think we're at a point where young people are like, fuck this, this, this doesn't work and looking for a new way to do it. But unfortunately, we still have these old fucks in Congress and. Oh, they won't last. Do you think this is a, do you think this thing that's the thing you're talking about there with people resisting the violence and resisting the repression of information that's happening in the country? Do you think that's part of like what the New Agers called the global awakening that they have been predicting since the 80s or is it, do you believe in that stuff? Do you subscribe to that stuff? You know, I really didn't until I started, you know, I've had a couple of conversations with Rogan who you introduced me to and he's into that. You know, he really believes in the power of the internet and, you know, and I've talked to some other people who really believe in that and I guess I've been, I've been swayed a bit by that. I tend to be more cynical and look at structural issues. You know what I mean? Like, you know, people say, oh, we got to get out, turn out the vote and vote these people out of Congress. I look at gerrymandering and say, yeah, the game's rigged, you know, every game is rigged at this point from Wall Street to DC to whatever it is, but I do think there's some, there's something very valuable about young people. For example, on my Facebook page, that's a Sex at Dawn fan page sort of in the last six months, you know how it tells you like people who have liked the page recently and are following it? Yes. I've seen hundreds of people from Iran and you can tell because they have that weird script, the beautiful script, you know, and it's like, wow, a lot of people in Iran are tuning into this. That's pretty cool. And that wasn't possible 10 years ago or 20 years ago. Because sexuality is a way to be revolutionary without having to get caught on fire by a government. Right. And it's a very revolutionary act. You know, we had people in Iran translate our book to Persian. They wrote to me and said, can we do this? So there is a sexual revolution happening in Iran because I've heard that. Yeah. A big sexual revolution happening and there's, I don't remember the percentage, but a huge amount of the population proportionally is under 30. So it's a young, young country. Right. You know, what it is, is that there is this sort of, if you were to look at the, if you were to turn the sort of, I don't know, dominant paradigm into a planet, then you would have, what do you call that? You're a doctor. So you probably know this. What do you call the crust, the ex, the, the highest crust of the planet? What's that called? Oh, isn't it just the crust? I don't doctors know every planet. Why? I ain't that kind of doctor. Whatever it's called. Don't y'all know every answer to every question. It's called the, there's the external, the top most crust of the earth. And there's the mantle. The mantle. And underneath that is magma, red, hot, potent, magma, free land. It's what made Hawaii, right? Still making it. On top of it is all this old shitty crust. Right. Well, that old shitty crust right now are all these old, country men and women who unfortunately got indoctrinated into a really repressive ideology. No matter what part of the world it is, for whatever reason, a lot of people got scared. They were raised by frightened people and they turned into like very angry, fucked up leader types. That's the crust of the subjective, or the, the planet that we're in right now socially. Hmm. And right underneath that is this like, roiling magma and that roiling magma is you see it exploding out from time to time. And I think most recently you saw it explode out when Obama had to go patting down his little red carpet and say, all right, we're not going to bomb Syria because the fucking magma came out from every side in the UK for the first, what was it, the first time in however many hundreds, hundreds of years. They were like, we're not going with that. No. Yeah. We're not doing it. Yeah. And the reason is because there's an instant connectivity to the representatives from the public and that didn't used to exist. Back in the 1800s, if you wanted to let your representative know that you didn't want to go to war, right? How would you do that? Yeah. What do you write a, write on a scroll and have, have your slave ride a donkey into DC. You can't do it now. It's like an instantaneous transmission and it's happening in mass. So I think that that's, that's what, what, what's beautiful and terrifying about what's happening right now is that in any time there's a volcano, it's generally, it tends to be a violent eruption. It's not a. Yeah. The problem is that when the magma comes to the surface, it becomes crust. It gets sprayed with mace too. Meet the old boss same as the new, or meet the new boss same as the old boss, you know, it, it. That's a fear. Yeah. I mean, you, one of the things, yeah, I'm working on this book called civilized to death and it's sort of about these issues that you and I both love talking about. And one of the things I'm looking at is politics, right? And how modern politics differs from the politics of our hunter gatherer ancestors. Right. And what's so interesting is that in pre-agricultural societies and people who haven't read Sex at Dawn or, or haven't listened to me, you know, do my spiel don't, may not know that for 99% of our existence as a species, we were hunter gatherers and there are consistencies in the way hunter gatherers interact with each other and the way they live and organize their societies and all that. And then about 10,000 years ago, there was this extreme shift where everything changed from the way men relate to women, the way adults relate to children, the way we relate to the natural world, the way we get food, the way we, you know, the way violent societies interact with other societies, everything changed. And so the, we're indoctrinated to believe that this very recent reality is the reality, is in fact, it's just the crust on the planet, right? In fact, I was looking at numbers. And if you look at American history in terms of the 200,000 years of our existence as a modern species, and you sort of do the proportions to only look at post-agricultural societies, which is the Greeks, the Romans, you know, blah, blah, the Egyptians and so on, is like, you know, saying, let's look at American history, but let's start in 2002. Wow. You know, that's how small the percentage is. Wow. And we don't even care. All the hunter-gatherer stuff are like, whatever. Whatever. 20th century, 19th century, it doesn't matter. Yeah. Let's just look at, you know, 2002 till now, right? Wow. And that'll tell us what's real. Sorry, man. That doesn't work. But anyway, the thing about politics that's so interesting is that in hunter-gatherer societies, you become a leader because people follow you. You don't become a leader because you want to be a leader. In fact, the worst thing you can do, like the number one disqualification for leadership is showing any interest in being a leader. Wow. That's genius. Because it's ego, right? Because only the smartest people, the smartest people are like, I am not going to be a fucking leader. I don't want to tell people what to do, right? But if you ask my opinion, well, my opinion is I think we should go to the river for the winter because it's a little warmer in that valley and there are normally fish we can eat. That's my opinion. And people say, he's normally right. This guy makes some good decals. Let's do that. Okay, let's do that. So you're the leader for that, right? But the thing is leadership is completely fluid. It's all based upon the respect with which people hold you. And the leaders tend to be the poorest people because they share the most. They're the most dedicated to the idea that everything is shared. So like a leader might be a really good hunter, but he and his family don't get more meat than other people. And in fact, there are all these mechanisms built into the societies to protect. I was reading this account from an anthropologist who was living with people in Botswana, I think, studying them for a while, and he decided to try to repay them for all their generosity. He went and he found in the region he was in, he went all around and he found the fattest best ox he could find because they were having some sort of party and he bought this ox and he brought the ox and he presented it to them like, hey, I want to help out in New Sears. And he was really hurt because this old woman was like, Jesus, you don't know anything about buying meat, do you? Like you bring us this bag of bones and then someone else was like, oh, I don't think there's going to be food for everybody on this thing. I know we're going to have to go hunting and they just like pissed all over his offering. And he got really hurt and he's like, what the fuck, man? I thought this was a great ox. I mean, I'm trying to help out and finally one of the people took him aside and said, dude, don't worry about it. This is how we do it. You can't, we can't let you be proud of your gift because when people get proud, then they start telling other people what to do and then it ends with them killing somebody. God, I love that so much. That is so sophisticated. That is so sophisticated. Yeah. God, I love that. Yeah. And it's the opposite of how our society is oriented, right? Jesus Christ because the demon is in us because we'll give a thing to a person. We'll give a thing to a person that you love and some piece of you, you almost can't prevent it. Some piece of you will, underneath there will be like, oh, look how great I am. Right. Look at that. Yeah. I'm going to own you now. Could you sign this so I can write this off on my taxes? Wow. No, that's so genius. I think that's so genius because it's like the connection should be with the group, the tribe as a whole, not the individual. It should be, and the most important thing is that we're all working together to be happy. And in a relationship, it's the same way. Relationships get so fucked up when a person is like, see what I've done for you. Do you see all the things I've done for you? Look what I do for you every day, every day, what I've done for this family. That's a very Western thing, isn't it? Yeah. All sense of gratitude. And it's very American as well, I have to say, because we're so individualistic and yeah, but I had a Spanish girlfriend for a long time and she was here visiting my family and all that. And I remember one of the things she said was, you people say thank you all the time. You say thank you. And she used to say to me when I was having lunch with her family, it's like, oh, can I have some wine? Oh, thank you. Oh, thank you. And I was like, well, you shut up with the thank yous. Like, you know, they're giving you food because they love you, man. You don't need to say thank you all the time. You know? We're all like beaten orphans. We're like beaten street urchins that got taken into the mayor's house and given a couple of French fries. Thank you, sir. Oh, my God. Yeah, so you're right. So the United States is a haunted house. We're twisted. We're like the Texas Jainsaw Massacre family. Because at country, we're twisted because we can't accept love. We have a real big problem accepting love because we've been primed to apply the laws of capitalism to relationships because we have capitalistic relationships. So if there's a, if there's a, if there's a, if there's a, everything's in exchange. Yeah. And everything is work oriented. I just read a gray on the flight down here. I read this paper by Peter Gray, who's a developmental psychologist. And he got interested in anthropology and reading about hunter gatherer societies, right? And he's studied kids for most of his career and particularly play. And he'd written about like how, you know, play is so important to psychological development of kids. And when we, and not structured play, right? Just kids hanging out playing, right? And so he started reading anthropology and he realized looking at all these hunter gatherer groups like, wait a minute, the entire hunter gatherer social system is based on play. It's you're there because you want to be, you can quit at any time. It's sharing based. I mean, think about what happens to your ball game if the kid who brings the ball won't let other people touch it. Right. I mean, that doesn't fucking work. And it's like he went, he goes through all these different, you know, characterizations of play and every one of them applies to hunter gather existence. So sometimes there's this debate about what, you know, what I call the neo-Hobbesian vision like Steven Pinker and people like that, who talk about how lucky we are to be alive now because life was so solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short before the start. I'm in that camp. We'll talk about that in a second. Keep going there. Oh, okay. So, I mean, the truth is that anthropologists who have studied hunter gatherers and lived with them, like the guy who bought the ox, have documented that they spend about 20 hours a week on average, including, I'm talking like the Kalahari Bushmen who are in the harshest environment on the planet, spend about 20 hours a week working what we call work, right? But what are they actually doing? They're hanging out with their friends. They're going hunting. You know, the women are going out gathering together. They're chatting. They're not playing with the kids. They're things that we do for vacation. Right. Their whole life, sir. Their whole fucking life is a party. Yes. And that's why when Westerners meet hunter gatherers throughout the historical record, these first contact accounts, every time the Westerners are like, let us show you how to hunt or sorry, let us show you how to farm. And the hunter gatherers are like, sorry, why would we do that? One guy actually said, why would I learn to farm? There's so many mongongo nuts in the world. Right. What's your fucking point? Why do I want to do that? You know, man, I, you know that, I don't know where it comes from, but you know that, the saying, as it was in the beginning, so shall it be in the end. And the meek shall inherit the earth. You know, I love that because I kind of see like where humanity is, is like the asshole teenager phase where if the earth is our mother, yeah, right now we're rebelling against our mother. That's good. We're disrespectful to our parents, just like every teenager. Yeah. Fuck you. I'm going to do what I want. I'm going to act the way I want. You can't control me. Only in this case, it's the planet. And I have a very naive idea, I think, which is that I think that what you're talking about, we're going to get closer to that again in a different way. It'll be a new way. But there's this transitory period. There's that place where the magma comes launching out of the crust where this period of sexually repressed, angry, generally men in control is going to fade away. They're going to die. You know, man, they're going to die. They're giving me the most hopeful vision of social development that I've heard in a long time. I think you're right. It makes a lot of sense. In fact, there's one of the chapters in the book I'm writing is about our relationship to the environment. And in the manuscript right now, the first line is when it comes to Mother Earth, we're all motherfuckers. Yes. Yes. Yes. And we have problems with our moms, you know, like in real life and with the earth. And it's hard to accept, you know, one thing like a mother, once you get to a certain... If you're a kid and your mother like does the thing where she licks her thumb and wipes dirt off your face, you don't even think about it. It's just part of what she does. It's part of the same thing. But when you get older, your mother does that, which is really just a sweet, loving gesture, which is like, I'm going to clean up your face and you're like, stop it. Don't touch me. You're embarrassing me in the same way. Look at us. So separated from earth. So we're so not just separated from earth, but we're separated from the idea of accepting love. And yet we're obsessed with women. Oh, yes. And we're obsessed with nature. Right? I mean, we got our kombucha and our, you know, whatever yoga, whatever bullshit we're doing that's trying to align us with nature and not my study. But I don't think it's bullshit. I think... It's not bullshit, but my point is that it's inherently contradictory. You know? Right. So we're obsessed with the planet and yet we go to Whole Foods thinking we're healing the planet. Yeah. Well, you know, I, as far as the planet stuff goes, I always go back to that wonderful George Carlin bit about the earth and plastic. You know about that? Have you ever heard that bit? I've heard everything he's ever done. So you know the bit where he's like, everyone's worried about plastic, but he's like, maybe that's what the earth wants. Maybe it wants to make plastic. Right? So it's like, he's like, the earth is going to be fine. Humans are fucked. That's what he says. The earth has been through how many different extinctions? The earth has been through so much shit, meteor impacts. Do you really think the radiation from Fukushima or whatever little humans are going to make is really going to fuck up the earth now? Humans are fucked. Now that's where I disagree with Carlin. It's a very cynical bit. I don't think humans are fucked at all because if you go and look at like what's been happening lately, if you turn your eyes away from the psychic sewage that comes pumping out of the mainstream media, man, I could name a few things right now that are happening that are so beautiful. Kenya, if you heard about what happened in Kenya, the, at the mall, the satellites, yeah, the mall, there was like, I don't remember how many people died at, what is it, 40? Yeah, I don't know. 40 people died. It's a tragedy, but if you look at what, in other occurrences, satellites using some new weird geo-scanning technology found enough water for 70 years. Oh, I did read about that. Yeah, huge aquifer under the desert. Yes, yes, yes, 70 years, and I mean, that's wild. That's going to transform the landscape of Kenya from dirt to farmland. The problem is, and we get back to the structure, you know, my structural view of history and economics and all that, the problem is what's going to happen. Chinese who are already buying up Africa are going to come in and either buy or steal land, and then they'll drill down into that aquifer and they'll grow food for China, and it's going to be very difficult for the Kenyans to end up getting any of the money from that. So the Chinese get the food. Right, yeah, and it's colonialism, just like the United States has been getting the oil. Right, but still, someone's getting the food from it. The point is that technology is like, you know, okay, so Kenyans only get to eat food grown in Kenya, and Chinese only get to eat food grown in China, and you know, it's, it we're earthlings, and you know, by the way, I'm, you know, quickly trying to react to that in a real hippie way. It sucks. I hate it. I want the Kenyans, I want it to be, it's a small world. They're all dancing. We can take floats through their beautiful river, but I think that in the course of human history to imagine that things floating in space were able to find a reservoir of water completely undiscovered. But isn't that just like flash bang bullshit? I mean, is it really going to make anyone's life better? I'll show you, I'll show you the video of the Kenyans dancing as the water comes pouring out of the... That's because they think they're going to get the water. I think they are. And you don't know that they're not. Do you know, do you know the worst place in the world to get a decent cup of coffee? Kenya. Well, Kenya, probably, but certainly Guatemala and Nicaragua, which is where a lot of coffee comes from. Or El Salvador. Right? Why? Because you've got corrupt governments, right? United Fruit Company comes in, you know, if the government won't play ball, they just CIA takes them out, puts in a new government that will play ball, then they export all the good shit and the local people get nothing. That's the way it works. It's always worked out. Yeah, but it's not going to keep working that way. Really? No. We know because here's the difference. Unfortunately, out of the earth has spawned a connective neurology that is the internet and the instantaneous exchange of information. The ability to protest now, the ability to map the movement. I wish I agreed with you. Look at what George Clooney just... I think people retweet some bullshit and think they've done their part, including me. Including me. Including me, but that's the... Where's Edward Snowden, right? Where's Julian Assange? Those guys should be winning Nobel Prizes. Where do you think Edward Snowden would be prior to the existence of the internet if he did the same thing? Well, Daniel Ellsberg is a celebrated historical figure. I think Edward Snowden would be feeding worms underneath the ground right now. Well, and he may well be soon. And I think we'd be dropping... No, I think that he already would have been taken out. They would have killed him in a second. Well, what's the difference? You're under Putin's thumb in Russia. You're alive and you've got all the information out and you're a global hero. I don't think he's a global hero. I think most people consider him a criminal. I don't know about that. I don't. You don't. But I... Reddit doesn't. And Reddit represents a huge, huge demographic. I don't think so, man. I think that you get the mainstream media and you get this illusion. Because I was talking to my girlfriend, we're talking about Christians. And the idea of how televangelists and the horror of the... I don't know. There's a clip on the internet of Pat Roberts talking about how gays should just be allowed to die out or some weird shit. Then I start thinking like, okay, aside from the Christians I've seen on TV, what about the Christians I've met in real life? And man, they're all hands down. Awesome. Yeah. Have you seen Den Savage's new thing? No. I think it's called They're Not All Like That or We're Not All Like That. Oh, wow. And it's Christian saying, hey, we respect our gay brothers and sisters and we think you should have the right to do this. We're not all like that. But the confusion. There's a confusion that happens. How about this new pope? Yeah, but yeah, he just excommunicated somebody for some... Did he? Yes. He just fell on his ass. He was doing so great. And then he was like, yeah. It was, I don't know enough about it. I probably shouldn't talk about it, but the double-edged sword of connection via technology that's happening right now is that your information sources will dictate what you think about humans. So if your information source is the news, the mainstream media, Drudge Report, or any kind of fear-mongering mechanism that is pumping out fear to the world, then you're going to start thinking that people are fucked. But yet, if you consider your interaction with humans, that's what you should be gauging things on. You know what? I learned that getting back to our earlier conversation, that's something I learned so much from traveling. When I said, I'm going to go to India, I'm going to go around the world, it was back in the late 80s, before the internet, before all this stuff, right? And people were like, are you kidding? You're going to die. You're going to be... I mean, the first time I went to Mexico, in like 83, I think, I didn't speak Spanish, and I took this, I got a kung fu star, you know, the stars like Bruce Lee would throw. I got a kung fu star, and I put a gold chain, like a fake gold chain, I wore it as a necklace, and I made one link weak, so I could pull it, that would break, and then I'd have this star at the end of a two foot chain, and I could swing it like nun chucks, and I could keep like a lot of people away from me. You're so cool. I was badass, right? And because I was scared, I was going to Mexico all by myself, no idea, no English, no Spanish, no idea. And after like a week there, I was like, what the fuck am I doing wearing this? No, but everybody's nice to me, everybody's helping me, nobody's trying to rip me off or hurt me, or, you know, and I ended up, I mean this is another one of these long stories I'm going to tell is like the bonus thing, but I ended up living with these land reformers who are, who later became the zapatistas in Chiapas, right? Yes. And I ended up, I met this guy, Ankel, and all this shit, I mean I ended up teaching self-defense to these land reform peasants in Mexico, this was my first trip out of the US. You know martial arts? I studied from 8 to 15. I studied kung fu. I had a black belt and I taught, you know, I was like, that was my thing. And then I told the story on Rogan actually, then my teacher killed his father. How? In a fight. It was a really intense, weird thing. And it was funny, actually I learned something because I told that story on Joe's podcast and then I started getting emails from people who were from Western Pennsylvania who knew about that case. This was when I was 15, so this is 77, and I even got an email from a guy who was like an assistant district attorney who had handled the case. You know, this is something I hadn't thought about in 30 years and suddenly I'm like getting all these court documents and stuff. It's interesting. Like I forget when I'm doing podcasts, I forget people are listening, you know, it's funny. But which it can be dangerous. By the way, did you know, if you have any friends who aren't American, they need to be very careful about admitting they've ever used drugs. I've got several Canadian friends who are not allowed to ever enter the US because they admitted they had smoked marijuana in Amsterdam. Are you fucking shitting me? No. No, I just talked to two friends last week about it because I've got some, you know, friends, foreign friends who need to be able to come in and out of the US. That is wild. And they, this guy's a lawyer and he said to me, yeah, man, that's real. He said they flew through Seattle, they got pulled out and asked a bunch of questions. There's one guy who was a professor, no, a psychiatrist who had done LSD psychotherapy when it was legal. And he was crossing the border. They took him out and they said, oh, they googled him or whatever in there and they're like, oh, LSD psychotherapy. Have you ever tried LSD? And he said, yes, of course. I've been in the passport, never allowed in the US again because he's used illegally. Oh, these pigs. They're so desperate. Look, they're going to put up a fight, man. They're putting up a fight. They're going to put up a fight. That's all they know how to do. They can't stop it. They're going to try though. They're trying, but it won't work. They can't stop it. It's too late because look at, look at Seattle, look at California, look at Denver. California is becoming legal, hemp. They're allowed to grow hemp in California now. It's like you, at this point, the genie is out of the bottle. You've allowed a psychoactive and pathogen to get into the bloodstreams of the population. You've been trying to brainwash. It's not going to work. It's going to work for a little while longer and how long that little while is really does depend on how vocal people become and how clever people become about protesting because, you know, protesting, like when we think of protesting, we really do have a primitive idea of protesting, which is go out on the streets and gum up the gears. You were saying, you know, I just feel like I, you know, I'll tweet whatever. It's like, no, that is protesting. It works. That works. It creates a trend. It creates a movement in the zeitgeist that causes things to change. Tweets are good. Anything's good. Anything is better than nothing. If it's a tweet, if it's a post on Facebook, if it's sending a link to someone showing them the truth about the NSA, showing them the truth about what's happening with Snowden, all of these things create a shift in the collective mind. And the collective mind is the thing that I think stopped Obama from selling some fucking missiles or from making some money on the missiles. He was, the hellfire missiles was going to launch into Syria. So I believe that it's, it's definitely a conflict. We are in a conflict period right now. It's us. And by us, I mean people who don't want to incinerate human beings or turn human beings into money. It is a really interesting time to be alive, you know, the Chinese thing, right? May you live, the Chinese curse, may you live in an interesting time. But do you ever feel, sometimes I get this feeling like I was born too late to really enjoy the party in the 60s and 70s and too early to enjoy the party that's just starting now. Shit. You're not born too late for that Christopher Ryan, you're in the middle of the fucking party. Well, but it's just starting. It's just getting underway. And by the time it's really rocking, I'll be 60, you know, it's like nobody wants a 60 year old at their party. I do. But do you know what I'm talking about? Yes, I do know what you mean. Like we're, we're living in this lull between two important periods. Well, no, but that's, right, exactly in this, and that's why we, people living right now have an extra responsibility to become a activist in whatever way that they can. Get the party started. Yeah. You've got to get it going. And the way you get it going is by, there's a lot of different ways, but I think what you were saying earlier about this conceptualization of giving that hunter-gatherers have, I think that is a great place to start, which is if you can eliminate spiritual capitalism from your life, eliminate the idea that, and I was just reading this wonderful, actually listening to a lecture from Ram Dass talking about unconditional love and how, you know, the more you meditate, the more you get into bhakti yoga, the more you get into the idea of like, you know, falling in love with love as he calls it, the more you realize you want to love everyone, you want to actually just give love to everyone as much as you can. And then when, if you think that you should have some reciprocity for unconditional love, then you thwarted this form of spiritual discipline, which is this idea of like, oh, I want, if I'm going to give you unconditional love, but I want you to think I'm very holy and special, which is so funny that in a society built into it is a reaction of like, this is a ridiculous ox. Yeah. What was he gave? This is a ridiculous thing that you would give us. Bag of bones. Bag of shit. No one's going to be able to use this because it's like built into their society is a mechanism that will advance spiritual evolution because you will overcome the reward mechanism that people are addicted to and which makes them want to currently want to do good. Get rid of that and just do it because it's, because it's, it's, it's what life does. It's what the earth does. The earth spits out berries, coconuts, deer, all kinds of wonderful delicious things. How long did it take evolution to make a porcupine? I don't know. Remember you said that, you came up with that when we did that last podcast with Daniela. You threw that out. One of my great dreams, you know, sometimes I think about like, shit, if there is like an afterlife and there is a heaven or some kind of place where I can exist with the same consciousness I have now to think back to how crazy it was to be human. Man, I hope that they have some kind of like time VCR where I can rewind at a speed of like hundreds of thousands of years a second to watch the way things evolved and grew to watch the transformation of land masses and watch the strange bubbling up of life from the gooey mess that was earth. God, I'd love to see that. So if you could live at any moment in human history in any place on the planet, being born as just a random person, have you thought about where and when that would be? Yes. I have thought that. And it would either be right now or it would be during the time when Jesus was around. Really? Yeah. Because I would like to see the historic Jesus. I'd like to see if that being existed, I'd like to come in contact with that being. I think that'd be super, super amazing. Do you think you would know though? I mean, if you were there, he'd just be another dude. I think he would know I was a time traveler because he's Jesus. Oh, I see. He'd know. So he would be really impressed. Hey, what's up? Like, you know. Like, Duncan from the future. Also Buddha too. You know, I, you know, Siddhartha Gautama, the Buddha was a historic figure. This is definitely not a fabrication. So, you know, yeah, I think it would just be a person. But I think that being around, you know, being around the sort of, what do you call it? Is it called a linchpin, doctor? The thing that things pivot on? Yes. Yeah. To be around the pivoting hive, the pivoting being in a hive of primates would be really potent to see that, what that, and all its purity and all its raw form. It could also be Hitler, you know, there are a lot of them. Yes. Yes. Yes. Hitler was an attempt, but it didn't work. But like to be around like. Did Jesus work? Yeah. Jesus worked. Really? Sure, it did. I don't know, man. I think Jesus would be pretty disappointed by what's been done in his name. Oh, sure. All that. Yeah. But I think he recognized, like if you read the scriptures, you see that there was a recognition of the way power deals with love and that power like. It worked for Jesus. Didn't really work for human society though. Well, yeah, but yet we don't know that actually. You don't really know that because if you, it just depends on your POV. If you, if you believe, you know, if you, if you fall in line with like the anarcho-primitivists like Zerzan, who believe that everything started falling apart the moment we started representing reality with symbols that weren't reality, then yeah, you know, like everything past that point is fucked. Like there's this kind of wild, orgasmic flowingness to what you're talking about, this tribal life of just being in tune with the earth and wandering through life, living with, living close, close, close to the vibe of the earth. And then as time progressed, we separated and somewhere along in that separation, some beings emerged, Buddha, Christ, and they started saying things to people who are really fucked up. Like this is a time when you would just nail someone to a, you would crucify people regularly, stone people regularly. So in the midst of this kind of like what maybe people like you, not people like you, but someone who views this ancient and greater part of earth is a more positive time, something went wrong or something fucked up and people got really cruel and awful. And then these beings started popping up saying, wait, the most important thing is love or that's Jesus. And then with Buddha, maybe it's something more along the lines of we are all one thing. We are all the earth. We lost track of that. And so that information is permanently injected into the paradigm. It's there. Now, the way people react to that information does not a mark of whether that information is right or wrong. It's like, if you see love the Lord your God with all your heart, mind and soul and love your neighbors yourself and then go sit in a booth and fly a drone over a village and drop missiles on a person and turn someone into fucking hamburger meat, I think you've probably misinterpreted that scripture a little bit. Yeah, you know, it's my bias, but I tend to see so many things in terms of hunter-gatherers versus farmers, you know, because the hunter-gatherer, the central organizing principle of hunter-gatherer life is sharing, sharing of food, sharing of shelter, sharing of childcare, taking care of each other's kids, taking care of each other, right? And it's not because they're noble savages, it's because that's the best way for everybody to survive, right? Yes. Because you get a deer today, I get a deer next week, we share it, we both live. It's beautiful, but it's also very utilitarian, it's very practical, right? So that's why I say they're not noble savages, they're just doing what works in that context. And then the agricultural context is very different. What works in the agricultural context is, fuck you, I got mine. You know, no, I'm not going to lend you any money, because I'm going to keep it for my family to maximize my genetic legacy, and my, my, my... This is my land. Yeah, that's right, get off my land, all that bullshit, right? So you've got these two diametrically opposed worldviews, and they sort of, you can apply them, you can like overlay them onto so many of the conflicts we've got in the world. Democrat-Republican, you know, help the poor, fuck the poor. You know, I mean, it's so clear, you know, women are equal in hunter-gatherer societies, women have great status in early farming societies, women are farm animals. You know, they'll shall not covet thy neighbor's wife. Oh God, like she's a fucking pig. Well that's the thing, everybody thinks that's about like, oh, respect your neighbor's marriage. Read it in context. They'll shall not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his sheep, nor his ox, nor his slave, nor his house. His slave. Right. But can I talk to you for a second? I feel like you're coveting my slave, man. Were those conversations having like, hey, look, I want to talk to you for a second, and listen. Yeah, speaking of coveting, Arnold, he's my slave, and he's great. He's great. He's really, really, really good at working for free. Yeah. Can you please stop trying to buy him for me? Yeah, you're making Arnold. I'm not selling Arnold for the last time. Arnold the slave. Yeah. Look, the idea is to, I think the idea is to understand the macro in as clear a way as you can. What's the macro? The macro being the like, geopolitical state of things, or the vampiric tendency that capitalism has to convert human life into money. Or the planet earth. Yes. Into money plus waste. Which is, you know, kind of like what Zerzan or the anarcho-primitus are talking about, which is like transforming life into symbols. So the moment you do that bizarre alchemy where you convert living, beautiful life into bank account numbers, which is what happens anytime a bomb drops on a village because the bomb cost a certain amount of money and dropping the bomb cost a certain amount of money and that money went to someone's bank account at the cost of someone being evaporated. So whenever you do that, you have the conversion of a human being into numbers in someone's bank account. Right. Basically. It's a kind of satanic solar panel. So. I love the way your mind works, man. That's it. That's what it is. So. Satanic solar panel. Yeah. So you see that, you know, that's the macro. So you see that. Okay. Well, I see that's then that's going on in the big, big picture that there are a small percentage of people. It is a small percentage of people who are totally cool at doing that. But then you always have to take it back to yourself. Yeah. And you, and that is where the world gets better. All politics is local. Yes. And personal. And personal. Local is in your relationship with your friends. Yeah. Your lover or lovers and your pets and your kids and the people that you go to, you shop at stores, like the stores you go to and the people you interact with there, the people who bag your groceries, the people who give you coffee. So that's it. Those are the people you're interacting with. So the idea is, okay, I don't want to, I don't like what's happening in the macro, which is the conversion of life into money. So where am I doing that in the micro? Where am I converting a relationship or the interactions of a relationship into a thing, a form of capitalism? You're paying me for this podcast, right? Yeah, thousands. Okay, good. Good. Just want to make sure. That's what's beautiful about podcasts is they're free. They're free. They're free. And that's what's beautiful about, that's what's beautiful about, not to say that people shouldn't make money, not to say that people shouldn't profit from their work or that there shouldn't be some reward. That's the thing. You're living this world. You've got to play by its rules to some extent. But you can still eliminate... But you've got to be conscious. Yes, you can be conscious and you can, as much as possible, you can eliminate from your life. And man, I've fallen prey to the sickness, man. There's like, I went through a pretty, shit, I released all these, I was so mad at South by Southwest for asking me to come and perform there for free. And I released these YouTube videos like pointing out how ridiculous it is that they want me to come there to perform when they're charging money for tickets. Oh, really? Yeah. They want you to perform free but they're charging for tickets. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Were they going to fly you down or anything? No, they wanted me to pay for my own flight. What? Yeah. Insanity. Fuck those guys. Right, that was my reaction. That was my reaction. Now, man, I keep getting thrown into this place, probably because I've been reading, I've just been getting really reading Ram Dass' new book and just this idea of wherever you can eliminate reactivity and wherever you can eliminate the idea of getting something back for doing something nice. Yeah, but let's face it, you're a performer and they're making money on your performance and they're not sharing that money with you, which is bullshit. That's exploitation. I think you're right to say fuck that. Yeah, but you know, man, I think that business model's fucked up and I'm still glad I released the video, I guess, but I've just noticed there is a kind of like malfunction or the thing that we've been taught. You do this and I'll give you this. Right. That thing we've been taught might be very, very, very wrong. By the way, I'm not a Christian. I'm not a Christian. I'm a Christian every day. I'm not a Christian, but I do love spirituality. I love reading the scriptures. Are you a Harry Krishna? What the fuck is that? Because I heard, listen to that podcast with your buddy. I'm not a Harry Krishna, but I love it. Dave, what's his name? Dave McClain. Dave McClain. I just listened. I told you before we started recording and listen to that podcast and you were like, I told you that was back in the day when I was chanting Harry Krishna every morning. I still chant Harry Krishna. You do? Yeah. Yeah. Doesn't that make you a Harry Krishna? Well, no. I mean, the Harry Krishnas are, when people say Harry Krishna, they're referring to ISKCON, which is the international society for Krishna consciousness, which is the kind of fundamentalist Bhakti Yoga. So we're talking about George Harrison songs here or what? Well, we're talking about Bhakti Yoga. And Bhakti Yoga is the sort of the way of connecting to the universe through love. And there's so, in the same way that there's so many different sects of Christianity, there's all these various sects of Bhakti Yoga and ISKCON, the Harry Krishnas being one of them, what they all have in common is they tend to chant the Harry Krishna Mahamantra, which goes, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Rama Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. And that mantra is a really wonderful thing to chant. It makes you feel so good if you say it over and over again, and it's not owned by anything. Anyone can do it. You don't have to be, you just chant the mantra you feel, but you'll feel good. So I love that form of meditation. I love mantra meditation because I have ADD, or I don't know if ADD is real, but I have a wandering mind. Monkey mind. We've all got it. I have a big monkey mind. And chanting is really good because when you're chanting, the way people tell you to chant is like, you're going to think about other stuff, but just keep bringing your mind, just listen to yourself chanting as much as you can. That's it. It's so simple. So you keep bringing your mind back to it. When I chant, I tend to be a much more calm, loving person. Have you ever done vipassana? No, but I, you know, I was just checking it out. There's one up in the desert that... Yeah. A 10 day thing. Yeah. Yeah. I did it. And my wife, Kisela's done it twice. Wow. She's hardcore. But what is that like? Can you... Do you have time? It's... Yeah, I got all the time you want, man. There's nothing I would rather do than hang out with you. I got it. Likewise. I mean, seriously. Okay. I'm going to pour some more on. I don't care. Thank you. I feel the same way. Hold on. Rolling. Rolling. I just... I've interviewed some great people for my podcast recently. I was in New York. I did like eight recordings in six days. I just was on like a podcast frenzy. Isn't it great? I got to... You know, I know I've done this before, but I have to thank you publicly for getting me into podcasting because I enjoy it so much. You people, why do you always say thank you? Yeah, exactly. God, it's so much better. Yeah. What do I owe you now? Fuck. You know, man, the reason I really love that story so much is because I want to say this without... God, I hope I don't sound puffed up when I say this. I don't want to sound puffed up. You're not puffed up. So who cares? Is that what you're saying? I'm very, very, very grateful to anyone who listens to this podcast. Yeah. And sometimes I'll get emails or people will come up to me thanking me for it. As much as I appreciate that, it always feels weird because it's like I love doing this. It's like you're thanking me for breathing. Yes. Yeah. Yes, exactly. It's that thing where it's like this whole thank you thing. It's a funny ritual and it's nice to do and I appreciate it in all, but really there's a bigger idea, which I love, which is the bigger idea is like shit, man. What if we're all just part of this growing expression of human understanding or one little tiny piece of it or one little pixel in this bigger picture that's emerging and like shit. I don't know. Anyway. Well, you know... That sounded puffed up. No. Should I delete that? No, no, no. You don't delete shit. Right. But no. I mean, you probably get the same sorts of emails that I'm getting, although you probably get a lot more of them, but a lot of them are from... I find people in their 20s who are looking for a way. They're like, what am I doing? You know, I just got one today from a guy who's like, okay, I read your book, I listen to your podcast, it's great, I love it, but man, I'm jealous. I'm really jealous and I've had these relationships and they all end because I'm so jealous. And you know, I don't know what to do. I mean, can you recommend books? Can you recommend... And... What's your answer? Well, the answer is the fact that you're writing me an email asking for this means you're dealing with it. All right. You're there, man. You're in the ring. You're fighting your battles. All right. Good for you, you know? Yeah. Or I get emails from people saying, yeah, I want to travel. I mean, you talk about traveling. Where should I go? What should I do? I mean, I got this job. I hate it. I'm 24 and this woman wants to marry me, but I don't really love her. Dude, the fact that you're reaching out to me knowing who I am, that's your answer. You're not reaching out to a guy who got married at 22 and stayed working for General Electric his whole life, right? If that's your role... You already know the answer you want. Exactly. So you're just... I'm the mirror, you know? And to be in a position to offer that reflection to people is so fucking beautiful. And I agree with you. I feel so gratified that people take time to listen to this stuff. It's amazing. Yes. But it is... And get something from it. Well, I think that I get from it, hopefully I'm getting from it. I think I get from it so much, like getting to talk to, you know, just getting like the chance to like talk to people who have such interesting perspectives that it really creates it. I would do this even if we weren't recording a podcast, but the reason we know each other is because you invited me on your podcast. At this point, we're friends. It doesn't matter if the mics are on or not. But yeah, when I was in New York, I interviewed six people or seven people or whatever it was, none of whom would have made time to just hang out and chat with me if I weren't doing a podcast. Isn't that weird? Well, it's a reality of life. If you email somebody like, hey, I think you're really cool. When you hang out they're like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. And I record our first conversation in life. They're like, I'll be there in a second. Yeah. Well, you know, if you say I've also interviewed Duncan Tressel, famous comedian. Please. You know, any like who lay out some names, people make time for you. It's fantastic. Well, I think that I think this is probably similar to like the salons that people used to have where people would get together and exchange information and because it's, it's, it definitely is some, some aspect of this growing, I don't know what it is, this growing collective that seems to be emerging and every almost every, every form it's, it's coming. It's everywhere, this thing. And you know, and that makes me very hopeful. And I think that there is a fusion that can happen. You know, like how like, God, I keep talking about Jesus, friends, I'm not a Christian. I guess this is where my mind is right now. I think you might be. Maybe I am. You're a closeted Christian. Maybe I am. But, um, you know, like, uh, Christ is always talking about this marriage, you know, he's always talking about this marriage that's happening, this union. And I think that there is a, you know, and, and then you get into the dialectic, you know, which is that, uh, the tension between the thing and its opposite creates the synthesis, which is the third thing. So here we have these wonderful opposites, the classes, Hegelian. What? You're laying Hegel on it. Hell yeah. So like now what do we have? We have your hunter gatherer, Dionysian, sort of utopian, wandering through the wild, beautiful and, and, uh, uh, complete, like completely in, like deep in the flow of the world and that home of life. And then you have on the other side of it, this sort of like terrified of the world, trying to separate ourselves from all like aspects of organic life, trying to control, manipulate, contain, categorize- Stainless steel hermetically sealed coffins. Yes. What the fuck? Yes. Yes. Yes. Exactly. So you have these two diametrically opposed points and that creates a tension. Hmm. What, you know, genetic tension, that kind of sense in a human that I am missing something almost like someone who was in the middle of a great love affair gets amnesia and wakes up having forgotten this thing. Like that wonderful movie, uh, no, not momentum. There's a great movie about, um, if you could erase a lot of the Jim Carrey thing, yeah, right. Where they go to a doctor and Montreal and erase their memories. Yeah. So here you have humanity having this beautiful relationship with the earth. Something happens. You get this amnesia for getting how wonderful this being, this being where you're a part of is. Yet this longing is inside humans is itch. So I think that there is a potential, uh, for reacquaintance with that energy, but in a much more amplified way, a much more massive way, a way that, uh, it wasn't the, in the same way that we can't feel the earth like people a thousand years ago might have, uh, they can't experience the connectivity that we're experiencing now. Yeah. And they don't have the technological means to find that aquifer in Kenya and to, to do really interesting things. I mean, the last chapter of this book I'm working on, it's called, uh, charting a prehistoric path into the future and it's exactly what you're talking about. It's finding, if we could just get our shit together, we could live in paradise, all of us. All of us. We've got the technology now. We've got the intelligence. We've got the way we've got the communication. We've got a worldview. If we could just, you know, apply what we know in an intelligent way, if we could organize ourselves and find a way to deal with the dickheads, right? In other words, oh, you brought us a bag of bones. Thanks a lot. If we could do that, like neutralize the ego. Yes. Because the thing is, I mean, I'm also, I'm also, there's a chapter about money, right? And the thing is, like our whole thing is built on getting more money, right? But the truth is that above a certain threshold, money stops mattering. Absolutely. It's like, it's like a wine. I don't know how much this wine you're drinking costs you, but it's, I'll bet it's $17. That's what I was going to say. It's between $10 and $20, right? Because above $20, $30, $35, it's bullshit. It doesn't taste better. Nobody fucking even knows. There are all sorts of taste tests where they've done them blind to taste tests. It's true, man. I'm a fool. No, no, you're, you're, you're in the range, you're in the range where it matters. No, I'm above the range. Well, you know, then it's all about ego and it's, it's a gift. Oh, look, I'll be, oh, I spent a lot of money on this bottle. Yes. Look at the label. The truth is that, you know, people blind test wine testers, they don't know if they're drinking white wine or red wine half the time. It's, it's complete bullshit, right? And it's the same thing on a much larger scale. Mitt Romney's not happier because he's got 20 million fucking dollars. Right. Right. Right. I mean, I've threw weird quirks in my life history. I've hung out with really wealthy people. I mean, I was just on this 130 foot yacht a couple of weeks ago with the guy I met at Ted, whatever, really cool guy, wonderful guy. He's filthy rich. He's not particularly happy. Right. There's no correlation between how big your yacht is and how happy you are. That's the fucking crazy secret. I was listening to this great, this American life about this guy who went around. His job was to go to people who had just won the lottery and offered a buy like they had done the payout over time. And he would like say, look, I'll give you five million dollars right now in exchange for, you know, you sign over the payments and all that. So, and he was talking, so he met a lot of people who had just met, just won the lottery. He said they're fucking miserable. They're all miserable because their friendships are gone. Their family life is gone. They're like drinking too much, they're driving fast cars, they're wrecking them. Money doesn't make you happy. So the whole idea is like we're on this wheel and the whole society is saying, run faster, run faster. And the truth is the faster you run, it doesn't bring you anything except exhaustion. And then your life's over. So the whole fucking thing is a scam. You know? Why am I ranting about this? Don't stop. There's a book. There's a great book which I should give to you. It's called Finite and Infinite Games. Yes. Philosopher at NYUCon, James Kars, I think his name is. And somebody gave it to me years ago when I was in my 20s seeking knowledge and all that. You know, who gave it to me? Actually, it's funny, Richard Belzer's brother. No way. Yeah, he was a friend of mine, Len Belzer. Wow. He was a friend of mine when I lived in New York and I was working in the Diamond District and he gave me this book. It's a very slim volume. It's like sort of, you know, chapters of three paragraphs. Yeah. And what he says is, he says everything you do is a game and there are two kinds of games. Finite game and infinite game. The finite game is a game that you're trying to win. Yes. The infinite game is the game you're trying to keep going. Everything in life falls into one of those two categories. God, I love that. Yeah. So one is about domination and the other is about unity. Yes. Right? And again, for me, it falls into hunter-gatherer farmer. The farmer's about, this is my land. Get off it. The hunter-gatherer's like, hey, let's share what we find here. Chimps and bonobos. Same thing. You throw a packet of food into a chimpanzee enclosure. They fight over it. A few people, a few chimps, they share it among themselves, the ruling coalition or whatever. You throw a packet of food into an enclosure of bonobos. They look at it. They all fuck. And then they share it. I'm a bonobo. Yeah, man. Yeah, it's beautiful. Yeah. And that is, I think that is what we're all waking up to is that that's more what the universe is like. And it's the only way we're going to survive. So it's what you said earlier about returning to a prehistoric perspective on life. In the end, it shall be as in the beginning, right? I think that's where we're going or TS Elliot in the four quartets he wrote, in the end of all our travels will be to return to where we began and know the place for the first time. Yes. That's it. I think that's it for humanity. That's it for humanity. And this period that we're in right now is a very special time. It's very special. We're in puberty right now. It's a great time to be alive. And I think the other side of it is so beautiful. And we get to be a part of like the expression of it and its initial phases, which are, you know, right now it's very primitive. It's, you know, you and I sitting at a table with microphones and this Zoom weird R16 controller. But in, you know, 30 years, it will be the transmission of feeling states to the entire planet. The, or maybe a hundred years, but I'd say around 30 will be being able to transmit neurological states of consciousness to the entire planet so that when a person reaches a particular so in, so in other words, instead of like the, the predicament being like you see a Zen master, you see someone who's like radiating the light that comes from a lifetime of meditation and then encourages, encourages you to meditate for life. I think it'll go to a point where it's like, no, you can experience what that's like and have that connection immediately with like, oh, shit. That's what I really am. Well, they say, you know, that's what hallucinogens, you know, Timothy Leary often said like, or maybe it was Ram Dass who said that hallucinogens take you to the top of the mountain, but then you find you wake up and you're back down, you got to climb. That's Ram Dass. And it's a great thing to get to the top of the mountain because it's, it gives, it encourages you. And I think it's a wonderful thing. Like when I smoked a dimethyl tryptamine recently, it was this confirmation of so many divergent philosophies that I read all coming together into this one blissful, very short moment where it's like, oh, shit, it's real. It's total, it's all this nonsense that I've, or stuff that I thought, maybe this is crap. We're all one thing. There's one connective life force that's just some love principle that only wants to nurture and embrace and heal. You hear that and it's like, whatever, but then you smoke DMT and it's like, oh, wow, it is real. It's there and I'm it and it's me. But how do you know that's not a delusion, you know, a chemical induced delusion the way like alcohol can go, I love you, I love you, man, you know, and then they wake in the next day is like, yeah, whatever that guy, I don't know. I mean, how do you know, why do you take that more seriously than any other chemically induced state? Well, I can answer that in two ways. One is, well, how do I know? Anything's real. There's always that. There's that, you know, because everything's a chemically induced state. Everything is a. I love, who is it, McKenna's brother, Dennis McKenna, who says, like, you know, they talk about like, oh, drugs and drugs, like your brain is drugs, you know, your entire being is drugs. Yeah. So we have this sort of like external wave form that is all of whatever it is out here, this sort of quantum soup that's surrounding our optic nerve and all the various sensory mechanisms that make up a human being. And you know, that enters into us through those mechanisms and then it gets translated into a neurological representation that we call reality. So yes, how do I know that that out there is, is real, but is it because, is it because it's a primary thing uninterrupted by some intermediary like alcohol or DMT or marijuana and somehow that direct connection makes it more real? No, because as you say, it's not direct. It's inner, it's, they're all sorts of intermediaries. They're serotonin and dopamine and testosterone and all this shit that's unavoidable. It's very, it's wildly from person to person. Exactly. And there's no direct relationship with reality at all. That's one response. And the other response is, you know, man, I can't say anything more than find some DMT and smoke it as soon as you can. And then answer the question for yourself because the experience is so... You're going to get picked up by the NSA again. I'm already picked up. If I'm not picked up by the NSA, then the system is malfunctioning. No, I mean, taking out to the camp and all that. Yeah. Hey, it's, it's not that bad a camp. They have a pretty good gym. Do they have canoes? Treadmills. Oh, treadmills. Well, that's something. They would have treadmills. NSA loves treadmills. They don't have like, like wheels you can run on like a mouse. I saw this New Yorker cartoon, it's two mice, like with the running wheels and one mouse is running and the other one's just sitting on his wheel. And at the bottom it says, I had an epiphany. Beautiful. That's the story of my life. Give me a hammock. I don't give a shit about anything else. Speaking of epiphanies, Terrence McKenna describes DMT as, I just read this as a niagras of epiphanous beauty. And that is a very apt description of this state. A niagras? Like the Niagara Falls. Yeah. Is that a word? A niagras? He made it up. He was in chains. And you're like lying there on your back with your mouth open, trying to swallow it all? You just, it's so interesting because there's a sense of a thing or a presence or a thing being like, it's really weird, man. And I, you know, maybe it is because I'd read it, but it didn't seem like some placebo thing that I read. You smoke it and there's an immediate sense of like something being like, just calm down. You know, there's a presence. There's a presence. Just, just relax, just take this. And then for me, it was a microtubules like just a, like thousands and thousands and I don't know, just an infinite amount of like, like mycelium or something, like coming out of nowhere and connecting with my chest and my, my chest. And then the sense of something pumping in, just love or this healing energy, just kind of pumping in with almost like a doctor who has a person on a table being like calm, just calm, hold on, just calm down, just calm down, just calm down. And then, um, then you close, if you open your eyes, you see kind of like, uh, very heavy duty, like psilocybin, LSD level, warping of matter, uh, but it's much more beautiful and less like, you know, when you're on acid, it feels like your consciousness is kind of like bending or warping with the acid. That's not really happening. There's more of just like the observer of this beautiful sort of like warping sense, but you don't want to look out of the world. You close your eyes and that's when you go into this just matrix of pre-creation. This kind of like pre-existent state of perfection that is somehow manifesting as us, as humanity. And, uh, it's just so tranquil and beautiful and peaceful and, uh, perfect and loving. And, and, but then there's like this, like at one point I'm like going through this weird maze of geometries and there's this corner and right around the corner, there's this like flickering light shooting out of this corner. And then it's like, you're suddenly just back on the couch. And my, my friend told me, well, you know, that's the problem with DMT is that to get around that corner, you have to like inhale quite a bit of the smoke. It's like rocket fuel. If you don't, it burns off so quickly because it's already in your body that if you do it in the right way, and the reason people like ayahuasca is that apparently it can, you're more likely to turn that corner. And when you turn that corner, you like blast into some other completely alternate dimension, which, you know, maybe I wasn't ready for that alternate dimension, but I got what I needed to get from the thing. Um, and, and also what's crazy about DMT is when you're, when you, 10 minutes afterwards, the hallucination stop 30 minutes after you still feel high in this beautiful way, four hours after you realize that you can't stop, you're still smiling. And then like the next day you wake up and you're happier than you've been in so long and you find yourself grasping for this. For me, I found myself grasping for the depression. Right. I was looking for the darkness and it's gone. So you're like trying to grab onto this darkness, but there's no darkness. So now you're like, what the fuck? I can't find the sadness anymore because you've been shown this pre-existent state. The one question I had, I'm sorry for the DMT rant. No, that's beautiful. The side effect of DMT is that you don't never stop talking about it. That is a bad side effect. But the first rule of DMT club. Yeah, you do feel like you've been inducted into some kind of secret society, but it feels like it feels like the answer to everything got whispered in your ear. And then you can't remember what that was, but the calmness and the sense of peace that came from the answer stays with you. It's like you're not allowed to like understand it completely yet that sense of like, oh, okay. I don't need to freak out anymore. Almost as though you were having a really terrible trip and someone that you loved came up to you and was like, hey, man, you're just really high right now and you're going to be fine. You're really going to be fine. And then it's like, oh, and that doesn't go away and it hasn't gone away to this day. It's still with me. So I'm very surprised that's an illegal drug. Well, all the good drugs are illegal. You think about this, there's a chapter in my upcoming book about that. I can't wait to read this. I can't wait to write it. Jesus Christ. I guess I should get work, stop talking about it and write the fucking thing. Uh, yeah, I just, I just talked to my editor a couple of weeks ago when I was in New York and, uh, it was a funny conversation because it was, the book is due tomorrow where tonight is September, whatever it is, and tomorrow's October 1st. It's due tomorrow, right? So I, I had this lunch with him and I was like, yeah, I don't know. I've got the, you know, my dad's been sick and I'm, we're moving a lot and I'm doing this TV thing and I'm the, I'm really busy with stuff. And he just held up his hands and he's like, look, Chris, uh, I don't care. If you need me to pretend I care, I will. You know, some writers need that, uh, but I really don't. You just write it when you write it, you know, it'll be great and we'll publish it when you give it to us. And it was like, wow, I've got the best editor in the world. Is the editor going to sign to you by the publishing company or you? It depends on your, your deal. In this case, he's the same editor who did sex at dawn at Harper, but he left Harper like two weeks after sex at dawn came out. And then this book went to auction, which is like every writer's wet dream where like different publishers are bidding on it. And, uh, he actually bid more than anyone else than I guess I can say this now because it's all done. It's all done with him anyway. I mean, unless the other bids were way, way higher because he's such a cool guy. He's he, and he knows me, he knows how I work. He knows when I give him a manuscript, it'll be 80% like ready to roll. So when you say he bids on it, the publisher's bid, so it goes in a circle like, and your agent handles it. So like, you know, it'll be like, uh, you know, uh, uh, Random House will say 80,000 and then, uh, and they've got an hour. So then the agent sends out an email saying, okay, Random House offered 80,000. And then, you know, Simon and Schuster will say 90 and then it's got to be 10 grand each bid. Wow. And then like a hundred and then 110 and then it goes around and around and around until there's a bid and an hour passes and nobody tops it. Wow. That is so cool that you get to experience that man. Yeah. Yeah. It's pretty cool. Although I mean publishing is, is on the down slope. So, you know, it's kind of a bummer because, you know, we're, I mean, I'm incredibly grateful to be in a position where publishers are fighting to give me money. And then say, yeah, take as much time as you want to write the book. That's even better. But, um, you know, my, my agent, when it all ended, my agent was like, you know, five years ago, it would have been twice this much money. All right. It's just like, Well, and it's also because your next book, you won't use a publisher. You'll just write it and then you'll sell it yourself and you'll make three times whatever they offer. Well, I was thinking on this book to do that. Yeah. And it was funny because I told my agent, you know, below this number, I'll just publish it myself. Because we don't need publishers. You needed publishers when there were bookstores. Bookstores are gone. What do we need a publisher for? Well, you know, the chain bookstores are gone, but the independents are doing well. And the, you know, what you need a publisher for is credibility. That's it. Right. But that's crap. That's crap on one level, but someone told me that. Another author told me that it's the credibility you get from going to book signings and having this thing. Well, in the media response to it, if you're publishing a book with a major publisher, then Newsweek's going to look at it and, you know, you'll get that kind of, you'll get invited to the, maybe the daily show or whatever. So that matters. But the thing is it matters less and less all the time. And in my case, you know, the first book was published with Harper, Harper Collins, second book Simon and Schuster. At that point, it's like, I got the credibility, you know, I mean, two major publishers have like paid me to write a book. So, you know, I'm not a shitty writer. So with that, I think you can go independent and people will say, okay, this is a serious writer. It's not someone who just like put up there. No, that's the dream. You can go Louis CK on your next one. That's exactly it. And you just, the problem is you don't get that overhead. You don't get the initial. And you don't get all the bullshit of people telling you, you know, no, the cover has to be this or we're going to change the title to that. Isn't that wonderful? Yeah. Yeah, exactly. It's so beautiful. It subverts all of that nonsense. I love it. It's great. And that's the, you know, I mean, the whole podcast thing, like we've, you know, people give a shit, you know, and you get to develop an audience and then you say, okay, I got a book and I've got an audience. I don't need you. Right. Everything's going this way, man. I mean, it's so like on a super, um, we've done it almost two hours now and I don't want to end on a super capitalist, capitalist bent, but it's not capitalist because it's like in LA, there is a car service now. There's a, instead of like, if you wanted to go drinking or like a share thing, you would have to get a taxi. Yeah. So, which is the responsible way to drink. If you're going to go drink, don't drive. That's retarded. What are you doing? You're going to buy a $6,000. Seriously? Yeah. It's like five or six grand. You're going to pay. If you get a DUI, it's the best. It's the worst. You wake up in the morning, you're in jail and you've run over a couple of people. So don't drink, obviously it's, it's, uh, alcohol does not help you drive. You're funny. You're funny. Like within 10 minutes, you're like, go out and find some DMT, but don't drink and drive. No. And I mean that. I'll say it. I know. Smoke DMT. Don't smoke DMT and drive. That's my public service job. And don't smoke DMT and drive either. No. And then it would be impossible, though I have heard fighter pilots have done it, but I can't believe that. But, uh, uh, but, but, uh, so now, so, uh, the option, uh, before the internet was you would call a number to a cab company and the cab company would come and get you. And so then the internet comes out and there's an app that you can use where it, uh, tracks your GPS and you can press a button and a taxi comes to get you. But now there's a new thing in the big cities called Uber, which is for, uh, a limo. It's the same amount as the taxis, maybe $10 extra, maybe $10 extra. You press a button within, I like, I couldn't believe it because my friends had been telling me about it and I was going to go out and drink. So I didn't want to drive. So I'm at my house and I'm like, well, I don't want to get a taxi. I'm going to try this Uber thing. Not by the way, guys, not sponsored by them at all. This is a non-sponsored, uh, story. I pressed a button on the thing within two minutes. That's how eerie this is. Within two minutes. Like, you know how like your dog will shit and like within a second, there's flies all over it and you start thinking, like, are those flies standing by? Where are they? It's like the grass just covered in flies. Are we covered in a world of flies? Like, well, how did that happen that fast? Like within two minutes, that is not an exaggeration. The thing's like in two minutes, your driver will beat you up. So you're the shit, the limo's the fly. Like there's just, I guess in LA, there's just a swarm of limos driving around neighborhoods waiting. Waiting. So suddenly within two minutes, you're in the back of a limo. They'll tell you how much it costs. Uh, it's the exact same as a cab and the difference is when the tip is included in the amount, so the cab just drives you somewhere and you get out. Like your mom is dropping you off at a movie theater or something. And that's it. It's beautiful. That's technology. And I've heard that there's the same thing for like, uh, Airbnb. Have you done that? I've heard it. I haven't done it, but I've heard about it. I just did it in Portland. It's great. It's fucking great. Same thing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The sharing, uh, economy through internet is definitely a cool thing. And it relates back to the hunter-gatherer, you know, right? Like share, take care of each other. It's a win-win. You know, I mean, And cut out the pig cause when you cut out the middleman, exactly. Cause when you have like a, uh, you know, not all, obviously not all publishers are pigs, but, you know, when you, uh, quite often, gatekeepers, the gatekeepers inevitably take more than they deserve. Yeah. And maybe in the old days, when you didn't have access to a printing press and you couldn't like print and distribute your book, they had more value. But now their value is, is gone from being like this thing where it's like, Hey, I have access to a massive distribution mechanism and a, and a, and a machine that will print your book out. It's gone from that to, I'll give you credibility, kid. Yeah. It's worse than that because back then they would not only give you, uh, the distribution and all that, they would cultivate writers. They would say, look, you're, okay, you're not that good now, but we think three novels in the future, you're going to be really good. And we'll take a loss on each of these first three novels and we'll send you on a speaking tour and there'll be a launch party. And it's like, and now there's no speaking tour. There's no launch party. I'm supposed to hire my own publicist, but the royalty structure remains exactly what it was. So they're like, we're going to keep taking the same thing. And ebooks, they take, they take 25% and how does it work? You get, as an author, you get, uh, 17%. So you get 25% of the 70 that they get. Cause Amazon or iTunes or whatever, it takes 30 off the top. So that's absolutely no extra cost to them, no distribution, no editing, no paper, no nothing, and you're getting 17% as a writer. What the fuck, man? It's so fucked up. Yeah. And paperbacks, you get 8%. So the idea is we, you know, there, there has to be a distribution mechanism that's not based on those, uh, yeah, well, they're done. They're done. I mean, now with, you know, ebooks and, you know, whatever, even print on demand, you know, if you want a paperbook, you can print it, you know, and the author gets more money, everybody's happy and you don't have to like play, you know, like when I wrote Sex of Dawn, one of the, the, I mean, Ben left and then there were other editors, I had all these issues and stuff. But I remember during the, the review process, like they were, they said, um, Penguin Poon Tang, you know, uh, I don't think we can really Penguin Poon Tang and I, and I asked my father, who's a writer, and my father's like, are you kidding? Keep that in there. Peng, that's hilarious. Penguin Poon Tang. Yeah. And now I get all these emails from people saying Penguin Poon Tang, you cracked me up. That's funny. It's like, it's cool though. Isn't it cool to see how like you have this, you know, a recurring pattern that's happening in almost every arena, which is that these old, crusty ship bags, who've been trying to hold back, uh, art or hold back, whatever the creative flow is, are being subverted by technology. And I think that there is something beautiful about that, whether or not it's going to end up okay. Who knows? We might have be sucking sarin gas by the end of the night. I don't know. But I think that I just take such delight in the watching people who have no real value, who have climbed up onto this totem pole and made it seem like they have some value. It's so fun to watch them fall down. It's so fun. It's so fun to watch them be diminished. It's so fun to watch the air go out of them. It's like, no, man, the people are what's important. Not you. You're just some fucking raft. Right. You're a bouncy house. Yeah. Don't get proud. Don't get proud about your, the ox you brought us. Yeah. It's a fucking bag of bones. It's a bag of bones. Dr. Chris Ryan, this has been one of my favorite podcasts ever. Uh, thank you. Hi, 10. Hi, 10. Uh, how can people find you, sir? chrisryanphd.com. They could follow me on Twitter at chrisryanphd. Uh, my podcast is called 10 Gentially Speaking, which you've been on. How many times not twice? I think twice. Yeah. Where is it located? It's on, you know, it's everywhere. iTunes, stitchyourferalaudio.com. It's on my site chrisryanphd.com. I'll put a link on my site, friends. And, uh, obviously, if you've never read, uh, Sex at Dawn, go and read that book because it is so fun to read and it really spins you. You know who I met today? I was at, uh, my agency. It's, this is like such a Hollywood thing. I was at my talent agency. You know, and, uh, in the waiting area, I said, I, I turned around. There's this woman on the sofa and she said, oh, yeah, come sit with me on the sofa and I knew her like, who, who the fuck are you? I know you, I know you. And I said, like, I know you. Who are you? She's the blonde on the office, the uptight bitchy blonde. What's her, I don't remember her name is, but. And she said, yeah, have you ever seen the office? Like, oh, the office. You're the like uptight, sexy, kind of sexy, kinky, you know, who's fucking Dwight and you know, like, oh, yeah, yeah. So anyway, we started talking and she was like, uh, yeah, you know, I'm single for the first time since I was 25. I got to read your book and I gave her a card. Oh, shit. She's cool. She's really nice. It's a great book and it's a book that I really love the book because I read the book as a monogamous person and, uh, and it really like mixed me up. But I've, I'm still a monogamous person yet. I feel like I'm monogamous, understanding more, well, that's the thing where it comes from and it's, it's, it's deep in my understanding of like what I'm engaged in, in relation to what people have engaged in for so long. And I think that's super cool. And I mean, you know, people say to me like, well, you know, you're, you know, isn't this an indictment of monogamy? Not at all. My, you know, my parents are, have been monogamously married for 53 years. It's not that there's anything wrong with monogamy. It's just saying, this is why it's hard. Yes. It's not hard because you're a fuck up or you're immature or you have Peter Pan complex or, you know, it's hard because it's hard for homo sapiens to be monogamous. Right. So that's not at all saying there's anything wrong with choosing that. It's just saying, Hey, good for you, man. I think that's why it's good for people in monogamous relationships to read, because it banishes that weird demon of like, you know, where, like, if you're like traditionally monogamous and you, you see your lover, look at someone else. Oh, and you'll feel you in jealousy and freak you out. But then when you understand the biology behind it, you realize like, Oh, of course she's going to look at someone totally normal. Let's work with that instead of freaking out about it. And so it's strength for me, it has been that book and that idea behind the book has been one of the primary banishers of jealousy for my life because by reading the book, it's like, Oh, I get it. Like if someone's hitting on my girlfriend, it's not enough front against me. It's not someone hurting me. It's, it's just nature manifesting in a very normal way. And your girlfriend's incredibly hot. Let's face it. She's beautiful. I love her. Yeah. I'll be hitting on her next time I say, please do. Yeah. Well, anyway, it's a great book, guys. Don't hit on my girlfriend. No, you care. Guys, read, read Chris's book, Sex Adon, follow him on Twitter. And of course, listen to his podcast. Thank you very much for coming on the show. Awesome pleasure, man. That was Chris Ryan, everyone, the author of Sex Adon. If you like the Dugga Trussell family hour, why not give us a nice rating on iTunes? Hare Krishna. Thanks for listening. See you soon. You're listening to my favorite Elliot Smith song, The Biggest Lie. Love you guys. Smith, not the name that you call me. You do make me want to die. Oh, I just told the biggest lie. I just told the biggest lie.

Check out the latest in-store, and we're never short on options at jcp.com. All dressed up, everywhere to go. JCPenney. Greetings to you, oh glorious ones. You have tuned in to the Dunkin Trussell Family Hour podcast. The podcast that for the last six years running has received the Golden Plum Award from the Alfred Meningite Association. And we are proud that you have made the very powerful decision to smash those delicious earbuds into your sweet ear canals and allow my voice to go spraying its sonic glory deep inside the waxy canyons, caverns, and inner crevices of your ear canal and pulsating brain. I can't tell you what joy it brings me to know that at this very moment, the supercomputer inside your cranium is transforming the gibber jabber of my voice into something you can understand called language. And also what makes me excited is that I'm not even human. I'm a plastoid replicant, Samborian jellyfish harvested from Io. I'm inside a plasticine gourd right now being fed Neutropic Neuroreceptors. And of course, I'm soaking in a briny, gulping, glowing, sweet sea of various synthetic neuroreceptors that have been harvested and re-synthesized using ambrosial technologies, patent pending. It's a real joy to be here in your brain and most importantly, to be laying sonic eggs in here. Yep, you heard me right. I'm laying eggs in your brain. You humans have yet to figure out that there are much more ways that life exists in the particular part of the time space continuum that we are in than just what can be quantified in matter. And that's great for my species because we have full reign to just dive inside of y'all in a variety of ways from podcasts to 3G signals to the sweet sound of Anderson Cooper's voice to the delicious sodas that you imbibe at various places. And we love getting in you and laying our eggs. Now, I can assure you that the spawn that will soon emerge from within the wonderful brain that you currently have are going to bring you great feelings. They're going to open up your heart and eventually bring you to a state of full realization satori, whatever you want to call it, nirvanic bliss. And you're going to open your eyes and you're going to be either the Buddha sitting under the Bodhi tree gaining full realization or Jesus Christ on the cross dying in a really agonizing and painful way. Actually, it's up to you. You can pick one or the other. I just lay the eggs. We have got a wonderful podcast for you today. Freddie Todd is with us.

I take pleasure in knowing that by listening to this podcast, a door opens up within which is a treasure trove of potential hardcore blasters. Thanks, BlueChew, for sponsoring this episode. I wish I'd saved it for you. But somewhere, someone actually left an angry comment about how I had done a boner pill commercial. And they were really upset. And I thought it was so strange that there is an actual sense that something is degraded about boner boners and boner pills. We're not supposed to celebrate the foulest from which all human existence on this planet blasts from. I don't get that attitude, friends. Why are we, the war on boners must end. The war on erections must end. What is happening? I just watched this, this isn't the commercial anymore, by the way, this is just me rambling, but we just watched, I don't know, I don't know what's going on, but my wife and I kind of got into like a murder porn loop, not literal porn, but you know, like crime shows. And what's her name, man? There's this like woman who, I don't know, almost chopped her boyfriend's head off and stabbed in 20 times and like just really like, it was awful, it was awful. I mean, every single piece of it's just really weird, but she was like sort of attractive. So there was something more shocking about it because we have this horrific symmetrical hierarchy that exists in our planet where if someone has symmetry, we give them a little more leeway than if they don't. Regardless, the way that the people in the courtroom were reacting to the images of his slain, hacked up, shot body were not as intense as the way that they were reacting to or recording of them having phone sex. Like, people could stand seeing somebody who's got stab wounds all over their body and whose head has nearly been cut off, but the moment they started talking about like playing this just basic fucking phone sex, not even that creative, not even that exciting, just like some kind of like mild BDSM style phone sex. And the people in the courtroom, the look on their face was like they were watching a gargoyle explode out of the chest of the screaming pope. I don't get it, man, what's going on on our planet? We got to be a little less afraid of erections and more afraid of murder than we currently are. That's my inspirational message for you today. We had a glorious time on Sunday. I've been expanding my technological capacity so that right now I'm basically I'd say I've reached the point, most podcasters got to probably mid-2015. And that doesn't change the fact that I'm still impressed with myself and awestruck by the technology that we have now and the ease with which a person can just go online and stream psychedelic stuff. And so I've been doing some sort of test runs of something I've been wanting to do for a while, which is like a live video version of the DTFH. And we had one on Sunday and it worked. It worked way better than I expected. I was able to take calls or video calls from random people. I had some great conversations with folks who listened to the podcast and it was just a blast. It's kind of like a combination of me just rambling and that gets mixed in with some others. I mean, the possibility is infinite, of course. I mean, it's basically like running your own public access station. And I have lots of ideas for various components of the video, whatever, you know, I still use the word video, the online version of this show. Well, no, not even that. I don't know what you call it, whatever this is. The next expansion, when the DTFH finally emerges from whatever strange temporal chrysalis it's been locked inside of and leaps from just being an audio podcast into a video podcast. I'm not really sure what it's gonna look like and the many possibilities of the forms that could take are incredibly exciting, but I've gotta be careful not to get too distracted by the ins and outs of this particular technology. You should see the DTFH studio now. Holy shit, it looks like I'm in a combination spaceship opium den, which is what I've always longed for. Flying opium den, what could be better than that? Everybody pictures weird technological consoles and spaceships and that's always seemed pretty weird to me that people think that an advanced life form that had made a pretty ridiculous decision of putting their meat body inside a craft and flying through space is gonna be inside of some kind of metallic thing with lots of right angles and glowing Christmas lights and strange buttons that they have to press. Why wouldn't there be a fireplace and maybe a nice comfortable Persian rug and hookahs filled with some kind of amazing cosmic space dust that you could smoke and why wouldn't you watch movies? Why wouldn't you just lay around and sing and have sex and sit in a bathtub and watch movies and sometimes eradicate planets or capture black holes and send them to your friends back home? Why would you be in some symmetrical craft? I don't get it, but one day maybe we'll find out. Aren't you gonna be disappointed though if a spaceship lands and the landing, the whatever you call it, the ramp comes down and it's just like technological dudes in uniforms? I'm gonna be so bummed if they're even wearing clothes, I'm gonna be mildly disappointed. Like, oh, holy shit, this is like universal that we put weird clothes on our bodies. They haven't figured something else out. I want them to be naked as a J. I want them to be taking baths in there. I want there to be massage opportunities in the spaceship. I want there to be swimming pools and I don't know, like water parks in there and opium. I don't even want there to be space dust. I just want there to be big clumps of sweet opium, like from the days of Edgar Allen Poe. I've never smoked opium, so I might not even like it. I might be disappointed, but based on the writings of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, it seems pretty awesome and I think it would go well with flying through space. Regardless, I've gotten off track here. If you want to join us next or this Sunday coming up for another attempt at, that's gonna be, it's January 21st. If you're listening to this on January 21st, we're gonna do another of these live things and that's gonna be on Sunday at two o'clock. That's when we did it last time. We'll do it again then. You might be able to talk, we might be able to like beam you in. I'm still working out the technical problems with that. It's highly likely that something will go wrong in the most extreme way, because I'm still figuring out and it'll be some kind of shit show. This isn't gonna be a perfect, obviously, so you're not gonna be tuning into some kind of like hardcore refined thing yet. It's just fun, it's just fun to do. And it's fun to talk to everybody. I'm still trying to figure out a way to just do basic stuff like overlay the YouTube chat onto the videos so people can see what everybody's saying and I can see it without having to go to YouTube. I'm still working all this stuff out. I'm basically gonna need a tech person soon because I think it's gonna make it a lot smoother and I've gotta relinquish the control freak part of me that wants to be spinning the dials because it's fun to spin dials, but that's greedy. I want it all. I wanna be able to talk and spin dials. And you don't get to do both. You could do both, but this is gonna require some kind of telepathic interface that we don't have yet. Some way to have one part of your brain control the various technical aspects, whatever the particular art form of the future you've decided to engage in and then the other part of you to just be there. We've gotta figure out a way to bifurcate our consciousness and transmit it through some kind of as of yet invented technological medium. Maybe like a space crown that has little jewels in it. One jewel is for the talking part of you. One jewel is for the technological part of you. One jewel is for the part of you determining whether or not what you're doing makes sense. And of course, there's the jewel of Loraxat from Alpha, Beta, Centauri. And we will never talk about what that jewel would do on your telepathic space crown.

Patreon.com forward slash DTFH, sign up. Won't you? Today's guest. Wow, he's brilliant. I got nervous. This kind of happened last second. He was in town making music and we were talking on Twitter and then it occurred to me. Holy shit, man, ask him to be on your podcast. And I asked him and he was kind enough to come over here and I just didn't have the preparation time that I needed, no excuse, but I wish that I could have given him more of like an inside the actor studio style interview, which is what he deserves. If nothing else comes from this conversation, I hope that if you have yet to listen to his music that you will head over to Spotify or wherever you get music and listen to Freddie Todd because whoa, holy shit, man, this is like one of those deep inside the rainbow tech entities. I don't know how he's doing what he's doing, but sometimes I listen to his music and it just, it just, well, it's very inspiring to me. I mean, I'm surrounded by all these machines and I'm lucky if I can make like a mild melodic anything, but this guy's like sitting there deep inside technology using MIDI, which is essentially the new way of writing music to compose these insane bits of music. And of course he tours and puts on some incredible shows. So if you ever are in some place where Freddie Todd descends in his pleasure ship filled with opium and Oriental carpeting bathtubs and water parks, I hope that you will go to one of his shows. Now, without further ado, everybody please welcome to the DTFH, Freddie Todd. [""Welcome to the DTFH""] Freddie, welcome to the DTFH. This is so badass. Thank you. We just went through, I'm acting like I just appeared here and we've been struggling, sadly struggling with my equipment. We got it. I'm here with a true artist, a sonic artist. I am blown away by your music. Thank you so much, Duncan. That means the world to me. I'm a huge fan. I listen to your podcast a lot. Thank you. And it's mind blowing to be here. I've been listening to your new album, Crondor. Is that what it's called? Oh yeah. It's cool. Thanks man. It's detailed. Thank you. But your music's really interesting to me because of its complexity. I don't understand it. There seems to be so many weird levels to it. Sometimes when I listen to it, I think, where is he drawing it from? I don't understand because it's got this mathematical precision to it that is also incredibly psychedelic, but then also seems to show that you are, I guess, are you just constantly listening to music? Is that what you do all day long? Honestly, I'm not even. I wish I was. I don't listen to that much music. I probably listen to a lot of my friends' music and stuff like that. But I'm mostly just kind of making my own stuff and tinkering around and yeah. I have always loved the idea of a listener being able to listen back infinite amount of times and get something new and have so many layers, but peel back so many layers and just have something fresh for the listener every time. Because every second, you're a new person every time, so playing off of that. But you're sort of like, are you, what's the process? Are you hearing, how would you even hear that stuff? I guess where I'm, forgive me, I'm just a complete new when it comes to this stuff. I have synthesizers. But you're not, I've listened to the stuff you've been making on the podcast. It's amazing, dude. Thank you. Well, my process is just more like a ham radio operator. If I get enough chaos going with the synthesizers and I have a mild understanding of how some of the stuff works, then I can kind of zoom in on something, but mostly it's just more of a kind of tuning in than an intentional production. Whereas with your stuff, it just seems way too precise. I don't know what I'm doing. I'm doing the same thing. I guess I'm throwing spaghetti at a wall as well. It's just like, I don't know. I don't have much classical training at all. I mean, my dad taught me some drum stuff and I went to, I'd had school band and stuff, but never anything too in depth, just having fun with it, you know? What was your first contact with technology, like with the technology to start making this kind of music? Well, let's see. I've played in a handful of bands in high school and at one point I was like, it was really hard to keep everyone together and all the drama and everything like that with more than one person. Sure. So deciding to delve into something that you could control everything was great, great fun. Yeah, sure. So I guess, man, I don't know how old I was. Maybe 12 or 13, I kind of, my dad had Cubase. Cool. And I was using that to record some stuff. And then when I was 14, I remember that was the year my friend's older brother pirated FL Studio, Fruity Loops. Cool. And it showed me that and I was like, oh, Step Sequencer, you can lay out kicks and snares in a time-based grid, which is similar to writing notes. I mean, it's writing notes. It is. It's the modern way of writing notes, like sheet music. But anyway, that was mind-blowing. I was like, holy crap. And being a drummer from the get-go, I was like, oh, yes, that's fun. So 2004, I was 14 years old. And that's basically it. And then just kept tinkering around and having fun. Eventually put my music on the internet, on SoundCloud. And all of a sudden, I was getting flown to more shows and getting paid for that stuff more than my day job at a movie theater. Wow. And I was like. How are you, yeah, that's young. How young were you when you started doing flying the shows? Let's see, I guess probably 19 or 20, because I remember being under 21 for a couple years where we were just talking about this, where they made me sit in Chicago, California. They made me sit on the stage at age 19 or 20, the whole show leading up to my set. And I was such a youngster, little kind of spiting that. And I was, I got the promoter to sneak me some whiskey in a water bottle during my set. And I just got really drunk and had a lot of fun. Oh, yeah. It was just like, ah, young kid. But anyway, that's probably around that age, yeah. That's young to be doing live shows and doing, like doing that, especially in that kind of environment. I mean, shit, I could have died. If that had happened to me, I don't know what, I don't think I would have had any self-regulation when it came to psychedelics or getting high. Were you getting blasted? Luckily, luckily, I had tinkered around with the psychedelics earlier on and had a mini grasp of things. And furthermore, I was like, I knew how intense and humbling that stuff is and how it's not really a party drill. It's not always a party joke and it's a spiritual thing. So I was plus mingling with work. I didn't want to mess up the mix live at a show and stuff like that. I've noticed a similarity in people who are performing live in this way. And it is that there is a kind of discipline and also almost a sense of wanting to broadcast out there. Guys, don't get so fucked up at these shows. It's like, what are you doing? Because you can really, I'm sure you've seen it. You've seen people like OD at your shows, no doubt, right? Potentially. That whole thing is definitely a crazy part of the whole live music scene in general and just kids partying and epidemic right now going on in the United States with downers and just all that stuff. And yeah, basically the broadcast would be to treat psychedelics, be humbled by them and do them in nature with a guru or with a teacher or something and stay away from it. To each his own, first and foremost, of course, but also as the older brother, maybe just stay away from stuff that will harm you. Yeah, well, yeah. And also it's like, this is like when I was coming up, I think that the attitude with psychedelics was different than it is right now. So when I was coming up and going to raves, it was just what you did. What you did was you went to a party and you found some kind of MDMA or some kind of LSD and you would just take it. There was no responsible attitude. There was no, and also this idea of like, these are sacred medicines that are to be done in nature. So it was there kind of, but mostly at least in the like group that I was in, that really just didn't even exist. It was more of a like wild diving into, what now when I look back, I just think, Jesus dude, you're so lucky. You're so lucky you didn't get arrested. You're so lucky you didn't get busted. You're so lucky you didn't go nuts. You're so lucky you didn't wreck a car. But these days, I think people are wising up. It's cool. I think, didn't you have the dance safe guy on your show? Yes. So early on, I met the dance safe people. Emmanuel Safarias. Cool. That was a really awesome one. Really inspiring. Yeah, early on I met Carissa, our friend Carissa Cornwall was, I'm not sure if she still works with them, but she was head of some Midwestern chapter of it and was at all the shows. And it was really cool to see that coming forth, just smarter ways to, if you wanna do MDMA, which is incredible substance when it's actually MDMA, then it should be MDMA, like what the heck, why? But yeah, that dance safe is incredible. Now I've gotten into the most boring part, I guess, of my existence, because now that I've been meditating, there's this, these people, my teachers, they have said to me in different ways, you know there's a way to get high that we're not taking psychedelics. That makes psychedelics seem fun, but like a kind of side project compared to what this is. And I've heard that and heard that and it's always seemed really ridiculous to me as someone who was like basically like, since I was 15 taking psychedelics. And now I'm at the point where it's like, oh fuck, they're right, they are right to some degree. There is a potential access point to a reality that is so profound that psychedelics in a weird way are, I don't know, it's like putting a wig on it or something. It's like putting a funny colored wig on something that is already the source of colors, so to speak, you know what I'm saying? Yeah, yeah, distortion wig. A distortion, right, that's a good way to put it. Like the distortion is cool and I enjoy this, I still enjoy distorting reality in that way, but there is this other thing that, and to me, something about electronic music compared to other types of music captures that. Do you know what I'm saying? It captures something in reality that for whatever reason strikes me as being more of like, I don't know how to put it, but more, I don't wanna say alien because that sounds ridiculous, but more sort of like. More human. There you go, yeah, something like that, something that's just more of a approximation of, I don't know, maybe the quantum world or something. Right, well, technology's insane, right, because it's just, it's an extension of us. We created it, right, technically. Did we? I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, and. I mean, it came out of our brains, I guess. And so what blows my mind is using the technology, and, but it being commanded by your brain and through your arms and what you're doing, and it's just mind-blowing. Do you think it's alive, the technology? I've talked to some people who think that their computer or the device. That was Paul Selig, right, the channel. He was talking about his wife, and he was talking about when he got into an argument with his wife, the computer's acting weird. Yeah, what do you think about that? I mean, I'll start by saying I don't know anything, so I will subscribe to that as much as I won't, and so, yeah, I think there's possibility, room for everything being connected, everything being influenced by everything. I wanna talk about a phenomena, though, that I don't think I've ever talked about on this podcast, and maybe feel free to shoot it down, man. It's like, again, I'm fully willing to just disown any kind of odd experience, because it's better if it's just you being confused to just be like, oh, yeah, I was just confused. Nothing embarrassing about it, it's totally cool. But this particular phenomena, not only have I experienced it, but I've talked to other people who've experienced it, and I find it to be really fascinating, which is that working with electronic music, and especially with the modular synthesizers in particular, and dialing in a specific type of sound, drones or whatever, when you get deep into it, and suddenly you're somehow, it is working with you. You're sort of working together. It feels like it's not a one-sided relationship that's happening anymore with these machines. And then someone says something, right, a sentence. There's no microphones on, and suddenly the sentence gets echoed in the sound. So I don't know if that's ever happened to you, but I've seen someone say a thing, and then you're listening to the music, and within the music, that sound is being echoed within the music, but no intermediary device has taken your voice and put it in. What is that? You're the only person to ever put it into words, because I don't know how to describe that like that, but I have been producing a song, and I will write a flute part with a real flute sample, or a real flute thing on contact, like a real flute sample, and then I will be writing some other thing, and then that will be conjured out of the mystical ethos out of the mist, and it'll be like, whoa, that came up. Another synth somehow turned it, like sounds like that, like exactly like what you're saying, where these different, within the song, I guess it's very fractally, things will start repeating, and I don't know where. Well, let's start with the most obvious explanation. The obvious explanation would be, well, it's kind of like if you take anything and loop it, if you take the word yes, and loop it, yes, yes, yes. You do chants and stuff. But if you just take any sound specifically like a word, or a sentence, or a word, and like loop it, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. It starts sounding different. It starts changing, suddenly you can begin to hear other words within the word that aren't that word at all, something about the mind projecting onto sound or something like that. So maybe it's something like that. Maybe it's confirmation bias or something, but man, it's both. And also I was, what came to mind when you were explaining that you've probably heard of, I think his first name is Masuro Imoto, a Japanese gentleman who wrote this book about basically putting like a word on a water bottle or something. You've seen that where they zoom in on the water molecule and it says like the word is love or something and it'll look like this beautiful, fractal thing and snowflake thing. But then if you do some horrible word, it'll be a little more distorted. That's trippy. But that's kind of what we're talking about, things affecting things on such a micro scale and such a weird just saying something or writing an intention, right? It's an intention and I think that's where we're like, oh, wait, we're only using 2% of our brain. What are we capable of? What's going on here? And then within also this sort of idea of an animistic universe. So sort of the concept of like, oh, maybe sentience isn't something that happens because of a human body. Maybe everything has some sentience in it and maybe the electronics themselves are. Dragons and the crown doors in the system. Yeah. So when you were talking about repeating, actually, have you heard of this guy, Adam Neely? No, I don't know. I'll have to send you his YouTube stuff, but he's incredible musician, music theory kind of guy, but he's gone into polyrhythms and basically speed and time and I don't wanna blow his video because it blew my mind when I watched it, but basically just like repeating something, stuff speeding up so fast, it turns into one tone. And what he did was he did like a certain polyrhythm and then another polyrhythm that like... And then a third one and in proper ratios where it's like a nice beat and then he sped that, those three things up and it turned into a chord. Oh shit, cool. Sorry, maybe we should put in a disclaimer to not blow that one if anyone's not seeing it. To watch it, you mean? Well, that's the ending and I don't want spoiler alert. Spoiler alert, that's the word. First of all, for someone to feel like you just spoiled something, they've gotta be some kind of fucking music expert. You know what I mean? Because when I hear polyrhythm, you know what I do? I do this awful thing that I do habitually, which is I nod my head like, oh yeah, polyrhythm, of course. I know what that is, I don't. It's just two beats at once or two rhythms at once. Okay, cool. So like my one hand was doing one thing, the other hand was... Gotcha, okay, polyrhythm. Yeah. You know, what's interesting about music is it's in time, it's literally... You're sort of etching things into time. Which is really cool. So trippy. Yes, it is. It is trippy. Time space. Yeah, it's a time space art form. And then it's a mathematical time space art form. And the other thing that's really, really fascinating about it is some of the more mythological ideas about the universe itself originating from a vibratory state. Or that sound being the universe sort of emerging from sound, and sound being the fundamental quality of the universe, which, Pythagoras, I think, actually disagreed with that, saying that actually it's math, then sound. Math is the primary thing. And then sound comes next. Because with math is the purest articulation of reality, and sound is just math being translated through your ears. You know, it was really music and sound that really got me into looking into occult-ish stuff. Basically, I was trying to search for more stuff to do with the sounds and frequencies and everything. And I stumbled upon the Manly P. Hall, Secret Teachings of All Ages. They have in there, they have the Pythagoras section on music, and from there I just bought a bunch of books I would not have purchased if I delved into if I was not trying to figure out music and what the heck's going on with it. And I still have no idea what's going on, but. My feeling with it is like, well, I guess this is definitely, I don't know what this is, or how it evolved to the point that it's at right now, particularly musical notation. But musical notation is so clearly coming from some kind of occult universe. In the sense that here is something that's encrypted. You know, it's right in front of everyone, musical notation, but a lot of people have no idea how to read it at all, what it means. It's really weird and it's weird. And most of the musicians, like myself, have no idea how to read it or how we are even writing it. I mean, I write a lot in clicking MIDI notes in. And sometimes I'll have tinkle around on the MIDI keyboard, piano or whatever, but a lot of times I'm clicking in the notes. Holy fuck. You're just a pure alchemist, man. You're one of the people up in the towers. You've gone past the need of the wands and the accoutrements. You're just directly from mind into machine, MIDI notes, which is one day, I hope, to achieve that. Just the guys in the matrix hooked up making beats. It's a deeper, deep, deep, deep level. And I know that's kind of where it leads to, is eventually just programming it directly and with MIDI. But with musical notation, which was based on a previous technology, because they didn't have MIDI back then, obviously, the grand staff, for example, which you know what I'm talking about? That's called the weird shape thing on the side. Yeah, it's the like the treble clef. The treble clef. And then the bass clef. And they call it the grand staff. It's so weird. So it's got all this stuff tied up in it, which feels magical. What it feels like, it's like, this is based on, I don't know what they really meant with a staff, but a grand staff. Sounds like something a druid holds, some sonic staff. So it's like those kinds of things. The thing, the way it looks itself, if we didn't know what was music, you would just... What's look like little fairies? They look like little snitches from Harry Potter. That's right. Yeah, so even, yeah, within that, there seems to be a kind of acknowledgement of there being this sort of ecosystem, which like almost like an alternate dimension where sound lives. And within sound, there are like various daemons, so to speak, various sort of like entities that only live inside of sound. And when you're making music, it's suddenly you can potentially enter into what should not be a collaboration because you're the only person there. And suddenly it's almost like, oh, a little thing shows up. And it's like, I wanna make music with you. And now there's another thing coming through. And those are the moments that give me goosebumps because those are the moments where it goes from making music to catching music. I don't wanna sound like super pretentious or anything, but the other day I was re-listening to something I made and I was like, who made this? How did this happen? I'm not this good. I don't know what I'm doing. Cause it was like really jazzy kind of a thing. And I'm like, I don't know what I'm doing with that. But it exists. Something swam through you into the world. And that element of art is so simultaneously wonderful and simultaneously terrifying. Because if you are just producing a situation where music can swim through you into the world, you're just a little tributary made of meat that these little musical beings are swimming in it. Yeah, meat tributary. For the daemons. Lay me down, Damys. That's like some Manson shit. I'm a meat tributary for the daemons. That's all I didn't kill anybody. I'm a tributary of meat. It wasn't me. Quote me out. It's nice to meet you. I'm a meat tributary for musical daemons. Can I get you another drink? I'm not a musician. Just a meat tributary for musical daemons. But the, see, I think that the language itself needs to be improved, but in a sense that there needs to be a little bit more courageousness when it comes to the discussion of creation. Because I think for, you know, one thing I've noticed, which to me is one of the really most hilarious, tragic and noble things that I've witnessed is sometimes hardcore scientists are doing studies with psychedelics and have clearly sampled their materials and have clearly had powerful mind expanding life-changing experiences. Have to then take this. Sweet, sweet Hoffman. Yes. And, but they got, because it's a scientific community, and because they've recognized that when used in conjunction with therapy, there's the potential for true transformation of society and of the individual. They're smart and they're like, wow. Yeah, but they get the importance of it. But they also know that if they were to sit down with a group of scientists who had yet to experience this and say, well, guys, see, what happened is this? Well, there appears to be a kind of, for lack of a better word, a ecosystem of beings that just want to help us. And one of the ways they talk to us is when we take psychedelics, and usually what they say is it would be good if we were more compassionate and kind to each other and there's types of healings that are possible. But you can't say that, because if you say that to a scientist, they're gonna be like, you are fucking nuts, man. So you have to translate it. And this is where you come up with these like amazing things that these scientists have come up with, which is literal quantifications of mystical states. So they've come up with quantification methodology to sort of measure out transcendent states of consciousness. And they have to do that because if they don't speak in that language, then they can't bring the demon out of the meat tributary into this world to translate it here that requires a type of conversion into something that is understandable, accessible, and not very threatening. Because for a lot of people, you sound cuckoo for fucking cocoa puffs. If you say spirits are coming through you when you make music. Mm-hmm, exactly. And again, I don't believe that, I also believe everything. I don't believe anything, and I also believe everything. It's like, so yeah, it's, I was gonna say, writing music is trippy in the fact that it's little time capsules where it's kind of a screenshot, snapshot of that artist's life or that point in time. But yeah, back to the daemons. Oftentimes, I'll be like, maybe it's because I'm on the road too much and I'll be hanging out with people, but I'll turn around and be like, hey, you guys, you guys like that? Oh, no one's in here, no one's in here. Or I'll be like with a one friend and be like, you guys like that? But it's just my one friend. Well, you look, I mean, it's- Who are you calling guys? Who are you talking to? The, well, so it's kind of like, so one thing that people are more comfortable discussing these days, which is hilarious, is gut bacteria. So a lot of people are understanding now that we're, it appears there seems to be some connection between behavior and gut bacteria, specifically like food habits that gut bacteria are sending, somehow sending signals to us that are making us crave certain things. Totally, yes, yes. So you could say this, you could say, well, there's definitely like gut bacteria living inside of you that is making you want to eat ice cream. But you can't say- There's actually dubstep bacteria in your ear that makes you crave bass music. Well, man, right, you can't say that. You can't say, who knows? Where does it stop? I mean, if the gut bacteria is making me want to eat some fucking ice cream, what else is it? Well, the other, we were talking about water and the Emoto and intentions being put under water and water molecules. I often forget, what are we, 70% water? Something like that, we're very water. Yeah, yeah. Very much water. It's going up. So what are things doing? What are frequencies? And then a full song is a lot of frequencies. So what is that doing? Well, we know subwoofers and bass and bass, heavy bass shows, you know, rattle things. And oh, you know what is really interesting? Have you checked out Symatics? No. Oh, you mean the shapes? Yeah, basically just visuals in water via vibrations. Yeah, right. And stuff's incredible. Right. Can't explain it, but it's incredible. It's math, you know. And so then that, so yeah, you see that. It's magical. You vibrate things at a certain frequency and they form these very specific geometric shapes. I think at certain resonant. So basically we've, I've done this with my roommate, Wes. We've in Detroit, we put a plate of water on my subwoofer which not surprisingly shortly after broke, but it ended up. You spilled water all over. We didn't spill water, but it just, it was done. We ended up becoming part of a robot statue in the backyard. But anyway, a tribute. But anyway, we took a sweep of a single synth tone, maybe like a sign, simple sine wave or something. Sounds like do and start real low. And that sound is what subwoofers are. Like a lot of 808 kick are made of simple sine wave. So anyway, we started really low and sweep it up slowly upwards and pitch. And at certain sections, the sound becomes resonant, I guess, with itself. I don't know anything. We probably ask an expert, but when it hits certain resonant peaks, it will, that's when you see these incredible, and in between them are incredible formations, but that's when a real crystallized like image is being vibrated in the water. And then you keep going up and it keeps getting more and more fractalized. It's really crazy. Crazy. Wait, what? And then you remember that you're made of water. Right. Wait, whoa, whoa. And then also you remember that we're like water expressing itself through action, emotion, thoughts. And then, yeah. Yeah, and in this situation, it's like when the vibration is affecting the water, it's affecting just pure water minus all of the other conditions that allow it to be sentient, which is what we are. So when music crosses paths. Yeah, we have blood and we have a bunch of crazy or other stuff. Crazy stuff, yeah. We're crazy alchemy. Yes, crazy alchemy. We're crazy walking alchemy projects. We're alchemy laboratories. Yeah. And that's the premise of so many wonderful philosophies and religions is like this idea of, oh yeah, what's beautiful about being a human is that you're a walking laboratory. Hello, I'm Alchemy Lab. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's it, man. You're an alchemy lab. And then when you, so within this alchemy lab of the self is there are a lot of little experiments you could do. And these experiments involve what you're saying, which is the kind of agnosticism. It's like you want to sort of allow yourself the episode. I don't, we don't know anything, but we, yeah, but we want to allow ourselves in case. Well, you just want to be able to open yourself. The idea would be, okay, let's push aside the obvious thing. Like let's just all admit right now that Neil deGrasse Tyson is right. He's right, he's right, he finished the project for us. We don't need to know anything else. He did it. 1,000 years of deGrasse Tyson. It's done. He figured it out. Carl Sagan figured it out. Stephen Hawking figured it out. Richard Dawkins figured it out. It's all been figured out. Okay, let's just, so let's admit that there is a, we'll call it the deGrasse layer, okay? The Tyson layer. He's at the top, he's at the top of the pyramid. Yeah, we got it. So there, okay. Now we know that. So we're all safe. No one's going crazy. DeGrasse de Tyson. We admit it. This is a fucking gravity well with the planets sticking in it. There's just matter. That's it. You die, you're dead forever. That's it, there's nothing more. We don't, if there is something more, we don't know it yet. And whatever you fucking think it is, Stoner, is not what it is, okay? So that's, okay, so let's start there. We got that. Okay, the base layer. Yeah, we got that. So now let's push that aside. Okay, fuck that. That's gone. So now we, but we all know we're not gonna go crazy. Magic can exist. This is, now the next step will be, okay. Now, let's imagine that we are host to a variety of organisms in our own body. This is actually on the Neal deGrasse Tyson real. We have mitochondrial DNA. This is on the Neal real. This is on the Neal real. So we know this is Neal real. So we have mitochondrial DNA, and then we have gut bacteria, and not to mention all the things living just in the ecosystem of what we are. We're like a tree filled with a variety of creatures that are living inside us. We're parasites. We're a jungle. We're diseases. We're a jungle. So, okay. So that's great. That's, we're still on the, on that. We're still on the real. Hairy jungle. We're a hairy jungle. And in our hair, there's little mites chomping our hair like corn. Yeah, they love it. They love it. We love it. Yeah, that's right. And then also our eyes are eating light. We know that like photons are coming into our eyes. Be that in the photons have been essentially spawned in the sun over millennia. And then our eyes are just gobbling them down and turning them into vision. And then our ears are automatically transforming waves, mathematical waves into something that we call sound. It's crazy. Yeah. That's still on the time. So, but that is, that's, so this, that's still on the Neal Reel. But then if we want to kind of move a little step past the Neal Reel, we would enter into the great question that Jack Kornfield says is the first thing they asked him when he became a monk, which is where are you in your body? So this is a fair question. The mind versus the brain, right? Yeah. What has there been any research into dreams and the mind and dream state? And I mean, I was just talking about this, how it's like, yeah, we quantify like maybe what alpha state or whatever the heck the brain, however they even measure that, but, and then what is that? That's kind of it. They've gone deeper in this for the Neal Reel, but we all know we can all agree. We all go to bed at night and then we go into this other world. And then that's, that's happening. We all, we can all agree on dreams, like what, what is that? What is that? Yeah. And then how about the non-dreams? How about just closing your eyes and four hours past? Right. Now the, the, the, uh, this is called continuity of the non-continuity of self. So in the sort of analysis, the idea is like, all right, well, we know we have gut bacteria living inside of us. And then clearly there's a me living in me and this forest of like bacteria and mitochondrial DNA and pubic hair and shit and piss and blood and flesh and oxygen. It's, it's me somewhere in there. There is a me living in here, you know, somewhere there must be. I gotta be in there somewhere. Where are you? Where am I? Where is it? You know, and with, so within this exploration is where things get really fun. Because it's like, if you're going to be agnostic about the daemons, the coming through the meat tributary into your sound, then you're going to have to be agnostic about the existence of yourself. In other words, are you any more real than those daemons? And if you are, how so? Right. You disappear every night, you reappear in the morning, that self that you attach yourself to, you disappear when you get caught up in your thoughts. How many, how often have you looked up in three hours has passed? And you're like, where the fuck was I? We are the daemon. Right, there you go. Yeah, so there it is. So it's like, suddenly it's like, well, okay, I can't confirm for sure that interdimensional beings are flowing through me when I'm making art or chatting or talking. But one thing I do know for sure is there does seem to be something living inside of this meat jungle called myself. And whatever that fucking thing is, I guess it's me. It's trying to do art, it's trying to scream at something. Yeah, it thinks it's something. I think I'm a thing. And then, so then you get into this interesting conundrum, which is where are your words coming from? And every single moment there's a flow of words coming out of your mouth. You go and order your coffee, you go get on the phone with someone you love, the sounds you make when you're fucking, all those sounds, where are they coming from? The stream of consciousness is crazy. Where does the stream start? And that's when like jamming and playing music and jazz musicians and, where did, where did you come from? Where did you go? I don't even know idea. That, because you know that as a musician. So the thing where, I think, and this is maybe the secret society of musicians and the big secret all musicians share, I guess, is when you all get together and start making music, something weird happens. You start sharing a mind or something. Like suddenly, something. Oh, that's what I was remembering. I just read a thing about, we were talking about water and the bodies. And so I just read this statistic about this thing that scientists, that the Neil Reel has agreed upon, that humans in large crowd form will move like water, flow like water in whatever the scientific term for hydro, hydrodynamic or something like that, where it will like move like water, like flow like flowing through like a huge, like a huge crowd leaving a concert or something. No one's like, there's not one director in the back like, all right, everyone do this now. But we're all moving collectively like water. So that's another proof, more proof of what the heck, everything's connected, man. Well, it's the water inside of us, I guess, and already knows what to do. The waters are lured, the waters are over lured. Yeah, that's what's happened. Yeah, well, what it is is it's like, so it's kind of like water is a perfect way to get into the conversation of the perfection of all things, because when you sort of throw water on the ground, anyone can do this anytime you wanna do it or if you wanna go and watch the rainfall, it's a better thing if you happen to be in a place where there's rain. We're lucky right now, LA rain, maybe. Yeah, I'm still, it would be nice if you'd cover it on a sunny day, but right now it's raining. I've never been here when it's raining, so I'm fine, I'm happy for the city. That's a good attitude towards it, man, it's like. I mean, I lived in Oakland for two years during the drought. Oh, there you go. Of Oakland, and. Great drought of Oakland. The great brutal drought of Oakland. And it was crazy, it was one season. Anyway, I'm sorry. You've experienced the blistering blue perfect, endless perfect day of Southern California. We needed a shower. We needed, yeah. But you don't judge water. Right. When you're watching water come out of a drain pipe onto the ground, unless you're like the most massive dick on planet Earth, you're not looking at the water flat of the drain pipe and thinking, look at that lazy ass fucking water. See how it just does only what it has to. Like that water doesn't do shit. It just like basically does only what it has to. And then that, and then it's looking at the way it flows. It, yeah. Freakin' water. Freakin' water, just only does what it has to. And you know, but. Was it Ramdas who was talking about treat everyone like trees? Don't judge tree, you wouldn't judge a tree. That's right. You wouldn't judge a tree. You wouldn't judge a flower. You wouldn't judge a water. Well, you wouldn't judge, there's no water judge. There's nobody. Too wet crew. Look at that. Yeah, those guys. Hey, props on being in too wet crew. That's great. It was one of the great honors in my life. Yeah, that's honorable. But since we're mostly water. Okay, so we know we're what? 70% water. Let's just pretend that's the number. It's probably. 70 something. 70, whatever. I will say that. And then, okay, so there's 30% of something else. Yeah, what is it? Well, a lot of that's got back to you. Oh, yeah. And shit. That's right. So then, but somewhere in there, there's supposed to be a self, right? But because we're 70%, we're mostly water. And we know that water is unblameable. Water is. Can't blame the water. Right. And if you think water is perfect in your 70% water, then 70% of you is perfect. Right? It's beautiful. That's pretty great. That's above failing grade. That's wonderful. 70% perfection is incredible. But then I think we could take it up a little higher. Because I'm not sure what the other stuff is, but let's just imagine it is gut bacteria. Let's imagine we're 5% gut bacteria. Who judges gut bacteria? Like, no one's writing reviews of gut bacteria. There's no Yelp for your gut bacteria. So, you know what I mean? Gut bacteria, as far as I know. Gelp. Gelp. You know, I encountered this gut bacteria and it was, I was really disappointed in the way it was. There's pictures of them. You can swipe through the pictures. Maybe gut bacteria are fine. Dude, this is, honestly, this is five, we're five years ahead of the curve. They're gonna have Gelp. Gelp. Maybe gut bacteria do, maybe gut bacteria is what sends the signal to write a shitty Yelp review and your pizza sucks. Who knows? Maybe that's where it's coming from. But then it's kind of like, you know, what I'm getting at, the point is, there is no, if you can't find you, number one, you really can't find you and you. You really can't. You don't know where you live in you. You just have this kind of thing that comes out of your mouth. That's when there's no accountability and then that's when you get people doing heinous crimes and things, you know. Now we're in a really interesting zone, aren't we? Because it's like, you want, we really, what we would love to have is a monster. So if you manage to find yourself a good monster, right? Let's take Jeffrey Dahmer, a true monster, a monster. But then you sit and if you look at Jeffrey Dahmer, like, all right, 70% of you is water. Now is that water evil? I don't think so. So if I sucked 70% of the water out of Jeffrey Dahmer. It's probably got some weird vibrations, but yeah, you can't judge that water. Can't judge the water. So like, in my God, if you want to talk about a mass murder or the ocean, holy shit. If we're going to talk about evil water, like, good God. Those are rough seas. How many people have drowned in the ocean? How many, like, but the ocean is blameless, it's fine. But 70% of Jeffrey Dahmer's water, somewhere in there, there must be something evil. Where is it? What is it, right? Where do we find it? Is it the fucking abuse that the kid had? Is that the evil? Is it the echo of the abuse that stuck in him? Another fractal. Or is it, what's that? Another fractal. Yes. It's all fractals. Is it his brain? Is it a neural connection in his brain? Is there some kind of like, or is there within Jeffrey Dahmer, was there, a precise, malefic, dark, decision-making process that was evil? And you know the problem is, I don't think so. I think you're just looking at a kind of rotten echo. An eddy, a shitty fucking- Yeah, because you can't have him without his parents and so forth. The fractal, his brain is a fractal of his parents' brains. And whatever happened in his childhood. Yeah, and now we're in trouble. Because our entire system is based on having like, you know, like people who are evil. And if we're now, if we're in a situation where it's like, you know, mostly it seems like we're reflecting. I saw the Dalai Lama talk in Anaheim and that's what he said. He said, if someone hurts you, you're probably seeing an echo. It's a bouncing, it's a thing bouncing off of someone. It's a bouncing energy that was been bouncing around for a long time. And so then here is where we run into a real problem, I think, which is, you know, interdependency. We're all completely reflecting each other. We're all part of the water, the crowd of humans trying to move out of the concert. Yeah, yeah. Who knows? Maybe rivers are dicks. Maybe like in the river, there's like- You know what? They are. You know what? Screw water. Water sucks. Fuck water. What if we just find that out that water's just an asshole? Water's completely shitty. The thing that's bad about people is the water. It's the waters and shit. Other parts of the universe, they talk shit about water. It's like, fuck Earth, it's 70% water. Water's an ass. So we all start drinking Gatorade, Powerade, and- There's so much water in Gatorade. You just have to start drinking dirt. Just get the dust, just get the dust out of the Gatorade. The key is pure dehydration. We have to figure out a way to suck the water out of us and then punish the water. It's not enough to just fucking take the water out. We need to punish the oceans. Maybe that's what the oil spills are. Maybe they figured it out. We're punishing the sea. I get it. It's a huge tribute to the sea. The oil companies, that's the only reason they exist. They're saving us. They're actually saving us. They're teaching me. They're trying to tame the seas. You know, sometimes I like to go out to the ocean and just get my whip out and start whipping. I love whipping water. When I'm depressed, I go and whip the water. Anytime there's a tsunami, just go out and start spanking the water. This is, I think, as absurd as it sounds, I do think it's an important thing because it's like anytime you're beating yourself up, you're whipping water. Yeah, you're screaming at the sky. Yeah. You're shaking your fist at the sky. Yeah, that's the first thing. You come home. You're an old man screaming at sky. Yeah. What have I done? I can't believe I did that. What's wrong with me? I must be a real piece of shit. Well, first of all, figure out which part of you isn't, is the piece of shit. It's like, that's the main thing. It's like, maybe you have to shit. You might just need to shit. But eat some food, take a nap, drink some water. Are you hard on yourself? Are we drinking water again? Can we drink water still? Nope. No more water for the rest of the day. We have to purge. I'm gonna try this experiment. Are you hard on yourself? Check on me in three days. If I'm still okay. Am I hard on myself? Yeah. I'm definitely a perfectionist. I like to say that for finishing projects and music and presenting stuff to the collective world. So in that case, yeah, I'm probably, probably kind of hard on myself with work and stuff. But lately, I mean, honestly, listening to your podcast, you have a lot of positive people, people talking about self-care and self-love and just positive stuff like that. More and more lately, trying to forgive myself, you know? Hold my hand, you know? Yeah. Put my hand on my heart and be like, oh, it's cool. It's okay. I've always been, tried to not be super hard on myself and just have fun and joke or just, I love comedy, you know? I don't like to watch horror movies. Yeah. Yeah, man. I know what you mean. It's like the... It's like, hey, we're trying to have fun yet? Well, that. Yeah, well, like lately, it's like, you know, a lot of these conversations we're talking about where these positive people, it affects me. And then it's really brought me to a point of taking a deep look into self-ness, so to speak. And then figuring out like, shit, what is fun? Like, what is, you know, I just, someone tweeted this really sad thing. I can't remember who it was. It was about their kids. It was a real pissed off tweet, but somebody got like 50,000 retweets. And he was like, you know, people aren't gonna say this, but having kids is destabilizing and it's just a lot of the time it's not fun. And I remember, I mean, my thinking on that, I was like, wait, what? What is fun? Yeah, what's his idea of fun? You know, and then I, and then from there, I'm like, wait, before I judge this guy, what the fuck is my idea of fun? Right. You know, what is it? Like, what would fun be? And then what the fuck is, and since then I've been thinking like, I'm not really sure what fun is. I actually, you know, because we kind of chatted about it briefly. I looked up the etymology to talk about the least fun activity, looking up etymologies, but I looked up etymology, the etymology of fun, and it comes from to trick or a fool. Wow. You know, so. Interesting. Yeah, really interesting, but like, you know, having fun. The jester is important. Andy Kaufman is important. You're important. The comedians are important. We need that. Fun is my goal. To me, and I don't know who I am, but to me, it feels deep down like that's really important. Comedians. Not being too hard on yourself or the world or just having fun. You're a comedian. Me? Yeah. Oh, yeah, I think. You love fun. I'll, listen, as a fucking comedian. You are fun. The comedian side of me will be the first thing to say how important comedians are. I'll tell you that. That's one of the qualities of a fool. A fool will right away bugle about the importance of themselves. Like, that's the first step of being a fool is you've got to think you're important. If you don't think you're important, then you might not be a fool anymore. Now you're getting wise. You better watch out. Step one, first thing, you're super fucking important. Secretly, step two, pretend that you're not. That's the kind of the dance a fool does. It's like, you know what I mean? Like down inside, you kind of have this messiah complex and you're like, maybe I could save the world. Which is why so many comedians- It's the only way to get out the door, right? Yeah. But you embarrass yourself. It's a good, as a comedian, it's like the number one way to embarrass yourself. So like, a lot of people these days get really angry at comedians because many comedians will suddenly step out. So to speak. And they will announce some broad global world peace plan. It's not even funny. They're convinced they figured out a way to save the world. And then the reaction they get for it will quite often be accolades, you know? Because whatever the thing that they've come up with is this sort problem. And then the solution seems kind of poignant or something. And so then the comedian gets placed on the throne. Which is an ancient tradition. Like all the greats, George Carlin, just talking about like the most epic stuff, right? Yeah. And then inevitably what happened, so like there was a, I've heard about this. What you would do is you take the fool, if you're a king, the idea is you take the fool and then you put them on the throne for the day. So you let the fool be the king for a day and then it's the most hilarious fucking thing. Because over the course of the day, if you had a true fool, then the fool would begin to start thinking he was a king or she was a king. And that was what was the funniest thing to everybody is you would begin to watch this transformation happen because this is a fool. And the fool naturally begin to become a king if you don't watch out. And this I think is a really dangerous thing when you're around a trickster. Because if you're around a trickster and you give, put a crown on a trickster, the trickster is going to like be the king. Trickster's king now. That's what, now you have Trump. Well, I mean. They'll have the sword of Damocles over them. Have you heard of that? You know that, I love that. You mean the thread with the sword hanging? I love that where any king or anyone in power has this thin thread of it could all be over. There's so many people against you and the sword of Damocles. Well, I mean, this was the idea. The idea would be that like the nobility of a king or a true leader is like there are many noble traits. One of the noble traits is there is a kind of lion tamer quality to them, which is like they fully understand the serious and sinister position they put themselves in because people will cut your head off. That was the idea is like the high of the, you've basically decided to move in to a hornet's nest and start telling the hornets how to fly. And like, if you step out of line, they'll just kill you. I mean, there's the potential to really get killed. But then on top of that, there's a love for the hornets or true, sincere, authentic love for the hornets. So it's like, yeah, being a leader. When you have a good king. Yeah, yeah. Well, I mean, the great leader. A great leader, yeah. One of the greats. You don't, this is in the Daodae Ching, the great leader. Have you ever heard this? The greatest leader you would never know was there was a leader. Cool. There wouldn't even be a sense that there was a leader. And then the next step down from that, I think, is if people are revering the leader, it's already considered a kind of degradation. It's tainted. It's tainted if there's reverence. And then the next step would be fear, right? If you fear the leader, then it's really fine. Then it's all downhill. Now you have autocracy. And then after that, it just, yeah, it continues to collapse, yeah. So whenever you have a leader that is producing fear dynamics, you're seeing a very degraded leader type. When like the idea would be a kind of like, and like, you know, a great, I think a really great, do you remember, I don't know if you remember the days when like the president would give a speech and you really didn't give a shit. It was kind of boring. And you couldn't like repeat, you couldn't respond on some forum in the air, in the air and respond to the leader, how they spelled two words wrong in a row. How can we do, how are we allowed to do that? What is Twitter? That's wild. Direct contact with a prep with a leader. How? Yeah. Who decided that? Yeah, it's wild. I remember when Twitter first came out, I thought I was gonna flop. It's like, who the fuck wants to leave tiny little messages in space? Nobody cares, like, no one cares. And then suddenly it became this like apocalyptic tool. Yeah, what? All of a sudden the president's talking to a dictator. It's mind-blowing, Twitter's interesting because all my musician friends, including myself, will use it to be comedians. Use it for like one-liners. And that seems to be what really only matters on there with the collective consciousness. Obviously I'll upload, be like, I'm doing this show or something, but the hits are the jokes, you know? And just boiling it back down to people. People, girls just wanna have fun. Yeah, girls just wanna have fun. People just wanna have fun. Yeah. I just wanna have fun. That's the, well, it's like the reality of it is that, so the creation of the fun state, right? So the idea is like, typically there are fun moments and there are non-fun moments. And then there's also the moments in getting to a fun moment, right? So like classic fun, the beach. Like, so the way it works is when you pack up your stuff and get in the car and you drive to the beach and then you go out in the sand and you lay out in the sand and that is like, now you've entered into the realm of fun. And then you get back in the car and drive home, not as fun, and then you get home and you kind of had an okay time and you fall asleep. But within this is a peak. The beach moment is the peak. The lead up to that is not quite as fun and then going away is certainly not fun. And so this is a kind of way that people paint reality, which is we produce moments that, oh, that's when I'm gonna be having fun. Right now, not so much. I'm in traffic, this couldn't be fun. Or the opposite, anticipating something stressful or something or procrastinating and just thinking about that leading up to it isn't great. And so I think the answer is the great old Buddhist, the old, be here now, the live in the now. Because I feel like when I'm anticipating something, I'm only thinking about the future and then I'm living in that moment of anxiety or waiting for the beach, thinking, being in the car, thinking about the beach, oh, anxious or whatever. But if you're in that moment, you're singing along to the song in the car and just having fun and I guess fun would be being in the moment, right? And that's being here now and stuff. Just being, being, being fun. Yeah, like, I don't know. The, like, because first you have to kind of define fun. It's like, well, I guess for, like, it's, you know, if you look at like a Coca-Cola commercial or if you look at like any commercial and you see the projection of fun coming out of- The polar bears. People wanna sell you shit, yeah. Those fun polar bears with sweaters. Yeah, that, usually fun involves either some kind of like insane frenetic activity. Like you're at a place with fog and lasers or fun involves, you know, the moments after purchasing a thing or fun involves a kind of like rare gathering. You know, one thing I saw, the most sinister commercial I've seen lately, portraying fun, is a crown royal commercial which shows a guy walking, shamelessly, walking down the street with a bottle of crown royal attached to- That's illegal. He's just carrying a bottle. That's illegal. It's just, whatever, it's a bottle of fucking crown royal. I mean, it's like, just put in a bag or something, man. He better be in New Orleans. Just seems weird, you know? But then where it gets even weirder, which, you know, whatever, fucking strolling down the street with a bottle of crown royal, who gives a fuck? That's your thing, I don't know. To each his own. To each his own. Have fun. But then he gets to home, he's visiting his mom. And he pours a glass of crown royal for himself and his mom, who lives alone, it seems like, and I guess this is like a sweet moment between son and mother, which is to share a glass of crown royal. It just seems weird, man. Yeah, what's fun is when the crown royal execs get their checks and bonuses. That's so much fun. It's fun for them, I'm sure. It's fun for them to make it seem like an intimate moment, a sweet moment with your mom involves fucking crown royal. And then he leaves his mom alone at the house, I guess, and goes to a bar where he drinks more crown fucking royal. His whole life is the crown royal universe, right? So this is fun. It's gotta be, it's gotta be for those execs to have fun. Fun is conditional. One thing for certain is that for many people, fun is conditional. There needs to be a certain condition. And also I looked at the opposite of fun, which do you know what it is? But I guess, what, bored? Putting bees in your ass. The eye. I get it. Yeah, that's true. The opposite of fun. Universally, they did a study. They went all over the planet. Now that's on the Neil real. Yeah, the Neil real Neil deGrasse Tyson actually did an entire like amazing episode like what unites us as a species is we all hate getting bees shoved in our ass. It's the worst. Terrible. The delivery mechanism for the bees is completely irrelevant. Not the best. Not the bee situation. Not the beast. Not the best, not the beast. Yeah, so like in this like exploration of humanity, they found that like, whether it's like one bee to 30 bees, to a bee hive, to a hornet's nest. No fun up your ass. We just don't like it in our ass. We don't like bees in our ass. The bee, and guess what? The bees don't like it either. No one's having fun there. The bees aren't having fun. You're not having fun. That's the opposite of fun. Bees don't like it. Right underneath that, boredom, you know, boredom. And here's where it gets really interesting. They found that it's impossible to be bored when you have bees in your ass. We've solved it. We've solved it. So like basically like the antidote to, now boredom is considered the opposite of fun. And this is where it gets fucking weird, which is like the antidote to boredom universally. Put some bees in your ass. You will not be bored anymore. You will have something to do. You will have an activity to do. There'll be meaning in your life, sadly. Boredom is the opposite. That's a great solution. It's a world peace, world fun, is perpetuate that via bees in your ass. Yeah, it's genius. And this is why the bees are dying. You see, what's happening is. They figured, Neil's figured this out, and it's been harvesting a lot of bees. People have been so bored lately. They've been shoving bees in their ass to give their lives meaning. And it's like the bees are like not only, you know, obviously dying from suffocating in people's asses, but they're also committing suicide because of the, even the chance. Some of them though are actually evolving and becoming part of the ass. Yeah. And so now you have humans with BS. Yeah, yeah. BS. Yeah, yeah, that's really fun. BS is actually the lead cause of. Traffic? I think traffic. Yeah, well, they're just, you know, there's a lot of theories behind like, this phenomena that's happening, which is like the main thing is, is like we don't know how many people are doing it. So like if, you know. That's the problem. That's why traffic, there's a lot of angry people. We, oh yeah. A lot of angry people. And you can blame them, you know? Usually the bees are, bees are usually blaming them. They're pretty pissed. They're stinging. They're up there stinging. In the water. Not happy. The fucking, the main thing guys, I think the takeaway from this is we're tributaries for demons and that the best way to not be poor to shove bees in your asshole, but boredom. And make sure to whip the water when you're. Well, the best way to torture water. Yeah. The main thing guys that we're saying here is just find a beehive and throw it in the ocean. That's right. We, we, the, no, fun. The opposite of fun is boredom. And boredom is what is painted as in the, in our culture, boredom is literally like the thing we have to avoid the most. Like boredom. Check your phone. Check your phones. Check your phone. Check your phone. Yeah. Check your phone. Watch out. You're getting bored. Oh God. Yeah. It's taking over. Yeah. That's it. So everything, like everything we see on TV and everything that we hear and many of the products are various antidotes to this idea of boredom of being still, of not doing anything. It's over, it's over stimulation. Yeah. That's it. Yeah. Fun. Remember when we used to just sit and hang out around the fire with the, with the ancient ones. The ancient times. And we would just do our thing without screens. Yeah. That sounded kind of cool. But now is cool too. I mean, electronic music is fun. It's crazy. Making music is, is glorious. So much fun. So much fun. Stream of consciousness doing. Becoming a talker. Let's talk more about what you were talking about, which is kind of almost conjuring. What is that? Especially for modular synths. And so you've, you've experienced this with, cause that's pure electronic voltages and just really real. Really, really real compared to digital is more in the, in the box, in the computer. But that's why this modular stuff is, is crazy to me. The realness of the voltages and the electricity. Yeah. I don't know what I, like my sense of it is that it's some kind of, for me, I see it as more of a kind of like oracular device, like a kind of like reading entrails. And I know that if I've got a practice where I've been sitting and if my mood, my consciousness is even slightly shifted with an intentionality of being grateful for my existence, then the music I get lucky enough to dial in is usually more harmonious and sweet. If I'm confused or pissed off or freaked out or whatever, then for like either just squawking awful shit comes out or like, you know, nothing really flows or there's even worse, the worst of the worst is a kind of like sense of squeezing out something. Like I kind of wanting to push a thing out of the sense or wanting to like pull a thing out, rip a thing out. All those aspects of it just suck. Slyther out. Yeah. Yeah. Like we just get a snake to come slithering out. Come here. Yeah. And sometimes I'll stream making music on it. And like when I do that, it's really funny because I'm- Then you have the external forces. That helps. Yeah. But my assumption when I'm doing that is people just know that I know that I don't know how to make music on these things. That's the key, I think. Yeah. Just not be so, not be too serious. But I think there's two modes of thought with what we're talking about. One mode I kind of subscribe to is what we're talking about is there's so many variables. I don't think I can get the same thing twice with all the variables going on. Now there's other more scientific producers and stuff that will be more in the mode of thought saying, no, no, no, no. It's all science. It's all frequency. Just dial everything in the same exact way. Yeah. But I don't know, man, like you're saying, I think there's something more to it where you're channeling something's going on when you're turning these. Of course, there's so many variables. Maybe it's just really hard to dial it in the exact same way. I'll tell you. You always get infinite new things. And you get that like one thing that I've, you know, this is so, I'm sorry, man. You know, you're so fucking cool that I keep forgetting you're this genius music producer. And I was just rambling about making synth music. No, no, no, dude. The thing is, you know, more than I know in this particular, like I don't even have a modular analog synth. I had no idea what's going on. You tricked me for that. You made me very comfortable. I appreciate that. But the the. Yeah, one thing. And again, this is a complete neophyte nubes shit. But like one thing, you know, I was recording music into Ableton from this thing and I'm like listening to it. God damn it. What what is going on that when it goes into Ableton, it sounds completely different or there's a. It's missing something. And then I realized like, oh, you dope. What's happening is you're playing it from your speakers and the speakers are reflecting off the walls and that's producing a sound that you can't capture through the line because it's coming through. Or at least I'm not. I don't know what technique to capture the reverb. You could record through the mic. You could record it through the mic. Yeah. And then maybe blend the two together or something because it seems like the mic recording would sound. You could do anything. Right. That's the other element. That's the fun part is that you could do that. And you I was I was thinking, man, my dad just for Christmas. He gave me this little. He said it's waterproof. This little it's little Bluetooth speaker thing. I want to record. I want to take a mic into the bathroom and have a part of my song and drop it into the tub. And that's a filter, you know, and record that with a mic. Yeah. I want to do that next. That element of it. Yeah. Yeah. So you know what we've done? So I have a side project called Gucci Men with Space Jesus. No way. And we recorded the sound of the sub. In my studio in Oakland a couple of years ago when we wrote this song, we were noticing when the sub hit a certain note, it would rattle whatever part of the wall or something. And we're like, oh, that's that's hot. So we took them, took a mic and recorded that and brought that back into the song, cut out the low end from that so it's not interfering with anything else. So it's just the high kind of rattle. Yeah. But it's resonant frequency resonating from the original sub. Yeah. And then the sub sound maybe will cut out a little of the highs and layer layer them. So it'll be like that's organic sounding. Yes, that that's the other quality of this stuff is like suddenly you realize like or one of the things it's taught me this there's two qualities I want to bring up. One is that just the practice of making music on this has been transformative because it's taught me a lot of other philosophical things. You got into this. Like I've been listening to your podcast for a while and I was listening before you really got into Ableton and this stuff. The analog. I'm in love with it. Let's play a little music and record our conversation while he makes it. You could come over here and make stuff you want. I'll just get the mic up. We'll switch. Do you have do you have vocal sound? Do you have vocal effects set up or is that kind of something you'd have to vocal effects? Like I could easily set it up for us. I would have to. Yeah, it would take like 10 seconds and like basically what could happen is I could sit there because there's only room for one person in this thing. And then you could just fiddle around with it if you wanted to. I'll fiddle. I'll tell you what I'm telling you right now. You know more than I do about your system. Well, that's the best. But yeah, exactly. That's the best thing. Yeah, it's like not. I mean, in a weird way, the more I learned, the more I wish I didn't know because like there's something about the chaos factor that I really like. My producer buddy was just talking about how he especially, we can't really like enjoy music. We can't really like sit and listen to music like a lot of people would. We're like just like kind of jaded and tainted by the industry but in terms of like trying to analyze every single thing we hear like, oh, how could I make that? Yeah, right. Yeah. Reverse engineering. Slightly starting to ruin being a fan. Yeah, you listen to the little pieces and you're like, oh, OK. I think I kind of understand what they're doing to make that sound. But for you, it must be more precise. You know what? Let's take a break. I'm going to like set this up so you can like get. I'll show you a little bit about how this system works. And then we'll just talk while you make. If you don't mind. No, that sounds really fun. Yeah, no, let's do it. This is the output. This is it. This is it. This is it. This is it. This is it. This is it. This is it. This is it. This is it. And we're going to start by giving you a break. Let me ask you. Woo! Woo! Woo! OK, I'm going to show you what this is. Yeah, I understand. Yes, so please rest. That's fine. OK. OK. OK. I'm going to describe this system just a little bit more accurately. Yeah, we're going to ask you to do a little closer look at this here. And then we're going to start to see this is our source here. Right? Yes, this is our source. Yeah. OK. So, you're going to do a little bit of this. That is basically this. Yeah?

It is I, Detrus, and you're listening to the Duncan Tressel Family Hour podcast, a radiant, obsidian pyramid rising above the sonic waters of the podcasting universe, blasting out great waves of telepathic metaphysical sonic astral energy into the deepest part of your third eye, causing your brain to explode with love jizz all over the chest, face, feet, knees, and legs of the present moment. I welcome you into these great halls of glory and say hello to you. All right, here it goes, pals, the big announcement. I've been recording this intro since 9 a.m. It is now 9.21 p.m. This is it. I'm uploading this no matter what, but I've been trying to think of some perfect way to say it. I wish that I had the power to summon an angel to fly into my stomach and put its mouth through my throat and into my mouth so that I could talk about this in a perfect angelic, beautiful, poetic, sweet, glorious, life-affirming way. But I don't. There isn't an angel in my body. There's just a half a burrito and a kale salad in there. So I'm gonna just use that to talk about, I just went through a breakup. A four-year relationship just ended and relationships don't end all at once when a relationship ends, it's a form of death and it dies like most things die, kind of slowly in phases. But it ended recently, like officially it was over in New York as I'm packing up my stuff. We did the final matter exchange. If you've ever been in a long-term relationship or a short-term relationship, you probably know about the matter exchange. It is an unrecognized ritual in the end of a relationship where you give the final little bit of stuff that's congealed in your apartment to them and they give the final little stuff of yours that they have. And there's this weird exchange where you're like, okay, here's your boots and your camera. And they're like, all right, here's your sweatshirt and the shirt I got you. And then that's it, the door shuts and it's over. It's done. Now, at that point, you've got a really interesting situation on your hands because something you've gotten very used to for four years just ended, right? And so you're gonna go through some crazy feelings and you might send some weird texts and some weird texts might be sent to you and there might be some weird moments, but ultimately, if you really think about it, you're doing great. And I think this is what gets left out. And I think there's a cultural sort of, I don't know. There's like a cultural like gravity towards overdoing the grief when something ends. I'm not saying there shouldn't be grief. I'm not saying that on the way to the airport, I didn't spring a leak listening to Rocky Vodalotto's White Daisy Passing, which is one of the great breakup songs of all time. I'm not saying that there hasn't been like a soul and sadness, moments of anger, moments of regret, but ultimately, I feel pretty good. And it was the right thing. And I think it's the right thing for her and based on what I've heard from her, she's doing good. That's good, ultimately. And I think there's like a weird cultural gravity when shit ends to like overdo it to start listening to Elliot Smith to like get into like the hate side of things, get into the grief side, get way more into the grief side than you need to get. When a relationship ends, it's a death. And we, in this part of the planet, the way we deal with death is fucking weird. Like, we gotta put it in a, you gotta hide it away, sweep it under the rug. Don't talk about it, put it in the hospice. You gotta be careful if someone's dying, oh God, or someone around them is dying. Oh Jesus, you gotta treat them so carefully when it's the most natural thing. It's exactly how things should be. Things liquefy, things transform, things shift. It's meant to be that way. And in the past, oh my God, I've gotten so overwrought. You know, like getting into the idea maybe that getting into the fantasy that they're miserable without you, right? I mean, there's like Elliot Smith songs dedicated to that. Elliot Smith, you know, he's got like at least 70 breakup songs. All of them daggers slung at some poor, emaciated hipster girl who like just was like, look man, you're like, I can't, I just, I'm getting, I can't, I've been on the, I've been on the receiving end of your flaccid heroin cock for too long, I gotta go. And he like writes these like just beautiful songs of anger. Like here's a good one, somebody that I used to know. I had tender feelings that you made hard, but it's your heart, not mine that's scarred. So when I go home, I'll be happy to go. You're just somebody that I used to know. You don't need my help anymore. It's all now to you, there ain't no before. Now that you're big enough to run your own show, you're just somebody that I used to know. I watched you deal in a dying day and throw a living past away so you can be sure that you're in control. You're just somebody that I used to know. I know you don't think you did me wrong and I can't stay this mad for long, keeping a hold of what you just let go. You're just somebody that I used to know. Like I've listened to that song, chewing Vicodin like ice cubes, fantasizing that whoever just broke up with me, whoever I broke up with is miserable somewhere. When the truth is, they're having the greatest week that they've had in years. They don't have to deal with your soul in Edgar Allen Poe, quote, the Raven nevermore, ass, they're free. They're hanging out with some cool guy who they have no history with, getting to know them, realizing like, oh my God, I could have a whole other life other than the one I was just in. Meanwhile, you're like some dark warlock clutching a skull in the bottom of a tower, casting curses. And I think that's not the way to do it. I'm not saying don't experience your grief, don't experience your sadness, but just make sure you're actually sad. Make sure you're actually experiencing grief because it may be that you're secretly happy and you think that you shouldn't be. That can happen. You might be reacting to the way people around you are acting because when you go through a breakup, you might actually be getting off on people being like, oh my God, are you okay? Or you might be sort of being reactive to the way people around you are acting because a few people have like said in different ways to me like, man, I hope you're doing all right. I really do. And they look at me like I just fell on a mortar. They look at me like I'm laying in some muddy World War II swamp with my guts in my hands, drinking whiskey out of a flask while I'm just shitting blood out of my half decapitated ass. And it's just not, that's not what's happening. It's really made me realize we've gotta be like, the next time I get around somebody who's going through some kind of loss, I am not gonna wince. Because you just don't know what's happening with somebody. You just don't know. It could be that things are great. This is what I think. I think we should spend double on the divorce party that we spend on the marriage. When people get married, whatever you spend on the marriage, when you get divorced, there should be a huge party that you spend double what you spend on the marriage. There should be fireworks. There should be ships launching butterflies into the sky. There should be sprays of rare perfume. Everyone should be dancing. Because this is a new life that's opening up for you. You did it. You went through the dance with someone. You spent some time good and bad with someone. It didn't work out necessarily. But God damn it, it doesn't mean that you have to spend the next year in recovery. It doesn't mean that you have to spend like month after month, morning and sad and wearing fucking black. I just, I think that's sick. I think that's a lack of understanding in the way the universe actually works was let's face it, sweet friends, we're being liquefied by time. The house that you're in, the apartment that you're in, the clothes that you're wearing, the car that you're driving, and they're gonna be around lots longer than your meaty little sweet smell and little body's gonna be. Your clothes are gonna end up in a thrift store or the dump. Your house is gonna be inhabited by many other families. You're essentially a sentient vapor floating through time. Everything else around you is gonna last, but you know, you're drifting into the infinity. You're just spreading out. You're vaporizing. And that's beautiful. And so when like things really shift in a person's life or in your life, I think it's cause for celebration. So the next time you find yourself at the end of a relationship, let yourself grieve, I'm not saying to block out the feelings of sadness, go through the sadness, go through the melodrama, do the weird texts, have the moments of anger, have the moments of like confrontation, have the moments of what say whatever you need to say, but make sure you don't stretch that out longer than it needs to be stretched out to satisfy the expectation of people around you. Like a child who's fallen and like, notices an adult looking at them in horror and starts screaming, cause that can happen too. We need to do butterfly releases when people end a relationship. There needs to be tap dancing and champagne and back rubs, static orgies, MDMA injections, big blasts of ketamine and float tank sessions, not Elliot Smith and Vicodin, because sometimes, all the time, things end. It's beautiful. That being said, I gotta find a fucking place in Los Angeles, so if anybody knows of a place in LA, I'm looking for a place in the Atwater Village Silver Lake area at around 3K, 4K, max. For that amount, I expect to get some kind of mansion with at least six acres, some kind of subterranean limestone cave with ancient casks of fine wine. I'm looking for a place with an indoor pool and a solarium. Also, and this isn't a deal breaker, but I would prefer for the place to have some kind of family graveyard from the previous family that I can take future lovers on walks through on moonlit nights. Some kind of like secret doorway in the house that leads to a section of the limestone cave that leads to a labyrinth with a codex and a golden box that contains within it my future life that I have to get decoded by some kind of archeologist that slowly drives me mad, but I recover from it. And from the recovery, I have more wisdom and joy than I've ever had before. Okay, babies, we're gonna jump right into this episode with Luis Gomez, Luis J. Gomez, premier comedian, premiere prime New York comedian, a true sweetie, a really funny dude, but first, some quick bees naths.

My loves, thank you so much for listening to this long opening intro. I love you guys. I wanted to share this crazy news that just happened to me. Sorry if I'm rambling or weird, I guess nothing has changed because this is what I'm always like. Today's guest is a really funny comedian that I became friends with in New York. He is a member of the notorious and esteemed Legion of Skanks. He also has his own podcast called The Real Ass Podcast, and he's somebody that I had a lot of great times with during my brief stint in the Big Apple. So everybody, please open your hearts, expand your mind, envelop this glorious being, this comedic entity, this thunderbolt of truth so that he can feel the tendrils of your astral body wrapping around him. Everyone, please welcome to the DTFH, Louis J. Gomez. Yes. Welcome, welcome on you, that you are with us. Shake hands, know we do you do. Welcome to you. It's the Duncan Trussell family. It's the Duncan Trussell family. It's the Duncan Trussell family. Louis, man. Welcome to the DTFH. Thank you so much for being here, man. Thanks for having me, buddy. Dude, how was LA? You were just out there, right? Yeah, it was great. I loved it. I love LA. I don't know why people hate LA. Do you go out there a lot? Yeah, I go out probably now, like four or five times a year. I was going out like two or three times a year. My buddy, Nate Borgazzi, who is my son's godfather, really funny comic, he told me a few years ago. He was like, dude, no matter what, even if you don't have things going on, just go out to LA, plan a trip. You'll have meetings that are set up around it. You want to be seen in both worlds. You just want to be a guy that's working in both places. So yeah, I just kind of made an excuse to go out a few times a year. You are a driven comedian. It is so cool, man. You're super funny. You've got this amazing work ethic. You're part of this. What would you call the skanks? Is it a collective? Yeah, I mean, Legion of Skanks, the podcast itself, it kind of has like, it's gone into almost, I would say similar to what the Death Squad thing is on the West Coast, kind of like a group of comedians that are sort of loosely associated with that as well and that brand, and we've turned it into the Comedy Festival Skankfest, which you did. It's huge. That thing, it was insane, man. Like, so many people. I've never seen a comedy festival where people are giving out tattoos. Yeah. Well, I'll tell you, and you know this is your podcast, I think when you do this and people that connect with this type of content, I think they fucking love it. They love it a lot more than they just love Stand Up or they love it a lot more than they love their favorite TV show. They're fucking living it with you. People were getting Legion of Skanks logo tattooed on their bodies, and they weren't thinking about it. They were just doing it. Yeah, it's also a cool logo. If we had a shitty logo, I think it would be a lot harder to sell. But when the podcast comes and goes and it will one day, you have that little symbol. It's like, what was that? That was a period in your life where you listen to this thing every single week. Podcasts, they get people through some pretty fucked up times, I think. This is what I hear the most, that we get letters from people that are like, dude, you know what? I was going through some shit. My wife left me, my fucking kid was taken away, whatever it is. You guys kept me laughing week in, week out. For me, I think whether you, you know, the podcast itself, who gives a shit, but if it's a cool little symbol that can kind of, you look down and it reminds you of that, you know, I don't think there's any regret there. I think when it's a fucking, I don't know man, I guess maybe people feel the same way about like a Yankees logo or something like that. I always felt that way when I saw somebody with like tattooing a sports team on their arm. I'm like, dude, grow up. I don't know dude, you're like, you're living like your, but maybe they have that story too. Maybe it's, it reminds me of them of their dad fucking bringing them to, you know, the baseball game on Sundays. And that's a big thing for them. So it's not as, you know, it's not as simple as like, I'll look at that douchebag. He loves the Yankees that much. He's got to have a fucking symbol on his arm. But you guys, you guys like have like a hardcore community around you. I mean, the death squad has that too. But I think that, I don't know, it's such a specific cult that you've built up. It's like, you have this, and I use cult as a positive. Yeah. It's a beautiful thing. I take it as a positive. Yeah, but how did, I want to talk about how this started. I want to talk about the beginning of the skanks and like how it kind of grew to suddenly being this thriving group of people who have no problem tattooing your logo into their flesh. Is that weird you out, man? That people are like, your logo is going to be moldering in some coffin and- No. Yeah, yeah. Does it weird you out that there's probably people that are dead on their floor, they're apart with heroin needles sticking out of their arms with your tattoo on them? No, you know, it doesn't weird me out. I don't know, man. I think when I got into comedy, I got into it, or when I got into entertainment, I was in a band when I was a teenager. I've kind of, even before it was, I think a part of our generation, I think the generation below us, like everyone wants to be a rock star, everybody wants to be a professional athlete or a musician or whatever, every kid now, you know? And I still kind of wanted that. And I grew up really poor and I grew up, you know, I think- Where'd you grow up, New York? I grew up like an hour outside of the city. So I kind of always, I always kind of wanted to be an entertainer. I liked entertaining people. I got up on stage pretty young. I was a teenager when I started playing drums in a band. So now when I have people tattooing that my fucking logo on their arm, and I see that, dude, I think it's the coolest thing in the world. I think, maybe not every comic feels this way. When people come up to me in public and tell me they appreciate what I do, I mean, it's the greatest feeling in the world. If you ever see me and you know who I am and you don't fucking say, oh, hey, Louis J. Gomez, I'm a fan of your work, go fuck yourself. You are not doing, we are comics and we are narcissists and we do it for, we do it because we wanna feel great. We wanna feel great in that moment, but we also wanna feel great offstage, afterwards. You're talking about like a high. On stage in that moment, that 15 minutes is that fucking high, right? You're like, whoa, I'm through the roof, right? But you still wanna be a little high at all times. So you check Facebook or Twitter or you still wanna get that high. So look, bitch, if I'm at the airport and you can fucking come up to me and be like, dude, I think you were so funny on that thing you did, I'm fucking back right there on stage in that moment again. That's right. You know what I'm saying? That's like a fucking, that's incredible. And most comics that I know, even if they won't admit it, I feel like they feel that way. Of course. And talk, what do you think about those assholes who when it happens, when someone comes up to them and it's like, hey, what's up? And they reject the person. That's one of the most demented forms of behavior on planet Earth, which is to act as though you sort of accidentally got famous. And now you're having to deal with this like, atrocious problem of people coming to you and telling you they love you. Yeah, that's like the biggest problem in your life. Oh, those are the fires of hell for you, I guess. And that thing, the whole tortured, famous person is to me, one of the most disgusting forms of narcissism out there. Narcissism, whatever, you end up being a narcissist and you're a narcissist and accepting love is giving love. But when you're rejecting love and you've simultaneously put yourself in a position where people are gonna come up and love you. And you're reaping the benefits of all that love. So you have a house and a car and all these amazing things because these people love you and are willing to spend money on you. Maybe not even in a direct way, but you know, people, the love you're talking about is why the network is willing to give you millions of dollars Okay, America is gonna sit around their TV sets and they're gonna fucking have their eyes on you and they're gonna fucking want you to win. And we're gonna pay you for that. That's what they're paying you for is those people wanting you to fucking win. That's why they're tuning in, they're rooting for you. You're Superman, right? So for you to reject that, I disagree with it, but it's also your right. You were human beings, I always loved that Charles Barkley quote, I don't know the exact quote, so I don't wanna misquote him, he just says how I'm not, I never chose to be a role model. People, athletes are kind of thrust, I think especially brown athletes and women, especially Ronda Rousey, I saw it happen with, female mixed martial artists. They're almost like, they end up having to be symbols of their skin color or their sex, if they're gay, it's like they have to be a leader for that community. It's like, well, Ronda Rousey, I think that was part of the pressure with her where it's like, not only does she just have to win, she's an Olympic athlete, she knows pressure, but now she is, she has little girls around the world going like, I'm looking up to you, and every move you make, I'm looking, that type of scrutiny and everybody, anytime you have an opinion about anything, about social issues or politics, they fucking come at you, no matter what, you're not gonna piss off 50% of the people in the world. That type of thing I think ends up crushing a lot of people, and I think that's what happened with her in particular. Yeah, I know people who get pretty ripped up by getting to a certain level of fame, like you do get to some level of fame where it becomes like you're in a dream, you can't wake up from, like some weird dream where you've attracted all these mirrors of yourself, like suddenly you're everywhere you look, there's all these reflections of you in front of you, and that could be odd if you're not prepared for it, but. You also watch people not really treat you, there's not a real thing. I've noticed it on a much, I'm not famous at all, at all, but I've booked comedy shows, right? I started out booking comedy shows, and I watch people because you have something that they want, they treat you differently, and you kind of get this sense. I remember, I did comedy for a couple of years, my first couple of years I did stand up, I was terrible, and I was booking shows, so nobody was really telling me I was terrible, they were trying to get on my shows. I had no real friends, I had no real friends. Oh, I hear what you're saying. Everyone was trying to, you know. This is what, okay, right, so what you're talking about, which is that you're not having any authentic contact with people, there's no one there to tell you, hey man, you're being a dick right now. You're just surrounded by this, the worst kind of funhouse mirror is instead of showing you in absurd ways, which is what good friends will do, they'll reflect you and make fun of you, and through that you might see something there seeing that you might need to work on, or something like that, but if you start getting around funhouse mirrors that are reflecting you more beautiful than you actually are, not that you need to accept the beauty you're at, not like imagine you're more beautiful than you are, or like shining to you some version of yourself that isn't real, but it's in the positive, and you're gonna start. Or if you're the person that's kind of making, creating those reflections, that's okay. I think if you're the person that's saying, you know what, I'm looking at myself, and I am, you know, I'm looking at myself as being in a better place than I was. Stay to mind, I think that's great, but if you're just going based off of the perception of other people around you, you have to understand, everyone has their own ulterior motives, everyone's got something else going on, so if you're letting other people kind of, we watch it happen all the time in comedy, everyone's like, oh, what's that guy getting, what's that guy getting, what's that guy getting? Dude, let me tell you something, that guy that's getting everything, he's not, he's depressed, he's pissed, it's just what you're seeing on social media, he's showing you the better version of himself, so what happens is you kind of, you're, I'm going like, I'm holding myself up to that example, which isn't even real. Yeah. That guy's fucking. It's fucking evil. That guy's broke too, that guy is, you know, worried about his next TV appearance as well. This is what I want to talk to you about, man. So this is what I think is really cool about the skanks, because one of the things you were talking about is like, yeah, you get on TV, and then suddenly you like people, you're out in the world and people see you, and they are seeing an absurd version of you. Most people on TV, Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel, even as intimate as Kimmel wants to get. Yeah. The reality is the way we understand any of these people that we see all the time is in a suit, generally keeping to this very repetitive persona, a very specific rhythm in the way they talk, you know this sort of inflatable thing that comes out in front of the cameras and can't really talk about how they actually feel. Of course. But, and so that kind of, that's an old thing, but you guys are the new thing that's happening, which is here are three people who, more than likely, if we fly you back in time to the 80s, and people are trying to pick hosts for their show, they're not gonna be like, oh yeah, let's take these foul-mouthed, hilarious, raw humans and put them in front of the camera, because they're gonna think there's no way I could sell fucking diapers with these guys as hosts. But now that we're in this beautiful new era, suddenly, what's happening is people like you are getting, I don't know, fuck fame, it's a stupid word anyway, but getting the success that used to be reserved for people who went through the network system, which was a filtration system that you had to get through. And even if you were like, even if you somehow fit the symmetrical characteristics, if you were aggressive, yet adjustable, you know what I mean? If you were like something that could be reined in by the corporatocracy, then there would be 19 others just like you. And so it's still a one in 19 role of the dice, maybe. So I love the way that groups like you are coming to prominence, because it's a way that is probably unlikely just 15 years ago. Yeah, I think it's also sort of cyclical. I think that we're at the beginning of the internet-like content industry. It's like the Wild West right now. You see it with podcasts and advertising. I mean, the way it all works, people don't even know like, it's a fucking mess behind the scenes. There's no real, like we can't technically use a licensed song, but they don't have any system to kind of go after people for really doing it yet. It's coming. I'd say, yeah, you heard me. We said get it the exact same second, because it's coming. And it will, and it's coming. And we were just talking before the show happened about certain things behind the scenes where it's like they're figuring out, no, okay, this is an industry. This is not the fucking Wild West and that there's gonna be restrictions put on the way. Yeah, so I think right now it's kind of like, it's very punk rock and it's very cool. And we were also coming out of a time where, TV has been king forever and everyone's been trying to get TV and comedians in particular have been kind of whittled down to 10% of what is funny about them. And it's just like, okay, well, we have to have this very specific opinion. We don't wanna piss anybody off. We have to appeal to the left. And I think that it's become, at this point, comedy a couple of years ago was almost like people were rolling their eyes. Even on Comedy Central, it was the same way that people were going, oh, there's no music on MTV like 10 years ago. But what does MTV stand for? There's no music. Comedy Central stopped being stand up altogether. Like there was no stand up for a little while. They tried to do it and it's like, nobody's watching it. Like it's very, very strange. It kind of still is like that. But I do think there's this like new punk rock thing that's happening. And Owen Benjamin, you know, he said this on Legion of Skanks last week, like there's this new alternative to comedy today, which is people are just saying what they want and who are going like, well, no, no, no, I'm gonna explore funny in a way that I wanna find funny. And the funniest people we all knew, everyone listening right now, remember, think back to the funniest kid in middle school, elementary school. He wasn't a kid who was sitting there with a notepad going, let me construct what's funny about this. This, let me think, let me really overthink what's hilarious. It was the fucking kid who was from the gut funny. Every kid who would stand up on the lunchroom table, he was- Was that you? That was me, yeah. You were that kid? I was the funniest motherfucker. I was funnier than I've ever been in my entire life when I was a kid. And then it became a business and you become like, you know, whatever we could be talking, right? And let's say I'm having a conversation with you and podcasting changed it a little bit because now we have microphones in front of us, right? But if I'm talking to you at a bar or a diner, right? And then one of us say something really funny, and then I'm like, oh, shit, dude, I can use that on stage. I will stop our conversation. I will stop this amazing, incredible, beautiful moment where we are enjoying each other's fucking time. I'm looking at you in your eyes and we are fucking connecting. I made you laugh, which is a fucking incredible thing that only certain people in the world have that ability to make their friends and family laugh. This is incredible. And I'll say, stop, hold the presses, fuck life. I have to go write this down now in a notebook. I believe that takes a, and you're stopping exercising that funny muscle in life. That's how you get really, really funny is you're making your friends laugh in life. You fucking make a girl laugh on a date, whatever it is. And I think that we stop it. And I do think podcasting is kind of helping it again though because now we're talking so much and trying to be funny so often for so many hours a week that I think once again, it's just exercising the muscle. So you started off living outside of New York, poor family. Oh yeah, like what do you mean by oh yeah, poor? I don't think you realize how poor you are until you grow up a little bit and you look back and you're like, whoa, I was really poor. Like my mom was on welfare, food stamps, section eight. Mom was a former drug addict who was in recovery throughout my childhood. Didn't even know really that my mom was a drug addict. And just apartments never owned anything, never had a new car. Like it was always some old beat up fucking car from the 80s. Your parents got divorced? My dad was murdered when it was four. He was stabbed to death. So and yeah, he was in Paterson, New Jersey, which is like- Sorry man. No, it's okay dude. It's literally 30 years ago, 35 years, 31 years ago. So yeah, I mean, my mom's 20 when she has me, 18 when she has my sister. Her husband or boyfriend is murdered. Now she's left without these kids. She already had a drug problem. Did they ever catch the murderer? Yeah, he went to jail. I tried to get him on my podcast. What? I was gonna try to get him on my podcast. He went to jail for like 20 years. You tried to get your dad's killer on your podcast. I did a whole thing. I talked to a private investigator. They were sending me specific things about the case because not everything's out there. So I went out and I did the research and found out a lot of information about the guy and he died. He died a few years ago. I was gonna try to get him on just, and I wasn't kind of like, ambush him and be like, you fucking murdered my dad. He was a kid. My dad beat him up. He was like 16 and my dad beat him up probably in front of his girlfriend or some shit, right? And he came back and he fucking, you know, he came back with a kitchen knife and there's no justification, but you, when you grow up in Patterson, New Jersey, you know, that's fucking, dude, you look on the lists of the most dangerous places, dude, Patterson's been up there with like fucking Syria. It's like crazy, dude. It's not good, right? It's bad. And these little pockets of like Jersey or like there's really bad neighborhoods in New Jersey and like outside of Philly. And yeah, my dad was also not a good dude, I don't think. I think he was kind of a bad, you know, drug dealery type, but also young, you know, but he was like 25 or 26 and this guy, you know, they got into a fist fight outside of a strip club and my dad got the better of him and the guy came back later on that night and fucking stabbed him. Holy shit. And that was that. So it was like, hey, like literally came back with his friend, you know, his friend, you know, I guess they were with a girl, the girl threw the knife underneath the car. It was like, all the details are fucking, they sent me like every like police report. I went on Google Earth and I like looked at the corner. That's eerie. That's, that was the eerieest thing of all. Looking at the corner that he was stabbed on. I can't imagine. Yeah. I can't imagine. Yeah. Wow. So my mom, you know. So you're poor mom, you're, she's 24 now. She was, yeah, 24. Yeah, she's 24. You're four. You said you had a sister? Yeah, she's, she's at six at the time. So she has a four and a six year old and your dad just got murdered. Yep. And she's recovering from drugs. Or is she using at the time? She's recovering, but then she started using again. What was she taking? Harrowing. Oh man. Yeah. Wow. And your dad was probably selling heroin. Yeah. And your dad was probably shooting heroin. Yeah. Wow. And I didn't know any of this until I was like, a fucking 12 or 13. And it was because my mom used to take methadone, which is a drug they get for people in recovery. And he used to come in a little orange bottle. Sure. And I didn't know it. And my mom told me it was her back medication. And I was just watching the news with her one night and on a conveyor belt, like the little bottles for my kitchen, just fucking new miracle drug to help heroin addicts. That's gonna take the place of methadone. And it's like these little bottles. I remember it was like, you know, one of those big factories where it's like all of the bottles like came spinning down. Like they were all spinning on a track. And it was like, I mean, that, it's a very morbid like memory. Those bottles spinning on that thing. And me like looking over at my mom and like having the realization like, holy fuck. And it hurt. Was she aware, did she know you'd figured her out at that point? Yeah. I got mad. I don't remember really, to be honest, I don't really remember what her reaction was. Maybe she denied it. Maybe then she told me afterwards. Yeah, I don't really remember. You're 13. Maybe anywhere between, I was probably between 11 and 13, sometime around that time. Right. And so now it's dawning on you that your mom is struggling with this demon. Yeah. And it's continuing to struggle. Or was it that time when she clean? At that time she was clean. She got, when, after my dad died, she started using again. And then me and my sister moved in with my aunt and my grandma. And then she started using, you know, she was using. And then she got clean after like a year. She came and like lived with us. And then we moved back in with her. How long were you apart from, do you remember that period of living with your grandmother? I do. I don't remember. It didn't seem like, you know, look dude, it's so hard to kind of like, that time in your life is so weird, right? Cause I have a four year old now. It's such a fucked up time of life. That time of life is like, you know, it's your first memories. It's the first shit you fucking remember. And I remember when I, when I had my kid, I was like dude, when my kid's four, I gotta be making money. I gotta be on TV. I gotta be successful. He's not gonna have a memory of his dad being a loser. Right. So. And your, and his dad isn't. You're a hard working human, man. You really have your shit together. It's amazing. Like watching you, it seems like you're kind of like, I mean, I don't want to insult anybody else in the skanks, but it seems like you're kind of like, the brains behind a lot of it. You seem really like, you're so good at planning shit and coming up with like, every time we're around, like I'll say something just offhandedly that I would like, never in a million years think of doing. And suddenly you're like coming up with business plans for. Yeah. Yeah, I think that just came from, when you do, when you grow up with that poor, I mean, like I said, dude, like, I remember watching my mom at like seven and being like, I don't know, we shouldn't be on welfare. You shouldn't be taking food stamps. I just remember having this thought, like being like, what are you doing? Like what, like that's not right. Like what, like what do we, now look, now you go like, fuck him, do the amount of taxes they take. Mother fuck, give my money back, dude. Right. Do whatever you can do. Go take advantage, mother fuckers. But the reality is, you know, I think that that, you know, it was the opposite thing. My mom was very verbally and physically abusive. My mom was very like, you know, to be honest, very lazy for whatever reason, whether it was justified or not, you know, she didn't have that same type of drive or a thing. And I just didn't want to be like my mom. You know, I really didn't want to be like that. I worked, I've worked every day since I was 11 years old. I've always had a job. I was buying my own school clothes when I was 11 or 12 years old. I just, I've had this industrious thing in me and I was very embarrassed about being poor as well. So I think that kind of just, it was just this thing that was always built into me. How's your relationship with your mom now? She died. She died when I was like 22. Wow. So you've had like- You don't want to know how. Yeah, I do. Hair went over this. She ended up using again after all, all said and done. So it's weird hearing you talk about this because most comedians have had really great childhoods and a great life. You know, it's funny though, it's like, you know, it's hack to say, but we're some of our fucking past and, you know, it is what it is. You know, I mean, you, I dude, I have literally the greatest kid in the world. I wouldn't change anything, dude. Would you bring your mom back? Fuck her. I don't, like, not even in a negative way, dude. Not even, not, not, not one. I wouldn't change a second before my son was born. Nothing, dude. Cause anything I could, the fucking wind blows another way another day. I turn left when I should have turned right. Who knows where the fuck I could have been. Right. Even all that, dude, all these stupid things. You know, I love the idea of like cast theory and the butterfly effect and all that shit. I get so like, I'm a stupid salesman, dude. I, you know, I, I, I saw gym memberships and I've always, I was break down to like the core level of like all that shit. Like that was the thing that always got me into like sales. Was that like mentality behind it? Right. And I, dude, I've just always like felt that way, dude. Like any little stupid thing that any fist fight you got into when you were in the fourth grade, you know, I remember I got to in the sixth year to fight with Brian Schultz, right? Yeah. You know, I got suspended from school. What was the fight about? This black chick was trying to like fight me. It was a chick, this fucking ghetto ass chick. And I'm like, I'm not going to fight you. You're a chick. And then he pushed me into her. So then I turned around and I just fucking decked him because I had all this pent up like fucking anger. Sure. And when a chick hits you, it's like, all you can do is cry. It really brings back to when you're a kid, like your mom hit, you can't hit your mom. Yeah, right. You know what I'm saying? So when a chick hit you, you can't do anything. You, you have this. So he just had to touch me at that moment. That was a bad idea. Yes. So I punched him in the face. What a fucking asshole to do that, man. Yeah, dick move. What an asshole. Cool guy though. He ended up being a cool guy later. Okay. This is sixth grade. We're kids. Yeah. So I hit him and got suspended for a couple of days, right? Yeah. That might have even been the fight that I got into because I got into like three or four fights in Farley Middle School that got me sent to Havershaw Middle School. It's a completely different school. Any one of those fights, if they didn't happen, I might not get, I've gotten sent to Havershaw Middle School. If I didn't go to Havershaw Middle School, I wouldn't have met John Hickey, who became my best friend, who I ended up playing in a band with. That defined who I was from eighth grade till fucking my first year of college. I was a musician. I was in a band producing shows, putting on huge metal shows with Sworn Enemy and Coed and Cambry. And it's like, dude, all of that. Think about that, dude. That fight with Paul Timanti. If that didn't happen, I don't know if any of that would have happened. I wouldn't be sitting here right now. I truly believe that. If Paul Timanti didn't push me into that girl, I wouldn't be sitting here right now, dude. I fucking wholeheartedly within my soul. Wow. Okay, so thank you, Paul Timanti. I wouldn't have my kid. Isn't that amazing? You go that fucking asshole, but I go, no, dude, fucking A, dude. That's the way it was supposed to happen. That was God. That was God in disguise. That was God wearing the face of your friend. You know, one of the things that I've been taught is one way to look at things. Not that this is true or not true. Maintain agnosticism. But one way to look at everything, everything is just God wearing different masks, like teaching you. And so your outlook is so beautiful because it's the opposite of victim mentality. A victim, something like that happens to them. And they think the exact same thing in reverse, which is if he hadn't pushed me, then I wouldn't have gone to this fucked up school. You know, and then my life wouldn't have gone downhill. But with someone like you, somehow, and I wanna figure out how, you've transformed a childhood that a lot of people would use as an excuse to be a complete motherfucker for their entire lives into some kind of beautiful trampoline that launched you into fatherhood and also into like having a really great comedy career and podcasting career. That's really beautiful. But when did it start? Were you, was this just like some genetic thing inside you? When do you remember in your childhood, the moment you were like, I'm not gonna let this destroy me? I don't know if it was ever as clear as that, right? It was like, I was very independent from a very young age, I remember. And I remember... You had to be, you had to be independent, didn't you? Yeah, I mean, yeah, I just, I don't know that there was like a specific moment that kind of, that I can kind of like nail down that made me go like, oh, well, I'm not gonna let this fucking, there's moments like, I remember, I remember like, I talked about this on other shows, so I do apologize if, you know, my fans are hearing me getting repetitive about any of this stuff. But, you know, I remember there was a moment that I could pinpoint the moment where I like became like industrious. And I was like, oh, I like running my own thing. Because I was always the kid to have my own like, iced tea stand. Dude, summer would hit, iced tea lemonade stand, I'd offer both options, three sizes. I mean, dude, I was that kid, dude. How old were you? You know, as young as six, I don't know, like five. I don't remember ever a time not making, going out and trying to make money. Did your mom teach you this? Where did it come from? No, no, my mom wasn't industrious at all. My mom was smoking cigarettes, falling asleep on a methadone in her bed. You know what I'm saying? Like, I didn't want to be that. It was a weird thing. It's just hard for me to imagine a six-year-old. Usually it's like you pick it up from somewhere, right? Would you see it on TV or something? Like, where did it occur to you? I've got to figure out a way to start taking care of myself because I don't have a mom and I don't have a dad. And I got to figure this shit out. My mom- I just didn't have things. And I envied the kids in my neighborhood who had things. And I grew up in a very white trash type neighborhood that was like lower middle class to really poor. Like block to block. It was like, it could be like fucking welfare to like the best case scenario, like lower middle class, where they'd own like a split level house, right? And, but you know, even those people were a little bit trashy. Like the people that owned the house, they weren't like, you know, but in my mind, anybody who owned a house was like fucking rich. When I, at that age, at six or seven, if you owned a home, you were like, holy fuck, like, wow, do you own a home? I would, I could never imagine- I'm still like that. Yeah. How somebody could get enough money and get all their shit together to like a half a million dollars. Are you crazy? It's astounding. That's crazy. That was always very like crazy to me. So I think that I, I don't know, man, I just, I remember the, really it was, it was those moments, it was really early moments where I'm watching my mom just kind of be a loser and just kind of going like, I don't want to fucking be that. I don't want to, I don't want to like, just the embarrassment of walking with you. I don't know if you were poor, but your mom pulls out food stamps and you literally leave while she's paying because you don't want your friends from middle school or elementary school to see your mom paying with food stamps. You know, that's, that was kind of a motivating factor for me. Yeah, I wasn't that poor. I, we definitely, our, our family was like, for the first few years, we certainly weren't doing, I mean, like, you know, you're, I wasn't food stamps poor. I think we were probably lower class for the first, 10 years of my life or something, probably, but I can remember saying to my mom, and this is when I knew we were poor. I said, mom, are we rich? And she looks at me and she goes, well, we're rich in spirit, donkey. I'm like, we're fucking broke. What does that mean? It means you're broke. It means you're fucking broke. She says she's rich in spirits. She was drunk, okay. She was hammered. She said, get out of my room, baby. Mom, you're getting happy. Yeah, man. But, but, but the kind of poor you're talking about. Yeah. That's like the real deal. That's the real deal, man. And that's what I, I would certainly get. It was like iced tea lemonade stand. It was like, you know, winter would roll around. I was shoveling people's driveways. I would rake up leaves. I would, I would do whatever it was. Cause I didn't have like, you know, I didn't have somebody to like buy me things. Like now that I look at my kid, he's got so many fucking toys. I mean, I remember just having a few, like kind of like tattered toys. My transformers that I had, you know, that, that one double headed gray transformer where the legs were the double, it turned into a draught, double headed dragon. Right. And it was the dude, the, the, the, the face of the dragons flipped up and those were his legs. Yeah. So I remember this dragon so fucking well. Wait, you mean Volt? That's not Voltron. It was transformer. Okay. Definitely a transformer. It was a dragon transformer. They had to spin off fucking whatever. It's right. And I used to make that guy, fuck my sister's Barbie all the time. Like, if you know the Barbie's legs don't split, so you have to do the, the double legs up, which is a good move now. Now that I'm an adult, like it didn't seem realistic. As a kid, I was like, who would fuck that the way. But you're like, that's a pretty decent move. Like knees together, legs up on one shoulder. So, but I remember, dude, I had that fucking transformer for like three years. That was my main toy. Dude, I had like four or five of those big rubber, you know, WWF, you know, wrestlers. Sure. And those, I, dude, those were my fucking toys for years. And that didn't seem like crazy. I love those toys, you know? But now that I look back, I was like, no, my kid gets new toys all the time. He gets new books all the time, new clothes. My mom didn't read to me. I don't ever remember ever being read to once in my entire fucking life. Not a single time do I remember a person sitting me down, putting me to bed and reading me a story. My kid, I mean, my kid, every night, my kid could fucking, my kid, you should hear me. I have the worst voice. I sing my kid to bed every single night. I put him to bed every single night. What do you sing to him? I sing him unanswered prayers by Garth Brooks. How does that go? Oh boy. Let's just hear it. Just the other night at my hometown football game, my wife and I ran into my old high school flame. And as I introduced them, the past came back to me and I couldn't help but think of the way things used to be. Oh, does he sing it with you? Yeah. Oh, that's the sweetest thing I've ever heard. I bought him green eggs and ham yesterday. I came in the mail. I mean, the first time you read green eggs and ham, I mean, it's fucking, dude, this kid lost his shit. He's not a big, he's never really read Dr. Seuss. Oh shit. He's about to go into a whole other world. So he has no immune system for Dr. Seuss. Oh no, dude. And look, he already hates Jews. So we're halfway there. Dr. Seuss is an anti-Semite. I think he was, right? I think that was like part of the thing. We was at Walt Disney. I think they were all anti-Semites. All of our heroes, we're losing all our heroes. Dr. Seuss, Harvey Weinstein, we're losing all our heroes. Harvey Weinstein hates Jews. Is that what he did? I haven't been watching the news lately. No, you haven't been watching the thing with Harvey Weinstein. No, I have, I have, obviously. Man, this is, so you're industrious from a young age. Oh, but that's right. I was gonna make this point. I remember, it was like a moment, like my neighbor died. A guy that I, that lived in my neighborhood, died. And his family was moving all of the stuff out to like the curb to be picked up by like trash collection, right? And me and this other kid in the neighborhood just took everything, everything that was being collected and put it, and we just moved it over to my yard. I was seven. My mom was at work and we moved it over to my yard and we did a yard sale at my yard. And we made like a hundred bucks in a day. Wow. And when you're like seven or eight years old with a hundred bucks to it, I mean, I mean, it was literally just used by candy and shit. What was your mom saying about this? My mom was very impressed when she came home. You know, she was. My mom at that time was, she wasn't like a shitty mom. Like she tried, she literally tried. Like she was the leader of my Boy Scout troop. She like took me to like little league, you know, karate classes. Like my mom did all the suburban mom bullshit. You know, she's had fucking demons. They got the best of her. She was struggling with one of the most disastrous addictions that can happen to you. Fucking a Puerto Rican. They warned her. It was not going to end well. Did you, did you think you were going to be a comedian? No, no. I didn't even know like what comedy really was. You didn't, when you're, when you're, you know, a little kid, you don't, stand-up comedy is a very weird thing. Even step one, you know, what? Like what the fuck do I do? What do you do? You know, you know. You remember the first comedy you heard? I remember the first comedy I heard, but like how would I do that? What was it? Like when you're a kid, the earliest comedy I could remember like really enjoying and laughing at, you know, was Eddie Murphy Delirious. Right. That was like the first like comedy special. And there was no filter in my home in terms of like content. You know, I watched pretty fucked up movies, anything. I remember Clockwork Orange I watched when I was like six or seven. That rape scene, that gang rape scene, where like they're in front of the dude in a wheelchair, they're raping this old dude. So I mean, as a seven year old watching that with your mom going like, cool, I understand what gang rape in front of a man in front of a husband is now. What was your mom doing? Booting up probably. I don't know, Duncan. She wasn't paying attention. I know that much. Your mom's shooting heroin. No, she wasn't. Like I said, it wasn't that like, I didn't know. She wasn't doing drugs at that time. But she, she fucked up like, no, she shouldn't let me watch those types of movies. You know, watching the exorcist when I'm like five or six. My kid gets scared of fucking, you know, if the incredible Hulk smashes too hard in the Avengers, you know what I'm saying? Like. But do you think this is, I mean, when I, I don't know what I was watching when I was five or six, that is too young. Yeah. But I want, I always wonder about like the impact that that has on kids. And I wonder like, how, how bad, how disastrous is it really for a kid to see some of that shit? Cause it's like, if you introduce it to them in the right way, maybe, I don't know. I remember being terrified. Actually, now I think about it, I remember being that age and someone could just tell me a ghost story and I would go into like a fear paralysis. Yeah. Where I couldn't, where I was just frozen and in absolute terror. So yeah, I get it, man. I mean, this is the thing that I hear a bunch, which is people who have warped childhoods, non-standard, abusive, rough childhoods. It seems like they make really, they either make really great parents or they make the worst parents on earth. It's either, it either you run the opposite direction or you, you're a little bit better than your parents. And that's what my mom was. My mom was like, my mom would tell me stories as she was beating me up. This is how fucked up this is. And I'm very like, people hear me talk about this stuff and they're like, dude, are you like, but you know, it's, you know, she would tell you stories. Yeah, but you know, like we talk about this, how we do it. I mean, if I was sitting with a therapist, we, I would just be talking about this the same way. Trying to find funny in these stories, in my opinion, is even a much more therapeutic way to look at, you know, dark shit. You're trying to find the positive. You're trying to pull the positive out of these dark fucked up things. That is therapy fucking 10 point out. Absolutely. Fuck just talking about it and crying with a fucking napkin. No bitch. I'm now trying to literally create a piece of positive content out of my fucked up childhood or life. So, you know, I don't think people should feel bad when they hear these stories. You know, this is kind of how, you know, this is how I do it. I shouldn't say every comic, you know, it's, it's, you know, it is very therapeutic to kind of like talk about this shit. It's like growing flowers on a baby grave. Yeah, exactly. That's actually an interesting analogy. Yeah. So, yeah, go ahead. So your mom would beat you while she's- So, yeah, she would fucking like literally, she'd be like, well, you don't know how bad I'd have it, you know, and then she would tell me stories. I remember from as early as I can remember, my mom told me that her stepdad raped her with an ax to her back. And I'm like, I would never put that on my kid. My kid would never have to deal with the levity of that. In his childhood, he would, you know, as an adult, he might, I might share that story with him later on. Like as a fucking fully functional, not even an 18 year old adult, like a 25 year old, hey dude, I've graduated college. Let me sit down and tell you about the, let me tell you about the fucking, about the world and some shit that I, you know, maybe even, I don't even know. I don't think so. You wanna hear something crazy, man? Yeah. So, this is something I've been thinking about a lot. And some people are explaining this to me. So, the concept here is trauma, right? And what you're talking about is trauma. And trauma is this contagion that travels through time from parents to kids. So, and you hear about this, you know, people who have been molested sometimes will become molesters, right? It's a contagion. And the same with trauma. People who have been abused will become abusers or have a higher probability of becoming abusers. So, you can follow this echo of suffering probably thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of years back to somebody maybe just having a bad fucking day. Some guys having the best day. Stepping dinosaur shit. Stepping dinosaur shit. Fuck! Probably more like he saw like a bear carry his daughter off and Peter in front of him. And then he kind of went crazy and became an asshole. Now, this is where it gets really. By the way, for us, like today, by today's standards, like as it relates, that's like iTunes going down for a day. Oh yeah. It's like that. It sucks. You're having a bad fucking day. It's a bad morning. I saw my entire village was eaten by bears. But the, so what's interesting is this. There was an experiment that they did where they took mice and they exposed them to the smell of cherry blossoms while they were electrocuting them. And then the mice had little baby mice. And then they would. We just a little side note to ADD this up. We really just don't give a fuck about mice. Is there anybody advocating for what we do to lab rats and mice? Dude, there's an actual, you can look it up. There's this very sweet statue. I don't know where it is. And it's dedicated to all the lab rats who've died for us. Jesus. And it's really sweet because so many of them have died. But you know, like, we can do ADD, but this is actually, you ever read Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy? No, I didn't. So this, I've talked about this before because it's so fucking genius. But Douglas Adams said that mice were the end of the tentacles of interdimensional creatures who are sticking them into this dimension to study scientists, right? Whoa. That's funny. But anyway, so they exposed the baby mice to the smell of cherry blossoms and they had a stress reaction to the cherry. So this is called epigenetics. And this is the idea that trauma gets, it gets in some way or another encoded into our fucking DNA. And don't they say that like, I just watched that one documentary about like dogs. Isn't dogs that much more susceptible to that type of like genetic, like passing things on? I don't know. Probably. Cause they were, like dogs are like the most genetically malleable mammals. Like if you read a, you know, two short, short leg dogs, they're going to create a short leg puppy. That's just like they're, and this why like you get aggressive dogs that have aggressive genes. And it's like, and you, you know, so I like, you know, dude, I don't fucking trust big fucking scary pit bulls or German shepherds. Dude, who fucking knows? Dude, three generations ago, some asshole with a fucking black Yankees hat kicked this dog in the head and it just fucking tears my throat out. Yeah. Well, this is the thing, man. I mean, this is like, and I really love all of this stuff coming out right now. And I especially love it in the context of what you're talking about, which is that every single person has a chance to stop this avalanche of shit that's been pouring down from time into our current part of the time space continuum. Cause you look at a person and you're seeing the very tip of a river of genetics that stretches back to the time when we were proto hominids. And this river of fucking genetics has been corrupted by trauma, fucking World War II, the industrial revolution, the fucking- Limb Biscuit. I hear so much, Limb fucking Biscuit, dude, it's destroyed. Limb Biscuit is why we have Trump. It's all part of it, dude. It really is. It's a collection of all of the trauma throughout history. Limb Biscuit was one of the, you know they have like little fucking, just fucking things on the timeline. That's one of them. No, Limb Biscuit is like the ocean and all the trauma is rivers that just poured into this band forming a capsule of horror. But this is, so when somebody has this fucking thing, when somebody has the wherewithal or the good luck or the good sense or just a sheer existential fucking potency to be like, I'm not gonna fuck up my kid. And the way I'm not gonna put my kid through that, I'm not going to continue playing this game of hot potato with a piece of Satan shit, which is what's been going on for so long. Then it's, what you do for the world is so incredible because you're stopping like, you're stopping something that is the potential of destroying the planet. You have no idea how much you're speaking my language right now and I want to shine the light on myself. I preach about this all the time and I get very preachy about it. And I think if there's one thing you're gonna preach about, this is one of the things, dude. I don't hit my kid I never have, never even smacked him on the hand. I practice my own version of peaceful parenting, peaceful parenting by definition, they get a little fucking crazy, I think, some of them. But I don't hit, I don't speak to my son aggressively. He's never been yelled at by me. Like he's seen me get upset, he's seen me get angry at other things, but it's never been at him. We don't use intimidation, we use a threat. Even parents that don't hit or the ones they go, well, we spent once in a while, the looming threat is just always there, right? And I think that that is a very big part of what's wrong with people today and where a lot of the violence is coming from in society. I think people are, we're hitting babies. You're hitting little babies, dude. You're smacking little one year olds on the hand, you're using aggression, you're speaking to them aggressively and it programs them to interact with people that way. I watch my son, my son walks like me, he talks like me. Dude, he is mimicking every movement, everything around him and for people to deny that, striking a child for an act in the way that you want them to act, before they're old enough to compute what's right, wrong, whatever it is, that that doesn't program them a certain way. I think that they're ignoring a really big fact. And I think that, and it's a lot of people, I think it's something like 70% of people admit to spanking their kids, 75%, as young as one. Those are the people that are admitting it, I think the numbers are even more than that. I think it's a very, very small fraction to people that don't spank or don't believe in it. I get a lot of pushback online when I talk about it. I get people that, you know, I've never, the most controversial thing I say on the internet is don't hit your kids. I have people coming at me, like, dude, I say on podcasts, I say the N word and the F word and anywhere, we don't give a shit, dude. We try to push the envelope as far as possible. What's the N word? Nigger? What? Nigger? What? Say it, Duncan, you can say it. I'm not saying the N word. You wouldn't say it? No, fuck. Just hold on for the context of just, we're saying, say this, the word nigger is a word. I can't say it. Shut up, yes you can. No way. It is though. I'm not racist. You're not racist. You are though. No, I'm not. Listen to what you just said. The word nigger is a word. You're a fucking Nazi. Oh shit. You're a racist. That's the new N word. Nazi, you make me sick. How could you say such a fucking thing? No, you know what, man? Here's why I won't say it. Have you ever ridden a subway in New York? No, no, listen. Here's why I won't say it. Here's why I don't say it. I won't say it. Not that I give a fuck that anyone says it. And anybody who says it, from the most vile, festering racist, to the most fucking hilarious Puerto Rican, awesome human I know, like to me, it's a magical word. And I think that it fucking, okay, let me give you an example. I'll give you an example. I used to not think like this, man. I'll give you an example. So I, you know, I got my fucking ball chopped off. I got testicular cancer. And I'm fine now. My mom died of cancer. So when I see comedians doing jokes about fucking cancer or when I hear like real gross, flippant jokes about cancer, it triggers in me memories that are like uncomfortable, right? I don't like it to think about it too much. But that being said, I would never in a hundred trillion billion years be like, hey, man, you shouldn't talk about that for a stage, man. That's fucked up. But that being said, I recognize the specific like weird fucking tone hits with me. So I think similarly. Of course. The word nigger produces. I think it produced, what it does is it produces like a. A visceral reaction. Cause I, when I hear that word, it's way different than when a black person hears that word. Have you ever heard it? I mean, you have. I've heard it. I mean, I've had it thrown at me by family members, like Italian Irish family members that like, like my grandma said, I remember young memory. It's not his fault. He's a nigger. I remember it was crazy. Cause I would get picked on in the neighborhood by the white kids. They would throw rocks at me and call me a nigger. And I would come on crying and upset that, you know, these, these kids were being so mean to me. And it's Italian Irish household where they're like, yeah, you know, hey, they call you a nigger, but you don't act like a nigger then. Okay. Yeah. Well, yeah, it's different. Obviously. So it's like, have you ever hear it like, like in like a real, like racist context? Like, I grew up in the South. So you know, exactly. We do these jokes. People don't even get it. Like we're so just trying to be funny in everything we do. Even if it doesn't hit, I think sometimes when a racist quote unquote joke doesn't hit, there's this like almost same awkward tone of like, oh my God, that was racist. Like, no, it's just didn't, it was a misfire. When you hear a real racism, when you're at a bar and you hear some other guy goes, like, I check out the fucking nigger over there, that makes me feel like disgusted. Yeah. That's like, you know, that, but it's really, it's con, the context is what's making me feel disgusted. It's not the word at all. The words themselves. And, you know, it speaks to your point where you said, like, you know, you feel slightly triggered and uncomfortable if people do a cancer joke. You almost kind of like, you know, brings you to a place. It makes me feel bad. But shouldn't comedy, I understand that point of comedy is supposed to be, you know, to make people laugh, but shouldn't comedy take you on a little bit of that journey? No, comedy gets, yeah, absolutely. And that's, and again, like I say, like, I recognize to me, that's the beauty of the thing. There is absolute. Like Patrice, oh, yeah, like I didn't agree with anything Patrice said, but he was the most brilliant comic and I thought he was better because of it. Because he took you on a journey. No rules, no, no rules behind it all. But then the other side of it, aside from like the journey of like just having to deal with it, I do, let me tell you, getting offended, it's a delight. Like if I find myself authentically offended, like, oh man, that's a great moment. Like, wow, that's incredible. How'd you manage to, that's fucking awesome. Yeah, the offense is like, usually it's just like, oh, the other side of comedy though, is you reflect what you think is comedic and what you want to say and what's really funny. And I just know like, when it comes to like racial shit, I don't know, it's just like not my ball of fucking putty. I don't get into it, I don't like, I think when I like say it, I just, I don't know, to me it's because it's not sparking, something in me that's like, yeah, that's pretty fucking hilarious. I just don't, I just don't do it. Yeah, I just grew up with such a, because I'm a mixer, I'm half Puerto Rican, half Italian-Irish, right? I grew up with a Italian-Irish household, my dad was murdered when I was four. The Puerto Rican influence in my life was basically gone after he was murdered, right? I just grew up in this sort of hilarious world where racism was a very, very big part of where I grew up, how I grew up, what I kind of dealt with every single day. I mean, I dealt with some real deal racism. When I hear white people tell me that I cannot use certain words that have racial implications, I'm like, motherfucker, are you crazy? Have you ever been hit in the face with a rock or something called the nigger? Right. Back the fuck up. There you go. Don't tell me what I can say. Exactly. So that experience, I do think it gives you a little more of a right. I have carte blanche because I am brown, I think I'm the surface. No pun intended, carte blanche. You do have that, yeah. But it's like, I think that people, look, I was raised by white people. I get this all the time. People are like, well, you're not really Puerto Rican because you were raised by Italian-Irish people. You don't listen to hip-hop music. You don't dress like you're a thug. I grew up on metal music. I grew up on poison and skid row. That was the shit that I liked when I was eight or nine. I had a sister who was a couple years older than me. So I didn't have that the same journey as the typical Puerto Rican kid growing up in the Bronx. But I think that because of that, I have a much different insight on racism and race than even those kids in the Bronx. Yeah, man, you do. And it's like, people get really white, some white dudes will get really adamant about their right to say whatever they want to say, to say the n-word as much as they want. And it's like, go ahead, dude. Say it all you fucking want. Just say it until you're fucking blue in the face. Wow, you're so fucking edgy. Wow, congratulations. But it's not funny and literally not fun. You know what I mean? It's not funny because I'm trying to apply ethics to comedy. It's not funny because what's coming out just feels like a kind of, have you ever heard the term edgelord? Yes. So that's what that is. It's edgelording. It's like, you're just trying to be this like fucking, oh, sorry about that. I like that, dude. It's actually better. You're just trying to be a fucking thing that's like standing at the fucking, I'll fix that. You're just trying to be a thing that's like being rather obvious in your choice of like language, where it's like, what does it really fucking do? And also PS, it's like, man, I mean, this is all, I'm gonna be fucking really honest, man. I didn't spend a lot of time thinking about this shit until like some of my friends started explaining it to me. And then I was kind of like, is there explaining a little resistant in the beginning where I'm like, what are you talking about? And then the more I thought, they're like, dude, Duncan, like just fucking think about it, man. Think about your experience in life. You know what I mean? You don't know what it's like to actually, like you said, get fucking hit in the face while you're being called a nigger. You don't know what that's fucking like. You have no idea. Anytime you've heard that word, it's coming out of the mouth of one of your fucking relatives in the south. You know what I mean? And it's like, and so you have no, there is no twinge. But the thing that I say, and obviously you're not even, you're not talking about taking the words off the table. You're saying it's your personal choice as a personal choice as an entertainer. Like, you're like, you know what dude, I don't need to go there because that's not, and that's, I think that's admirable. And I think that's obviously you're right. I, you know, we kind of loop back around to kind of the, you know, alternative comedy. I do think that a lot of those words, they're really difficult to get laughs with. You can't go up and say faggot anymore on stage and really get a laugh. It's really hard. I remember, I remember, I have a joke. I have a joke that I use. I talk about how, you know, it was when I first had my kid, I wrote this. I was like, I used to say that I wouldn't care if my son was gay, but, you know, I took my dog to the park recently and he started humping his other male dog and the dog's owner started fumbling. He was like, ah, yo son, your dog's a faggot. And I, you know, that was, and then I go into whatever, right? Yeah, that's cool. So, but the word faggot, I had to take out of that joke because I would say faggot and the audience would be laughing at, like they're laughing at the setups and I'm hitting these little punches and then I'd get to that word and the audience would shut down and they go, whoa. That's depressing. You know, and then I go, all right, well, I have to change it and I have to pivot. It's my job to kill. It's my job to get booked again at that club, but it's also, I believe, you know, my job, you know, and what we do with Legion of Skanks and kind of the brand over at Gas Digital, the podcast network that I run. It's, I think it is our, at this point, it's almost become like, you know, part of our brand and part of our responsibility to see how far we can push the line with keeping it hilarious and palpable for everybody in the room. That's it. Big J. To Big J. Wilkerson, you know, say what you want about him. Dude, he says every word under the sun and he is one of the funniest motherfuckers on the planet. Super funny. He will, dude, I mean, I literally, I watched him, we were at the Rose Battle and he used the N-word judging and he fucking killed and I was like, dude, I don't know many people who can use the N-word, a white guy in a comedy club 2017 and fucking have the audience rolling. Dude, that guy's fucking incredible. And again, let me just emphasize this, man, in case there's any question out there and people are listening. To me, comedy transcends ethics. Comedy transcends morality. Comedy transcends any kind of social construct in the zeitgeist determining what is the right way to be or the wrong way to be. Comedy is the spirit of Loki, of chaos and cannot be chained by the fucking ethical systems of the people. The moment comedians start letting themselves get chained down by that fucking system of ethics, then at that point, they are no longer fucking comedians. At that point, they've become something a little different. But again- Setarist or what it was, setarist was the word. I don't know what it fucking is. But what I'm trying to get across is, we should use all colors in our palette. So what I'm saying is, if something popped into my head, which was an authentic, hilarious use of that fucking word. You would do it. Fuck yeah, I'd do it. Yeah, goddamn right. But the point is, I haven't thought of anything funny in years. Yeah. Well, just cross the board. Yeah, dude, I'm out. Well, you look at clean comics, like Napar Gatsy. Like, people don't even realize that he is squeaky clean. Like, has never cursed into a microphone. Has never, like, that's like, on podcasts, he was like, dude, I won't even curse. Maybe he said bullshit or something on a podcast, like, gotten hammered or something. But that's as far as it's ever gone. And he's got, you know, a few hours of material, squeaky clean, super palpable. And, you know, we've talked about it so much. You know, my agent's like, yeah, dude, I'd love to get you on some of these corporates. How long can you go clean? I'm like, six minutes? I don't know, dude. What are you, how long you need? I can lie. You know, and Nate, you'll go do an hour on these corporates and he makes a lot of money doing it. Yeah, bet. Like a ton of fun. He said to me, he was like, dude, he was like, man, worst case scenario, I'll just do these corporate gigs, you know? And then he told me how much money he makes on them. I was like, that's your worst case scenario? I will suck a dick right now. Literally, I would suck a dick for the amount of money he makes on each corporate. I really mean that. I'm not even, and I'm not gay. So excuse anyone, doesn't know. That's a lot of money or not that much. Or I'm really into sucking dick. Yeah. Turns out I just love sucking dick. 500 bucks. It's like 500 bucks, yeah. No, but he, his mind, he doesn't think dirty. He just, his mind doesn't go there. His mind very much thinks of these things and it's not a thing for him to try. When I'm trying to do it like the late night tape, it's a nightmare, dude. Like my mind doesn't think that way. And I'm editing my jokes and I'm pulling words out and you're getting me an edited, you know, not for, for people that don't know, a comedian, you know, the reason that comedians do best in their home club, it's because they're most comfortable, dude. When you're comfortable, you're from the gut. You're in the moment. You can say whatever you want. You know you're not gonna get fired if you bomb because the booker loves you, that your friend at this point, you've been working there for years. That's where you get this amazing, incredible fucking comedy out of somebody. It's not in theater in their first half hour comedy central special. It's not late night where they're nervous as shit. That is like. Or where they've had to give a fucking sheet of their jokes to a panel of censors who go through every fucking line. Word by word, gotta take that out, gotta take that out. That is Lucifer. That's like, can you fucking imagine all the great artists having to go to a bureaucratic panel of people reflecting the will of the state before they could paint the thing that had come into their minds? It's crazy. Can you fucking imagine what that would look like? If they could showcase their art. And then you would literally go, imagine them going, all right, well you know what dude, we're only using the eight colors in that Crayola box. That's it. Now look, is that a skill set? Is that something incredible to be able to do? Of course. But it's not the nitty gritty balls, what the fuck is funny about Duncan Truffle or Louis Shagomas. You know listen, I love that you wanna paint Mona Lisa. And I think it's fantastic. But does she have to be in dark, like let's brighten up the thing a little bit. Can we brighten it up? She's, you could barely see her smile. Make her fucking grin. I wanna see her, I wanna see those teeth. I wanna see this fucking teeth. See Colgate is one of our sponsors and we really need to show some teeth right now. But see, but this is, and I think it's a good way to wrap it around because I know you gotta go. This is something that I love about the skanks and all of you guys and what you represent when it comes to comedy is that when you consider that up until this point, the main way to reach the people through comedy was either going on the road and then having albums or getting on TV. But then here's where it gets sinister because the rules that people have been abiding by up until recently with network television have been rules that have been prescribed by the state. Then what ends up happening is the state gets in between the people and art, in between the people. So people have been seeing propaganda. Now it might not seem like propaganda. They're like, what do you mean? Just cause like you can't say fuck or pussy or shit or whatever. No, no, no, no. You can't get a late night set if you are praising Trump in any way. You're not getting on late night, period, you're not. Now this is this effect for better, this effect is always for the worse. And so what ends up happening is people begin to become attuned to a very specific type of media that is media that has been warped by the state. It's also comfortable, right? So that people love routine. So anything that deviates from that specific thing, they go, I don't even like that. And then in real, it's like a subconscious thing, but they go, oh, that's uncomfortable. They've been programmed. Yeah. They've been programmed. That anti-programming, you- It's conditioned. You don't even realize that like, it's not even the words, whatever it is. It's how it's packed. It's why every TV show is the same. It's why every late night talk show starts the same, ends the same. It's because that routine, if you deviate from that routine, we don't need to start television shows at the exact same time every single, every single, in the same way. Not every fucking reality show needs to have the exact same structure, but they know that the way the human mind works is routine makes people very comfortable. It makes people go like, oh shit, I feel like I'm at home and that's why everybody in their life, they go through these cycles. So you say, anybody who goes through a therapist, you're gonna come to the conclusion that you're doing these stupid cycles and you break them all down and that's comfortable. Even if it's bad habits, even if it's stupid shit, smoke and cigarettes every day, right? It's just, it's this comfortable thing that you're doing every single day and when you don't have it, I remember when I first stopped smoking cigarettes, I was like, what am I gonna do with my hand? I was like, ah, I need to, it was so uncomfortable and just not have that. It wasn't even the fucking smoke anymore. It was just the routine. So which is super fucking cool about your podcast and what you guys are doing. See, I'm not saying you guys are like saving planet earth or anything that's so lofty, but just the very act that I know. You should know though, because here's what we did. This is where we get fucking so silly. This is that, we were in LA last week and we did that show at the comedy store and then we're just at dinner and we're on cloud nine. Jay had just done Conan and everyone's feeling really good and there's Puerto Rico shit was going on. We tweeted at me, they were like, ah, you guys haven't said anything about Puerto Rico. So I was like, you know what? The comedy store shows tomorrow night, well, this in front of everybody, Dave did not want to do this at all. Jay barely wanted to do this, but there's a bunch of people, like agents, all these people. I was like, we should donate the money from the comedy store show tomorrow night to Puerto Rico. And then Dave's like, all of it? I'm like, yeah, all of it. And everyone's like, yeah, yeah, I was like, yeah. Then everyone's like, I guess we're gonna do that now. So we made three grand that night. On the Thursday night, we did a stand up show in the main room, then a podcast in the belly room. But then, check this out, you're gonna love this because you fucking, you get into the, just using the fucking business for good sometimes. The podcast we recorded, I was like, well, why don't we just put that up for pay-per-view on Gas Digital? There you go. Right, because people won't buy podcasts, but if you donate a few bucks, we'll give you the podcast. We're gonna put it out for free eventually one day. So we've made another like six grand already. We're probably gonna probably cut her off like 10 grand. We're gonna donate 10 grand to Puerto Rico. So yeah, you can say, and word jokes, are saving the world Duncan. And I can feel it. And that's what's so fucking cool about it. And this is why it's just such a beautiful thing to have. And it's really fucking inspiring. That's awesome, fucking $10,000. That's amazing. And here's the cool part of all of the thing that I'm like, I take out of all of it, fuck Puerto Rico, no offense. But I think that's such an incredible lesson to learn. Like, wait a minute, hold on, time out. We don't have to raise money, and we're not a huge podcast. We have a following, but you can do a fucking charity benefit without having to get eight big comics together and a big theater. And you know, to raise $10,000, it would take a fucking a whole night and everybody's schedules and getting everything together. You can just say, hey dude, you know what, I'm gonna do a podcast. You know, you sit down with fucking Ari Shafir. Today we're gonna donate the money to the Las Vegas family. Victims, five bucks a pop, you buy it, you donate it. I mean, we did it $2 for the audio, $5 for the video and the audio, and then for 20 bucks we give you a special thank you on air. And we're just gonna keep it open for about a week. I think we've done like six grand so far on the pod. You are a filthy angel and I'm so glad you exist, man. Filthy angel is a great way to fucking describe it. Sounds like the name of a porn company. But hey, thank you so much, Louis. Thank you, brother. This is awesome, man. Where can people find you? Go on MyScomedy.com for all the live dates. When does this come out? This will probably come out either this week or next week. So if it comes out next week, December, I'm sorry, October 22nd, I'll be in Detroit. You guys can get tickets at GoMesComedy.com, I'm with my buddy Justin Silver, coming out to Chicago, coming out to Buffalo. Lots of road stuff happening.

It is I, D Trussell, and this is the Dunker Trussell family on our podcast in Holy Lord in Heaven. We've got a blazer for you today. First, some backstory. When I was in high school, I became obsessed with an author, Robert Monroe. He wrote a bunch of books, the most famous being journeys out of the body, which are his accounts of the experiences he had when he figured out how to do something you've probably heard of astral projection. Now, this is a very old idea, maybe one of the oldest ideas and different cultures have different ways of expressing it. But essentially, the idea is you can like launch yourself out of the sheath of your body and fly around the material universe. Now, do we really have a soul that can launch itself out of a sheath that we call our body? I don't know. There's all kinds of weird stuff wrapped up in astral projection, a kind of silvery cord that connects you to your body that tethers you to your body. If that cord should be cut, you're out of here, baby. Again, I don't know if we actually have a soul or some kind of astral aspect to us that can fly outside of the body. I don't know. I speculate that astral projection is really just a form of lucid dreaming, but who knows? I speculate it could be a way to induce sleep paralysis, that thing you've probably experienced where you wake up, you can't move. Some people claim that they feel like an old lady sitting on their chest. There's lots of stories about it, documentaries about it. Truly, I don't know, but when I was in high school, I diligently began studying Robert Monroe's techniques of astral projection, his methods of relaxing and all of the ways that you're supposed to come out of your body by like rolling out of it. Lots of weird little tricks. I could never pull it off. But my mom had a tape, a hypnotic tape on astral projection. And for a while, every night I would listen to it. I still remember it. It would sort of try to relax you by having you imagine that you're on an escalator or something. And then after you fell asleep, it would continue and seed you with methods or the ways to come out of your body. Most importantly, it would sort of implant in you the belief that this is something you could achieve. So one morning, I was skipping school and laying in bed. I'd fallen asleep. And you know, that wonderful, deep, relaxing sleep you used to get in high school when you were skipping school and went to bed. I don't know if you know what I'm talking about, but four stars level of sleep. I was deep asleep and then I thought I heard somebody knocking on the door of our house. I woke up and suddenly my fan was right in my face. Now, in those days, I was taking LSD all the time. So my first thought was, oh, this is some kind of acid flashback. And then I kind of drifted around and saw myself asleep in bed and realized that my mom's hypnotapes had actually worked. I was doing astral projection. It was not what I had fantasized. What I'd fantasized was like I'd be able to fly around, spy on people, go through walls, do anything I wanted. This was terrifying. There was a sense of a dark, looming presence in the room and I just wanted to get back in my body. So somehow I managed to float down to my body. I floated through my body and landed on the floor underneath my bed and then opened my eyes and I was wide awake. After that, it happened, I don't know, maybe 10 or 12 more times. Each time was pretty scary and I never really liked it. Maybe that's why I can't do it anymore, though I have tried a few times. There's lots of methods out there. If you're interested in doing astral projection, journeys out of the body is probably the best place you could go. If you're interested in lucid dreaming, there's lots of techniques out there. One of them is really, really curious. The idea is you sort of set a timer on your watch and every hour your alarm goes off and you think to yourself, am I dreaming? And if you're not dreaming, you just go back to your regular life. But if you do this long enough, then what will happen is in a dream, your alarm will go off and you will be lucid dreaming. You'll be able to enjoy what it's like to have some kind of conscious control over your dreams. And this is something that for sure people can do. You might have experienced it yourself. In fact, it's one of the best things that can happen, isn't it? When you're having a nightmare and suddenly you remember that you're in a dream, like right away the nightmare transforms. Now, in this incredible book written by today's guest, Tenzin Wango Rinpoche, The Tibetan Yogas of Dream and Sleep, all of this gets kind of turned on its head. Instead of setting alarms or reminding yourself throughout the day that you're awake, you do the opposite. Throughout the day, you actually tell yourself this is a dream too. What's the difference? It's still like a dream. That is a very psychedelic practice. It's incredible and weird. And I still remember reading about it and just being overwhelmed by that thought experiment, the thought experiment of wondering to yourself, what if this is a dream, this thing that we call being awake? Maybe it's a more consistent dream. Maybe it's a more stable dream. And whenever I'm dreaming, I'm sort of jumping from one incarnation to the next to the next to the next. But if you think about any given life, you're jumping from one incarnation to the next to the next to the next, even while you're alive. I mean, in the same way dreams have that weird fluid quality to them, where you don't really question how strange it is that one second you could be sitting on a plane, the next second you might be riding a tiger. Because I guess the way we experience time when we're awake is different than when we dream. We don't notice so much how massively different things are from one year to the next to the next to the next. And there is a quality in that kind of transformation or fluidity of anybody's life that is very dream-like. So that's just one little piece of Tibetan dream yoga. I mean, obviously I'm no expert in Tibetan dream yoga, but today's guest truly is. I don't even, it must be a dream because I actually got to talk to Tenzin Wangyoh Rinpoche about his incredible book. And I'm really excited to share the conversation that we had. Get ready. It is a very intense psychedelic conversation. We're going to jump right into it, but first this. Today's episode of the DTFH has been sponsored by Babbel.

Friends, it is time for you if you are living in Texas to come and see me do some stand-up with the amazing William Montgomery. You probably know him from Keltoni. He's hilarious.

So I hope you will come see me there. Did you know I have a Patreon? We hang out every week. I hope you will join us. Okay, everybody, let's do it. Today's guest, Tenzin Wango Rinpoche, is the founder and spiritual director of Ligminche International. He is a world-famous meditation teacher. He teaches the Bon Buddhist tradition of Tibet. And he has written a lot of amazing books. The Tibetan Yogas of Dream and Sleep. It's just one of his incredible books. I hope you will check out all of his writing. And if you're lucky enough to live near him, he still teaches. So you could go to one of his retreats or you could go to one of the Ligminche centers. You can find all of those at Ligminche.org. And of course, the links are going to be at dunkintrustle.com if you feel drawn to Tenzin's incredible teachings. Tenzin is an amazing way of just cutting right to the essence of things. This is what happens when you are a practicing monk Tibetan teacher. And honestly, just getting a chance to zoom with him was really intense. Being around people like him, it's the most inspiring thing. The clarity, the sharpness, the vividness and also just how cool they are. I feel so lucky that I got a chance to hang out with him. So please welcome to the DTFH Tenzin Wangyue Rinpoche. It's the dunkintrustle.com. Rinpoche, welcome to the DTFH. I'm thrilled to meet you. Thank you so much for being here. Thank you. I thought we could, I have a question to start off. And I think this will help us jump right into dream yoga, which I am really interested in. In your book, you say, if we lose ourselves every night, what chance do we have to be aware when death comes? So I was wondering, why do we need to be aware when death comes? The role of awareness is always the same. I think every single moment in our life, the moment you are aware, more good chance that you are more connected to yourself, more good chance that you will not lose yourself, not lose things. Like even when you lose phone, I often lose my iPhone. So very often I remember when I keep my phone somewhere, I'm looking at myself and saying, I'm putting you here and I'm aware of you and I'm going to pick it up back. So if I'm not aware, so usually as you put somewhere, you forget and you forget to pick it up. You lose it. So during the moment of the death, it's so important that you are aware of yourself so you don't get lost in the part of the intermediate state. Now, the bardo, the intermediate state, let's imagine someone dies in an unaware state. What can they expect in the bardo? And what is the thing within the bardo that is experiencing anything at all as opposed to a person who dies with awareness? Yeah, so it's a similar thing that even during the daytime, there are so many moments people get completely get lost. They kill people, they suicide themselves, they bring a lot of harms in the society. In the very moment when they are not aware, they are completely caught up in their deep pain, stories and depressions and anxieties. So if they are aware of those moments, they are able to see, or are not happy, they are very down, they feel very negative, but I should be more aware of the consequences of what I do and what I say. So even having that awareness, you protect yourself more when to talk and when not to talk, when to act and when not to act. Same way in the bardo, it's more serious because it's not a transition of a day or week or month, it's a transition of life. If you are going to go in the wrong direction, you go for the entire lifetime. So if you go in the right direction, you go for the entire lifetime. It's not like doing a mistake, leaving your phone or doing a wrong turn in the highway. Gotcha. It's sort of like going to a movie theater, except the movie lasts for your entire lifetime. You want to pick a good movie, you just don't want to run into any theater. You might end up in the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I got it. Okay, thank you. In your book, you point out something that I don't think many of us have considered. We spend one third of our lives sleeping and to bring back to what you said initially, and even when we're awake, where were we when we lost our phone? Where were we when we lost our keys? If you add to that one third, the times in the day when we're not there, it seems like we're barely here at all. Yes, it's scary. It's scary, but I'm curious. In those moments where we have lost our phone, where are we? From your perspective, what has become of us? What was there? What happened? Yeah, and I think as every spiritual tradition talk about the famous being the present moment. Present moment is a gift of our lives. So what happened is most of the time we get lost. Before we lose our phone, we get lost ourselves. Before we get turned wrong turn, we get lost ourselves. So before we lose it, take our own direction in the intermediate state of Pardo, we get lost ourselves. So I think the main thing is we get lost in our pain stories, some sciatic stories. We have so much stories. And not only we have so much stories of the past, and constantly we are always creating a stories in every given moment. Instead of letting a resting little bit for a moment, we lack rest. Okay, right. Yes, even sometimes I will fall asleep and thank goodness it hasn't happened as much, but sometimes I'll wake up more tired than when I went to sleep. I don't know if I doubt you have because you are a Rinpoche, but I don't know if you ever had the experience where you fall asleep and in your dream you work. Have you ever had that happen? Yeah, sometimes definitely that happens. So I think when you are sleeping, it depends on what kind of quality sleep you have, how deep you are sleeping, how long you are sleeping, how much your sleep is interrupted or not. It factors in so many different things. So when you do sleep like a power nap, it could be like a 20 minute. You sleep, you come back with so much more clarity and awareness. Rather than putting that 20 minute, working so hard trying to be more clear, trying to be more aware and exhaust yourself, you don't have any more energy to be clear. It's better to sleep and wake up and more clarity than trying to be clear and lose little energy to full clarity you have. That mistake we do all the time in our life. Gotcha. Particularly in the West, we think working harder, doing more is better. No, taking break, getting rest, you recover better. Long term, you're going to be way more productive. Even in a short time, even in afternoon, when you're trying to drink double espresso and trying to do something, it's better to not drink double espresso, take a short nap and wake up. It's right there, you're much better. Well, in the West, if there is a spiritual component to sleeping, generally, I don't know if you've ever seen, I think they're sort of silly. The websites, I dreamed of a bird. They'll say, oh, you dreamed of a bird. It means money is coming or something ridiculous like that, as opposed to what you teach, which is, I just, I mean, I clearly remember the experience I had reading your book. I remember the feeling as you were inviting me to see waking life as a dream. Oh, what an odd sense came over me. It was, I don't want to say unnerving, but I just don't think I'd spent any amount of time considering the dreamlike quality of waking life, at least in the way you were able to dial it in in your wonderful book. So this thing that you are teaching, it's not like even the Jungian archetypes or anything like that. It's much deeper than that. Can you talk about it, this idea that there is actually some opportunity for a spiritual practice within the dreaming state? Before I read your book, I'd never even heard of that before. Sure. So I think, you know, in our life, we all need to take a break from our ego, stories of our ego, stories of our pain, stories of our conflict, the push of our ego to always trying to do something, achieve something, compete someone. This whole energy draining machine that we have running 24 hours a week, we need you to learn how to take a break. And naturally, sometimes we do take a break. So like you're sleeping. When you sleep, you're supposed to sleep deep and good quality. When you're taking a weekend, you're supposed to take a good weekend off. When you're taking a family time, a good family time off. Or even the idea of intermittent fasting, you know, like fasting. In our culture, we do fast in between the food. In Western culture and American culture, you have snack culture. You have big meals and in between big meals, you have snacks or so many snacks. So you're never giving a break to your organs, particularly your liver. And your liver is getting drained again and again and again. It's like having a bad boss. You've given a task and before you finish that, you've given another task. Before you finish that, you have a bigger task. So we need, you can just really break in our system. So sleep yoga is, and sleep yoga and dream yoga is saying, you are taking a break anyway, learn to take it better and apply your spiritual awareness in them so that one third of your life not completely lost. There's some development is happening. You make a distinction. I wonder if you could talk about the distinction between the sort of sleep that could result from this yoga versus what most of us think of as sleep. Like when I think of sleep, I think I lay down and I get a little dimmer. Maybe I'll feel good. The pillow feels mattress feels good. There's some moment where my body will jerk. Then I'll have a series of weird dreams. Maybe wake up in the morning. This is how I sleep. Can you talk about the difference between that kind of non-yogic sleep and the sleep that you're talking about? Yeah. So basically we think about three different kind of sleep. One we call sleep of clear light. The most important, most profound experience is the sleep of clear light. Sleep of clear light is when you're able to totally rest deep enough so that all your conceptual mind, the story of the day, pain of your emotions, none of them will interfere your higher quality of sleep. You know, we know sometimes some days as a better sleep. Other days as a worse sleep. The better sleep is when you think, oh, my day was productive. My day was great. I have my family visiting me. I love them. They love me. You have a wonderful day experience. Do you go to sleep? You're a good night's sleep. So you will sleep well. Next morning you'll feel, you know, more like a rested, more uplifting, more positive energy. But the day when he hits you, your boss fires you. Your family have rejected you. You have deep emotional crisis inside you. Your fear is completely up. So like night like that, when you go to sleep, you don't, you know, of course, first you don't go to sleep. You maybe go pieces of sleep. You have nightmares. You wake up totally exhausted. So the whole entire life is like that. So it's not so much question about what happens to you. It's more what you do with, or how you process what happens to you. So sometimes negative experiences can happen. If you know how to handle them better, you still go to sleep. Okay. Sometimes you have a good, good day. But the last morning you have one bad thought that you don't need more. One single bad thought after a whole good day is enough to mess up. Yes. Yes. My mind is good at producing those thoughts. Incredible. In fact, like a terrible heckler right before I'm falling asleep. Amazing. So, okay. The sleep of clear light. Some mornings after what you just described, rejection from the family, some horrible fight, something rotten is going on. I wake up in the best mood ever, feeling so good. And then within a few seconds, it's like, my mind reminds me what happened the night before. Is that the clear light that you're talking about? It's this kind of non. The clear light is, it's the moment all your pain stories, it dissolves like water. You know, when you don't shake it like a little spring water, when you shake it, it's a muddy, and when you leave it for a couple of hours, all the rocks and stones goes down, all the leaves comes up in the middle. It's the crystal clear water. So, your mind, when you go to sleep, when you're able to let go, able to rest, then your mind becomes completely clear like an autumn sky. No clouds. And then that experience in sleep, it's called clear light sleep, where you are able to be aware of that inner sky, inner light, without any stories or pain. That's like another word, when you're really able to see yourself and experience yourself without all your thoughts and emotions, that's the clear light experience. And, but when we say sleep of samsara, sleep of samsara means sleep where you have dreams, every single dream is your samsaric stories. It has something to do with your activity of the day. It has something to do with your, how you think about that, how you see about it, how you feel about it, all your stories related with it. When that becomes a dominating factor and take over and you produce a lot of dreams. So, that becomes, it's called samsaric sleep, means you have stories, dreams. Sometimes we call clear light sleep, clear light dream. Clear light dream is dream more predictable dreams, a dream in which you can meet teachers, dream in which you can connect with your inner sources, get a lot of information, inner knowledge from yourself, from other beings, other masters. So, these are different kind of sleep and dreams. From time to time, I have dreams where people were Tibetan Buddhist monks give me Dharma talks and I love it when it happens. I wake up in the morning and I can't remember much of what they taught, but it's like I'm sitting in a lecture hall or they're just teaching. So, who are those people? Do you, when you are not doing your retreats, do you go into people's dreams and teach them? No, I think it's more like people have, I have dreams like that with my teachers. I regularly visit him, he regularly appears in my dream. I regularly ask questions, he regularly answers my questions. Then I sometimes very, very long and a very impressive, very sequential and I ask him, you know, I will say, do you come in my dream? He would smile. So, basically I think it's not sometime, not so much that he's coming in me or in my dream more than I'm creating a space in my higher self which is becoming as a form of teacher, the teacher that I know, outer world. So, that outer, my outer teacher, my inner teacher, they come together. One is essence, one is a form, but it's communicating to me. So, my higher self is communicating me, my outer teacher is communicating me with my higher self. Whatever way you want to look at, I think that's how I see it. That makes a lot of sense. My method, which please don't judge me for this when I say method, but it's very lazy I guess you would say. When I'm falling asleep I will ask for that or I'll put that into my last thoughts and then sometimes I get lucky and it'll happen. Not all the time, a lot of the times I'm just running from a ghost or something, but sometimes it works and I guess I'm interested in the distinction between this and astral projection, lucid dreaming and the various sort of new-age spiritual methods that allow you to come into waking space but in the astral form. Yeah, I think the astral trip, out-of-body experiences could be very beneficial if it's guided properly, if with knowledge and sometimes I tell in my students, I tell them, you know, you guys are always too much out-of-body anyway. If you want to learn something, you have to learn how to embody yourself, how to be in your body, not out-of-your-body, because most of the time you are out-of-body. Yes, yes, for sure. That's hilarious. Okay, that's a wonder. Thank you. I get that. Well, this idea of the story, it's very controversial to some people. Some people, they feel quite committed to the story. You know, if you suggest when someone is expressing discontent that this is a story that you're telling yourself, there might be more to you than just this story or that maybe you're telling a story to make sense of some fundamental suffering, but the story is not quite as real as the suffering. Can you talk a little bit more about this tendency in human beings to sort of instantaneously produce an explanatory reason for all of the pain that seems to go along with being in a human body? Yeah, I think the main thing from this perspective is always human beings always have an identity crisis. You know, I mean, in the West, you know, you say about identity crisis, we think about, yeah, people have identity crisis. You know, middle-aged people having identity crisis. When their body is weak, they could get a stronger car. That's what I did. I have a big truck. Fancy a car or something like that. Or when people lose their job, sometimes it's not to get into so much pain because of their losing their sense of identity, power, position. And a teenage, you know, when they are going through struggles, they're trying to look for themselves, you know, trying to separate themselves from their parents and trying to find themselves who they are, identity crisis. A war in Russia, a war in Ukraine in Russia right now is identity crisis. You know, basically it's identity crisis. So instead of becoming an enemy, you can become a friend. You know, one of the best ways to resolve the conflict in two countries is to become closer, not trying to take over each other. You know, like people come, I mean, you see in the U.S. there's all these different states becoming one as one country rather than, you know, thinking about all times still fighting between Texas and California. So it's between even two people. You know, you can have a conflict, you can argue in a fight all the time or you can, maybe the best solution is how to connect with each other, each other, how to become friends. So friendship is a solution for conflict, not the war, right? So I think that it's always the issue of identity. This is what it is. So when you don't know who you are, you're always trying to be something, someone. And always there's something someone has to create a story to beat. Right. So even in a dream, you might not be you. What do you think who you are? You might be somebody else. Sometimes you can dream about being animals. Yes. You can dream about men can dream about being a woman. Woman can dream about being a man or human can dream about being tiger. Yes. You know, or maybe that the monkeys can they dream about being human? I don't know. So it's always the identity is what crisis or identity is what creates all the stories of pain. So there's this possibility. And I, you know, I think many of my listeners have heard of this possibility, the possibility being that via some spiritual practice, a reacquaintance with something that is not so transient. I think it must be the clear light that you're talking about. Could relieve this identity crisis. It could show you that there's a more stable. Yeah. So for example, if somebody tells you, you know, if somebody tell ask you a story of your pain, you will have a lot of stories to tell. You will say, I broke up with this. I lost this. This conflict. You can have a lot of story of the past. And then maybe you can have also a lot of stories of the future user. I'm hoping this. I'm hoping that I'm hoping this will happen. And but if you look, if you say, what's your problem right now here? I'm not interested in your past story. I'm not interested in what you're hoping in the future. What's your problem right now? And you look at right now here. You look at right and left and up and down and here. Here. I don't have any problem. That's it. Yeah. So if you're trying to be in the moment, you don't have so much a problem. And if you are aware of that, you can have less hassle. You will be less affected by your past and the future if you are more in the present moment, because it doesn't allows the story so much in the present moment. Okay. Well, let's imagine you and I have been sentenced to death. We are both hanging out just before going out to the gallows. And you say to me, what's our problem right now? I'm going to say, they're about to hang us. We're doomed. This is creating all kinds of anxiety in me. Even if I'm in the present moment, maybe we can even see the gallows right over there, right over there. So how does this work in situations like that imminent doom? Yeah. So in that, those situations, you, first of all, of course, I'm not saying it's easy, but I'm saying we are playing the same game. We have a notion of death and death and you have an idea of death is bad. Yes. Yes. You have an idea of death is failure and you have an idea of particularly where you are, you're the way you're going to die. You have all these stories. Without those stories, you will not have a problem. Well, the stories is death. Dying like a death, you know, when you take a nap, would you say, you know, it's a problem? No. Because you say, a nap is good. When you say, I will wake up in half an hour. When you say death, that is a problem. So you're going to wake up in 40, 49 days as a different, another, another life. The story that we have. But I mean, not to keep going back to the story I just told, when I take a nap, I don't hang myself prior to falling asleep. I mean, though I do get the comparison and I, and I do get the comparison, I just, and I love. The main idea here is, is the story that we, it's not about the death and that is the story that you have around the death and that what creates the problem. Death is not creating a problem. Death is not a personal problem. It happens to everybody. It happened to Christ, happened to Buddha. And it will happen to every single powerful people. It will happen to everybody on this earth right now. In the end of the years, maybe none of these people will be here, all these people right now. I mean, it seems like in a few months, that's possible the way things are going in the world. Yeah. Yeah. So it's a natural, this is something that, but I do thank you for this because I don't think I ever quite connected the fact that I'm telling that I'm, I always think, I understand the add-ons in Buddhism. I understand. Your example is, I think it's a little bit extreme for people, but every given moment, every single day, you have a stories, there's an event and there's a stories. And the story is you can, the people who are in a very depressed, they will have different stories of the same event. People who are positive, they will have a different version of that story. People who are successful, they look for solutions. They don't talk about problems. People have failed a lot. They're not interested in the solution. They're attracted to talking about problems. Right, right, right, right. I want to thank BetterHelp for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH. Friends, life is incredibly confusing. And sometimes it gets so confusing that you're not going to figure it out yourself. You need help. I'm somebody who has really benefited from lots of therapy. In fact, once I asked Ram Das what advice he had for me, like what spiritual practice he could recommend for me. And he said, get a therapist. It was really frustrating because I was hoping he would like, you know, I don't know, give me some kind of like spiritual something, a mantra. But it was like, no, you need therapy, man. I ignored him for a long time and then finally I ended up getting therapy and it truly is one of the best things I've ever done for myself in my life.

Like, for me, some kind of pain, some kind of suffering, then that is when I invent, oh, I want to know why I don't feel so good. Here's why I don't feel so good. Because I didn't get enough sleep or I'm worried about this or that. But can underneath the story, that suffering, what is it? Or are you saying that when we annihilate the story, story goes away? Suffering naturally goes away. Instantly, that would go away too. Now, as I said earlier, underlying the story is the pain identity. The father will have a pain of father's story, not the mother's story. The mother will have a mother's story, not father's story. The business person will have the story, pain story of business related, not as a parent. So if you look at every pain story, it's associated to a single identity. And this identity sometimes is very flexible. That means, you know, usually we say, I'm no one and I can be anyone. I'm someone, it's hard to be someone else. When you, when you, you know, a whole idea in Buddhism, they say, you are no one. What you're identifying is just identity. You are identifying with it, but you are not that. You're not, you're not a lawyer. So you're not a doctor. You have a role of law. It's a professional role you're playing as a lawyer. But you are not lawyer. So when you are, you are able to separate what you do. Basically, another word, you are not what you do. Okay. Now you are, and you have to be free. You have to be free from what you do and do it better and you will do it better. You are a father. How many children do you have? If you don't mind me is just watch how old 16 16. So what's it like being a renowned Rinpoche and a dad to a teenager? Well, that's, I think the beauty is that, you know, I think I feel that all the teaching, the practices, they help me reflect differently. I don't have to look at one way. I have, I feel I have option to look different ways because I can see, I can see, I feel something. I can see where the feeling is coming from. I can trace back to that one single identity. Then I realize I do not have to be that I am not that I can be more than that beyond that and free from that. Then I have, I'm able to deal with the situation much better. Deal with the situation better does not mean necessarily being passive. Sometimes you have to be strong. Sometimes you have to be soft. But what do you need to do be when and what kind of kid these decisions, it happens in the second. Yeah. How do you, do you ever find yourself forgetting this? Like, do you ever find yourself wrapped up in? Of course, of course. And do you have tricks for? Well, I mean, I don't have a trick. I have, I have awareness. You know, I don't have a trick. So I have to, I first whatever is happening you self observation is the most important human beings has. I think one of the greatest gift that we have ability to look ourselves and look analyze ourselves. I'm feeling this. Do I have to feel this? Why I'm feeling this? I'm feeling this because I expect some respect. I have a main identity who luck, who feel luck of respect and that place of luck of respect and reacting to the situation. But when I realize that, that's all what I need. Not to be too, too, too caught up with the story. Got it. I can see where it's connected. It's not, it's not you or someone. It's me. When I know it's coming out of me and one aspect of me, I feel more free. This autumn sky, I love that, but I love autumn. It's my favorite time of year. Blue sky. And yet, here we are. Clouds, right? This pain body thing. It's a cloud. It's cloud. Now the cloud, even though if you even catch a slight. Cloud is okay. Not the storm like in Florida. Yeah, hurricane. That's me. That's when I meditate. I'm flying one of those planes into the hurricane. That's what it's like. But this pain body, this, I know that from the perspective of the sky, doesn't the pain body kind of not deserve respect, but deserve love or, I mean, gosh, what a mess to find yourself. Even if you are a temporary transient, wispy, clump of knotted stories, you still are something, right? Like you still, this thing, I'm just saying within the possibility of, I'm not the neurotic cloud. There's still the cloud somehow. It's still there. So, yeah. So, you know, in my book, Tiberi Yogas of Dream and Sleep, which is now a new revised version is coming out with Shambhaka. And so, and that in that book, you know, we talk about different dream, so different kind of dream, different kind of sleep. And in order to make some changes to this pain identity, if you're not able to do it during the waking state, you might able to do it in the night. So how to do those change, you go to sleep with one personality, you wake up with another personality. It could be that dramatic. It could be that radical. I found it interesting in one of the lectures of yours that I watched. You were talking about how this is, you know, everyone, you didn't say these words, so forgive. This is coming from me, neurotic cloud. That's my spiritual name, neurotic cloud. We know meditation. We know yoga in the day. This is considered just as much a valid path as meditation, just as much a valid way to wake up as all the others. So, especially in a dream and sleep, what is important is that, you know, just before you go to sleep, one of the very important emphasis, they say it's so important. One of the two moments is a very important moment in life. One before you die, one before you go to sleep, whatever thoughts and emotion you have before you go to sleep, very important, it will impact the rest of your night. When you die, before your last breath, whatever thoughts and emotion, even what object that you are looking at, will impact, hold the process of journey of the death. So, it's very important. So, in the dream yoga and sleep yoga, it teaches, you know, trying to do something called night breathing or purification, do some kind of breathing, be aware of your thoughts, emotions, breathe them out, find a very restful place and let go, and then find a deep resting place to sleep. So, you kind of preparing yourself. If you manage to succeed that, let's say in five minutes, you do your little practice, your little tricks, and then when you go to sleep, you manage to, you go to sleep for six hours, four hours. But during those four hours, you are able to maintain that autumn sky, that light, because you just enter in there. During the waking state, it interrupts very often. You know, I have a first second, I have a good thought. One minute later, I have a bad thought. There's more frequent interruptions in the sleep. No. For example, when you say, I want to wake up five in the morning because I have to take a flight, you put that memory there. And next morning, you wake up around five o'clock, very often. Yes. So, the memory stays the rest of the night. Right. Whoa. Gotcha. That's amazing. You wake up for five minutes, and then you wake up after four hours, you meditate for, you're meditated for four hours. But if you enter depressed in a five minute and slept five hours in that state of depression, you are depressed for five hours. Yes, that's why you know why you wake up so bad mood. Wow. I got to stop looking at my phone when I go to sleep. What am I doing? I look at the most terrible things. I watch Ukrainian war footage, and then I fall asleep. I got to stop. Yeah, I do too sometimes. You do? Yeah, I watch. I mean, I watch the, you know, the war story a little bit more than I should. It's very absorbing. It's a big story. It's a planetary story. It's very absorbing. Could you, and forgive me because I know that this is a, this is the kind of thing you teach over, you know, months to truly learn it. And, but is there a way for listeners? Could you maybe teach us just a little bit about a simple practice to do before we fall asleep? Sure. So I think for beginners, I think it's important throughout the day. Try to be as much as aware as possible. Try to be aware of, you know, what you're feeling, how you're responding to the world. Like, I'm happy what somebody said. I'm unhappy what somebody said. Being aware of your thoughts and emotions. And when you're aware of your thoughts and emotions, seeing who is upset. The identity. When you're able to see, oh, I'm upset for no reason. Or maybe I'm upset because this morning I was in, I have, I was in a good mood. Then I am throwing this to my wife, my friend, someone. You just, you recognize something, you know. So throughout the day, trying to have some control over your own thoughts and emotions, not totally driven by it. So during the daytime, I think that's important to do that. So just calm down, calm down, calm down, self-reflect, calm down, self-reflect, calm down. And then before go to sleep, think about, you know, sleep is, get excited. Think about sleep is a journey to inner temple, sacred temple, sacred journey. Look forward. And then the last moment before you go to sleep, look at what happened during the daytime. Process them a little bit. Look at what's happening that particular moment before you go to sleep. You are almost ready to close your eye, already close your eye. Look at, you have a thought. One single thought of discomfort thought is sitting there with you. And you are aware of that. Just bring the light of awareness to that one single negative thought, unprocessed thought, and bring awareness in your breath. And through your breath, breathe out. Breathe out that single thought. Breathe out that single feeling. Breathe out whatever tensions in your body, wherever these tensions are held. You breathe out there. Like they said, deep exhalation, like five to six seconds. Count five to six seconds. Deep and slow breathing out. And breathe in like about four seconds in. Deep breathing in. You repeat this maybe five, ten times. Then you're clear. You have the past to go to sleep. And once you're going to sleep, you will have amazing experiences. You sleep better, sleep clearer. You might have positive energies are charging. You might even experience a clear light. But you have to do this little process before you go to sleep. I love that. Thank you. That's very simple. I remember in the book, there's also poses, aren't there? There's ways of sleeping, holding your body. I mean, this gets quite deep. You know, there's a lot in the book. So I think if, of course, I would, you know, those who are interested in a dream and sleep, I would recommend to get the book, especially the new version. And now revise, revise version so that. And this is the book, not to study for a week or month. This is a book to keep it near your pillow and rest of your life. This is where I, I'm going to get the new edition and I will, I will start doing that. Friends listening, I must tell you this. I, I have, I don't think I've ever encountered a more psychedelic book. I don't think I've ever encountered a thing that made me how instantaneous. It was almost too, I think I almost stopped wanting to read it, not because it wasn't interesting, because it was too much. And I remember in the book, something of a warning, like you had to tell people just because you were starting to explore the, the, this light waking life as dream. That doesn't mean. So if you read the book, don't think that you will understand everything right away. Don't think that you have to do everything. What it says you should do. Think about step by step. Take what you're getting and take what you can do. Do what you can do. Don't worry about what you cannot do. Right. That's true in life, right? Yes. A lot of times we worry about what we are not able to do. We don't enjoy what we have done. Yes. Yes. For sure. This is true. Yes. I mean, this is, I, I'm sorry to ask the question. I, but is this a kind of yoga that maybe you, did you hesitate to put this out into the world? Did you have a sense that maybe the world? Yeah. Additionally, usually they are more reserved. So, but nowadays, you know, I think how much you're going to keep them reserved. So I think I believe in it. We call it in our tradition, one of the tradition we say self-secret self-secret. Self-secret means I can keep secret from you, not talking to you, but I can also talk to you and I will ask my angels and guardians to keep it secret. Those who we need to be keep secret from. Wow. So I will not keep it any restricted, but it will keep restricted by itself. So, so when, when, when, when, the probably when, the moment even you want to say, Oh, I don't want to read it anymore. The book saying keep it secret from you. Oh, no, I really want to read it. You're saying, okay, retry it again. Okay. Maybe I'm ready now. Maybe I've been given a pass to revisit. Yeah. It wasn't, it was just, it was beautiful. It's just, you know, I had, I've, I don't know if you're familiar with Robert Monroe. This is the astral projection stuff. He is, you know, the, and all the other methods for inducing astral projection, which we mentioned, this is probably different from that. They usually involve reminding yourself, you're awake. So your method is the exact opposite of this in the sense that you're looking around and kind of reminding yourself. This is much like a dream too. That's the part where your angels are like, okay, don't read anymore. Awake. When we say awake, you are waking from what? You know, we awake from our sleep. We awake from our ignorance. We awake from our pain. You can be awake from anything. You can be awake from your sense of lost. When you found yourself, you are awakened. Awake means can mean many things. Yes. And here's my final question. Thank you for your time and thank you for your concise answers and thank you for this book. So why are we dreaming? Why is collectively, why is this happening to us? Why has it happened that you and me and everyone on the planet right now have woken from the bardo in a human body or an animal body? Why? What's going on here? Why is the universe expressing it like this, itself like this at all? Why does the emptiness turn into clouds? Yeah, I think there's probably two reasons, one basic reason. One basic reason is that we, you know, I think that just generally able to imagine, able to dream, able to have a vision is very important in our life, right? I was very stunned by when September 11, the investigation about thousands of pages. In the end, there was one conclusion word. It says Americans were not able to imagine that that could happen. So, you know, imagination, you need to imagine somebody might do it in this way. So we have to be ready for protect from this way. Imagination, right? So imagination, I think dreaming, imagination, visions are very important. But it's bigger than that. I think it's a dream sometimes happening, what we are not able to process in the day, it's happening coming up in the night. Nightmares, why nightmares come out? We're not able to work with that. That's why they show up. Why our problems? We're not able to process them. That's what they show up in our life. And what we are not able to accommodate, process and be from, they will not leave you. They will come up sooner or later. Thank you so much. Everybody, the links you need to find this book are going to be at dunkitrosil.com. Are you giving any upcoming, are you doing any tours?

Trussell, and you are listening to the Duggar Trussell Family, our podcast. This powerful voice that you're hearing, this deep, masculine voice that many people have compared to the clenching buttocks of Patrick Swayze and Dirty Dancing is at this very moment spinning down your ear canals into the pulsating canyons of your beautiful brain, where I hope it will flow like some kind of mystical river into the ocean of your mind, and hopefully give room for new fish and aquatic mammals to swim around in your subconscious, producing some kind of cool dream where you've got wings and thousands of dicks and vaginas and a million boobs that are all being simultaneously suckled by every person living on planet Earth. We're in strange times, it's true. I have been going through different moments of pretty profound catastrophic despair mixed in with joy and then mixed in with guilt for feeling any kind of joy and then mixed in with a kind of numb confusion. This is usually followed by eating too much pasta, gaining some weight and staring at my unmanned peloton, which we ordered early on in the pandemic, imagining that once that thing came, I would be galloping through peloton land. My pandemic fat melting away and being transformed into hard, powerful, beautiful muscles. So far, I've climbed on that peloton exactly one time. I've ridden for 20 minutes, it felt good, but every day that passes that I don't ride on that embarrassing exercise bike is a mark of shame. It's just they sit there, they mock you. They mock you like the albatross. So many of us wear our embarrassing pelotons like an albatross. We carry them around our necks and think to ourselves, my God, not only are we pigs, but we've chosen the vehicle of pigs and we're not even riding it. It just sits there like a shrine to our laziness, but I'm telling you this, I'm gonna be climbing on the peloton very soon. Within the next few weeks, I will climb on that thing and it will happen, I will ride the peloton like some kind of powerful, very expensive mechanical stallion into those sweet, sweet forests of health that I have always longed for. I wanna stand in front of the mirror and look at my 46-year-old body, not in its current form, which I'm trying to love using many of the techniques I've been taught by my teachers, but as some kind of rigid, rock-hard, beautiful, oily thing. I want people to gasp at the beach. I want people to think I'm on hormone replacement therapy. I want people to think that I've been bathing in testosterone. I want all the hair on my bald spot to grow back and to reverse age until I become some kind of powerful form. I wanna be worshiped. I wanna grow bigger than planet Earth and all the planets to start worshiping me and kissing my feet, and I wanna get even bigger than that until black holes are running away from me, and I finally break through some kind of soil that I didn't even know space was made of into the garden of some powerful wizard that plucks me up, throws me in a stew, annihilates me and sends me back into my human incarnation, where I find myself riding my peloton yet again and restarting the cycle of life as illustrated in the Egyptian Book of the Dead. We've got a great podcast for you. My friends, Eddie Pepitone is here with us. We're gonna jump right into that, but first, some quick business.

Welcome to the DuncanTrussell Family Hour podcast, the brilliant Eddie Pepitone. Music playing Welcome, welcome to you That you are with us Shake and glory to be blue Welcome to you Welcome, welcome to you Eddie, welcome to the DTFH. It's great to see you, man. I remember I went to see your one-person show. The one about the apocalypse. Do you remember that one? You did it at the UCB theater. It was so good. You remember that one? Oh, that was a bunch of years ago, right? Yeah, that was a bunch of years ago. But it was, you know, when you see a good show, it's like it sticks in your head forever. And that show is just so great. Really? You liked it a lot. Oh, I'm so happy. That makes me happy. But I think it's funny that now we're in your show. Yeah. I mean, this would, this easily, even though I don't even know back then if people even knew what Zoom was, but this could easily have been a sketch in your show, which is like to, this is where we're at now with stand-up comedy. I mean, it's, you can't do stand-up anymore. Do you think stand-up, what do you think the future of stand-up comedy looks like? I think it's going to take a while before it is back to what it was. You know, I think the benefit of this time is that it's showing us, and I think you've been ahead of the curve with this, but it's like showing us that we can use technology too, you know, a lot, and like bypass the suits in the studios, you know what I mean? Yeah. And put out stuff. And I think that's great. It's kind of what you did, huh? To like go to the point where now you're a Netflix sensation. Well, yeah, kind of. I mean, I, yeah, I had no, I had no choice because I, I couldn't do it any other way, man. I tried. Yeah. You know. So many people, yeah, yeah. It's great that you did it, man. Well, thank you. Yeah. Well, I, I agree with you as far as the, the pressure it's putting on creative people who used to, their life was performing in front of audiences. It has caused a lot of people to figure out what works and what doesn't work. And you know, even though I understand, because if you're a comedian, you're going to make fun of stuff that, you know, everyone's just bashing zoom standup comedy shows and who can blame them, you know, they're as depressing as depressed it could be. But still I like it because what it's doing is, is it's exploring how can we make it work? I agree with that, man. I agree with that. It's, it is at least an attempt to see, you know, what's going on, you know, it's, you know, what it feels like. It feels like with the zoom technology, it feels like we're all like game show hosts. Like our world has turned into, have you, have you noticed how this incredible self-consciousness in, in Western civilization, right, of cameras everywhere, cameras everywhere. I'm not even talking about the surveillance state. The surveillance state, of course, is massive. They want, you know, they, they're into everything, you know, our emails, our, our texts, everything. That's why Snowden is in Russia, right? Yes. But look at how self-conscious, you know, the cameras have made us like totally voyeuristic. You know what I mean? Like, like it's like we're obsessed with self. And that's the, that is the period I think we're coming out of. Like you want to talk about growth and like, I was talking about this with the comedian yesterday that people don't want to change and they don't want to grow. It's kind of the same thing. So the whole Zoom technology thing is about growth and we are growing from narcissistic, I think, into like realizing that we're all part of a whole. We're all part of a whole. We can't live without the ocean. You know, we can't live without the Amazon. We have to see nature as an, as an extension of us. We are nature. Right. Right. But yeah, I mean, this is, there was a time where I guess if you wanted to, you could imagine you were some kind of singular disconnected thing if you were rich enough or whatever, but isn't this the horror of the most wealthy people on the planet right now? Is it doesn't matter? It doesn't matter because you have to have a planet to enjoy your wealth. You have to have, there's no way you can enjoy being rich without some system which is bringing you food, some system which is making it so your employees don't die of a fire on the moon. They will be the last to die because of their wealth because they will be able to get the food that we will be able to get, you know? I mean, I want to say now that I hope by then I'm dead. I don't want to be part of these intense wars for food, you know, like I don't want to be part of a world that waits to ambush a Ralph's truck. You know? Yeah, right. Yeah, no. I mean, this, I think this thing that is happening to us right now, the reason... The pandemic? Well, not just the pandemic. I mean, the pandemic is part of it. The pandemic turned into a revolution against racism. Oh, right. I think the pandemic, by the way, is so part of what I was talking about as far as, you know, us being part of nature, you know, we're way overpopulated. Nobody talks about overpopulation. I don't know why, but there are no resources to go around anymore. And what I mean by that as far as the pandemic is that we keep knocking down nature's habitat. Right. You know, what is it? A hundred species of fucking day go extinct. Right. That's not hyperbole. Look that up. Right. You know? Yeah. Yeah, this is... Matter of fact, look that up the first thing when you get up in the morning. You just start your day. Honey, it's 125 species are gone. How about a nice coffee that we got? Because, you know, by the way, palm oil, don't buy palm oil. Really? You have to... Palm oil, man, they've gotten rid of the orangutans. Are you fucking kidding me? It's orangutans, right? Yes. Yes, orangutans now don't have a habitat. You know, land is being raised for plantations of palm oil, which is just hard. And it's in everything. It's in fucking cooking. I'm vegan, right? Yes. This stuff is in vegan cookies. You've got to look for palm oil and just know the palm oil because orangutans are basically now... I don't know. There's not that many left. Yeah, and also... It's a shame, man. They're gorgeous. Gorgeous. They are. They're such mystical creatures. Oh, yeah. And the pandemic, you know, this thing started either in a laboratory or it started just because animals were being treated with, you know, so horrifically that the... Right, the Chinese, you know, in this case, the Chinese, they, you know, they get these wild animals, right, that should not be making contact with us. They should have their own world to live in, but we keep knocking things down for consumption and overpopulation. So I just wish that there'd be some way to, you know, get the population down. I don't know how that would be. I guess things like the pandemic. I'm laughing. Well, I mean, it's so, no, but listen, what the thing, the thing that you're laughing at, first of all, I mean, come on, George Carlin's done many jokes on this sort of thing and a brilliant... And it's a true thing, though. I mean, you have to, one of the really, I think one of the things that people haven't been talking about too much, usually the way they say it is things like, look, the dolphins have come back or whatever. The dolphins are swimming in Venice now, but what they don't add to that is wherever humans can't go outside becomes incredibly beautiful. Wherever humans aren't, they don't say that because, you know, this is, because the problem is the moment you start saying things like that, then guess who you sound like? Charles Manson, because that was his, one of his main tenants. Like, you know, his religion continued, of course, if flourished, there was like a... By the way, you could play him. I mean, I think I'm going to write something for you, a Manson thing, because you have all of his qualities, except you're about love instead of hate, but you do command like a charismatic type of vibe. I take that as a compliment, man. I mean, look, Manson, let's face it, he's like, could have been a great performer if he hadn't. It's like, just like, isn't that crazy? It's true. It's like the same with, same with fucking Hitler. It's like, here you've got an artist, didn't, didn't get to be an artist, ended up doing. Manson was like, I mean, if Manson had had any kind of power, you know, he would have done something like a genocide. This is one of the things he talked about. He said, you know, the best thing you could do for the planet, if you really, really love the planet, the best thing you can do is kill yourself because I was like one of his final man, Manson, that was one of the things he said from prison is just like, if you really love it, just stop living because humanity itself is killing it and, and you know, this is true. It's so true. Yeah. It is so true. But then we're, you know where it gets very paradoxical is this. Here we are on this planet. We're loving our palm oil, vegan cookies. We're loving our plastic fucking bags. We're loving our cars. Right. And we made all that shit and the shit that we're making is destroying the planet. Similarly, the planet made humans. We came from the planet. The planet creates humans. Like Alan Watts says, the earth creates humans in the way an apple tree creates apples. The earth is peopeling. Right. So the earth, if you really want to point the finger, let's point the finger. At the fucking earth, because it's making us your honor, your honor, I call to the stand Gaia. Yeah, I who know Gaia, the entire earth. I call I call the entire earth to the stand. So what's it? How's it? How do you like being a planet? It's OK. You. So you as a plane, can I have a glass of water? Get the earth some water, the earth's water, particularly Southern California, Bob. So as the earth, would you say that everything living on you comes from you? Um. Yes, no comment. It's a simple answer. Well, yeah, no, I'll I'll I'll I'll I'll Yeah, yeah. But you know what? The earth is too articulate. He's like a mook from Brooklyn. Yeah. Well, but that is what you kind of run into is it's like, well, the earth made the people that killed the orangutans. So the earth made the people. So it made. Yeah. So the earth killed the orangutans in the sense that it allowed us to. Now, this is assigning intelligence to the planet, you know, which I actually kind of feels like it does. But you know what? I mean, it's just a it's a curious thing. You know, it's so it's so spooky. You know anything about like drakes? I think it's drakes. It's one of those astrophysics laws about why we haven't got contacted any aliens yet. What is that law? Well, the creepy law is that civilizations that get to where we're at. They either go dark because they see something in space and they realize like, holy shit, do not broadcast anything. They're going to kill us. What's out there will kill you. In other words, like an animal in the in the in the in the forest, it suddenly realizes there's a bear nearby it freezes. So it's either they get to a point where they are radars, pick up some fleet of carnivorous insect aliens that will just eat a planet or or probably more likely what happens is they get to where we're at right around this amount of time and they just kill themselves. By the way, that's kind of chilling. And it's also kind of mind blowing if this is indeed almost like a reincarnation thing where people keep, you know, life forms keep reincarnating and then go extinct when they reach this level of consumption. You know what I mean? I mean, yeah, yeah, I could see that. Yeah. Well, I mean, it's all of the but all of these analyses are so dismal. Do you do you see any what is the way? I mean, we're not going to do population. The only way the only way Duncan and Duncan's listeners is is what has been going on lately with the protests. And, you know, the protests have already led to some changes. And, you know, I go by the I go by the old adage if electoral politics worked, they wouldn't be legal. So the only way to change things is to do what is being done now, which is people really standing up against the quote unquote machine. That this, you know what I mean? And saying, no, we want this, you know, right? You have always they're going to have to do that. This is this is one of the I'm sure people who are familiar with you and people are watching your awesome Instagram show, which by the way, man, I'm so impressed with your discipline when it comes to doing that. You're doing that every day. I know. But you know, it's been good for me. It's it's like it's kind of given me something to do during the day. You know, you're a kid, right? You have a kid. Yeah, that which takes up a lot of time. But still, holy shit, man, congrats on the fact that you've been doing that. And it's really good when you're using Instagram, which is really cool, because it's like that a lot of people aren't doing that. So that's in the way you're doing it. You're innovating something with that show, which is pretty awesome, man. But but you you've always struck me as kind of like a revolutionary person. You've always struck me as somebody who would be one of the people out in the streets fighting. Yeah. With that I have been I have been, you know, I've been I went on many protests where I live in New York. Now, I don't want to go out. I'm 61. So I have to be careful, man, as far as like mingling with a lot of people. But I did go down to a protest right where I live. And I just walked down to it. And it was really great. Have you been to one? It was really great because people were just fucking communicating. Right. And and it wasn't nasty. It was like, this is what we want. This is what we deserve. You know, blah, blah, blah. Well, yeah, you know, I started. There is a great YouTube channel called Unicorn Riot. I don't know if you watch them, but really, they're so good. They just have really good like journalists who go to the end of the protest. Like when they were burning the police station down, they were inside the police station. Unicorn Riot was filming people. Yes, they were. Yeah. And that's insane. Well, we're unicorn by the way, when you tune into Unicorn Riot, you get the most in depth coverage. You do. There is a fire. We will be in it. Yeah, they were literally helping people climb over Rubble who were going in and out of the police station. Filming and also the the the journalist, they're really, really good. And the difference between them and like Fox News is they will they hand the mic to people. So they just will be in the middle of the protest and say, do you have anything you want to say? By the way, that has been really powerful to see. Yeah, just people speaking their hearts and minds. That's been amazing. Yeah. And I that that is my new gauge of journalism is are they giving the mic to other people or are they just are they interpreting? If you watch the major news networks, you know, the cable shit from Fox, MSNBC, CNN, they have the same people all the time, the experts, you know, and that edits all the fucking kind of same point of view. You know, sometimes there'll be some truth there. You know, it's an it's interpretation. It's an it's an interpretation with the intent to control. So yeah, they so you'll you know, when you hand the microphone to someone, it's so beautiful. You know, fireworks are going off next to this police station that is now burning to the ground that's, you know, within which these three murderous fucks were, you know, that was where they would go and drink coffee and take shits. And now there's like, you know what I mean? There's like fireworks going off. This thing is now smoldering. And and you you see them just hand the mic to people who are who are either many of the people were so overcome with emotion that they're just crying. Like they can't talk. They're so upset about what happened. You know, many people, you know, some people will try to talk and they would just start crying. You will not see that on Tucker Carlson. What you'll see on Fox News is an interpretation that these people are looting, villainous, monstrous. It's like it's like they are the bad guy. Yeah, they are the bad guys. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. I think what's great is that this is show me that and it's younger. It's younger people, which I really love because then it's like, OK, there is some hope, right? You know, because the computer world can be so isolating. And you know, even, you know, even though, you know, it's great to talk to people online or whatever, isn't the fucking same thing as being in person and and really communicating. So that's been really good to see. You know, they don't want they that this is to me. This is the sinister aspect of it, which is if you show people what's really happening when people get together in general, if you show them what's really happening like this jazz or whatever the fuck it is, the autonomous, it's apparently it's like a music festival out there right now. But if you show people that's what's happening, you know, you've got people playing music, you've got free food being handed out. You've got people giving speeches. You see you see people in their natural form. And it's almost like they don't want us to see that. What they want us to think is that those people have, you know, Fox actually Photoshopped this guy holding an assault rifle in front of a roadblock there as though like folks were getting militant there. When the truth is they took that one picture and added it to another to give the impression this is what's happening. Well, yeah, they're saying a warlord is running. Right. A warlord. No, I haven't heard it yet. But but I mean, you know, which is really funny that they would say a warlord is running it when the fucking president who is literally a warlord, he literally is. They need to say a different warlord or a new. A a wannabe warlord, unelected warlord. There is an unelected warlord running the the autonomous zone. The elected warlord doesn't want to give up his power. Yeah, man. I mean, that's have you ever seen in your whole life? Did you have you ever seen anything like this, man? Can you think of anything like this? No, no, because. Because things have gotten worse. Things have escalated to and here's my basic cannon is all of this stuff. Yes, racism, so intense, right? I think so much of it comes from economic injustice. And right now, the economic injustice going on in the United States, the fact that there, you know, you know, a few families own so much of the wealth and the rest of us are like, oh, my God, I'd better do Trussell's podcast today. You know, so I could keep promoting my brand or I'm going to be out in the streets. Right, right. You know, yeah, yeah. So we need to we need to fight for, you know, equality economically, you know, just start funding. You know, this whole call to defund the police is really a call to fund the people and in the L.A. They have a thing called the People's Budget. You can go to people'sbudgetla.com or something and, you know, see what they want to do. We want to redirect funds to people's needs, needs, you know, health care, mental health care, you know, education. And our education system is in shambles. Yep. It's a fucking shambles. You know, if you don't have all this money to go to a private school, you know, you're going into, you know, teachers have so many kids in the class and they don't get paid well. And also, what about like the thing that is really fascinating to me is that right now the government is doing a form of universal basic income. They're just giving money to people and people are able to live off this money. The implication being they could do this and they can do that. They have that much money that they can do it. You bet they can do it. And, you know, the first so-called stimulus where we got a $1,200 check, you know, they got a few trillion to their cronies, to their, you know, to this industry and that industry, IEO. You know what they've done before when they've gotten these huge stimulus, meaning giveaways is they've done things like buy back their own stock to raise their stock prices, you know. And they just get super rich. Right. And the super rich have basically turned the rest of the planet into serfs. We are serfs with Zoom. Which is dangerous. But that's dangerous. That's right. That's true because look at all the people coming out. I did it. We're exactly like this is the problem. This is the problem for anyone. Anyone. It's a horrible time to be horrible because you used to be able to freely be horrible. I mean, it wasn't that, you know, to the point where they had to talk about God, they had to say, listen, yeah, sure, no one's going to see you do that thing because you live in the middle of a forest. Oh, right. You know, but God is watching. But now it's a literal, what do they call it? There's a panopticon. We are. What's that? It's a name for constantly being monitored. So yeah, we're constantly being monitored. And unless, you know, on my Patreon, there is a wonderful person who does, she does, she protects computer security. And she was explaining to me how much they know about you. How you, if unless you're using not just a VPN, but unless you're using just a mini smart tactics, it is not that hard to gather from where you're going on the internet. Even if you're just a number, who you are, they know who you are and then where you're going. They could track you with cookies and they know what you like. So that means that somewhere in a file somewhere, if you haven't been protecting yourself on the internet is more than likely the data points necessary to show what kind of porn you like to look at, what kind of drugs you like to take, how you like to do, how you like to take care of your bodies when you dissolve them or whatever. Every single thing, it's all there waiting to be uncovered and it will be uncovered. And then when all that gets uncovered, we're all going to have to deal with like, oh, fuck, we all, that's the porn you. Oh my God, you're going to see the, what Trump looks at. You're going to see the sexual preferences of Lindsey Graham and Sean Hannity. It's all going to be out there, all going to be out there for better or for worse. And we're just seeing the very beginning of that right now, which is like, you know, the very beginning of it. And this is why surfs with cameras are really dangerous, you know, surfs with their devices that record all movement. You know, part of me really does worry about the future, man. Like it, it could be really, really dystopian. Like when, especially when I hear stuff like that, like, you know, the hacking of the internet, you know, I'm just waiting, you know, I don't know about you, but every day I go into my bank account, I'm just waiting for it to say zero because someone has gone in there and siphoned it. Yeah, or just, or just there's a run on the banks. I mean, I, you know, I, when, now I, what happens to me is like, I'm on the news, I'm on the news too much. So I get stoned. I go on the news. I'll go into a paranoid episode. That's bad, right? Yeah. Yeah. And so I was like, fuck, you know what? I'm going to take a bunch of money out of the bank. I'm going to take like a bunch of cash out of the bank. Yeah. Yeah, I sure did. I went and I took thousands and thousands of dollars out of the bank in cash. Now, what happened is I just went to the bank to get some cash out, not that much, but the person in front of me, all the ATMs in front of the bank, it stopped working. They were saying there was no more. Because the person in front of you took everything out? Just the ATM stopped working. It was actually a malfunction at the bank, but for a second, it looked exactly like every movie where there's a run on the banks. And this guy in front of me is saying to the teller, you know, all the ATMs say they're out of money, right? You know that, right? He's getting, he's intense with her. She's like, oh, well, one of them's working. He's like, no, actually, none of them are working. You know that, right? You know, none of them are working, right? She doesn't answer. So he's like, you know, I want to take a lot. I want to take all my cash out right now. And she's like acting weird, but they give it to him. And then I'm like, fuck, is this the beginning of a run on the banks? Then I got some money out way too much, way too much, way too much. But, you know, this is the thing. Like, you're never going to hear about when that's going to happen. But it can happen at any time. Anytime people, the serfs can just decide they want to take the money out of the bank. Anytime. There's not that much cash. They don't have it. You can't. It's not if we all go and try to take all our money out of the bank simultaneously. It fucks the economy severely. And you know, so that's one of the things I think about. I don't mean to be negative here, though. I think there's the potential for a dystopian future in the sense that we're all monitoring ourselves, George Orwell style, and where this becomes apocalyptic, is that you will notice how quickly morals, ethics, standards change. Like, look at the 80s. Any fucking romantic comedy in the 80s that dude is grappling with women. That was like just a common thing you'd see in the 80s. Stripes, I think, or, you know, Bill Murray grabbing some woman he wants to hump. She's like, no, tries to kiss her again. She's like, no, tries to kiss her. Yeah, I've been watching that. I've been watching stuff like that. Yeah. Yeah. And if that's what shit was like on movies in the 80s, god damn it, what was it like in the dating scene, right? And then boom, it changes, you know, over the course of what? 20 years, suddenly it's like everything changes. Why? Because of the cameras, because of the ability to record this shit. But this is the problem. In 20 more years, what are we doing right now? That in 20 more years is going to look like some fucked up shit. Eat, maybe eating meat. Maybe, you know, who knows what it could be. Maybe we just don't know. You know, maybe, I don't know, man, but that's where it could get really interesting. And then if the morals or ethics shift, what happens if they shift in six months? What if I know, you know, that what is so quickly and all the shit you did before is recorded? Here's my thing, you know, the need to need to movement is definitely something, you know, that comes out in reaction to too much abuse, right? Yes. And nobody ever fucking connects the military to this shit. I don't know why people aren't talking about that. What do you mean? The military, you know, mindset that kind of rules our country. You know, this whole, like, super macho, militaristic way of viewing the world. I don't know if you've ever seen a movie called Do Not Resist. And it's a doc about how police are trained. And it's amazing. You know, they train them as like, instead of looking at people as the people, you know, that you're actually serving and protecting their, the enemy, you know, and such a military state of mind. And the fact that we spend more than 50% of our gross domestic product on weapons of war, people, the planet with weapons. And I know this is kind of convoluted, but what I'm saying is that it's about domination. And it's a very hyper masculine thing that this whole military mindset transfers on to women, transfers on to the popular culture, you know, it's all about domination and, you know, not, not love, you know, fuck yet. I mean, just think the president tweeted something along the lines of the anarchists and punks that were getting in my way as I was going to that church. We cut through them like a knife through butter. It was easy. He, he, I mean, it's so, by the way, he makes me laugh. I don't know if that's a good thing to say, but it's fine to say that. He is hilarious to me when I'm when I'm not so fucking pissed at whatever it is. Yeah, I just find this guy to be, he is seriously good. He is such a buffoon. It is like, what is this? Think about this. You're talking about, you know, the deterioration and morals. What kind of country Alex, you know, bozo the clown, you know, what the fuck? Well, you know what, this is the thing I was thinking about the other day. It's like, okay, in sports, in sports, if somebody does too many fouls or breaks his leg or she like, you know, gets hurt, they put, they put them on the bench and that's just normal. You're like, okay, you got to go on the bench. You don't just have one person. You've got a bunch of people to replace that person. So the team does well. But the way we have this shit structured is one president and then a fake president called the vice president, but not like we should have five equally potent humans as the president. And then when one starts going crazy, which ours clearly has, you just put them on the bench. It should be known that this is, this is one thing that for some reason people want to acknowledge presidents, they go fucking crazy, man, not just Trump, but in general, they're going to go, you're going to go a little crazy if you have to be the symbolic representation of an entire nation of people. You see what happens to them. They all go gray and they get all withered and shit and they get like a weird look in their eye and they're all fucked up and they're all very concerned about their legacy. Yeah. Like, oh, I hope I remember. You know, it was a great documentary because I love documentaries like everybody, but the fog of war and McNamara, the former head of, I think it was department of the state department, you know, but it was, you know, all the military, it was the military stuff. And, you know, that is an incredible character study of a guy who's been involved in, you know, major decisions of life and death and he does not look good. He didn't look like he aged well. He's trying to do like a mea culpa, you know. Yeah. You look like if you're going to be president by the end of that run, you look like shit. You are fucking, there's just no other way. You just do. You see him. Oh, look at George. Look at George W. Now, like this guy, he's like a look at Clinton. Bill Clinton is like, he's like someone who's stared into an evil crystal. He's like, can't talk. He's all stammering shit, flying around with fucking Epstein. They're all like, addled from it. Oh my God. They're like, how about that pedophilia of like Jeffrey Epstein and what do you think about that? What do you think about that? All these powerful guys, you know, oh, I think they're just that's, that's the deterioration of morals. That's when society breaks down is when you don't respect kids. You don't respect women. You know what I mean? Yeah. You use them with your power. I mean, and animals too. That's a big thing that people don't talk about too. I mean, there's more of a vegan consciousness, but animals are, you know, the most powerless things and they need to be protected too. Man, I had the, there's a conversation that sticks in my head. I was in Hawaii having a conversation with just some random surfer guy at this bar and like he started bringing that up. He's like talking about like, and this is way before Epstein is honestly before I'd even become aware of this like institutionalized pedophilia thing among power structures. So like he started just saying that he's like, yeah, these, you know, these rich, these rich people, they're fucking kids and stuff, man. I'm like, what, like, what, why would, why would it, like if you were wealthy, would you ever want to fuck a kid? I mean, why would you want to, his response was, well, well, because they're innocent, because they're, they're pure and they want to hurt. They want to hurt pure things. They, they want to hurt the earth. They want to hurt the, and that was, that's the part that nobody wants to think about. All right. Well, you're, you're not, you're not the kind of hippie I am, but I would think of you as something of a hippie and not in the way, not in the like, negging us way, but in just in the sense of like, we do think about love. We throw around the word love a lot and we, we, I think, I don't know about you, but I, in fact, it's a good question. I have the idea that humans are fundamentally good underneath all the ego shit that underneath it all. I think so too. Okay. That's, that's what I'm saying. Both of us agree there. Well, this guy's premise, it's fucked up because his premise is like, oh no, actually no, there's, there are people who believe that, but they're wrong because some people, they, it's not just like they accidentally spill oil in the ocean or it's not like they accidentally bring an oil line across the Appalachian trail or across sacred Indian ground because that's the only place to run the oil line. It's that they run the oil line there because they want it to break. They want it to kill the earth. Oh my God. It's so, it sounds crazy. Man, it's called flying. Flying talked about the destructive impulse. She said, man, he said, man has the creative and the destructive impulse. You know, and yeah, I mean, a guy I read Chris Hedges, he was saying that this, what we're doing to the earth, you know, what we're doing to our water, you know, what we, what we do in this fucking capitalist system where people are basically just put into a machine and ground out. When you read about, you know, how they work, Amazon workers in these warehouses, they're policed by these robots. Do you know that? No. But anyway, he, wait, no, wait, I'm sorry. Tell me about these robots. I haven't heard this. Hey, hey, listen, I am not legally allowed to talk about the Amazon robot. I signed a non-disclamer. Leak it. Yeah. No, what I've read is that they have, like they monitor you. First of all, like you have to work a certain amount of time without going to the bathroom and shit like that. I mean, it's crazy. And, and these robots come and they kind of, if they see someone wandering around, they will like guide their movements. It's something like that. I don't want to, I don't want to say things that aren't true, but that is they do police Amazon work. Hello, Larry. I noticed you were, hi, Larry. I noticed you're 30 feet away from your department. Do you need help getting back? Let me guide you. I'm going to attach a tether to your neck. No, no, no. I just want to walk. I just, I need to walk. I have a muscle strain and the robot goes, Larry, don't make me say it again. And then a laser, a red laser goes on Larry's forehead. Larry, you have, you have vitamins to pack and deliver. Larry. Larry, you're part of the Amazon team now, Larry. Yeah. We need to send these vitamins. Larry, I want to show you something. This is live, this is a live feed from the nanny cam in your child's room. Oh, look, look how peacefully your daughter sleeping would be a shame if a siren went off. And there, you know, that is, that is crazy to imagine that that's what's happening. But yeah, that is what's happening in the Amazon warehouses. Fucking Bezos is like, essentially, like he's, he's running the show at this point, right? Like he is the emperor that no one calls the emperor. And by the way, Amazon didn't pay taxes last year. I don't understand that. How did, how is that possible? I don't even, I can't wrap my head around that. How do you do that? And, and, and that's why people should always be in the streets until that shit changes. But what I, the other thought I wanted to finish was that we, we live in a culture of death, you know, talking about that destructive and creative impulse. And, and it's too much about death, you know, the death merchants, the death merchants are winning like the amount of money that we put into weapons. Again, nobody talks about the militaristic, about the, about the military point of view, you know, the Pentagon and, you know, the control of resources and the weaponry that that takes. And also, you know, when we bomb Iraq, when we bomb Afghanistan, when we make the weapons for the Soviets to bomb Yemen and create all this, you know, despair, when we bomb, then we're policing the poor. So then we overseas and we're going to police them the same way here. And that's what's happening. That's what's happening. You know, the brute force is militaristic, you know. Right. And then that's what happens. Hyper masculinity. Hyper masculinity. Well, you know, actually, this is stuff that I've thought about regarding that idea of hyper. I don't think you talk about that because that's something a lot of people don't want to talk about, I think it's like kind of taboo, you know, because everybody else supports the troops. And I want, you know, I support. Yeah, I think the troops are, you know, should be supported, but not in support of these. Well, my dad was a troop. My dad had PTSD. My dad had PTSD. His back was fucked up for his whole life. He didn't get any help from the VA. What was it? What war? Vietnam. Two tours. Wow. Yeah. Two tours in Vietnam in the Navy. And so I like I. Some of the most radical guys come out of the war, veterans. They're the best. Those guys, you know, the left veterans who were against war because they fucking went through it. Yeah, that's exactly right. Most anyone who hasn't completely lost their mind, who's been there, they're usually are. So if you support the troops, you should support no war. And also you should support the VA. Like we, we kick the. So what happens with that is you, so you get these kids who are super poor. I know my dad was. They want to get the fuck out of their little town. And, and, you know, this, of course, there's like 48% of the military or African American people. And a lot of those people come from the inner cities and stuff because they advertise this shit as like, this is a way that you can get a college education. And so you, you're out of options. You go and talk to some recruiters. You end up getting your fucking head shape. And my dad, that's one of the creepiest things he said is like, the first night he was in Vietnam laying in his tent, wet. It's raining. He's in the jungle. You can hear bullets. You can hear bombs. And he's shaking and just thinking, what the fuck have I done? What the fuck have I done? What the fuck have I done? And like, you know, because by the time you're there, you're, you're fucked, right? So then they come back after all that time. Yeah. Not to mention like all the other shit that happens. I had a friend who was in the Navy. They just give you pills, man. Like on the ship, he was on this aircraft carrier. They just give you medicine to take and some of that shit is expired. Yeah. Yeah. You, they own you. They own your body. So you're taking like weird medications and shit and like, yeah, man. I mean, it's like just look at some of the people coming back from Desert Storm. They had that, I can't remember what the name it was, a syndrome, where they were like shaking and they were all fucked up from the nerve agents and stuff. But it went into happening is they don't get taken care of. So they come back here. They have got PTSD because they saw their friend or they, they chain gun somebody or a bunch of people or they killed kids or they're part of an operation that's incinerated kids. They come back here. They're living in a nightmarish hell and then they give them benzos. So they start taking these benzos or they start taking these weird sedatives. And then, but, but, but basically to get to your hyper masculinity point, I don't know that masculinity is the right word for it. I think our culture is so fucked up that masculinity and the symptoms of PTSD have become synonymous because the country's been at war for 93% of its history. So if you look at John Wayne, that is how a person with PTSD acts. They don't tell you when they're hurting. They don't tell you when they feel the real, you know, the real soldiers hated John Wayne. He used to come visit soldiers in hospitals and Wayne never fought. You know, John Wayne never fought the war. And, you know, these guys would come back with, yeah, major injuries and they'd be like, come on, spare me the fucking, you know, the Hollywood bullshit. Yeah. Yeah. But that is that. But what do you say? What are you saying about people have PTSD? Some of the symptoms are, they're not going to tell you that they hurt. One of the symptoms is they don't report that they're feeling bad like normal people do. They think it's weak to express pain. They don't. Yeah. Yeah. So you get this like in the real, the reason they don't want to do that is because they're trying to like avoid the trauma. They're trying to avoid triggering themselves as much as possible. So you end up with this hyper isolated person who's having suicidal ideations and trying to mitigate the anxiety with booze and cigarettes. Now, all of a sudden you have the what is that like sort of like the callous hero figure, but that's not a callous hero. That's a person who has fucking like a horrible mental disorder and is doing everything they can to not scream, which comes across as this kind of like tough. And then we say, oh, all I see what you say is then we say, oh, that's masculinity. That's not masculinity is like cutting off your fucking humanity. That's not masculinity. Even though I do get very masculine when I work out, I'm very, I start to work out in a gym and I and I start to say to myself, maybe I can conquer a country. Maybe if I get together a few of the guys, we can go into Peru. Let's do it. Let's take it. Let's take it. But my new special, my new special is coming out and it deals with a lot of this stuff. You talk about hypermasculine. What's the name of your specialty? It's called for the masses for the mass coming out. Yeah, it's coming out June 23rd on Amazon and iTunes and Google Play and a couple of the platforms. When did you shoot it? I shot it February of 2019. It's taken a year and a half to finally launch. Oh, cool. When you when you saw all this shit going down and you realize like all this crazy shit has happened. Do you feel do you feel like you covered in your special just accidentally like you addressed? I wish I would have covered pandemics. I didn't see the I mean I knew about I knew about you know pandemics for sure. But I didn't you know like I think most people I didn't see it coming. Well, yeah, I know man. I mean, I think this is kind of the red flag, by the way, big red flag. He didn't know about it. He didn't predict the pandemic. I don't trust him. But here's the thing. This is what I think so is one of the telling aspects of the time we're in. Forget a special a year ago. I recorded a podcast four weeks ago that I haven't put out yet. It's really good. I really like it. But I haven't put it out yet. But in that month period, five week period, look what's fucking happened. So when I put that podcast out, it's going to seem weird that I wasn't addressing what's happening. I'm going to have to say in the beginning this came out five weeks ago. But shit is changing so fast now. Do you know what I'm saying? That things are becoming like you you you're special. I think that what's the reason it's going to seem relevant is because you you might not have predicted the pandemic, but you were at the UCB. Like I said in the beginning of this conversation, doing a one person show about the apocalypse. You you were in a people were wondering why I was being a downer. Yeah, exactly. So I feel like you're, by the way, yeah, people don't get me who think I'm, you know, depressed and negative. Like underneath all my like scathing criticism of what's going on, I'm just trying to get a better world out of it. You know what I mean? It's like, and I feel like you need to put this shit in front of people's noses because most people are dead asleep, just consuming, you know, just kind of living in fantasy. Yeah, numb, numb down. They're in fantasy. Yeah, that's right. And then people in fantasy is an annoying thing. If you're enjoying some wonderful fantasy, even if the fantasy is one that's going to end when someone comes around saying, listen, I'm telling you, you've got to fucking listen to me. There's the fire is coming. You're going to run. It's just where you're living right now. This is one of the things Terrence McKinnon said. He's like, many people, they say it's not the end of the world, but actually it's just that the apocalypse hasn't gotten to where you're at yet. It's happening. It's all over the planet. This shit has been the end of the world in Syria for a long time. It's been the end of the world in Iraq for a long time. It's been the end of the world in Afghanistan for a long time. People in Afghanistan, they're probably looking at Americans right now like, well, yeah, oh, is this rough on you? I'm sure they're happy about it. I'm sure they're like, oh, good, you know, your fuckers are suffering, you know. When you, so how, when you shoot your specials, Eddie, how, what, what does the process look like after the fact? Like, did you shoot more than one night? How did it work shooting this thing for Amazon? And also, did you like work a deal out with them after you made the special or before? After. Wow, cool. That's powerful. After the special was produced by a company for me called 800 pound, pound gorilla, Steve Fine Arts directed it. And yeah, we shot it. We shot two shows in one night. That's what we did. Cool. My last special in ruins, that was a necklace thing. That was shot two days, like two consecutive nights. Like I did one on Friday, one on Saturday. But this, I just did two shows in one night. And I think I like to do the two shows in one night better. How did you, how did you, I mean, what did, I'm just, this is probably the, quite a boring thing to talk about a comedy special. But as a comic, I'm always curious about this. Like, how did you manage the crowds? How did you, did like, who took the production company took care of all that shit? You didn't really have to worry about it or? Oh, you mean, what? You mean getting people for the show? Yeah, you know, like, yeah, you did, I don't remember seeing any announcement of it or anything like that that you were doing a special. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think I was, I think I did, you know, put it all over social media and then I'm sure they did as well. Did you have any moments? It was great crowd. When you were shooting it, did you have moments where you had to stop? Because of tech stuff or you realized you'd fucked up? Only, I, no, no, not really. I just went and, and, you know, Steve knows that that's when I'm at my best, when I'm just kind of going, going, going, and after the two shows, we did some pick-ups at the end. There were just a couple of stupid little things. I got you. You know, nothing major. So when you are editing, editing this thing, this is something I always wonder about and you do cut to a crowd reaction. Do you have any? I don't do the editing. You didn't edit it at all. No, no, no, no. So you just let them do it. I don't get involved. Wow. Yeah, well, yeah, yeah, I trust Steve to do it. That's so fucking cool, man. This is, I mean. Because I don't know, dude. I don't, I think you need someone who's not that close. You know, I'm too close to it. Like I looked at it and for the first couple of times I look at it, I go, God, I'm bold. Yeah, yeah, I would. Dude, that's, I'm telling you, there's, I'm not saying this is the reason, isn't the reason I haven't done this special. There's lots of reasons. But one reason when I think about doing a special that I cringe is that, is my fantasy is you sit in the fucking editing bay for months watching your, your set over and over. And I would, that sounds like hell on earth. You think that's necessary? I don't know. No, this is just in my head. You know, one of those things you just assume that's what comics do. That's so cool that you, I know what you're saying is beautiful, man. I think you're right. That is the way to do it. Like of all the people who shouldn't be in charge of that edit, it's the comedian, if you ask me. I don't know. I mean, I guess some comedians would agree with you for sure to, that they want to do the editing, but I know I'm saying no at it. Because I feel like it's all, you know, and this has kind of been something I think that has probably fucked up my career a little, is that I think it's all about the moment. I think, I think performing is all about, I mean, the live performing is all about the moment. And that's magical. And then, you know, so to me, you know, reliving it over and over again on film or whatever is not, is not what it's about for me. Fuck yeah, man. And you, I'll tell you, man, there's a lot of comics that I'm, I love. But sometimes when I think about the comics I love, and then I try to really recall their work, I can't. But you, man, I remember your stuff. I remember, yeah, yeah, because you, because you, because it's not, it's like, you really put on a show, Eddie, like, and by that, I mean like. So do you, by the way. Yeah, thank you, man. But I remember when like, you know, I remember when I was a kid and my stepdad took me to see Les Miserables. And I remember sitting there and you don't, in a good show, you don't just remember the performance. You remember the whole fucking thing. The room. That was a great show, right? What, Les Miserables? Yeah. Master of the House. Master of the House. I just got into, I have never watched Les Miserables in my life. It's stupid. Me, my wife, just got into it. Master of the House. Les Miserables is like, on one level, it's great. And I don't mean to offend anybody. And for people who are fucking Les Miserables fans, they're going to get mad when I say this. I bet I could out sing, I know every song by heart. But if you really look at that story, it's the stupidest. Jean Valjean. Oh my God. It's such a dumb story, Eddie. It's like, think about it. It's like, do you know the story? The story is she falls in love with this dude overnight. And then all of a sudden they get married the next day. And then the guy's carrying him out of the, the whole thing is ridiculous. Well, you know, that's the musical. The musical world is, is pretty much like that, right? Like, I want to do a musical that's horrifically tragic. Yes. You know, like, and people have to sing about it in an upbeat way. You know, like, there's no more water. There's no more birds. But I got you. Eddie Pepitone. God bless you, man. Tell people where they can find you and tell people where they can find your special. What last time? Yes. Go to eddiepepitone.com.

Number one, the spirit of witchcraft. The spirit of witchcraft. Number two, the human beings that are possessed to practice witchcraft. Number two, the human beings, the human agents, possessed of the devil to practice witchcraft. The verdict, shocking. The sentence, even more so. A Saudi woman beheaded for crime, practicing witchcraft. An elderly man executed by ISIS for allegedly performing witchcraft. The Daily Mail reporting that militants fighting for the Islamic State of Syria beheaded the man in broad daylight while a large crowd looked on. That's the 22% of 18 very short-passed description, says, thou shalt not suffer a witch to live. Very simple, very direct command from God. His name is Godzwill, and he's been beaten and abandoned, cast out by his own family and society at large, accused of being a witch, no matter that he's a five-year-old boy. Hello friends, it is I, Duncan Trussell, and you are listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour Podcast, and today's episode is about witchcraft. We exist at one of the most incredible times in all of human history. Every day some brand new invention comes out of nowhere with the potential to transform society from the new Microsoft HoloLens that will allow us to see holographic projected images on all surfaces to the Vajankul, a plastic foot with a vagina in the ankle. We exist in a time so incredible that it won't be long before you'll be able to put on your HoloLens and gaze out, not at your living room, but at the alien landscape of Mars while making love to a plastic foot. Yet in this age of incredible technological advancement and novelty, people are still burning witches. That is a mind-blower. Witchcraft is one of the most misunderstood and marginalized spiritual traditions on planet earth. It's so marginalized that when people incinerate witches, which is a form of hate crime, it barely makes the news. So that's an astounding thing to me, and I think you'll find it even more astounding and even more tragic. Are you here today's interview with Maja Daou, the white witch of Los Angeles? We're going to dive right into this interview, but first, some quick business. This episode of the Duncan Trestle Family Hour podcast is brought to you by Squarespace.com.

For those of you who haven't, I beg you to journey through the Amazon portal located in the comments section of any of the podcasts at DuncanTrussell.com. The next time you're going to buy something, and I would highly recommend, as always, buying a bidet, feel what it's like to have a little piece of the Garden of Eden in your asshole. That's what a bidet does, and it's a life changer. Set it before there's a few ways you can change your life, and all of these, there's a few quick ways that you can change your life, and all of these can be done through Amazon. Number one, throw away all your old socks and replace them with brand new socks. I got that from reddit.com. I tried it. It truly works. Number two, go to Amazon and get a bidet. Install that thing. It'll make you feel self-sufficient, at least for someone like me. It made me feel like I was Davey Crockett, the plumber version of Davey Crockett. Just a self-sufficient man of the land screwing a white bidet into his toilet. Then the other thing that it makes you feel like is the pope, because when you're walking through your day after having a vigorous anal water bath, and you're surrounded by these pigs who just use toilet paper, you will feel so superior that you will begin to radiate a dark, charismatic aura very similar to that put out by some of the world leaders that are running the show today. Why do they put that aura out? Why do you think Obama is so charismatic? Why do you think Putin holds such sway over Russia? Do you think it's because of some magical potency inside of them? No. It's because they have nice bidets. It's the secret of the Illuminati. Go through our Amazon portal, pick up a bidet. You can even post stories about your bidet experience by going to the forum at DuncanTrussell.com. Your bidet stories will be most welcome there. Okay, that's it. Oh yeah, not it. We've got tours coming up. You can go to DuncanTrussell.com, see all the approaching dates. We already sold out a show in Brooklyn, which is happening in April, but I will be posting new ticket links tomorrow. Go to DuncanTrussell.com. You can see all the upcoming Midwest tour dates, Winnipeg, St. Paul, Madison, Chicago, Columbus. I'm going to be in all of those spots at the beginning of March, and I hope to see you there. Okay, let's get going with this podcast. Today's guest is Majida Oo. She is the white witch of Los Angeles. You can go to her website, GodIsMyBoyfriend.com, and find out everything you need to know, not just about the spiritual practice of witchcraft, but a lot of other stuff. She teaches classes in the Los Angeles area, and you can find out about that too. So now, everybody, please welcome to the DuncanTrussell Family Hour podcast, the white witch of Los Angeles, Majida Oo. It's the DuncanTrussell Family Hour podcast. Majida Oo, the white witch. You are here on the DuncanTrussell Family Hour podcast. I'm very excited. You have written in the forward of one of my favorite books of all time, which is Ron Regi's incredible book. And not only that, but you're kind of legendary around Los Angeles. This is one of the great spiritual teachers here, and you have impacted a lot of people who I respect, so it's really exciting to have you here. Thank you for coming over. Aw, thank you so much, Duncan. That's my pleasure. Cool. You know, I wanted to start with this question for you, because a lot of people, when they hear the term witch, they get weirded out. Totally. Why in a world where every single religion, almost every single religion, is actively involved in killing people, why does the term witch or witchcraft have such negative connotations? It's pretty crazy, isn't it, Duncan? It's in a world where it's acceptable to have discussions about children bombed in Syria, it's still somehow inappropriate to mention witchcraft, which I find, like you just mentioned, fairly shocking. And I feel, for me, my kind of take on it is that pretty much anything that maintains a taboo, people enjoy getting into that melodrama, it's like some circle of melodrama that has taboo. That includes homosexuality. You could easily argue, how is it that people are still shocked or like have some aversion to homosexuality? It's literally ridiculous. So for me, it's ironic because the word witch actually just means someone who knows stuff, who is like, wants to go find stuff out. It's literally wise one, or someone who wants to know, like knowing, or how we can get closer to knowing. So the fact that it's a board in this very ignorant fashion is pretty interesting to me. So I enjoy very much using the word witch, if for nothing else, just to test people's reaction to the word, to see how much of their subconscious is just going to flash out a fear or a judgment, which I then enjoy getting into and kind of addressing. It also works because technically I do feel like I do all of those things that are affiliated with the term witch, which is basically trying to know stuff that is hard to know. So it's a witchcraft is, what religion would you compare it to? Is there a comparison to Buddhism, to Christianity? What is, I understand Buddhism, I don't understand much about witchcraft, I understand Christianity. How can I understand what witchcraft is with another religion as a comparison? Totally, totally. Well, if you go into the histories of religion, sooner or later they all get back to some form of paganism or indigenous cultural shamanism or something to that effect, if you go back far enough in any timeline. So witchcraft traditionally is affiliated with pagans, but what's a pagan, right? If we look at the word pagan, it's a word the Romans used for anyone who wasn't Christian. That's a pretty large amount of ideas and philosophies that exist outside Christianity. So technically it's kind of anyone who's not kind of down with Jesus, but in what I kind of research, it includes aspects of all religions, it's kind of this meaty underbelly of the techniques and kind of skeletal system that all the religions then build upon, if that makes sense. Wow, that is so cool. Yeah. Now that's fascinating. What does the term pagan literally translate to? I think it's one from the hills or someone who's literally outside of the regular group of people, because the pagans in Rome would all kind of be like the Druids, they would be out in the forest in the woods. So it kind of was similar to outsider. Right. Yeah. Now, there's a verse when you mention Christianity, there's actually a scripture that comes to mind, which is so sinister, which is, thou shalt not suffer a witch to live. Yes. They, you guys, like something went down, like they were pissed at you, like, and they were killing you. Correct. There was a genocide. There was a literal genocide. It continues, P.S. Do you know how many witches were burned in Africa alone last year? No. Like a lot. There was one that was terrible. I think it was in New Guinea, and she was a mom. She had a kid and she was burned alive in front of, on a pile of tires in front of the entire village. This was like a year ago, February, if you Google it. Oh my God. So it's still occurring. It's not just history. So I always like to point that out too. So even to this day, members of this religion are being incinerated in the name of God. Correct. And the press that comes from that is almost nothing. Yeah. In Africa, they started incinerating Jews. You better believe there would be, you would probably invade. There would probably be an invasion. But because they're burning witches, it's just a kind of novelty story. It's something that's going to land a few paragraphs underneath the big headlines. That's fascinating. It's a big fear, obviously. I mean, you can look at it and try and analyze and say, why would someone do that? When this was performed, the woman who got burned, it was by a priest, by a local priest who said she was, and who knows what the reason really was. Maybe he just thought she was pretty. He couldn't handle it. Who knows what motivates those kind of gnarly judgments. It doesn't even matter that he was a Christian priest. You could take your pick of anything, anywhere. It's just ultimately a dumb paradigm of a dumb-dumb. They just kind of like, oh, she's got to go. So they just burn them, and it's kind of, if you go through the history of the development of psychiatry and psychology, all of the kind of decreeing a mental illness or a dissident, it's always dissidents or some kind of de-factor, the outsider, something that disagrees with what you're saying. That seems to be, it's just some kind of dissenter or heretic. Which basically means someone who doesn't agree with what you're saying. Right. Oh my God, that's wild. So here you have a religion that's based on the DNA that gave birth to all other religions, the deepest, the oldest religion. So in fact, isn't it kind of a mystery where it originally- Nobody knows. If you look at the stories, it always goes back to some creatures from the sky, right? Brought it down. Or literally, if you want to get really into it, in the Egyptian sources, it's literally women who have sex with extra terrestrial beings, and then that's where we get the knowledge, according to those old scriptures. Wow. Which is the Bible too, like look at the story of Jesus, there's some extra terrestrial being named the Holy Spirit comes down and pregnates Mary, and then this like, scripture is born. But that's the same story in all the stories. This is the, what are they called, the Nephilim. Right. And that verse is something like the sons of God were with the daughters of men. Yeah, it's in Genesis. It's in Genesis 6-1 or something, right, totally. So do you believe that, that this religion comes from some kind of extra terrestrial contact? I just like to find out about it. I don't know what I believe, but I just research as much as I can, and you'll find the names they use for these beings, right, it varies from like angels to demons to aliens to extra terrestrials to multi-dimensional beings, right, if you start going into the Burning Man crowd, they develop all these identities like they're Arcturian or they're like Pleiadian or they actually have identified locations that these beings have like arrived from. Do I believe any of those? I don't know if it's necessary to believe it. I don't think that's necessary. I think what we can do is to say, hey, yeah, it's weird that we human beings seem to be somehow different than a lot of other things on this planet Earth, right, even though we're also very much alike at the same time, even like sharing DNA with pigs and chimpanzees and stuff like that. And yet we can do things that they can't do. So there is this weird thing. So you have to say, what is it something that's from here in us that makes us do that? Or is it something from somewhere else? So I think it kind of comes down to that question. So is it possible that it's from somewhere else? I think it's sure. Why not? How could it not be? Right. And you know, you get into the notion of what I think it's called panspermia. Yeah, totally. The fungus. The fungus. The fungus among us. The fungus among us. You know, they've shown that, do you remember, they found some form of algae on the International Space Station. Yeah. And they, it's living in space. And so the. It was alive still. Alive still. It's up there living. And that, you know, the one explanation was that the earth is kind of exhaling this stuff into the universe. Like a fart or something. Like a fart. So the earth is like breathing, even in the, you know, it's a rather, probably a fairly hopeless endeavor to send your life out into space, but the earth has always been such an optimist that she's still like, let's just give it a shot. And it worked. It lived on the space station. So the, that idea is, to me, always seemed kind of ridiculous, which is that some form of life was on a meteor and it hit the earth. And then that was the seed. I do believe that there are, I think that we use the language of the highest technology that we have to refer to these beings always. So let's make metaphors for them, but we only have what we can compare them to. Whatever. Right. To describe them. So now it's interdimensional beings. It used to be angels, but it's clearly, the muse was another name for these things. Sure. The daemon, right? Yeah. Alistair Crowley calls it the HGA. You can find so many names for it in every single culture. And that's what's interesting to me is not like, do I believe in this? It's like, oh my God, why is every single person throughout the history of the world talking about that? Right. That's weird. Including Tesla and a great many inventors. Absolutely. Now, how much of witchcraft is about making contact with these beings? Well, I mean, honestly, the first thing that you do in a lot of traditional Wicca practices, although for me, I kind of use a potpourri of a lot of different things like Taoism and alchemy that I integrate, as opposed to just like, you know, a lot of people think of Wicca and they think of like a black and purple velvet, gothy store and, you know, making pentagrams and stuff like that. So yes, it's that and more kind of, I think people's view of what that entails is a little limited to like candles and boobs and skulls. So I like to point out that it's also a little bit further and more extended from there. So it can include a lot of other things, not just kind of casting spells on things, you know, and stuff like that. But one of the first things you do, even if you're only doing Wicca, is you learn to draw down the moon, which is literally taking in a celestial force into your own body. So you kind of start out, like inviting that energy to come into your form. And this is the first, you say this is one of the first things. Correct. It's called drawing down the moon. And if you get any like Teen Witch book, any like Pagan book from the library, they'll have some kind of description of methods and techniques to do that. What is the energy of the moon? What does that give you? Or what is? Oh, you can feel it. Good thing. I don't even have to tell you. If you go on a full moon, here's what you do. When the moon is full, lock your gaze with it. Don't blink. Just stare at it for as long as you can without moving, without, you know, faltering your will. And when you look at something, it's like eating it a little bit. Like if you look at something, you're like, it's a sensory thing. You're like getting it all over you to feel it. So it's not even like you can describe it's an experience. So you just, that you just have to do with your eyeballs by eating the moon. Wow. Oh my God. That's so cool. Yeah. You know the story of Hanuman? Oh yeah, totally monkey guy. And you know, he got in trouble when he was a little monkey. Right. You know that story? He got in trouble all the time. He was always getting in trouble. Which one? So little Hanuman thought the moon was a piece of fruit and so he tried to eat it and I think he might have succeeded. I don't know if they made him throw it back up again. I don't remember. Maybe he took a bite out of it or you know, who knows, but I think he little baby for those of you who don't know Hanuman is this amazing monkey God. Just look it up. Look up the, listen to the Hanuman Chalisa and you can hear this spirit of friendship I think. Yeah. But yeah. So Hanuman eats the moon and then as the punishment for eating the moon, his punishment was you will be able to do anything that, forgive me you guys out there if I'm butchering this, you'll be able to do anything that you want. You can do anything that you want, but you will never remember that you can do anything that you want. So true. Isn't that cool? So good. Yeah. That's so good because when you go into those, or when I have, I don't know if other people have experienced this too, so I can only speak for myself, when you go into altered states like that, where it's there, you literally feel like you know everything, like you can get access to every single thing. You feel omnipotent. Yes. But then when you come back into, you know, whatever the conglomeration that is your meat suit, you're like, oh wait, now I got all this stuff and you like bump yourself into a table and you're like, wait, I can't do stuff. Yeah. So you do, you directly forget. You directly forget. And then I guess the songer, the community is, those are the, we're all trying to remind each other as much as possible. Yes. Like just remember, it's a dream. I think we can do anything that we want. It's like we're all trying to nudge each other. Like, come on, come on, let's just do like some awesome stuff. Yeah, it makes me think of, you know, because there are these like new age terms, one of them being the awakening and the, it makes me think of what would happen on a spaceship if all of a sudden those isolation pods started opening up and people started clambering out after a long, long time in space, you really might have a few days or hours of being like, wait, what are we doing again? I feel like that happens to me every day. Yeah, me too. But you have a community around you. You have a community. You have a class that you teach, but you have a real living community around you and you're their teacher. Can you? Well, they teach me too. Like that's a thing I always like to point out. I feel like my community, I like to call them an army of generals, not an army of soldiers because everyone's awesome. So it's more like, and one of the things that anyone who's taught anything knows, and even you and your podcast know, as soon as you have to teach something, first thing you have to do is know about it, right? So teaching is a really good way to learn. And then I get to have this exchange with all these amazing people who just like to think for themselves. They're people who can think thoughts that are their own instead of infiltrated by television or advertising or, you know, the melodrama that is existence. They can actually pop out of that for a second and think about other stuff. Right. Yeah. But that's, you know, and that's one, all the great teachers will, that's almost the first thing that they say. It's like, it's almost the forward that you feel like, oh, I must say this. To be sure that I don't seem like I think I know everything. Oh, I have evidence that I don't know a lot of things. I know. I know. When you came over, you know, I've got this on my wall, I have a poster, which is this Alistair. Do you know the name of that poster? It's an Alistair Crowley poster. It's some kind of depiction of the Kabbalah. It's got the tree of life of the tree of life. And Maja immediately started breaking down the numerics on the thing in a way that I've never seen anyone do before. So you're, you, I mean, you, you do know a lot about this stuff. You have been studying this for your whole life. It's been a long time. Yeah. And I'm so, uh, I get real tenacious about it. So I'll track stuff down. Like one of the things I do, if I find out about something, I got to know, where did this come from? Where has it ever been? Other places? Like I do like a whole Nancy Drew trip with it, where I think some people will find information and they'll kind of think like, oh, that's cool or whatever. But I'm like, who thought of that? Like, how does this come in? So I get real OCD about it. You follow the roots as far down as you can go. Yes. Totally. And, um, this, when did this start for you, the, this discipline or the practice? In turn, I mean, for the reading, I'm such a big nerd. Like in terms of research, I just always was a big nerd, even as a little kid. Instead of hanging out playing, I was kind of fat. So I just go to the library and read all the time, um, which was its own blessing in a way. I was able to, you know, inhale all these books, but so it's been a, ever since I was little, I've had like around two, I had a near death experience because I was really sick and then again at seven. So I would feel things. I was like, this is weird. This is not like what everybody says is happening. So then I just had to investigate it on my own. What were these experiences? What happened with when I was two, I was sick in bed and my mother was sleeping with me and I, it could have been a dream, it's possible, but I came out of my body and I saw me and my mom sleeping underneath me and it was like I was looking through a window and an attic down on myself and then I watched her push me off the bed cause she like moved a little, you know? And then my body body fell off the bed and I saw it happen and then I woke up and I was on the floor in my body body. So it was like a transferral and I told my mom about it when I woke up and I was two years old and it was a weird conversation to have with two year old. My mom was like, well, what are you talking about? We don't have an attic. You weren't looking through a window and then I was like, oh, and then when I was seven I got really bad pneumonia, which I get, seemed to get periodically. It's one of my deals with my meat suit. So I got really bad pneumonia when I was seven. It was so gnarly and again I had another out of body experience where I kind of left my body up into the corner and what I saw was all these rainbows on everything. So it was like, if I was looking at you, it was like all these rainbow trajectories kind of coming out. That's super cool. Dude, it was like awesome and all the, it was like looking at Tron or something is the best way to describe it. I love that you are mentioning that. I just did a podcast with a friend of mine who goes to South America to take ayahuasca and he was telling me that the name that they had for when, when, I guess the conquistador started coming there, they called them the gray people because they can, the shamans can see auras and what you're supposed to see is like, you know, what's inside of his is a rainbow. Apparently I've never seen it, but apparently that, but when the, but if you're shut down or your energies cloaked or something and you start going gray, so to speak. So that's true. Two, two, two of these mystical experiences. And then that's when you started and then an outs, you were an outsider. You were, you were, you felt like an outsider and so you were treated into books. This is a pattern I've seen a lot now. Yeah. Who, what makes the introvert go inside? Yeah. So the world kind of pushes you into the, it's almost like the entire world is built to push you in the direction of these things. Like a pressure system, like a pressure cooker. Yeah. Yeah. And it doesn't happen for everyone, but for some people, and this makes, do you believe that concept of we sort of pick what we're going to do down here? There's a, the class concept. Right. I think like you said earlier, if you think about how much we forget, okay, we can't even remember why we're born. Do you think it's possible that we could have picked something, right? Consciously if we can't consciously remember even being born, but we know we were there, it makes sense logically speaking that there would be maybe other thoughts even before that. Right. Unless you just think like knowledge and consciousness exists only in a formed brain. Right. Which I think is a little ridiculous if you look at the whole natural world and even, or even galaxies, right? There's no central nervous system and there's still conscious behavior. Right. Even in like, you know, quirks and stuff. Right. So I think it's a little silly to think otherwise. Yes. Personally. Right. You're some form of momentum. Yeah. Intention. Intention. So prior to your birth, you're a sort of, we don't, I don't know, but some kind of momentum. There's a, I wish I could remember where I read this, but it was a Buddhist teacher saying that he brought, it may have been a, her, his or her kids to see this like Buddhist teacher, another Buddhist teacher, their teacher, and their request was, can you tell them something about Buddhism that they can understand without knowing anything about Buddhism? Yeah. And his response was, when you die, the only thing that will be left of you is your state of consciousness. And that is a kind of, I think of as a kind of wave moving forward into time. Like a push. Like a push. And so in, in the same way that encapsulated in all these symbols, like Baphomet or, or is it Baphomet? You know, Tamiya Zomato. Tamiya Baphomet, Baphomet, Baphomet. It is. It is. Is it French? I think it's like French Muslims, so I guess it would be Baphomet. Baphomet. Yeah. Baphomet. Baphomet. So the, the, this, this, uh, encapsulated into this strange momentum that happens when you die is sort of encoded within it is the, the, your potentiality or, in the Bhagavad Gita Krishna says, or Arjuna asks Krishna, what happens if I give this path up? If I stop this path and it's the most awesome, happy response ever, which is there's neither any loss nor diminution along this path. There's never an end. There's never an end in any gains made or permanent gains. And if you have a life of the spiritual path and die without gaining realization, I will give you birth in a home of disciplined men. Patriarchal. Yes. But still super cool. I want some discipline men too. Does that count for me too? Yeah. Where are they? Come on. Hello. Don't ask me. Get a bunch of losers. Um, I, so you, um, so you started studying this stuff and when did you, when was the first time you realized that you were a witch? I was like 16. It was a total teen witch situation. I was one of those very, a kind of stereotypical teen witchy girls, I guess I would just, but you know, I was kind of an outsider. So I lived on an island. I grew up on this little tiny island in the Northwest and I lived right next to a forest. So I would just go nerd out in the woods and just hang out there by myself all the time. And that was when I started to kind of feel the earth and feel nature as this living thing. So in my investigations, I looked at, you know, panentheism and pantheism and that seemed to make the most kind of sense, um, in terms of what I felt. So then I was like, well, I got to look at this stuff because that seems true or real. Did you ever make contact with any kind of spirits out there? Have you ever made contact with the beings that live inside of trees and plants? Yeah. It's really hard to describe without starting to sound schizophrenic, but, um, because then you get into this dilemma, right? And here's what, how I test and how I feel like other people can be helped too, because you want to make sure you're not delusional, right? Because our brains can make all manner of things at the drop of a hat. If you have a little bit of imagination, you can just go nuts, right? But then it's like, is it real or am I just like, you know, having some mental masturbation happiness? Yes. I can say to invoke those experiences when there's other people there too, so that I can be like, is this delusional or is this for real? So I can, you know, say I've contacted beings or energies or whatever, but that's all, you know, who cares. What I like to do is to do it and to do it with other people and to see what the results are. Right? Yes. Yeah. So what would be your most successful example of that kind of experiment? There's so many good ones. We literally will look for things like signs or symbols from nature. So at one ritual that I was doing in a friend's backyard, they're literally, as we were doing it, a giant barn owl came and flew in a circle over our heads and landed in the palm tree and just hung out the whole time we were doing it, just like chilling, hanging out. So it'll be like stuff like that, right, where you can feel the presence. Yes. Something like pop open a bubble and something crazy and magical happens. Yeah. Always in the flavor of wonder or like, oh my God, that's impot, like miracles, right? Yeah, right. One of the craziest ones I'll share that was so nuts, I did a summer solstice ritual and we were trying to get over fear of death. That was the, the MO, right? I know, big undertaking, tricky, but not so bad when you understand nothing ends, right? So the idea was to get over it and my friend Libby said, she goes, I liked when I went to New Orleans, she goes at the funerals there, they dress up the corpses like a party. She goes, they dress them up and for the funeral, they're like dressed like a pimp. Like she said those words, she goes, I like it because they dress them like pimps and everybody has a party. Right. Okay. So fast forward in time, then the rituals done, we're all in the house having a conversation. I'm talking to another girl there about her sister, we're having this conversation about her sister because her sister's having a hard time. She gets a text at that moment from her sister that says, it's a, it's a link to an article about funerals in New Orleans and how they dress them as pimps, the literal, the tag line was the exact sentence that my friend had said. Yes. Like impossible. Impossible. Totally impossible. Now that function in the universe seems not, it seems to be alive. It seems to be like there is a person, personified. Yeah. Yeah. Cause it, you know, one part of me could think, well, maybe if you put enough psychic energy out, it boomerangs and then it just pops back to you in a kind of impersonal way. But that doesn't, it always, there's another quality, but aside from that sense of wonder and, and novelty that comes with it, it always seems kind of funny. It's always hilarious. I'm so glad you said that it's, I call it the setup cause it's like a comedy setup, like a joke where like all this stuff is the setup and then the punchline comes. That's it. Yeah. It seems, and from that you can almost, you know, you can take in the same way that they can find a fossil and from that fossil unfold what the dinosaur looks like or, you know, kind of come close to what it might look like. I think in the same way from those moments, you can start unfolding a little bit of what is this being, you know, and one thing is it's got a real, real sense of humor and a sense of humor in the same way that comedians have a sense of humor. It seems to have its own specific style, its own sense of humor. Yeah. And it's clever humor. It's not like dumb, dumb humor. It's always like skeetingly accurate and funny. You know what I mean? Like it's a very sad or knee kind of sad or knee. What is that? What do you mean? So like Saturn, that's where satire comes from. So satire is the, what do they say? Like comedy is tragedy plus time. So Saturn is like Kronos, right? The God of time. He just kind of takes stuff that's terrible and then is able to just, you know, like throw a little snarky comet. But that snarky comet lifts everything because it's like, everything is stupid. That's right. That's right. It's the, it's the, it reminds me of when, if you have a, if you're a kid and someone is telling, there's a successful ghost storyteller telling a ghost story to a bunch of kids, they're going to throw in a funny thing in there that makes you laugh in the midst of this ghost story. And it feels like that too. There's this kind of acknowledgement of the predicament that we're in with a wink that comes through. It's a wink style. Never, never, it never fully reveals itself or it's totally like a little beep. It's like a peep show. A peep show. Yeah. That's what it is. It reminds me of a form of peekaboo or something. Yeah. Totally. I'm here. Just so you know. Okay. Bye. Yeah. That's it. Totally. Now why, why a game of peekaboo? Why not reveal to us the truth? Why is this? Now, cause in a lot of people would say, yeah, that's fucking sadistic, man. What are you going to play? Oh, you think this is funny? Yeah. Right. Yeah. No, here's, I have a theory about that. I don't know if it's an answer, but why is it the peekaboo? If you look at what a, like the first thing these, if you want to look at them as beings, if you look at most things in history, the first thing out of any angel's mouth is do not be afraid. Oh, wow. Every time there were, and I had a weird synchronicity with that too. And then I found that I was like, what? And the first thing they say is don't be afraid because I guess they're, it's terrifying. Right. Like people lose their shit. Yeah. So I feel like it's peekaboo, possibly because of our own capacity, right? So that it doesn't want to just like totally crumble our whole world. But then I, I'm like you, I'm like, why not just blow the lid off the whole thing? Like let's go apocalypse now and just have everybody deal with it. Just deal with it. That this is the sitch. But it is, it's, I feel like it's like lovingly trying to push in the pressure cooker also because it wants us all to do it ourselves so that we're not just like parasites and think this thing is like this big awesome thing and we have no capacity for it. I think it's kind of peekabooing to empower us to feel like it's cool, like we can do it. Right. Maybe. I don't know. Teaching style. It's a, it's a teaching thing going on here where it's you, it's like, and it's almost like, that's why I keep going back to this ridiculous, I used to roll my eyes so many times when I ever would hear anyone say this idea of like, we choose this incarnation. I would roll my eyes, but more the older I get, the more I think, no, this does, it feels like a class that we went into and almost as though before we went in the class, we said, don't let us know. It's a class. It's like, you know, like if the, like we went into like, please, don't give up the joke. Don't give up the joke. Right. I paid a lot of money for this thing. No matter how much I scream, don't. No spoilers. No spoilers. I'm going to go through it this time. Yeah. So yeah, it does feel like that. I do like, um, I do like trying to reverse engineer God, goddess, whatever the word is that you have for now, is it possible to have the full vision or the full revelation of this force in, in, in this incarnation? I have met a couple of individuals who I feel like have done that. I feel like I've had some of the force. I would not say the full, though I've gotten the full Monty, but my teacher, Dr. Calvin DeWolf, who he got his PhD in Chinese medicine, but he falls native, his native tribe Mick Mac traditions. So he's like epic and you can just see like it emanates from them. That's right. Another one I met was Amma G who, I mean, you can literally feel the rainbow rays coming out of her for whatever you think. Is the hugging scene. Yeah. She's the hugging one. And I, this is how I tell if people have kind of like received that full force, right? It's like if someone took a bath and tar, you can smell the tar all over. It's not like a, oh, is this person holy? No, it's literally like dripping out of their pores. No question. No, unquestionable. No, I just, you know, I had Alex Gray on the podcast and we were talking about this very same phenomena and I've, he calls it like a vent, like a steam, like a, like a vent. And I've thought of it as like a love heater or something, but there's, it's all the same. It's the same idea, which is like emanations. You can't fake it in the same way you can't fake having muscles to who you cannot fake it. Dude, that reminds me of the Sarah Palin speech that she just gave, like where her teleprompter went down. And I feel like this is part of that apocalypse energy, right? The unveiling where it's like the jig is up. Yeah. So it's like, if you're not for real, yeah, you're every, all the emperors are losing their clothes right now. Yes. So if you're not for real, the jig is up and people can see it. This is not something you have to like wonder about in a crystal ball. Right. It's self-evident. Yeah. They, and the stories that I've heard about, uh, Neem Karoli Baba, it was, it was just that look, it wasn't like, Oh, maybe it was like, you're, it's, you know, it's like what McTarence McKinnon says about a big dose of mushrooms. It's like standing next to a nuclear explosion. Very much. You are blasted. You can't, you can't fake it. And I, you know, and you know, even, you know, even though you say you've only had a touch of this thing, I can feel it from you. I, and you too. And I, oh, thank you. But I've been around people, you know, enough now that I, I do know what that, what a little bit of what, oh yeah, I know what the tar is like. I know what it smells like. And I think that that's a really important thing for people to realize. I think so too. So many of you are so paranoid about having a teacher because they think, Oh, I don't want to get hoodwinked by a scoundrel. Well, and there's a lot of those is the problem. Yeah, but there's also a lot of those as car mechanics or doctors or dentists. Like the, the sneaky creeps are prevalent everywhere, so spirituality is no exception. But again, it's like, how do you know your car mechanics? Good, right? The proof's in the pudding. This isn't something like, if you go to a spiritual teacher for 10 years and you still know jack-a-poo, yeah, like chances are maybe they're not, they're just not very good. Right. That's right. Like a good mechanic. Right. Cause you can feel it when it's good. It'll go. It'll work. Yeah. Yeah. That's exactly right. You just, and also another thing that I've noticed or a quality of teachers is that they, their words are a secondary component in what they're actually doing. Yeah. Really. There, there's some other deeper thing that they're doing with you that you, that the words are just kind of there to fill up the space. Yeah. But then there's a deeper, um, there's something deeper that's happening. Um, so as a, what is your, as a spiritual teacher and as someone who, a lot of people look up to you, what is your, they do. Oh, how do you, um, what, what, what is your day to day practice look like? Well, I usually, my, my main practice is assisting clients. So I'll do that in a number of ways where I'll either use the kind of what I call psychodivinological session where we kind of like Nancy drew to the bottom of the situation and see what we can find out. So it's kind of like investigation. Right. And I'll use astrology or each thing or tarot to do that. And then I'll also do, um, energy sessions, which include a Qigong practice that I learned from my previous teacher. And I did Qigong and martial arts, um, pretty much from the time I was like 24. So I'm 40 now. So a little while, and it's more of just like energy movement. So like with those, the biggest thing I'll see is it'll just move stuff. Like one of my clients had polycystic ovary syndrome and she hadn't had a period in like three years. I give her a little sash and she totally started having a period. So you healed someone. Well, it'll like move it. Like, I don't know if I'll claim like, ooh, a miraculous healing happened, but certainly I've noticed people will, their energy will move and like stuck stuff will kind of either come to the surface. Like I gave a session on this ADHD kid and he like literally got like twitchy, like his muscles were twitching and I was just touching him. So it kind of like brings stuff to the surface to like push it out. Yeah. And, and this is, you know, so people hear that. Yeah. And they're immediately like bullshit. Right. This is not possible in this dimension. There is no way to get arrested for claiming that they can heal people in that fashion. And yet you have had a direct experience with seeing that this works. Yeah. I've had direct experiences of seeing that this stuff works. That's got to be a little frustrating for you that, and I can feel that you feel like you kind of have to, a lot of what you're saying, you do, it seemed like you have to nerf it a little bit, explain it. Cause otherwise you do, you sound like a total cuckoo pants, but it makes sense. Here's how I describe it. It's just electromagnetic energy. Like we literally have electricity. It's not that weird. Right. We have, we are electromagnetic little balls of dirt walking around. So the, if you think about it, and in terms of acupunctures too, like it's just moving electricity through your body. It's very simple, right? It's that, that's it. Right. And we have to, it's almost like what you just said, this is another weird part about being in this super technologically advanced time period that we're in, is that you actually have to dumb down what's really happening by using the current lingo, even though what's really happening, you wouldn't really say electricity. I bet you've got a lot of different words for what's happening. If you guys want to know the true truth, yes, here we go. It's all light. So anytime we, like if I look into your eyes and we get an exchange of light, that's actually releasing photonic energy. So everything in the whole business is differently condensed light forms. So if I can give you a gish and get you to like, ideally I shouldn't have to do anything, but sometimes if like, I can get my light going and I just stand next to someone, they'll like do it in sympathy. Like how you catch a flu from someone. You can like catch light from someone too. And that should be the purpose of a teacher, should be to just like, you know, get you to be like, Oh my God, that's right. I should totally just be like, right. So that's like the true truth. It's light. It's light. That's what it is. Yeah. And that's what, you know, when you're talking about the, the, the eating the moon, as you're saying really, you're eating light, you're eating reflected sunlight bouncing off of this extraterrestrial planet that has this added quotient thing to it, that the moon is placed within it. It's like sun gazing. It's a, the witch version of looking at the moon is very similar to the yogi sun gazers that do it in the, at the dawn, which version's safer. I think right now, these packets, the light is information, isn't it? So that's correct. So contained inside this, these packet, these photons, like little prisms, little prisms, like little crystals. So each photon is like a little crystal. Yeah. So it's these, and actually God, I just read that they had somehow managed to turn light into crystal. Did you hear about that? No, but it makes sense. By draw, by somehow by changing its frequency, they crystallize light. You know, all these things are happening right now that are so insane. I know that they just go flying by everyone. Like, oh, they turn light into discoveries are epic. Like there was all these scientific truths we held for so long regarding like physics and relativity. And now it's all just like popping off at an extreme rate. It's true. But like with the crystallization of light, it's, I look at it like making a snowflake out of water. It's just like, right? It's just a condensation. You've changed its form a little bit. And so now inside each of these, so if I look at this, a photon, this crystal or this sort of like a hologram, right? Like a laser light hologram. Yeah. Like a hologram. And this would be the atomic structure that we're all made of is many of these holograms, an arrangement, an arrangement of holograms are, is each individual photon, do they all contain the same information? So here I'll offer what Max Planck said. A lot of people don't know about that Max Planck, which is good. People need to know about him. He had the whole Max Planck Institute studies light. Now it behaves in living systems too, like our bodies. What he proposed is that all light is only one being like. So even though there's separate photons, that it's only one thing. Because the reason he said that is if you do something to a photon over here, a photon like somewhere way far away will have a memory of what happened to that other photon, which is insane. Unless they just like shouted through interdimensional wormholes at each other. Hey, this just happened to me. But that would mean like every single photon would be like, hey, you guys, check out what just happened to me. That's cuckoo pants. Instead, it's like they're an entire body and one living organism. So does it's like DNA, right? If my fingernail cell, if I go in deep enough, it has the DNA for my liver, for my heart, for my brain. So that's what light is. Gotcha. Yeah. Like DNA. So the DNA I've always thought of is the kind of, if there was ever a signature that an alien put inside of all life, it would look like DNA. It looks like a signature. But we have alien DNA in us. Actually, it's mitochondrial DNA. You have two different kinds of DNA in your body. One is yours, your cells. And the other one is in the mitochondria, which are these like semi-parasitic organisms that just kind of hang out in us and give us all the energy that we have. Right. That's right. Yeah. I've heard that's completely different DNA. I'm playing a kind of primordial symbiosis is what people theorize about. Now, to get back to this concept of light, that we're all we're. So here we are, this one light being that has varying, I don't know what you want to call it, frequencies that it's operating at. And some create like wood and stone, flesh, brain, blood. And then in the least less condensed form, we've got whatever photons are the stuff that's bouncing off of us, dimensional beings or whatever. Right. Okay. Right. Right. So that those things too. Yeah. So when a person is not living life to their fullest potential, based on this concept that we're all like, what's going on? Why, why the depression, why the anger, why the inability to accept love or to give love, what's going on with the light when that's happening? Well, there's a couple of theories about what's going on there. And certainly anyone, all you have to do is take a little DMT and you can literally feel that because it's like a miasma. It's like a river of blackness in the Carlos Castaneda books. They call it the evil sorcerers that are at the level preventing humanity from busting through to their full potential. Right. So you can say like evil sorcerers, there's some like force, right? What is it? Is it like, what is that thing, the darkness that sucks people into? Yes. Depression, suicide, unhappiness, like inability to function, alcoholism, disease, that's like kind of the foundation of everything when we start to fall apart and then eventually leads to death, correct? Correct. A lot of people will call that force Kali. They'll call it gravity if they're scientists. Right. So we're all just kind of walking around until everything gets pulled off of us until we just like pull apart. Yes. Right. And that's the situation. Yes. So what is that? Yeah. I mean, I feel like it's just a counter force to whatever the force is to grow. So if you think about, if you have anything, there could be infinite potentialities of every other thing that it could possibly be, but we could simplify it and just say, like, according to physics, if there's a thing, there's an equal and opposite thing. So if we have this potential to be these awesome, huge, gigantic, interdimensional beings, then we also have the potential to be these lowly little slimy, creepy critters. Right. Those simultaneously exist. What's the difference between the two? That's the question, isn't it? How do we go from creepy crawling creeps into these like epically individual beings? So I think, and what the Taoists say and, you know, all my favorite teachers, we have to somehow come into the middle of those two things. We can't be our extreme potential or our creepy crawlies. We have to somehow figure out how to be all of those things together. At the same time. Wow. Right. And that's because we can't eliminate our creepy quality. Right. It's real. It exists. We all have. We can all be grumpy. I'm going to get pissed. I could be an animal and just rip things to shreds with someone like attack my children. I could totally become that thing. Right. It's a, it's a potential that exists within me. So then it's like, okay, I have to be like that potential exists and everyone does it all around. I have to accept that people bomb people. Yes. It doesn't mean tolerate it. It doesn't mean not talk about trying to make it different. Yeah. That's not the same thing. Right. But you have to acknowledge it. Like a lot of new age people, you know, they don't want to look at anything negative and talk about negative things. Right. We ain't go negative vibey. Yeah. So you're eliminating completely half of existing reality. Wow. That's fucked up. It is though. It's not true. Right. Yeah. It's just not true. Right. Yeah. It is a, you know, that is a thing where you even like the contemplation of these negative concepts and that's something I always wonder about. You know, I, I'm someone who does contemplate those things. And sometimes as I'm contemplating them, I think, is this actually just a form of laziness? It, it, what, you know, like indulgence, indulgence. Yeah. Yeah. Cause at what point does, how long do we sit at the edge of the grave and watch their decomposing bodies? Like when is it time to keep rolling? Yeah. To tell the brain, Hey, come on. Let's, let's start thinking about the, the other side of this. Well, cause then you get polarized, right? If you go too long into indulging that, it's like you'll get enough gravity where it'll accumulate momentum and then you get like caught up in it. And now you're trapped. Whereas equally on the other end, if you get all caught up in that, then you go like Messiah style, right? And you think you're like, yeah, everybody's gotta be like, I'm a God. So just pay attention to me because I'm a God. So you got to go in the middle of those. God, and that's the hardest. That is so hard. Yeah. Is it hard? It's, it's like balancing on a teeter totter. You just got to check yourself. It's like the thing and, and listen when other people check you. Like I don't like being told what to do, but if like five people tell me I'm being a bitch about something, I'm going to be like, okay, okay, baby. Right. I got to check this out. So you got to listen and react and respond to what is occurring as well as relying on your own kind of inner authority to like make discernment and choices. It's a combo. Right. Yeah. Your own inner authority. Yes. And with this, uh, in, um, what, what is, is that your own inner authority? Is that synonymous with your will? Is your will and inner authority the same thing? I feel like it's pretty close, if not exact. So the, your inner authority has been called like your conscience. If you look at like, what is your conscience? It's described literally as a light. Yeah. Really? Oh, go on Wikipedia. Like it's cuckoo. It's a light that is located above your head. So when you get connection with your conscience, which isn't just like, you kind of get there when you go between the angel and the devil, going like, ah, you're a loser, you're going to ever make it. And then like, no, you're a messiah, you're awesome. So your conscience is kind of somewhere in between there where you go, neither if you guys is right, just be quiet. And then you kind of like chill out and then you let what's really going on outside of your own opinions come into you. That's what I think. Okay. Connection. Okay. Does that make sense? Yes, it does. So you're sort of pushing. Yeah. It's like getting snow out of a driveway. Okay. That's super cool. So these two, uh, the, the, what, the negativity and the positivity are in all the thought patterns that emerge from it. This is this, this is the snow on the driveway and you push that away. And then all of a sudden that's when you are making contact with what? That's a good question. I feel like it is like your will, your true will or intent. So like, if you can imagine your consciousness, whatever that is, it's some kind of light that has its deal that it came in to do. It knows what it's here to do and what you should do. Right. Right. So it's, it's like your intention, your will, but also ancient knowledge, like, like primordial. So it's both of those. I feel like it's your own personal will, but then also something that extends beyond what you are. Right. Yeah. Why do you think people are so closed off to that? It's weird, huh? Yeah. And like you look at the, we just did a, I did a show with my radio show partner, Eric Davis. We talked to this woman about, um, xenolinguistics, like where's the info coming from or how do you know who to listen to? And there's that whole thing of hearing voices. You're discouraged from listening to any voices in our current society. Right. If you start hearing stuff or linking in bad news, bad news. If your friend starts telling you that a voice is telling them to do something crazy, even though every single musician, artists and scientists usually do things in that manner. Right. Somehow, if you talk about it, you're cuckoo. Yes. I don't like that. That's fucked up. That's fucked up. It is. And I think that that brings us back to what we were talking about in the beginning, which is this fascinating taboo against witchcraft, because what you, what you just said is, uh, identifying a kind of censorship that it currently exists in the time period that we live in, which is that, you know, you can, they, there's freedom of speech. But if you start talking about, right, this thing that you're talking about, it reminds me of the same, of North Korean level censorship, which is that if you start saying, I think I'm in contact with higher dimensional entities, or I think that I might be a conduit through which a higher intelligence is coming, uh, if you say that to the most people, the phone is hung up. Yeah. But check it out. President Bush said the reason he went into the war was because God told, he said he heard a voice of God telling him to, but that's totally acceptable. No one was like, holy shit. The president just heard the voice of God. I can't believe they didn't get that reaction. What he said, the voice of God told him to go to war. Why didn't everybody go fuck you and burn him as a witch? It's like, that's the same thing as like, when you take the keys away from your drunk friend, that's when you take the keys to the nuclear arsenal. No more keys for you because it, because this, this, this makes me, there's one. Ramdas, uh, said that, um, just because a being doesn't have a body doesn't mean it's telling the truth. Uh, yeah. And that's a curious thing. Isn't it? It's, it's here there and in every religion. And I remember the Dalai Lama in a lecture that I watched said something like, I just love the way he said it, but he just sort of in a very casual way mentioned the fact that, oh yes, they're, they're entered in, there are other entities and he said, but you know, just like us, they will eventually die because everything in this dimension dies energy. Yeah. Um, but it, and I think maybe that's why people are so closed off to this is because fear, fear, because it's like, look, if I start playing around with this concept, which there are spirits for lack of a better word that I can contact, then that opens up the doorway to what I think it is. It could be some real dangers, which is what if I connect with the wrong, what if I connect with Bush's friend? It's a serious problem. And that's the thing I always like to say too, like in my personal practices and the shamanic ones I've learned from my teacher with the Native American traditions, it's very different than like, say the spiritualism that occurred in America where people were using Ouija boards and stuff like that. Yes. In, I guess, for lack of a better word, shamanic traditions, you do not allow the spirit to possess you. In fact, the whole point of this is to become an autonomous being that is connected to your true self. Right. That's like being, doing what your friend says to do. Essentially, if you let a spirit possess you, you're just like a jump in someone else's train. That's wild. But it's like, I can talk to you and I'm not afraid you're going to possess me. Right. I feel confident that I know who I am. So if you just say a bunch of stuff, I'm not just going to agree with you, Duncan. I have my own thing. And this is what people forget. Spirits are the same way. You are in charge. But again, like my, I have this Reiki master, Christina Galvez. And she said the smartest thing ever. She goes, it's just like walking downtown. So if you wear a short skirt and you walk downtown, you're going to attract trouble. So it's the same with like dealing with the spirits. You got to be savvy, like, you know, handle yourself. Whoa. That's so cool. Yeah. It's like the Grateful Dead parking lot. You've got to watch out. Yeah, totally. Like in reality. Yeah. Yeah. It's no different. It's the same thing. Totally. And the same, I imagine that you could apply the same. My contact with extradimensional beings has only been through psychedelics generally. Not only, but the, the, the ones that not sell great ones have usually come through psychedelics. Interesting. But it's the, the, well, not evil either, but just like I got it. Like pushy. The first time I saw, I asked you about the beings living in, yeah. Um, uh, in nature, because when I was on a huge dose of mushrooms, it only happened to me like this once I was laying in a lawn chair. And it's so ridiculous to say this. It sounds like someone making up what a psychedelic is like, you know, like someone who would think, oh, this is what they're like. So I'm going to lie about it, but it was that clear. Cause usually when I have a hallucination, it was, it isn't like this, but I was laying in this lawn chair, looking up in a tree. And there was plain as day, what appeared to be a gnome that was an old man and he was looking out at the sun. And he was just sort of like watching the, I guess watching birds, like old people would do or something. And he could tell that I could see him and it irritated him. You know what I mean? It was just sort of in the ear, a mild kind of grumpy irritation. And I don't know, that's not evil, but it was just like shit, man. They're not. No, dude, if you read stories of the, so fairies are basically nature spirits. And I know everyone thinks of fairies as these cute little things, but they're assholes. Like if you, there's all these stories of like, if they could see people seeing them, they would like poke out their, your eye. Like they wouldn't, they don't like that. Like they get like to be covert because a lot of the nature spirits, what they call are like fallen angels. So it's these kind of like higher light beings that are kind of like trapped in natural form. They kind of have a body, but only an energy body. So they're like, you know, everyone thinks they're good, but they're just, they're not good or bad. They're just hanging out like everybody else. It's like at the beach. Totally like at the beach. Some people at the beach, yeah, they play radio. They play their radio and they like, like, what are you doing? You're, why are you doing this to us? Yeah. Like, why would you play? Yeah. Taylor Swift is loud as you can at the beach to us. Yeah. So it's like that. That's cool to know because it was, I remember just sort of as the mushroom trip was happening and I was in the mushroom trip. And even to this day, I think, I think I saw a gnome as that was happening. It was that this uncomfortable dawning realization of shit, man. That's a grumpy guy. Like they're not Disney guys. No. And they'll come and bite you and like try to get little chunks of you and drain your energy too. But again, you just have to know who's in charge. How do you stop that? You say, no, you do techniques that build your will. They seem smarter than us, but we have will and intent, right? So it's true. Some people's will and intent, it's just they don't, they can't do it. They get tired and they just give up, right? But if you meditate and have a practice, that's how you build your strength to be stronger than them. Right. Just like I would go do martial arts so that I don't have to get raped when I walk down the street. Right. It's the same kind of concept. Right. Right. You arm yourself with techniques and knowledge to know how to handle it. This is the circle that they talk about again and again and again. If you're, if you're sort of channeling or bringing these beings into your life, you're, there's, they're already there. That's the news is that, guess what? You personally are not responsible for invoking these beings. You are perception open so that you can see them. Whoa. They're always there. Oh, that is so heavy. That is a real heavy thing. That's why I always say, why be afraid of something that's already happening now? Oh, wild. So you're saying that the, you know, my, okay. So I'll tell you what you, the thing you just shifted in my understanding of this stuff is whenever I've had, and I, you know, I've dabbled in this stuff a little bit probably in really stupid ways, but I always have thought that that's so interesting. Of course, what you're saying is that I've always thought that you, that they, you know, you sort of invoke these things and then like they teleport in. I never had considered that could be true too. Like it depends on what you're invoking, right? But at any time we're in a sea of all kinds of different stuff, like a city. It's like if you were in New York, there's just shit going on all over the place. Right. So if you want to call in a specific one, I do think it's some kind of teleportation situation, right? Because there's no time and space in these other places. Everything's like photon style. Yeah. So it's instantaneous. I got you. So if you have like the name, which is there like a dress, say, right, and you, what would one of their names be? Well, you know, if you pick anything from magic, they'll list either angelic beings or demonic beings. Let's say an angelic, Michael. Sure, like Cassie L, right? So if we're going to Cassie L is like an old man who looks out into space under oak trees. So could have been who you saw. He's really grumpy and like he's like God of tears. So he rules like sorrow and kind of grief and he hangs out under oak trees. And so or like there's a couple of other spots that he likes a lot too. So you go to one of the areas that they like and then you kind of like bring up their name. And it's like if it's like that song, you got a friend. James Taylor one, you know, you just call on them and they're there. It's like you got a friend song. Wow. But they're just they're like the you can feel it like they just like if you're thinking of a friend and it just makes you feel your friend. Wow. And this is and is how much of what is this? This is witchcraft. What you're talking about. They talk about doing all these things in all the pagan traditions address these kind of things and all the Gnostics, like if you look at Gnosticism, it was like basically paganism that wasn't Christian. So they all got like, you know, put aside. But in Gnosticism, they talk about that stuff all over the place with like the Archons and what's going on in terms of consciousness and the mind. They they addressed that so long ago. And in such detail, it is almost like shocking that people are so dumb about it. Well, we're scared, you know, I'm scared to tune into that frequency too much because it's it's I'm you know, we have such there's already a certain level of sorrow in dealing with the meat bodies around us. The idea of suddenly turning the lights on to all the other friends that we have very scary. It's scary, but that's the only way that you do it is you have to look into your own darkness. So like the thing that everyone's the scariest of seeing who they really are. They're not really scared of all the other stuff because what we are so awesome, but we're like kind of scared that we're so awesome. So we're all like, we don't want to go in the Luke Skywalker tree and see the Darth Vader head. But I think it's kind of more that than what we're really afraid of that something else could be more powerful than us. Because everything's more powerful than us. We had taken out by like a snake or a spider. Oh, yeah. Like we're afraid of demons and people live in Australia where everything can kill you. That's hilarious. We're already doing it now in nature, right? Yeah, there's brown occluses. Oh, my God, you're totally right. And I love what you just said that what we're most afraid of is how great we are. I think so. Yeah, because that is so because what is why are we afraid of that? That's such a good question. If anything better for me, so I'll just, you know, use myself as an example. If I kind of stop myself or get him cock block myself, so to speak. I'll notice that it's in situations where I feel like I don't have the authority. If I feel confident, if it's something that I am comfortable with, I'm totally cool. Yeah. If I'm comfortable, if I don't know, then I go like, oh, my God, I don't know. So then I had to go through this whole point of being like, it's OK to know stuff. Right. So I think it's that we don't know. Right. Maybe. I think I don't know. I don't know the answer. I think that a lot of people think at first that the thing you're afraid of is that the darkness or the sort of, I don't know. The foggy energy inside of us or the anger, whatever that stuff is. But then, you know, whenever I get around the Ram Dass people. And everyone, you know, or Ram Dass, it's really hard for me to be around that kind of love. Like it's really hard to to be around that thing. Like you kind of, I know what you mean. You know what I mean? The goody two shoes where it's like, I can't. I don't feel cool because I feel like I'm getting judged because I know I have evil. Yes. That's first. That's one of the first things that pops in your head is like, I feel really kind of polluted around people like that. Yeah. The second thing is, is just like, I just, yeah, because I don't deserve it. Because like this love coming in, I don't deserve it. So if the idea is that inside of all of us is that we are love is that or whatever that, the right name for that energy is, then it would make sense that the real terror would be realizing that it's not just that you're fighting with it coming from the outside. We're receiving it. Yeah. Yeah. You're fighting from the inside too. It's stupid. It's dumbest wrestling match. Totally dumb. It's a dumbest fight. Really dumb. Like, no, I can't have that in me because I'm not, it's the whole thing. I think this whole thing with religion, witchcraft, everything, all this information is to try to get us to get our brains under control so that our thoughts don't disrupt the reality of our being. Oh, wow. That's a beautiful way to put it. Right. So that's pretty good. Right. Yeah. That's really good. Our minds are these blessings and curses. Yeah. That can go so many directions, get possessed, distracted, taken over, destroyed. You know, destroy ourselves, what we're thinking. And, you know, even in a bad environment, your thoughts can be what's destructive to you, right? Like we obviously, people are in terrible situations brought on by each other in a lot of cases, but then still you got to fight extra hard with your brain. If you're in one of those God awful situations, try to keep your own thoughts and not all this like pain and suffering and trauma, which you may be experiencing. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. I see it's kind of like it's like if you want to deal with people in the world. Yeah. This is the first fix yourself, work on yourself. So this is the idea of like you can either put leather all over the entire planet or you can put on shoes. It's accurate. And so in the same way that if you want to deal with the next level up, which would be these beings that you're talking about, same concept identically. So in the practice of witchcraft, step one is take in the light. Get it in you, right? That's why it's traditionally women and like the whole sex stories. Like I think about it. Think about that. What is sexuality is being penetrated by a force outside yourself. Whether that, but like that erotic energy that can go to a lot of different places, right? Look at that in terms of galaxies, in terms of, you know, all kinds of things. Yeah, aren't anthropomorphized. So it's like you're allowing the sword of light to kind of just penetrate you and come in and that's the difficulty is receiving it, right? You talked about not wanting that. I think you're not worth it or that you can't do it. Primary difficulty. Yeah. So that's the taking in the moon that is taking it. Oh, that's so cool. Yeah. How bad at pretty good, right? Yeah, really good. Yeah. Um, how can my listeners take your, or is your class open? Can people take your class? I'm currently so magic school. I was doing for a long time at the Basant Lodge and I'm trying to get a, I'm trying to expand it to get more stuff available for people. So I want to get, ideally, I want to make like a witch church and have like places where people can take these classes, learn how to, you know, focus in how to use the techniques, cause I'm a real technique heavy person. Cause I think, yeah, you can get it in these spontaneous moments and I've experienced that as well. Or you can use, you know, substances or all kinds of stuff, but there are actually these techniques that make it just a lot easier. I call them like the dumbo feathers, right? So you can kind of like use these ritualistic or qigong or meditation techniques and they kind of can pull off some of the layers of the tar. Yeah. You can like get at getting light to come out.

Absolve me of my sin. She deserves your love. Okay, let's do a podcast. Hello friend, it's me Duncan and you are listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast. Hello, man. Ah, god damn, I've been riding my bike again. Boy, does that just juice the serotonin out of your synaptic vesicles. It's so glorious. You get addicted. You get a little trembling thinking about biking. It's really, really the antidote. If you're somebody who like me tends to fall into long periods of numb, soul negating, horrifying depression, then just getting out on a bike and riding around can do so much to help assuage that incredible numbness that can slowly and silently creep into your heart like kudzu wrapping around some young sapling cutting off all connection to the sun and slowly killing it like an anaconda choking the life out of a young lamb. It can happen. It happens slowly though, man. Next thing you know, you just don't feel anything. You're just kind of annoyed all the time and fuck for me, there's some things that fix that. Intermuscular catamine doesn't hurt, but also climbing on a bike and just riding outside and smelling civilization, going through the different zones, walking is awesome too. And admittedly, it depends on where you live. If you happen to be in a place, devoid of bike lanes or nowhere near a park or somewhere just, I don't know where you are, I guess in some like horrific crucible where the roads are cratered and snipers, maybe you're in the future. Maybe you're listening to this in the future after the economy collapsed and all the streets have bubbled up from the solar flares that wiped out the satellites that caused a complete collapse of the communication technologies that gave us the incredible conveniences that we've taken for granted and become so accustomed to. You might be some scavenger sitting in the rib cage of an enemy that you just killed with your hatchet and sling and you've found an old phone that mysteriously still had energy in it and the podcast was stored in the phone and you don't have a bike. All you've got is a backpack made of the dried out leathery faces of the enemies that you've scalped and it's filled with teeth and lubricant and you don't even know what I'm saying right now because you no longer speak English, you speak some new grunting language based on the sound of squealing pigs and roasting martyrs that you've thrown in your boiling pits of tarry oil that you've harvested from the desiccated cars that were exploded by the fire bombs dropped from the alien UFOs that flew into our planet's atmosphere after the satellites got wiped out by a solar flare and this could just sound to you like that's the case I don't know what to tell you man you can't understand me you're just some ogre thing wandering in an apocalyptic wasteland so I'm not going to talk to you anymore but if you're somebody who lives near streets just get a bike they're not that expensive they're relatively cheap for the amount of joy that they can bring you I forget somehow I always forget but the moment you're just fucking driving down the road and you can the gears are spinning and it's all these satisfying little clicks and words and the bumps and the barbecue smells and the blasts of exhaust and the what is someone burning fucking wood someone with someone burning some kind of ancient wood near here what does that smell coming from and then the quick blasts of music coming from unknown parties somewhere in a relative close proximity that you'll never see and the smell of perfume and the sound of birds singing and the whir of the wheels and the zones that appear in cities you go from like deep acidic Williamsburg with like just acidic Jews everywhere and silence and kids playing in the alleys and a kind of like feeling of like fuck I just traveled backwards in time to suddenly being in like deep hipster Williamsburg and then just it's amazing it's amazing you don't have to be in New York either if you do live in New York and you're not riding a bike it is insane that you're not doing that you don't even realize the fact that you are living in a kind of utopian paradise the other thing that becomes strangely clear when you're riding around on a bike is how miserable people in cars seem like people in cars are beeping at each other screaming at each other I just saw some guy climb out of his car today and just scream just scream like somebody who realized that they were in hell he would been in a kind of amnesiac state where they forgot there the scream of god spoiler spoiler alert the scream in angel heart by the way if you haven't seen angel heart just cut ahead like 50 seconds the scream in angel heart when harry angel realizes that he's the murderer and he sold his soul to the devil this guy just clambered out of his fucking car and was like it's the strangest thing and what's really crazy in New York and this is a obviously it's special about New York it's generally faster to get where you're going on a bike because traffic is so fucking bad here and it's about the same as taking a train that's weird that's a really weird thing so if you're in New York and you've got the subway blues or whatever because they've raised the price on the subways man get a fucking bike just try I know I sound like the most judgmental condescending person on the precipice of joining some kind of vegan biking collective some kind of anarchist vegan biking collective that throws paint bombs at city monuments and incinerates trash cans and throws bricks through the windows of chipotle's I know I sound like that I'm sorry but my god if you are up to your neck in a kind of dark soupy inexplicable depression if you just feel bored if you need a a change if you want to get a nice terrifying rush because you do get those when you're out there too it ain't what you would call safe you're out there on the streets people don't see you if they do see you they're they're pissed because you've got this saint-like glow to you because you've discovered the fact that you can get on a thing you power with your own caloric energy that takes you from point A to point B while making you healthier while allowing you to stand on some ridiculous peak of judgment and gaze down on the fools driving their cars I've only been doing this for three days I've become so egoic and puffed up and judgmental of drivers that it almost negates the health benefit that the bike is giving me so forgive me for going on and on about this but what it is kind of fun to temporarily feel superior don't get me wrong I'll be in a car before long guaranteed and I like it climbing in the back of a cab that doesn't smell like a billion hummus farts being exploded out of a fucking exhaust pipe of some kind of spaceship which can happen sometimes you do end up in some stinky fucking cabs where whoever's been riding in them or maybe the person driving is just been not like farting like you know intermittently here and there but there's just been a kind of central air conditioner style release of foul putrid gas that's just been pouring out of someone in there for hours and is seeped into the old brittle seat so that every time the cab hits a bump the just a swamp bubble of doom gas comes out of the seats the seats are farting you might as well have stepped into some kind of world war two battlefield where they've just dispersed something worse than mustard gas something created in the alchemical laboratories of the driver or passengers small intestine using a terrible mixture of ingredients including hot dogs old onions radishes and potentially cat brains based on the murky musty thick smell that sticks in your nose but it's nice when you feel the air conditioning when it's super hot outside so don't get me wrong I get it I get it man I'm going to be in a car I've owned cars I've gotten sucked into car culture I've driven around in a Mercedes at the peak of my midlife crisis when I turned 40 trying not to think about my bald spot and pretending that sudden bouts of acceleration would be enough to help me escape from the inevitable truth that all humans must face which is that eventually we will be extinguished by the forces of time I've done it man but listen nothing when it comes to transportation and depression fighting compares to a bicycle holy god get a bicycle friends you won't regret it

now everybody please welcome back to the Duncan Trussell family hour podcast Shane Moss hello hey man glad to have you back here in new york city good to see you so you um you just had a show at the bell house yeah yeah it's fun the tour is wrapping up the last time we talked was or on the podcasts anyway was right before the tour and uh that was back when everyone thought i was a complete crazy maniac for doing a big long tour that was me i thought that for sure i didn't think you'd make it yeah i mean i didn't know what happened to you how what number show was the bell house show um 105 i think good fucking god yeah yeah and you've been driving from one place to the next yeah um i drove all of it until sorry sorry no no problem um i now can't hear go ahead and there we go yeah sorry about that that's okay um i i drove all of it until the end of january and then i got rid of my car and then i flew and rented cars places from the because i was just kind of picking up sporadic things here and there but yeah the first the first part of the tour i made a full loop around the perimeter of the u.s and then i made a small loop um and then i was around the midwest after christmas because i'm from wisconsin and then uh just been tacking things on since that it's supposed to end mid mid february and then i was going to do a big international tour which got pushed back i'm hoping to do more um some international stuff this fall how many shows are left in this tour um like three or four i'm doing um ashville athens chattanooga and then might be adding one to three more shows in colorado where are you performing in ashville um the moth light and i'm doing both my um good trip show and my dmt talk uh there which is just a talk that i give about my dmt experiences with some laughs but i wouldn't call it a comedy show and then i'm uh doing my live here we are podcast in ashville as well and that's kind of officially the end of the tour but i might i might stick a couple more on in colorado if you had to pick let's say you had to pick between doing a comedy you could only do comedy shows or you could only do dmt lectures which would you pick man sometimes i feel like i'm getting more and more away from um comedy i mean i think that i think that it's easier to uh i mean the the really challenging thing to me isn't creating jokes it's um trying to come up with new ideas and saying something novel and meaningful that is affecting people in a different way uh that's really really hard to do and to come in every time that you know i think i have some great new idea about how science works or whatever i'll run it by one of my podcasts guests i have a science podcast and and they're always like oh yeah so and so did that work like 50 years ago or whatever but uh i i think trying to trying to say more meaningful things is really really for me it's really fulfilling and challenging and um and it's easier to have some jokes along the way where it's harder to do the opposite to have a comedy show where you need to have x number of like laughs in it you know it feels a little bit like haiku doesn't it yeah like you're you're you're sort of in a weird way you're like constrained to this particular form that is slower to develop a little bit than the other form and i don't know sometimes i feel like god that fucking the that word comedy can in a lot of ways for example like this podcast if i told people prior to the podcast hey this is a comedy podcast yeah right remember that right i mean let's try it right now let's do a right now as just let's do some comedy podcast yeah i think it'd be fun be wacky like what would you do but i but i've had comedians i mean what it happened it hasn't happened that much in the in the beginning before people understood what podcasts were yeah people once i can't remember it was someone people will come on the show giving you setups and then get and doing doing their thing and they're like and i heard there was a comedian once who said something to me along the lines of look man i mean we're comedians why why when i see why if you when you're not being a comedian then what are you right right it's like well that's the strangest in like how why are you just a comedian too why are you just identifying as that listen we work in the auto factory okay that's what your dad was that's what i am that's what you are all right we don't talk about politics we talk about cars working on cars that's what we do leave it to other people to do that other stuff is this one of your skits is this one yeah this is one of my gags trying out one of my jokes see that's the thing so like now if we rephrase that and you go shane what would you rather be doing morning radio and telling jokes on morning radio or having meaningful conversations on podcasts that sometimes we have some laughs as well i would say no fucking question no question it's it i mean and i i mean i'm careful to sit because like morning radio can all but like go to hell for the most part there's still some good stuff out there but it's really rare to find it and whereas whereas stand-up comedy i think still has a lot to offer people it's just right now this time in my life it's definitely not what what makes me as fulfilled as some of the other things that i'm working on right i mean even my psychedelic show is like really i would say it's i would say it's like a third like ted talky it's a third like funny stories it's a third which are like very genuine and things that happen and then a third like much more like jokie you know but to do that to do like a third luxury kind of stuff and just like a regular old comedy club would be challenging yeah i think like a lot of people would just straight up leave they just be like what the fuck is this asshole you know i've been trying this new thing with comedy where i do the thing i exactly think that would maybe make people walk out you should try it yeah you might be pleasantly surprised because yeah what ends up happening is people really really seem to like it and the thing that you thought was the thing that you could never do turns out to be the thing you should have been doing all along and the stuff that you think you should be doing is actually kind of what's the word condescending to the audience because you're like oh i guess for you guys i better do this because you're not going to get this other stuff and then you do the other stuff and they're like thank fucking god you're doing that because they like it and they know that you're treating them just like you would in other words like if like you're we're sitting down at the dinner table with a group of people just be yourself right right try it out you don't have to like need to talk down to people at a dinner party where they're not going to get my stuff yeah yeah no i i um i definitely have been for years really trying to put more give people more credit because it's it's not it's not that i think that people are dumb or anything that come to comedy no i know it's it's that it's that the point of a comedy club you can have you can have a room full of you know you can go and do a corporate gig for for nasa and it they're still gonna respond to dick jokes more often because it's the whole point of it right people have been using their brains and racking their brains all week probably doing way smarter shit than anything that i was doing all week and then saturday night comes around and they just want to turn it off for a second get drunk and have some simple ass laughs and they deserve that too absolutely people can do but it's just there needs to be like some we need to start categorizing shows a little more like hey this is the style of comedy that you're going to see night so you can if you if that sounds appealing to you you can if it doesn't you can go to a different style on a different night thank god for podcasts because it saved us from like what it used to be like which was uh you know if you go do a you do shows on the road and like you're gonna do it some fucking comedy club and then you know people come to comedy clubs like they come to like soup plantation or something they're just like god it's gonna be comedy you know it's just gonna be comedy and i know like when i go to soup plantation not to knock soup plantation like i'm gonna get some soup and it's all gonna kind of taste the same you know right people think that's gonna happen with comedy right and it doesn't it doesn't work like that but we get to do these podcasts and people know us now you know what we're like a little bit so most people when they come to my shows they know what i'm like right so it's not going to be as shocking as it may be when a you know group of veterans uh in their 80s rolls in to the comedy club and then they're not gonna like it right some of this stuff i do necessarily maybe not to knock uh elderly veterans i mean elderly conservative veterans you know and now that i think about it when that happened they actually did have a good time so i don't know why i use that forgive me veterans i quit i'm so sorry by the way man not speaking of veterans and not to change the subject by the way not knocking veterans my dad's one thank you guys um but a lot of us are so brainwashed right now man i was talking to someone about this kathy griffin thing i don't mean to completely change the subject no no problem but just the idea of like shaping your comedy for a group or something right um so i was talking to someone and they're like did you hear what kathy griffin did i'm like yes of course i heard what kathy griffin did well she shouldn't have done that she shouldn't have shown a picture she should have that that's what isis does holding up to capitated heads she shouldn't have done that and i'm like i don't know man it's it's if isis were doing paper mache maybe that could be some therapy that that we introduce into it yeah this is the worst thing that kathy griffin did was apologize that was fucked up for her to do that holding up the fucking head of fake head of donald trump is it like i mean i'm not gonna sit in defender but i'm also just gonna say like i just thought it was sort of boring i was like what is all the hubbub about like and and it's i mean i just saw some video like guar did the same the same thing with obama during the show yeah he would cut obama's head off during but it's like guar so it's like well they cut the heads off of everything it's all they express no but this isn't about like this isn't about no one's offended all right okay like certainly trump isn't offended i'm like that guy doesn't care at all mm-hmm what it's about is power right ideas like i think trump cares a little you think he got his feelings hurt by kathy griffin i don't think his feelings are hurt i think it just like i think he's just in that rival remote all the time and like he's kind of fueled off of that and like spite and kind of you know attacking the haters like he's always talking about haters yeah so weird yeah honey yeah so like i'm sure like riled up up in that in that way like just more fuel for that hater fire that he's so it's so weird that the president's just always talking about hate using those words and everything it's really strange it's really so strange it's this yeah it's it's definitely part of the singularity because if not for twitter this wouldn't happen this is a hundred percent because i guess he would he could theoretically you know send out like mass emails prior to twitter or something like that or like post facebook post but it's technology you know that that is causing this this bit of dissonance is because we can't pretend that our president isn't an idiot like you you have to just be like man the guy is really like awkward and embarrassing he's like just an embarrassing he's like an an embarrassing he's like a kind of just embarrassing like it's like it's like every day it's just like well he it feels like he has to one up himself i know i know oh yeah i mean it's it's it's like the jackass guys you know it's like well you just can't just hit yourself in the balls anymore like we we're gonna need a little more than that you're gonna have to do something more than fucking fall asleep tweeting and and like not finish your tweet because you just drifted off with those i like that he was like when he was like dumb it's a real word like what what is is it like just clearly just like a narcissistic personality disorder which is which is certainly a valid or is he just like fucking with everybody like i can't tell if it's just a genuine disorder or if he's just trolling every because both seem equally valid to me he seems like a shitty like teenager yeah like just like a teenager that's just always gonna do something wrong like when he comes home he's gonna do something wrong he's always do something wrong i don't give a you know really the thing that bothers me is more right now trump is an entertaining person to watch it's in a form of entertainment i don't really care too much about him pulling out of the fucking paris thing apparently the the impact of that is going to be minimal and also it would the thing well i don't think it was gonna have much of an impact on the environment that's right i think i think that like globally it makes us kind of dicks well that's yeah that that is true it makes us look like assholes but as far as like the actual impact on the environment from what i've read it's a very minimal impact and the other thing is it seems to be inspiring people to be more environmentally minded just to fuck him up like whatever his stupid plan is i don't really care about trump right and then in the sense of like being like flustered or horrified what bothers me is the people who have assigned themselves as the defenders of trump yeah that's weird to me dude it's their adamant defense of him and and one of the first things they'll say to me is i never heard you talking about that like this about obama and it's like no then you never saw my shows when obama was president because i fucking was attacking him too presidents in general in general dumb idea to have presidents exactly and what's so but a president fine you know what it's gonna self select to create a specific type of person that's gonna get into that seat of power but the defenders of presidents those are like the you know how nerd used to be a like a derogatory term and then it became popular well defenders of fucking presidents these are like government nerds like it's like they're like it's like it's the nerdiest thing that you can be is to be like don't talk about the you didn't tell him about obama it's nerds it's like deep embarrassing it's embarrassing why are you so infected by the fucking state that you feel the need to stick up for some kind of obvious buffoon what is your driving you to do that you know yeah i mean it's one thing to just be like you know i vote i vote republican every time that's just how i vote that's one thing but then to be like no he's he's gonna save us all like he's like to think that is when it's i mean my my grandparents small town iowa you know very very limited life experience out of just this very small town upbringing and yeah and not terribly well educated and you know not uh not the most open minded or adventurous people and and they um they thought and they're like hyper religious and we're still like even when like all this stuff that are like grabbing pussies and all this other stuff that you would the which like uh you would you would think that would be horrifying to like if i if i say the word pussy on tv like my grandma is terrified right i mean you wouldn't say that in front of her at the table you'd be like yeah i was grabbing pussies right what do you call her me ma grandma what do you call grandma grandma one of my favorite things about tours is i get to grab pussies throughout the whole tour she wouldn't like that probably but they i mean when trump got elected they sent out uh they first off they went to um they went to go and and meet trump at one of his things and paid you know ten thousand dollars for a picture with him or whatever it was i imagine but uh but they sent this picture out like in a card after he got elected to everyone and was like they were like uh finally god has spoken this is clearly divine intervention like actually believe donald trump who is first off if you think donald trump believes in like religion your religion or god or any like gives a fuck about any of it like other than himself you're out of your mind right but to but to think that he's like selected by god to save you is it totally different but i don't know i think you know as we were talking about twitter here's how i do think that social media is just fucking with us so much so i used to write jokes i'd sit i'd write in my notepad i'd write a joke it'd mostly be garbage a month later i would look back at this joke and i'd have some way of improving upon it i'd be like maybe it's good enough to try out now it doesn't go that well a month later i'm going through my notebooks again i see this joke oh here's a better place for it in my act and then all of a sudden it's like a great joke and it works really well because the the non-conscious world is is doing so much more right than than this consciousness stuff is but now it's like oh here's a premise you know what rather than spending three months of just kind of playing around with this idea and thinking about it while in the shower i'm just gonna tweet out this half big premise yeah hoping to get like three retweets and a few likes or whatever and like my joke writing skills have just gone down the garbage i mean i mean i can i can write just as good a joke if i actually put my old methods back into practice right but it's just so so distract i mean fortunately now i do longer form things and and so twitter's just a way of like ah this isn't going to fit in anywhere i'll just throw this out quick but now apply that to something like a politician creating policy it can take a long time to evaluate sure figure out like what the best solution and and you're talking about so if you have trump all of a sudden like oh quick here's an idea and just tweeting out this half-baked idea and like that and it's a signal to the brain that's like well i'm done with that you know just like mind doing jokes it's like done done thinking about that idea it's done i have tweeted it i have finished that idea and uh and i think that's what uh that's what a lot of people are doing including our policy makers and everything else rather than like creating policy it's like oh this this policy could maybe benefit people which i'm suspicious that but there's really any politicians thinking that way anyway but instead they're going like oh will my twitter followers right enjoy this phrasing of a stupid idea that i have they're getting confused but the truth is like i mean if you look at every response whenever trump tweets you never it's like every 15th one might be someone being like great it's generally just an endless stream of pure hate people hate him apparently but again that's not its statistical truth but whoever's using twitter so when he's looking at the responses he's got an he can't be thinking like oh i must be doing great because like everyone is like you're a dumbass like you're just stupid man like you're dumb you're a dumb dumb person but the but the the the the essence of it is formality right it's like there's certain jobs that you kind of would rather the person doing the job express some formality right like when i go to the doctor for example i i would prefer for my doctor to be a little formal with me you know i don't necessarily want him to be like hey dude what's up fuck sit down man let's take a look at that you know like it's weird i just want to feel kind of like all right this is serious this is serious i want my airplane pilot to be like that too you know i like it i don't want my airplane pilot to be casual when he's making announcements i want to feel like he's up there fucking focusing with all of his might i'm flying this i don't need a groovy flight no i need like so so i think that like what ends up happening when the president begins to become informal in the sense that when he doesn't spell check his own tweets the message it sends to the world is or to america or the people is i really don't care enough about you to spell check my shit like the thing that you would do like if i'm sending a business email you know i'll like look at it twice let's just make sure that there's no misspellings in here because i want the person i'm doing business with to know i respect them enough that i'm i'm gonna like at least think about what i'm sending out this is the problem because them to me with twitter the impression it's giving is the guy doesn't give a shit about us because if he did he'd spell he'd see be formal there'd be a formality a kind of like practiced form out that's what i liked about obama you know i liked obama because when he was conning us he was doing it in a formal way yeah and he was like people like oh he said all the right things and he's charming sure it's like well that's a pretty big part of the job yeah that's that's much of what the job is even even if even if he's like pulling a con which is like at least it's not such an incredible and obvious embarrassment we want our con artists as an american the american tradition is when we're getting conned we want to pretend that we're not getting conned yeah right we don't want the cognitive dissonance of like look i know i'm being conned like you know like with obama it's like i'm pretty sure i'm not positive about this but i'm pretty sure you have increased surveillance i'm pretty sure that you have definitely killed a lot of kids with your drone attacks i'm pretty fucking sure about that and i'm pretty i'm not positive about this but i'm pretty sure like you're like making lots and lots of money off of this you know the fucking these wars that you that you are continuing and you and and you know but there was something so smooth about him right so but with trump the problem is is like man look you're like obvious like you are obviously conning us and then that's where it gets really problematic is people like your grandparents who are getting the con they they're they're not the problem is they're not just because it's a different world of hell or something they're pretending that the story these people are telling us is real when it's not it's not real it's the state as always doing the same fucking thing hypnotizing you tricking you jeff sessions wants to restart the fucking war on drugs mandatory minimums come on man all you fucking trump supporters out there come on like i i that that's that's where they're really gonna shoot themselves in the foot hardcore is on the drug stuff yeah because there's a million i mean libertarians were a big part of getting trump elected yeah and they are not going to have that and even pretty hardcore conservatives are warming up to the idea of of legal marijuana and everyone's kind of you know seeing it now and that's gotta bother you right man you are a psychedelic advocate of vocal you have a show about psychedelics how did you feel when you saw that jeff sessions sent out that fucking memo suggesting or saying that they have to start enforcing mandatory minimums again how did that make you feel i mean it's just like it just seems like it's just par for the course i mean it just seems like this is the same stuff that i've had to hear about my whole life i mean i'm like i i just feel like my small town midwest upbringing i got real exposure to the kinds of people that they're manipulating and trying and uh and trying to market to those people those people like really get together and vote and and uh and they're you know they work really hard doing their one specific task that they know a fair amount and then a lot of times uh it's you sit back at the end of the day burnt out exhausted and watch like whatever the dumbest thing on tv you can find because you're you're burnt out and you're fried and then you drink too much on the weekends and everything it's not like you know people aren't spending a lot of time sitting there considering all the little nuances of of uh of life not that they aren't capable of it but it's don't forget they're chomping on those fucking oxy cottons oh that's a really big thing too and then and then that's a thing like small i mean if i go and visit my grandparents this is like this is like i mean it looks like a ghetto there because it's you know there's all the mom-pop businesses are gone everything and the the farming industry has changed dramatically and and uh and so all these all these things like addiction that was something that was reserved for like um you know inner city urban youth uh you know that was it was always you know these dangerous minorities of course are getting themselves hooked on whatever but then all of a sudden in real if you look at something like math where you have like a whole bunch of open like i had a podcast on talking with this guy that wrote a book all about the apple the history of appellation meth use and there's a bunch of tree cover for a meth lab it's there's not you know these are small towns there's not a lot of police enforcement around and there's like uh there there's certain industrial products um that are used uh that that work really well for making meth that are used in um for at farms so it doesn't raise suspicion when you're getting a lot of this and then people are having to work longer and longer hours in their factory jobs or whatever like gutting chickens or this monotonous i i did four or five hours four or five years of factory work and it's brutal factory work is brutal um it wasn't and it wasn't really the worst thing that i did it was fine but it can just be like really monotonous and and what factory did you what factory did you work i worked for ashley furniture and their manufacturing um company in in uh arcadia wisconsin outside of my hometown and um you know what was your job i had a few different jobs there so i would um they're like on this table there's kind of this um this molding on it like you you put this board if this were fake this looks to be stained but if it were fake you put this board through a machine that would put kind of like the fake siding on it and so i'd do that i worked a cnc router meaning it would cut pieces into um into shapes and like drill all the holes or whatever to you know put together a entertainment system later on in the assembly line i did a little assembly work i did some i did like forklift and i loved driving forklift if i if i wasn't a comedian i could do anything else it'd be like driving forklifts and cranes and that sort of thing i like pulling lovers um what was the pay enjoyed that um well it was all kind of peace rate and so i would say i was probably getting about $15 an hour um what was your shift a little more than that overnight shift 10 to 6 fuck so you're doing graveyard work man in a factory yeah in the midwest yeah for four years yep how did you stay what what was like this is the idea was that i was going to save up enough money to go and pursue my big dreams of becoming a stand-up comedian which i was just terrified of doing so it worked it worked i mean eventually i so i mean i took a third shift job specifically so that i would drink less um and then i ended up uh like after we had a christmas party that was like six in the morning or whatever um you know after the shifts over at some local bar i was like oh i'm gonna do that and then like every friday i would next thing i know i was just going to the bar at six in the morning rather than because i was drinking too much before that so i took that third shift job you still drink yeah yeah i quit for like three years to hit the reset button and then i'm probably about due for another reset well you've been on the road yeah yeah it's you're gonna drink too much on the road yeah and i have july and august off to kind of get back in shape and everything and um but yeah so drinking on the road for sure but but that's you work in a factory if you can have some meth which is exceptionally cheap from my understanding and you can have something that not only keeps you awake and focused but there's a bit of euphoria involved too um and so were you doing meth no no no but i've done i've done aterol um just on on this tour i had like three or four aterol with me for emergencies when i had like a eight hour drive and like zero sleep and i had to get to radio blah blah blah and man when's the same thing you take a boring monotonous eight hour drive that's usually painful to get through and hard to stay awake and stay focused and you take an aterol and it just blows right by yeah and so now you can have this job that's putting bread and butter on the table just blow right by like that and and then you're even working overtime you know and and uh making a little extra money for the family and then you have like a good source of of meth and then so like your friends are asking you and then next thing you know you're dealing meth and then next thing you know that's more profitable than working in the factory is and and so this is this is invading small town real rural america everywhere and i i just having done uh about i think i did because i did a couple cities twice i think i've by the time the tour is over i'll have done a hundred different cities um and uh i didn't shy away from small conservative towns at all and it's been really interesting because these small um conservative towns that like a lot of these people like mean really well and have like you know values or morals and blah blah it's just they think that these problems are something that exist outside of their town and they're like worried about this the the stuff that they see on tv of like what minorities are doing or whatever and don't even look around that like my grandparents are scared of of terrorism meanwhile they live in a house that's falling apart my grandma like fell down these steps in this poorly built home that are way too steep and like broker hip and everything it's like your house is a threat to you right and not not like terrorists don't care about lansing iowa i assure you but they're even so like they're like oh gee here like the terrorists are moving into trampolo like like this this town of like 500 people i'm not kidding you and like they literally believe that there is like what town atomic radical uh terrorists that are infiltrating these like 500 city uh small towns and they're everywhere they just see them everywhere because it's very salient on the news i mean humans are really bad at statistical reasoning man what they're really bad at is research it's the thing is is like okay so you have this threat that you think is coming terrorism who is it and they'll say oh it's isis who is isis what is isis why is isis that's where they that's inevitably you hit a wall with them it's called the illusion of explanatory depth and we all do it what is that explain that so you can so they give people surveys and they go like you know how a toilet works and people are like of course i know how yeah toilet works and they're like well how's the toilet work then everyone's like uh no one knows how toilets work there's like two people in the world like and even that those people like you know man this is how we this is what we think is something to do with the silver knob but we don't know but but you know i i just had a i don't know what it is man i think my beard is getting to a certain length where like islamic taxi drivers are like opening up to me or something and like it's awesome man and i got into this like like probably hour long like the cab driver pulled into a parking lot to explain to me what's happening in yemen because he's yemeni and yemeni yemeni so he's so you know yemen is being bombed by saudi arabia right now right so i should say i'm embarrassed with my lack of uh unless anyone think that i think of myself as a smart person i do not keep up with what who's bombing who is the one thing that i like to just check out from he was explaining it to me in and in great detail and it is such a complex situation and it is so fucking like crazy over there there's so many different types of power and play and so many different governments like russia and the united states and iran that are all warring basically like what's happening is there is a world war you could almost say there's a world war happening a kind of cold war hot war happening and the major world powers are using like these chess pieces made of people living in the middle east to wage this war so and it all comes down to like you know or a lot of it comes down to sunnis and um like two different types of yes and a bit like first what he's explaining to me and again this is a taxi driver that picked me up i didn't fact check this it made it he was passionate about it and he'd actually taped on his taxi a book list that he had taped there so that people were like hey what's that list and that's what he would go into is explaining what had happened because he's from yemen and um so anyway uh the point is it is so much more than terrorism right you know and and and one of the things he was talking about is remember like zikari i think was his name that like the guy who was running isis do you remember that anyway there was a this name started chain he started talking about this guy zikari uh this this terrible leader like you saw him like like he was one of the main targets that they wanted to take out and all of a sudden they're just talking about this guy in uh iraq the uh just dude the deadly dude who's like the leader of all these people well my taxi driver's like no one knew who he was like he starts talking about this guy and in the middle east people are like who the fuck is he talking about like no we haven't heard about this guy who is this guy like if he's this dangerous we would know about him right but like you know i mean he's the way you put it is like this it's like imagine if like suddenly somebody in the middle east started talking about like carl french in the united states deadly carl french he's he's leading a fucking he's leading like armies are you the fuck is carl french has anyone heard of this guy right and so so it's really creepy because the insinuation of course is that you know we are creating imaginary people or we're training people and putting them over there so that we can fight this war against like russia or that we can fight this war against iran and that we're like sort of like russia iran the united states and israel they're all doing this fucking world war right now but they're saying it's no no no it's syria we're just trying to like work shit out with syria why do we care about fucking syria why does he know why did we shoot missiles at syria well they chemically attack their own people what really that's why we did it because they chemically attack their own people but like what about all the other shit going on all over the world what about all you know what why would we be suddenly so obsessed with syria this is the kind of thing when you sit down with your grandparents or your dad or people who are really deeply in in this stuff you say hey why are like not that people should like do chemical attacks clearly it's an evil thing but why are we so obsessed with the middle east what's going on what does that make sense to you is that what the founding fathers wanted that's what we want so it's fucking creepy man because that thing that you're talking about with toilets mm-hmm clearly the powers that be understand that and they're like just tell them it's a fucking talk tell them it's like terrorists they won't ask any questions they won't go five steps into it trying to figure out what the fuck it is or why it is you don't hear it on the news when people are talking about this why is it fucking why isn't anderson cooper or why aren't these people going deep and like here's what it is here's what it is there's a tribal fucking society in yemen the tribal society is sunni the shiites want to kill them the sunnis don't want to kill the shiites but the shiites are in power so there's a power disturbance but russia wants the shiites to stay in power and you you you ron is shiites so they want the shiites to stay in power and russia's powers with iran but the united states hates iran because the united states wants the oil in the middle east so the united states is giving money to various groups of people out there who some of them are sunni but some of them maybe aren't sunni some of them are like part of another group that appears during wars and that's isis that was the most i'm not going to keep going i'm sorry no that see i mean part of the thing is is that's like a lot that's a lot to take in and most people are most people are uh exhausted and you know working their ass off and also we're all addicted to every fucking thing in the world but why are we exhausted sugar to alcohol why are we exhausted we're overworked why are we overworked because i i think that uh i mean i think that a lot of uh people are manipulating um poor people i think it's like a really nice easy way to get cheap labor and it's not very i mean it's also i think that uh jobs i don't understand job why would you create jobs this sounds awful like let's get rid of jobs more jobs no i want a president who's like we are going to get rid of so many jobs yeah i mean look i i'm i'm moving to uh i'm moving to my girlfriend's outside of portland wash or oregon in and uh in washington just across the border and and uh in oregon you you have to every gas station's full service people pump your gas for you because it was part of a job creation program yeah why is that we just created that you mean that dude could have just been sitting at home and then in return i could have got out of here faster now i'm like having to wait for him because he's having to like fill up eight different cars at once so this is actually taking longer than if i was just pumping my own damn gas if you're making up jobs if you're making like trying to like bring people back to do obsolete jobs why not just admit it and like pay people to dance in front of the fucking gas station play guitar sing or the way yeah that's that would be like re poetry yeah instead of pumping ass like have them do something if you're gonna make a fucking job of the the point is man that we we the the reality of being a human being is that we are very fucking intelligent and we shouldn't and for for eventually we won't be able to have jobs anymore because it's all going to get automated or a lot of it will be and in the world so this job it's bullshit fast food gone that's a vending machine now yeah and and and and it's one person working there making sure that the thing's still running no matter of time matter of time a cold the whole fucking coal shit trump's obsession with coal it's going bye bye coal's going bye bye like we can try to like you can like try to like get into coal as much as you want but with market pressures coal is gonna go go kaput elon musk is gonna fuck up coal coal's gonna go away now i don't know exactly when that's gonna happen but i imagine that's already like the so the we're not far then you have then you have self-driving self-navigating cars now you don't now guess what no more uber jobs or lift taxis or taxis for you and now the police don't need to do traffic patrol like they used to there's there's a like tow truck companies aren't going to be as busy as they once were there's less accidents that means less paramedics i mean and these are all good things yes these are all wonderful things that's right what you don't do is then like well now we got to find some other bullshit thing for you to do when you could just cut everyone's jobs down to and say 30 hours a week is a full-time job now if you want two full-time jobs and you want to work 60 say if you want three full-time jobs because you just believe that's like that's what brings you all the value in life is to work your go for it you know suit yourself but people people should be able to make a living off of working 30 hours a week our hunter gather ancestors were working for five hours so how do you do that what are you thinking like basic basic wage what do they call that yeah i don't know that mid like the minimum living wage yeah i mean yeah this is uh i mean i'm this is definitely not a thing that uh i am confident in my ability to have a good solution well the question is who pays it right right i mean that's a very good question i think that there are ways of things that seem costly that are ultimately minimizing a lot of costs like say sticking more if sticking more money into education might or say rehab or halfway homes this might seem like a big drain on uh this is why are we putting our tax money into these like drug addicts or whatever or or like you know these uh or or even kids other people's kids that i don't i have nothing to do with in the education systems wrong and there's plenty of points to be made but the problem is is that to put someone through one year of sitting in prison in a privatized prison that's costing some what is it something like 50 or 60 thousand dollars a year i think it's more than that yeah that's what you're paying to like whether you'd like it or not there's no that's coming out of your tax money no matter what that's it and if you and so if you if you think about now someone gets 30 years in prison or whatever and now you're you're paying i think it's closer to 75 thousand dollars a year for just your average prison i mean please fact check those those numbers bombs don't forget the cost of bombs the cost of bombs the cost of the cost of police enforcement so all all that stuff has a cost the cost of someone going to an emergency room that's uninsured has a tremendous cost yeah and all of these things so uh that are i mean i wish the conversation was more about preventative um care because that's certainly we're able to say that when it comes to like military spending like this is preventative you know you want to build more bombs so that other people can't bomb us and then we have rummage sales for our old bombs to the people that we're worried about bombing well no right or or it goes to the fucking police the militarized police but yeah man this is the problem right the problem is that they've gotten us tired what you're saying is right we're tired we're on opiates we're bleary right now we're confused and bleary and we don't fucking understand the the the power that we have as uh species right that's the essence of it if we understood that if people understood that then there would be so many things that we could immediately do the paris accords everyone's like oh the fucking paris accords well i mean if like the majority of us just stopped eating beef yeah as a response to the paris accords just stop eating beef you can still eat chicken you can still eat fucking fish just stop eating beef so like a major industry gets fucked if enough of us could organize to do that you know so that suddenly the shockwaves every time stuff like that happens we organize and everyone's saying that's what it is everyone's saying the answer to it is micro organization micro micro communities that's the idea is like we have to diss we have to detach from the state this is the one of the things that we have to do is like get the fucking state out of your head forget about the fucking state they're not gonna help you no one's gonna help you they don't care about you president trump doesn't give a fucking shit about you the congress doesn't care about you senate doesn't care about you no one fucking cares about you except your friends and your community and the people around you so it's like we have to it seems like the answer would be get the blinders off that they've put on top of us so that whoever lives around you start talking to them figure out what's up how can i help you is there anything i need to help you can i help you i'd like to help you that'd be pretty cool to help you it feels good to help and if we start doing that in our little communities then then that that's a nightmare that would be a fucking nightmare for them wouldn't it yeah they would hate that i have a friend i have a comic friend named jake baker and he's always going on and on about this because he started uh he started um going to uh you know after they bought a house and like kind of not the best area in la but they started doing these community meeting things and just like going around and making sure all the neighbors were getting involved and it just like cleaned up everything and then they were they'd even have like police officers come in to explain because you know it's a bad neighborhood so police don't you know we're kind of thought of as the enemy and everything too and so they'd actually have police come in to be like hey we've been having problems with um you know people hanging out at this one particular corner it seems like there's you know some we've seen some fights at that corner is there anything that can be done and then explaining like what what goes into having to take action on something like that and what people can do and how many times they need to call in before they're able to respond and and um i guess it's just changed the entire community and then it gets people talking i mean in my my little and this wasn't my idea this is actually um this guy michael garfield um suggested that i i do this uh who's a really cool interesting smart guy um but he he uh i started doing this based on his advice is i usually do an intermission during my show because it's an hour and a half to two hours long and so i split it up a little bit and it's also has a nice like the first half is like one on one the second half is like gets a little deeper into things but one of the things that i love about it is is that i'm like you know i'm like i was scared to do this show because i was in the closet about my psychedelic use i've i've been sitting on this show for years and i didn't even think i'd be doing it for like another five years that's how nervous i was and i didn't know how many people were out there that were into this and interested and it could be so hard to meet people in your community so try to like get out of your head a little bit and introduce and make some new friends because honestly people are also like hey how do i find out more about like these various ceremonies because there are so there are like legal ceremonies and like different countries you can go to and and all sorts of people doing amazing there's there's people like working with cannabis in a spiritual way and like all these kind of legal things that that you can do and all these loopholes and learning about holotropic rhetoric you know there's a million things like this and if you just like meet some other people that are knowledgeable this is how these human networks work really well because we we we can each one of us can be really knowledgeable about the particular area here and there and then when we get together and talk about it our collective knowledge is is something really special but we're becoming more isolated now we're just kind of getting our information from like zoning out and like i fucking love netflix man i love i love television but i have to like go out of my way to be like okay you get to watch the leftovers each week and that's it and then when that's over you can have one other show a week because billions on showtime or something and that's it like you don't get any more than that because i can binge watch and just be like oh i wonder i've never seen this before i guess i'll watch eight seasons of it in a week this is the app that i'm surprised doesn't exist because like they have this app for video gaming twitch you know twitch i've heard of it but i don't know what it's about it's just video i do it it's very fun like you twitch stream video games and groups of people watch you play video games but there's like a chat room where you can talk to them and interact with them and like it's just a fucking blast but i don't understand why this is not being maybe it hasn't i'm not aware of it but where this hasn't been created for like binge watching tv shows you know like it's like yeah like i mean you could have like a mystery science theater thing with you and your buddies too yeah and then at least you're connecting with people and having conversations about it or like join rooms of people watching tv shows and like talk to them while the shows are happening and then you sort of include the community in there you know i i i think online groups of people community groups of people in your own fucking neighborhood anything that is anything that involves connectivity with other people more than you're connecting is a good thing i'm trying to find the name of this app that i just heard about actually um so sorry i was still no problem yeah no um i and and this is even coming from someone who i'm i'm not the most outgoing person in the world either and it could be like really uncomfortable for me to like you know think of an icebreaker with like strangers or whatever sometimes but if you put yourself out there and do it i mean there's there's some amazing people out there well you don't have to put you i mean like one thing that you can do is just is get the intention in your head that you want to help out and then uh something will come to you the moment you flip that switch in your head there will be the opportunity to do something more than you're doing you know i was thinking this i was reading this fucking book on the cabala and uh there's famous rabbi i can't remember his name but he was talking about how it deadly important it is when anyone ever ever asks you for money to give them money whenever ever you do it because this is the one of the camouflages this is how god camouflages himself one of the one of the costumes god loves to wear is a poor person i've had that during dmt trips i've had that message um given to me and i've never heard this before but i've had that message given to me on like four or five different trip occasions yeah that's one of the universe's favorite clothes thing clothe they like that's the caught that's one of the costumes and so when people come to you and say hey can you help you help and then you don't just have to give them money you'd be like hey what's up yeah how are you doing now they might you know they might not want to talk they might be like out of it or whatever but uh other things will you know other things will come that this is something daniel pinchback i had on my podcast recently said which i really liked is if you want to know what to do imagine you're a cell in your own body and then start acting the way you'd want that cell to act and that was one of the smartest bits of advice because it's like you know when he said that at first i thought about it and i'm like oh well i'd want the cell to be healthy so i should get a little healthier and so i started eating better after that conversation i'm like all right maybe i'll just like start eating like um just try to eat a little cleaner than i have been and then now that you're talking now that we're talking about this i realized oh fuck you don't want your cell to be a hermit i don't want to fucking sell in my body to be a goddamn boo Radley i want the cell to interact with the other cells around it right so the moment you just get into your head you know what i want to try to help a little bit more as a cell in this body which is my neighborhood or the people living around me it's kind of magical what'll happen because almost right away something will come up to you like hey you know it's the weirdest thing man right after i was like thinking this after reading that book and thinking man you're selfish don't you need to help a little bit more i'm walking into the building this guy barely know i'm talking to him i know he has turtles he keeps turtles and we're talking and he's like and i know he's kind of looking for work right now but we're talking he's like i need a filter for my turtles i'm like what do you mean a filter he's like you know a filter i'm like no one hey not everybody knows about fucking raising turtles man no i don't know what you mean a filter it's like you know it's a filter i'm like all right all right and i realized oh fuck man i bet his turtles are gonna die and you can't afford a filter for the turtle so i got home this is literally just after thinking like you gotta help more yeah and then i just was like ah fuck went on amazon looked up turtle filters they're like eight bucks same day delivery oh fuck i'll get a fucking turtle filter turtle filter comes i'm like see the guy i'm like hey got your turtle filter dude he looked like he was gonna cry you know he's like thank you thank you gave me the biggest hug i gave him this like filter it was the one of the best days i've had in a fucking month it was the best day you know because i started acting like a cell all right and cells i don't think i don't think you have to be so like focused is like i'm gonna start a community group and not i don't mean to do that voice that's a cool thing to do and if you're like i know i i would fail miserably but they do all sound like that we should listen to that person they have that leadership quality voice no if you're a true doe or whatever start a group i i just i i guess that is actually with my voice to make fun of anyone else's voice is not cool but uh but i just know if i was i know what happened if i'm like you know what i'm going to start a community group i would dread that fucking meeting with all my heart as it was approaching i'd be like there's gotta be a way for me to get out of this man i was high when i said i know i know well i i mean my main hang up is like i already feel um dangerously close to like giving sermons just during my during my act where it's like that's not what i want to be doing necessarily i think there's like a certain uh level of kind of arrogance in it too but if you can inspire people um you know that's great but but at the same time i'm like may it just makes me a little bit unsettled sometimes you know when you're putting you gotta check yourself but you gotta know well you need to check yourself and you need to ask yourself what am i right now am i am i a conduit or am i just fucking like blowing steam right now yeah that's all you always know the difference because when you're being a conduit synchronicities happen yeah when you're when you're being a conduit that's when the little coincidences happen and that's when the flow state happens and that's when you're like oh this is easy this is easy when you're not being a conduit that's when shit's a little more like you know the the bumpy or like tricky and you could feel it inside of you when you're like when you're being the other version but both are okay it's the intention that's all that matters is the intention really that's all that fucking matters yeah i mean this is uh i when i put this particular act together which is the third themed act that i've done i i thought that it's not that i didn't think i was the only person doing psychedelics or anything like that i just didn't realize how robust the community actually was i was i've done i've just been doing psychedelics just by myself like i've just been eating mushrooms by myself and writing about it for like 20 years you know and then i started doing it i started meeting all these people all these different researchers and like maps kind of took me in and and and uh just talking with all these people and people taking under their wing and ever and seeing all the amazing things that happen once you just start putting yourself out there just a little bit and just i was just following my natural curiosities and natural inclinations and just like you know what fuck it don't be scared just do the thing that you want to do in your interest like i was just scared and uh man once you start putting yourself out there a little bit um yeah that's uh there there's a lot of other people that are that are just waiting for other people to be like oh good this guy this guy's into the thing that i'm into as well now we can get together and have conversations about it and yeah you and it's like the moment you sort of give up the idea that you're the listen you're not fucking gondi okay you're not gonna do a goddamn salt march there's not gonna be a well i'm gonna do a salt you might do as i mean i'm gonna do nothing i love more than salt march when you when you were growing up we'd always take you every third of july before the july the salt marches made the fireworks look like nothing oh god i love you and you didn't you just would get like a salt shaker you could even get a salt lick and you just march and you're just walking whenever you whenever you get tired just take take the salt and pour in your mouth and keep walking but you know better times the story of the salt march is pretty fucking cool you know the salt march gondi salt march you know about that tell me more about it it's just this i mean i i know of it and i know like absolutely nothing about it in particular well gondi was trying to figure out how his toilet worked you know and so it all starts there if you really want to get into the secrets of the world just study your toilet i the um so yeah basically what happened is um uh he he the god damn uh british were set were making it so that like indians couldn't mine their own salt right they had to do it through the british empire or something is just like classic colonialism bullshit and so gondi was gonna lead some kind of like protest you know but the story goes that like it the way he was working wasn't so organized like they wanted him to do something he was gonna do something i can't remember exactly how it goes but it's just like at some point he just gets up and starts walking towards the ocean and like he's and then people are following him as he's walking towards the ocean it's fucking gondi i'm sorry if i'm butchering this guy's the essence that i like the the the meat of the story that i like i guess it wouldn't be meat he was a vegetarian but like the what i really like about the story is that it wasn't like planned the fried okra of the the fried okra of the stories he was just sort of like guided by his own intuition to do this thing and but what he did is he gets to the ocean and he basically like picks up some of the the brine in his own hand and holds it up breaking the law because he's like mining his own salt essentially right that was the fucking and that started a rebel that basically started like the domino effect that made india no longer a part of the british empire that was part of it and it didn't happen from some kind of like meetings or or strategy in the normal sense it was like i'm sorry if i just ruin that story that what i'm trying to say is trust your intuition like what you're saying follow like whenever i start following the thing that i think i shouldn't follow because i enjoy that thing too much and i should follow the thing i only have enjoyed instead of the thing i shouldn't that i do enjoy it and then when i start following that thing that's when the flow state starts yeah it's always when i'm like doing the thing that i'm like well this is what i do or should be doing or you know what i'm saying i have a hook and an angle yeah give up the angle but if you in that man that's the when shit gets really it's not by the way it doesn't have to be glorious the thing you like to do it could be video games it could be some kind of it could be anything it could be some kind of like repressed sexual fetish it could be you know it's in every area of your life there is something that you're not doing because you're afraid and you're like oh i shouldn't do that that's not really what i do i'm the blah blah blah yeah i mean well one i pretty much only do glorious shit i just like i know that about you i know that about you no you you came to i didn't know how you got it new york but you came here and a chariot pulled the lions yeah how did you get lions to to oh it's just i saw i was at central park i saw a guy and it's just it's really easy he let you borrow it or gave it to you yeah it's just like i gave him 40 bucks and like i gotta get it back there in a little bit too but but how do you get the lions to obey you they're cats no they're already trained you know if uh you know if if they act up um you gotta whip them uh that's i know that's i know that's we're gonna get a lot of angry listeners but you know they're it's either it's either bad or they eat you uh so so you know not a hard choice no and uh and it's just i feel like it's just uh it's fuel efficient for sure and it gets people thinking you know about just other ways of getting around and what are you just leaving tied up yeah mostly um i mean right now i i should probably go and check out to be honest now that you mentioned that i did i put a bike lock on but it's like a lot of things could happen it could slip right out of the collar dude there's a lot of people who walk their dogs around yeah shoot well it's fingers crossed but yeah there's this have i ever talked to you about um learned helplessness uh it's something that i think about a lot uh when we're talking about putting yourself out there because it's something that once i read about it i was like oh that was me for a lot of my life so you you uh put there's a rat in a cage and there's uh it it learns that there's a few different scenarios one a light goes off and then it gets shocked okay so it knows it's going to get shocked and it can brace for it and then it's not as bad it's just like randomly shocking a rat because it's ready for it right so a lot of stress is about predictability so so like sometimes they'll they'll have games where people like uh can either play this game and maybe get shocked or just like take it and they're like just give me the shock like i don't want to sit there nervously like waiting for this shock to happen and so and then there's another condition where um where the shock happens and uh and it can hit a lever to stop the shock so then it has control yeah and so the shock sucks but the most ideal scenario is is you can turn on a light and then the rat knows to press this lever and and then the shock won't happen and this and it will learn that really really quickly but then the two other ones you can take control away and it still gets shocked um and and you can take predictability away and it still gets shocked but it's still there's still either predictability or control in one of those or you can get rid of both and just randomly be shocking this rat and then you can take that rat and put it back into the environment where if it learns that if it turns on the light and it or once the light turns on it hits a lever and then it won't get shocked um you you could put any rat in and any rat would figure this out but this rat won't figure it out because it will no longer learn because what it's learned from all the random shocks is that life is just full of a bunch of unpredictable shocks that you have no control over so there's no point in even looking for any opportunities fuck it man you're just gonna get shocked don't be tricked by the lever man the lever is alive man and i think that's a lot of our lives right now is a lot of people that are now kind of blind to potential and possibilities people that have just completely given up and um and i mean it's easy to do it's really easy to do so teaching people how to unlearn helplessness is a really really uh tricky thing just showing like little bits at a time of how how like here's a change that can be made here's something that you do have some control over that you can take action on here's a way that you can make predictions and start moving toward a goal you know i fucking love that dude yeah that's beautiful because it's like oh that's the last thing they want they don't they when i say they whatever it may be the embodiment the summation the the the the the total of all those people who depend on the majority of us to just fucking lay back and get shocked for them to like for it to work out for us to start being like wait a minute we don't have to do that uh that's so exciting to me because that's what that's the dream right is is is is all of us are the majority of us learning that we don't have to get shocked anymore we don't have to oh i love there's still gonna be a shock here in there in life oh but you're gonna get your fucking ass shocked you're not getting it shocked you're gonna get dragged by because like you know like what happens is when too many people start being like hey wait a minute you know i don't think we want to get shocked like that anymore and they start marching then eventually the the you know that's when they show up right when you hit the force field of the wall when you hit the wall that they show up with the sprays and they spray you back into complacency you go back into your house you get back into your pattern like okay okay listen you've you woke up a little too much okay we get it there's a lot more of you than there is of us and we're gonna fucking spray you with with shit their hurts and we're gonna use sonic weapons and we're gonna fuck with you until you go back in there and just pretend that everything's okay again that's all we ask we're gonna pretend we care about you you pretend it's okay and if we pretend these things together we're gonna have a wonderful country and that's the fucking problem is because we don't want to pretend and and and anymore that's the essence of it and when they stop pretending that's when it goes from being a pseudo democracy or an oligarchy to a fucking tyranny because tyrants or that's when they stop pretending that's when they're just like no i'm a fucking dictator yeah bitch get back inside or i'll shoot your ass yeah yeah and when and that's why when one of these motherfuckers stops seems to be like kind of not pretending anymore that's where shit gets a little creepy because like hey he's not even pretending what happens if they all stop pretending you're anyway i love it learned helplessness yeah ooh that's a beautiful thing i know i i get like that and i mean the thing is is our life is so much more complicated than this nice pristine little lab setting that they've set up so it's not a perfect metaphor um and and the world is so much more chaotic nice pristine nice pristine shocking chamber yeah yeah like but but it's also a good lesson that i mean to anyone in a position of authority um that that figures out that you can fuck with people enough to just make them hopeless and uh and and then people are just operating out of survival and fear and just kind of you know checking out and just like getting through it and then you know like okay they went to work all day what do you do for work i get shocked for eight hours straight it's just as part of this job creation program that like we had robots doing all the buildings and like making food for us and stuff and so so we just so we created these jobs where we just shock ourselves for eight hours straight and then i'll love that and then we get done and then they give us a rest uh they after 10 hours of being shocked they let us go home and and uh and then they they sell us they sell us all the addictive nonsense that that does that in no way makes us happy i feel like i'm gonna have to delete that only because it's they're gonna listen to like if anyone hears that they're gonna that's a great idea what we could do essentially the the future looks like this it's basically these pain administration chambers right where there's a menu like on the wall it's like here's what we pay right for like uh we will for we will give you $50 to punch you in the fucking face that's what you get for you will punch you in the face once you get $50 yeah right if for 200 we will fucking kick you in the balls so fucking hard it might rupture your fucking testicles and that's how we do this basic uh living wage is you just have to go to the pain chambers get your dose of pain when you look at like it's gonna be weird because when you see people who are wearing like nice clothes you're like fuck jesus christ that's like five kicks in the balls you got that new mac dude that's like 10 kicks in the balls it was worth it man yeah i i mean that that's that the future future is amazing let's commodify fucking pain this is like the new the next president's gonna be like i have created more pain chambers than any other president with better payment for the pain i mean the thing is is we as i mean it feels i think it feels particularly unnatural in our modern society to kind of like relax to like sit back and do nothing it's like we're really unsettling for people i there's a there's actually i mean there's a study where they they have a here's a study they take people in and then they go i go here's the waiting room sorry we're gonna be like 30 minutes but there's like no magazines or anything like that and they're like if you touch this it can shock it'll shock you but you know so like you can touch it if you want to but you know it'll shock you horribly and they just leave people for 30 minutes people can't handle it they're just like i gotta touch the fucking thing everyone breaks everyone needs to shock absolutely i would touch that thing within 30 seconds yeah like oh well i gotta know what that shock is like that's the shock yeah i haven't been shocked in a while i forgot what it feels like to get shocked it could be interesting oh man it's uh that thing that you just said though is another mark of the darkness of the particular empire that we're living under whatever the fuck it is which is that there is a built-in mechanism of guilt where if like you're not doing anything if you're just you become what's known as a layabout like look at you why aren't you look at this layabout what why aren't you doing something you need to do something you have to be doing something and then you're like well look what's there to be done really what's there to be done it looks like everything's being done okay it's not like shit's fucking up because i'm not doing something it seems like in fact i'm not really needed at all and it's true you're not that's what unemployment is unemployment is we don't need it we don't need you if we're doing all right without you we really don't need you so it's like we don't need you whoever you are whoever it is out there you quit your fucking job everything's gonna be fine and and become a layabout yeah i mean isn't that isn't the problem like crime and these people going out and stealing and everything like we'll just i'd rather just pay someone to be a layabout which by the way people think that like people people think that like everyone's going to there's people that take advantage of every system at every single level and certainly we should sure make sure that uh there aren't these loopholes and we're not all being taken advantage of absolutely but at the same time this like people aren't living for for like work the the ramen and like you know ramen noodles and a roof over their head and like some clean water that's not what people are working for people are working for their new iphone that they want to show off and their brand name clothing or taking a girl out to eat at a fancy restaurant that's what motivates people is advertising so it's already built in the layabouts don't get that they aren't getting laid they aren't having friends because it's like well what do we do well i can only lay about that's all that i like sometimes other people want to do more than just lay about and so so there's already these built-in incentives to do more than lay about but we need what we need to make sure is that that people have the opportunity to just lay about and sit back and think and create better ideas sure let them do it who like the the fact that in this society the one of the core teachings is your job is your life your job is your life and what is the job the job is like you're working for a you're fucking working for a factory i know and that's who you are that's your i think that about myself all the time it's so inescapable and look at what my fucking silly job is the fucking silliest it's well i mean that's who you it's what and i take it very serious very but i'm a comedian i gotta tell you though man when i fucking go out i'm i got i'm you know i've got this little yard and like when i go out there and dig in the dirt and just pull up weeds oh you gotta get that hammock going out there you're gonna love that thing the feeling of that yeah is far greater than most things i've ever felt and it's just real simple you go out and you put your hands in the dirt and you like weed and i forget how wonderful it feels i do it from time to time and in other versions of myself and every time you get out there and do that and the sun's beating down and you're sweating you're dripping fucking sweat and it feels good you just stick a fucking thing in the ground and it grows i put tomatoes out there and it's gonna grow tomatoes because here's one of the big secrets that they don't want you to know if you put seeds in the ground it makes food happen wow amazing right out of the ground right out of the fucking ground like it grows on trees or something you don't clock in the dirt isn't like hey you unless you fucking work for eight hours a day out here now i'm not saying that you don't have to work to farm obviously it's a lot of work but my point is that if we all get together and start growing food for each other and like realize that a lot of this shit that they're telling us is in is is absolute brainwashing it's it's just brainwashing man it's like they want us to be their fucking servants that's all they want us to work for them in their factories they want us to work for them in their fucking pain chambers and and and and the what's insane is and this is the final phase they're gonna fully automate yeah and then what are they gonna do to us yeah what are they gonna do to us shame i i uh i don't know shock us some more no a lot of people say like one of the conspiracy theories is they're gonna fucking kill us one of the conspiracy one of the conspiracy theories is private prisons arbitrary laws right start imprisoning people who are quote layabouts and then once they go to the private prison make them do slave labor and now you have a new slave class which is cheaper than robots temporarily so that's kind of the scary thing about the slippery slope that the prohibition of drugs which is a fundamental human fucking right like drinking water standing in the sun going jogging if you make anything like that illegal then you suddenly create a situation where you can arrest anybody that you want whenever you want to fucking arrest them because everyone does drugs right everyone does some form of it everyone experiments everyone does it you can't make sex illegal there'll be a revolution you can't do it you could try you can't do it they're doing that in parts of russia though you know they're trying to do that that is a thing you can do but here they haven't gotten to that point but you can't take a substance it's completely harmless and put a five-year mandatory minimum find a substance that uh self that the people who tend to do it are uh more curious and intellectual oh that's good let's get the fucking people who might start a revolution let's get the people who like might fucking stir people up let's get the people who are going to start community fucking meetings and let's figure out something that they all have in common what do you know they like to get high all right let's make that illegal now we can arrest them put them in a private prison and put them to work for the fucking corporations now you have a slave class composed of the people who might be starting community meetings and you've solved a real big problem for your machine of death which is these loudmouth blabbermouth community salt marching shit fucks rain on your goddamn parade too much so that's what's happening and it's no good yeah well eventually too it will be like rather than stamping out license plates or whatever it will just be like we'll be crafting like these artisan like uh end tables and stuff like that for for the well you know like like like our artists will be enslaved in these prisons and I think that's part of the main big reasons why uh the importance of you and I starting this cult of ours I think I think that the importance of it is uh is we won't shock you um there's there's no fucking in our cult uh there's there's just when did that happen it's zero I'm just I'm just brainstorming here in our cult there's we don't we don't have any sex we have zero sex ever every cult is like that's like one of the things we try a different one like just no sex well Shane's cult there's no sex Michael that's all there is is sex it's a it's a big yeah it's a big rivalry between our two cults your cult's gonna have three members yeah the best three we're not distracted by your by your foolish evolutionary underpinnings I'm in a fuck cult yeah you're you're in a sex prison you're obsessed it's all you think about not our cult our cult what are what are you I mean like that's like the greatest thing that can happen to you in a cult is the cult leader finally fucks you and you're like oh my god it's real they really do fuck people in cults wow this is crazy I'm that guy I went to this I wasn't I was gonna culty vibe recently I was at this party and it was like some pretty new agey like you know psychedelic people it was where was it I don't want to say so it's very possible that they're listening right now and like they're like really a nice people like they're there there might be a person in the listening that might know and here's the thing man this is one of the problems is that first of all the problem is they use the word cult number one is like that gets thrown around a lot the other problem is when like you hear about these stories of like quote cult leaders fucking the like cultists just to get together yeah well the the thing about is is like I mean this is something that like another thing that pinch back explained that I thought was quite really smart it's just like what's happened here is in our culture people are so severely sexually repressed that instead of like just being able to have sex a lot of like guys that they cannot have sex like they can't get except maybe through uh possibly like paying for a prostitute or something because they're not like matching the current criteria for what draws a mate or because of their you know um because they're like a victim of I don't want no scrub scrub is a guy can't get no love from me right that song it never will stop infuriating me because it's just such an obvious like because I always think about that song and other species like I don't I need more than one tail feather look at the way he waves his tail feather and brings seeds to me I don't want that seed I like shiny stones or whatever the fuck it is that your mating pattern I like all the dung balls with my dung beetle male I like my male that have collected all of the other insect corpses why are you dating Tony he only rolled you he only rolled three dung balls did you see the how many dung balls jack brought to me at 15 dung balls whatever it is the whole thing is like you know cultural conditioning or whatever so the so then what ends up happening is like if you do happen upon a group of people who aren't fucking obeying the the laws that you've been taught the sexual norms or whatever then you will start thinking because god knows I've been in the situation where like wait a minute it's happening the orgy's happening I'm out of here you know what I mean and then you think oh this must be a fucking cult when really what it is is probably and I bet the people that you're with it's just a group of people that like not being an individual and like to merge together in a way that like with psychedelics can happen where you're suddenly not a one anymore you're an us and sometimes the us likes to fuck like you know when I'm like I hate to break this to you guys sometimes I have sex and when I'm having sex I know I shouldn't well this is my code oh yeah we're talking your call but when I'm having sex the animals get on the bed yeah and suddenly now it's like I'm having sex and there's the cat and the poodle and there's fox and they're looking they're there they're drawn to the energy and you're and it's weird because you're like you you're like I want to do this in private right but but you but the moment I'm not saying I do this all the time usually I get them out of the room because I can't deal with it but the moment the moment you let go a little bit and like wait a minute maybe I'm not a me maybe I'm all of us you know and this is like the sum total of my web of consciousness extends out into all beings in the house then suddenly it really goes from being an awkward thing to just kind of like yeah I guess we're just you guys are all part of my vibration and I'm part of your vibration and we're here merged together this is such a more beautiful conversation before you fucked your dogs in that story and that's when I start fucking my poodle I think I just got a few more members for my cult actually I don't fuck my dogs I didn't mean to like that um I did suck off the poodle but you know and then that's the next thing you start doing you just like want them in you want them to feel pleasure I mean that's it you gotta you gotta clear out the pipes so look I want to hear about this so tell me what happened so this uh I go and there's like this guy there that's dressed in like full kind of like Buddhist garb and everything and he's talking about like he uses all these potions to heal people and study he has all these like little vials like 30 different he's like I just scooped these up I had like 50 yeah like 5 000 of these different little potions and it's like kind of like aroma therapy kind of yeah also sells insurance by the way and uh part time shop and also sells insurance and um and so they're pretty legit and so he uh like I want what happened was is just a separate room there's like this gathering I see this separate room and there's just like this dude's like this seven-year-old like ugly ass like like old dude and then he's just like surrounded by like eight or nine like fertile women just like gobbling it up all these potions I go in there I'm like hey man let me hit all those potions and he's like going and he's like talking about what each one does and then he's like sprinkling a thing on your head and whatnot like oh yeah for sure need that one and then and like some of the descriptions there's like a big campfire story between each one one was like you know you know that thing that like the fear that that keeps you from realizing your dream this one brings it all to the surface so you can see it and and all yours I'm like oh yeah I need that my oh the fear has been stopping me from my dreams and like sprinkling and all this I'm like this motherfucker is doing all this fucking witchcraft nonsense and and like and it's working and then he's and as I'm thinking this I'm like Shane don't be a dick maybe it's like and then he's like oh see you feel that one now we're feeling all loosey goosey and real like warm and cuddly I'm like this motherfucker's closing deals what the fuck is happening right now and then he brings out this one it's like it's like uh it's like uh uh I think they call it like Cleopatra's milk or something like that that's his cum no someone told me that afterwards I was like oh no you're right and I rubbed it all over my face via the instructions I was just trying to gather some anthropological data and I rubbed his cum all over my face I'm sure of it but he was like Cleopatra's milk he's like so Cleopatra had this thing that like this milk that gave her eternal life and beauty and and uh and you know so I'm like uh your skin does look great man and so he's like so this is like you'll have this and it will be like a natural facelift and all the girls are like oh I gotta get rid of and by the way these are like new agey like head and shower armpit hair like all natural we don't care about our looks and social conditioning in women don't need to be a certain way you tell you tell one of these girls that you have a magic potion that's going to get rid of like oh I'm gonna be beautiful forever oh and it's organic and they're like going crazy and and then the dude's like then he's like after that one that was like really sealant and now everyone's like real excited they're gonna live forever and be beautiful forever and then he's like got pictures on his phone about like he's like see I just make this stuff and and this is how I harvest it using the seed of this thing and like he's got a he's really got his wrap down and and he's like uh he's and and there and he's like yeah so you can even come and help me harvest and everyone that does gets like a free bottle of this stuff I'm like oh my god you just have help me oh fucking help me harvest my cum he's just got a bunch of like hot chicks helping him harvest his his come clearly and then like to make more placebo to get more hot fertile women and his weird cult that dude's crushing on the cult here's the thing man he's way better he's doing way better than the no sex and the dog fucking cult that we're trying to create before I've gotten to that cult when I grew up I grew up on a cum farm and it's not as easy as you're making it out man you are kind of being a dick like is no it's different these days with the it no it's that there's a lot of machinery now the drought that will that will milk it no it's not the same you don't get this I'll tell you when I I remember like waking up in the morning what time going out to what you got to wake up at five on a cum farm four sometimes depending on on the season you go out there man and you just have to like sure the first dick you're like you still got a lot of energy you had your copy but by the 25th dick you're exhausted yeah and then god forbid there's been like not enough um water like the music is wrong because then you start like getting dry spurts yeah you just get like you know and and also like some some of those you're just like milking and milking and milking and it's just nothing yeah and you got to do it I come from a family of cum farmers and they're like you know try going back try going back to the house you have to be excited about it too like every day you have to because if you're not excited they're not gonna they're not gonna be they're not gonna come if you're if you're not if they get the feeling you're tired or like you're bored you're not gonna come yeah just to really just clock the clock and in and out yeah there's they're on the wall just really mailing it in there was a a wood carving on the wall of our house that said no frowns on the cum farm and you know it's just you can't frown I I like the one that says like 11 days no injury on the cum farm you have to erase it with your semen covered oh god man there's nothing worse zero days it happens that's the other thing that is kind of probably gonna offend people listening about what you're saying we're not here we're not trying to offend anybody yeah but there's a lot of like 80 percent of my audience is cum farmers and and there's a lot of it's a monotonous job you really want to have some sort of distract and distraction and it's dangerous dude because you you go what happens is do you if you ever heard of cum vertigo yeah so yes I have but just explain it to the listeners thank you it's actually I have I've been writing so the way you do harvest cum is after you've gotten a full bucket of cum and this is like you don't just think of how long it takes to get a full bucket of cum it's it just depends on what you've been feeding them but it takes a while so it takes a day so it by the way I just want to say we have been like a lot of a lot of the stuff that we've talked about today has been like a little bit like I'm not sure we know what we're talking about this is Duncan is nailing every fact of this yeah I got this the salt march I don't know but the fucking cum farm you because I grew up on one this is like this is in my life cum is in my blood so if you if you you take a you take a by the end of the day you take a bucket of cum yeah and you have to take it to the cum vacs right and so when you're standing in front of what is like the size of like those backyard above ground pools trying not to spill filled with cum not to fall in right well no that's cum vertigo because when you climb up on the ramp and you have to go out on a diving board above the cum to pour the bucket in you can't just pour it on the edge you've got to go out or the outflow because cum like when you get enough together it makes this like beautiful spiral yeah that's the point so you're standing at the edge of this it's just a good reminder why you do it too yeah you mean for you get a glimpse of that beautiful cum spiral when if you've never seen a cum spiral it is the most beautiful um it's alive this is why we do this this is why we do it but what happens and I've seen it happen myself uh one of my friends who spent the summer because a lot of kids come into work hypnotic I see you see it happen they stand at the edge and what and you'll hear it sometimes they call it the song of the cum babies and you can hear it it's like these children like an angelic choir singing from within there I think we're all familiar it calls you yeah it calls you it calls you home and I saw it happen to my friend Jake Tamir he was standing at the edge of the of the cum board and he looked back at me and he said I'm going home and he jumped he jumped into the cum it's one of those things where it's like you can't blame the guy but it's like think about all the cum in there and now we gotta empty the vats oh and they try doing fucking CPR and a guy who just drowned and cum you know what that's like because you you're not gonna once you get cum in your lungs it's over like it doesn't work like water and like but you still legally have to do it so like that was another thing I had to do is like I was the dude who had to give CPR to be blue had gotten cum vertigo and fawn in the cum vats and when they sometimes they'll convulsively just vomit come into your face you know but they're gone that's the thing I mean just uh you'd think there'd be easier ways to harvest I mean it's all it's all it seems a little quaint well yeah that's now there's factory cum factories that are doing it but it's like not the same it doesn't have the same potency right right you want the free range for sure it's it's like I mean if you want to get rid of all the wrinkles yeah it needs to be free range free range come you let them wander you let her on our cum farm they would just wander in this like over acres and that was kind of the other annoying things you have to go out and you blow this cum whistle and then they come out of the forest well that's the thing I mean as I'm sure you know growing up on a cum farm is that that uh when you just have the purists like because yeah because you go to like uh you go to like a city where they just like there's no cum around you know and so you're just getting like all the cum's shipped in yeah it's just like by the time it gets to you it's just so watered down there's all sorts of other there's salt in there you know lipstick yeah they're just all of the and it's not what you think is is uh just pure cum there's only like 10 percent cum in there and that's not you know if that you got to know what you're getting if that sometimes it's not cum at all and and that was and the other thing is you know these factory you know these cum factories it's just you're you're not getting you you don't know what they've been feeding them and you know well that this is one of the things about the cum farm that I worked on we are very specific about who we are harvesting and every once in a while a perv from the city would sneak into the cum farm because they think that we're not going to be able to tell the difference and that they were just going to get jerked off and you know right away like I could tell you know you're not one of ours get the fuck out of here I'm not jerking you off I mean this is this is the problem with having the what what are they called you know you don't like the fake weed that goes out there yes drives people crazy yes uh yeah that's the trouble with cum is like that's and that's the problem with the regulations too you have it regulated and then there's all these cum analogs and then the next thing you know you're so far deviated from the original purity of the pure magic of that original cum that that you know people are going crazy like we haven't evolved to make all this weird fake processed and then we're all addicted to all this fake cum and that's right and this is why we got to do these meetings guys you need to have community meetings make sure that the people in your neighborhood are drinking fresh cum and you you can offer them your cum and and you know that's what what what I do at all of my community meetings all you got to do is give it a name like don't just say this is my cum Cleopatra's milk yeah that's it and that it's how we will change the world together you know um it it's funny because there's uh there's ideas with um uh like schizophrenia like why did schizophrenia evolve uh because it doesn't like cancer and things like that that they don't hit you until evolution's already had its way with you you already spread your genes out so it doesn't catch it schizophrenia you're in like peak mating time in the early 20s or whatever and um and then they did they went around to uh that was probably Denmark or something like that the Dutch are always keeping like really good record I don't know where it was exactly sweet I I'm not sure but um but they what was the thing oh yeah so they went around and they found all of the all of the people with schizophrenia and then they went around and they found their family members and their family members are all like hyper religious very superstitious begin to these like ceremonial like in the traditions and take everything like very very literally it's not a metaphor it is actual reality and so it says this word of schizotypoid you take a schizotypoid person and they can in the right scenario get it channel these these things you can go into church uh or get together once a week and channel and speak in tones yeah got you and then you turn it off and then you're like you know help hunt and you know act like a normal person through the rest of the week and then got you but but but you get a couple of these people together and then schizophrenia is you know these two kind of recessive traits um start expressing themselves right and then you have schizophrenia um but it's quite possible that um schizotypoid is is what a lot of a lot of these shaman have and they were able to because because you're able to have one you're able to tap into the spirit and two you actually believe it yourself and when you believe something yourself you're able to convince others that you believe it that much more and that's not to say like schizophrony or shamans or like uh full of shit or or they have this condition or whatever it's just interesting that that that's how um we we've kind of evolved to um follow these people that are a little bit a little bit crazy in a way and and maybe maybe in the um sense that we are uh now kind of everything's kind of robotic and we have these systems in place and everyone behaves this way and and we're kind of being um you know socialized maybe it is people people are voting for like kind of these lunatic politicians as as kind of like a natural like hey look at that lunatic that like goes out there and says anything he really believes it maybe that's in us for some reason to really worship these people and for ladies to to be attracted to these guys that can kind of make themselves the center of attention and then your child goes off to become the center of attention and has a bunch of ladies sleep with him and so on and so forth because shamans certainly got laid like crazy back in the day you definitely want to be a shaman if you're older huh i see what you're saying well you know i i don't man i don't know i didn't see this particular thing go down but i mean i don't know did it what happened did you split did the guy end up like um i don't think that he sealed any deals but you could tell it's a wrap that he does very regularly and i'm sure that he's had um some opportunities in the past and it was definitely just like it was a little bit it seems like it was like taking advantage of like how did you get into this come avon party um i just uh it's some people that are in the weird different areas psychedelic worlds we got to be discerning friends listen if you if you get around to come don't as as abraham lincoln said don't fall prey to the wiles of the come shaman because you could get in a lot of trouble and it might be fun it might be fun trouble but you know you got to be it's because it's the power of come i've seen it the come that from the come that to the come vile it all contains a very specific type of uh hypnotic resonance that'll pull you in male and female alike to quote i believe it was um a martin luther king junior who said yeah um there's two things in life that i have trouble saying no to sure pizza and come and it's like it's gonna get you that's the main thing well that's what bonds all of us together that's what you know there is there's no separation yeah um once you're just talking about pizza and come um yeah it's i mean it really was it was a magical night there was a lot of talk about like exploding into fractals of light and stuff like that during it too wow and i was like i was like well i was like i was almost gonna i was gonna like call my parents you know just so they knew you know like in case they find my shoes in this weird house like what are your kids up to well justin he's doing like a computer programming and she went out to hollywood um got himself in a cum cult and exploded into fractal turned into a rainbow so he's just out there zipping around through the universe he drank so much sacred he turned into a rainbow that's what rain went that's what rainbows are whenever you see a rainbow that's someone who just drank sacred comma that's someone just projectile vomiting come across this guy shane it's always a pleasure to have you on the podcast we gotta close on that um i love you buddy you gotta i love

Welcome back to the DTFH. It's great to see you. Here's my secret. I never left. Well, then where were you? I didn't see you. I was between lines and between spaces. Oh, yeah, I was very Buddhist of you. Here's a zinger of a first question. How about this one? If you could change anything in Buddhism, what would it be? That's so interesting because I don't think necessarily Buddhism is just an external thing. It's sort of like if you said if you could change something in air, which would it be? And are you talking about the air outside here or the air in my lungs? Well, I mean, I get your response. Because I was thinking to myself, if Buddhism is true, then that means that really you would kind of have to, by changing it, you would actually be changing everything else simultaneously. If it's a little too heady to start off the podcast or too like super Buddhist nerd or something like that. But I was thinking, oh, yeah, I guess you would have to alter time space or something so that then the Dharma itself would have to reflect that alteration in some way or another. If it's true, if it's a true reflection of reality. Well, so you know, Duncan, in our teacher training programs and stuff, in terms of how to respond to questions, sometimes we say, what's the question behind the question? Is there a question behind the question? No, it was just like, gosh, I wonder what David will say if I ask him what you would change about Buddhism. I wish I could say there was some plan behind it other than just like, I'm curious what someone who's been studying this for their entire lives in considering it, is there some aspect of it where you think to yourself, oh, yeah, that could use some revision. Yes. Well, it's being revised. The ism part is being revised for 2,500 years. It has been revised and updated even just by changing languages, Duncan. You can't possibly mean the same thing in English as you meant in Sanskrit. It's not possible. Do you read Sanskrit? Do you not read Sanskrit? No, no, no. Have you ever thought about it? Just like diving in and trying to learn Sanskrit so that you could start reading the original? I'm reading that thing. I sent you the treasury of, I love the names of Tibetan Buddhist scriptures so much, basket of bountiful rainbows. I sent you that. I can't remember you know what I mean. They have the most beautiful names. But the one I sent you. It's both positive, isn't it? The vibe is kind of glowing and positive. It's the coolest. It's called the treasury of precious qualities. That's what I'm sort of absorbed in right now. And yeah, as I was reading that and thinking to myself, my god, I have no idea what some of this is saying. And I was wondering to myself, what if I could read Sanskrit? I wonder, when you're reading like that kind of thing, it has a quality of, it's like a poetic equation. And you think to yourself, my god, if there's like one number that's kind of out of line here linguistically, how much is that impacting my understanding of it? Yeah, it's like pi if one number in pi was different. It wouldn't be pi anymore, would it? Yeah, right, exactly. And it feels like the Dalai Lama wrote a forward to it. It feels like clearly like a great deal of effort was put into this particular translation. But still, it's like, my god, how do you take something from the Tibetan plateau and then turn it into English and replace symbol sets that are based on your experience living in Tibet so that a Westerner can understand it? Really a powerful question. I think it's sort of been an issue for all the great translators throughout history. And I would say that sometime if we want to go deep into this, I would have my partner, Larry Mermelstein, with whom I teach our Tuesday night vintage Dharma class, because he is a Sanskrit and Tibetan scholar and put a scholar in general. So he and I co-teach certain classes. And then he's really highly qualified. He's been the head of the Nalanda Translation Committee. So when Trungpa Rinpoche came to the West in 1969, pretty soon after that, he started a group of about 10 or 15 translators who've been working to this day. A lot of them are quite far along, but still involved. And Larry is the head of that. So it adds that kind of dimension to it, which I can't add, because I'm not a scholar. I'm not trained in the linguistics. But as you see the translations come, what you are really dealing with is, first of all, a verbal tradition, oral tradition for 200 years. There was nothing written down for the first 200 years after Buddha lived, going to probably the earliest translation school, which would be Pali, based on sort of language at the time. That is not, by the way, an extant language, as far as I understand it. And then Pali got pulled into the higher Sanskrit, more formal Sanskrit. And that carried the Dharma for many, many centuries. And then in the 8th century AD, the Tibetan, several Tibetan teachers, one of whom was watching a little later than that, Marpa, the translator. Even his name was like it was like Duncan, the podcaster. This was like Marpa, the translator. His gig was learning the teachings in India and then bringing them back to Tibet and translating them into Tibet. Now, in 1950, we have a group of people translating those Tibetan teachings, which derive from the Sanskrit, which derive from the Pali, which derive from the oral tradition, back into English, and trying to make some sense out of it. For example, Duncan, there's no word for ego. That's a Western word, ego, like egolessness, ego, which is such a big word in the Western Buddhist world. They don't even have a word for it. So what would it mean? Atman would be probably the closest thing to it. An impermanent, a non-evolving, non-changing self that's somehow part of your personal ecosystem. There's part that doesn't change a soul, if you will. And really, what Buddha was teaching was that that atman formulation was not based on anything that he could directly perceive or experience. Oh, wow. So he was like going after a central idea in the world and saying, no, no, no, no, this thing is completely not correct. Well, or that it exists but in a different way, which is that it's fabricated. But there's no unfabricated self that exists primordially. Oh, OK, so where is like they were saying this thing, the atman, is like a kind of eternal primordial. Aspect of sentience or he was saying, well, it's made up. It's a made up thing. Or look directly at it and you tell me. I mean, it's more like there's a process of contemplation of like, well, are you going to take that on faith? Or are you going to be able to verify? So I would say the real innovation of the Buddhist teachings is verification by the individual practitioner. He was doing for the atman what people who think Bigfoot is bullshit were doing for Bigfoot. He's like, well, come on, you don't have to insult people. There's no need. It's just like, OK, we're going to look at this from the perspective of prajna or discernment. And you tell me, where is it? What is it made of? How does it operate? Well, let's think about this. There are right now more pictures of something that might be Bigfoot than there are of this thing that he was deconstructing. There's more pictures of UFOs than this thing that he's. There's more pictures of the Loch Ness Monster. There's actually more evidence now in the world for these theoretical, exciting mystery creatures than there are for this thing that many people, the ego, or whatever, consider to be a fundamental element of their identity. And yet, you can't take a picture of it. The moment you try to describe it, you feel dumb when you start saying, I hate when they're like, who are you? So tell me who you are. You're like, wow, I love chocolate chip cookies. Milk is with milk, especially. They're great. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I mean, to be really clarifying here, the Buddha would say there is such a thing as self, but it's relational. It's not absolute. OK, so yeah, it happens as a property of connecting other people or being in space, I guess. It's a quality of space. And time. And time. And so it's kind of a symptom of being in time space is this thing. But since we don't. And it can become a very heavy-handed, like anything that exists in space-time, it can become a nuclear reactor on overload. Or it can become a river with boats. I'm looking at my window. There's a river with boats flowing on it. No reason to say there's no river. There is a river, but it's a relational river. It'll probably dry up in a couple of thousand years, and maybe there'll be something else there. The ball. How great PCP. He went to three waves. Shoot off all ladies' face. Then he climbed into the lion's cage. When the zookeeper found him, there wasn't anything left to put in his grave. If only he'd used Herbstomp. If only he'd used Herbstomp.

Music I was, as I was reading this book, and I'm glad you brought up that we're talking about time, as I'm reading this book and so this beautiful poem, I'm realizing there seems to be a, I don't know how to put it, a kind of structure to a lot of these scriptures. It starts off with a kind of like an enunciation of the preciousness of human birth and the transient nature of human birth and sort of tries to impart a sense of expedience. Like, look, you're not here that long. You have this little moment that you can sort of like work with yourself. You have this moment where you can try to reach some kind of understanding about what's really going on and yet this is, at least though, the vintage ones is what I'm talking about. The other one I love to listen to on Audible is the Way of the Bodhisattva. It starts off with the exact same thing, almost like, I don't want to say Old Testament style, I have like real intensity of like, what the fuck are you doing? Expediency is great. That's a great word for it. And those are called the Four Reminders of Renunciation, which is something we've been talking about recently, is what does that mean? In order to benefit from where you choose to place your energy and attention in your life, there has to be some sense of giving something up and taking something on. Sacrifice. That word renunciation is used there and those are Four Reminders to not get caught up in trivial stuff that's really not going to move the needle for you. Or anybody else? This is a very beautiful song or poem, I don't know what you would call it, but the way these reminders are showing up, they're really quite disturbing kind of if you are trying not to think about that stuff. It's very flowery too, but one of them being like, you know, you're spending your time enjoying and you look up and 100 days, they look up and 100 days has passed and they don't even think about it. You know, it's like referring to this quality of, and this brings me to like a point I wanted to chat with you about is it's a quality of time blindness or something. Like it's like the nature of the way humans perceive time makes things seem far less fluid than they actually are because, you know, we see time in this certain rate and because of that we don't see trees growing out of the ground, we see solid trees, we don't see the grass growing, flowers growing, and you know, I don't know if you've ever gotten fat, I don't know, like, you know what I mean, like if you, you know, you step on the scale and you're like, wait, what? But you somehow managed to not, you knew like, I think I might have gained a couple of pounds, like 15 pounds, but if you saw yourself swelling out like a balloon, you would probably take action. But so it's, so I started thinking, is Buddhism, as we understand it, a kind of like antidote for time blindness? You know, is it? Whoa, that's so, well, those four reminders definitely are that. They're saying, yeah, this is, this would be something to contemplate, that you, before you practice, you contemplate them and think, how do I want to spend my limited time? And you know what's a very Buddhist story in its own weird way? No. The ghost of Christmas future and Christmas past. Okay, oh yeah, sure. You look at the past, you look at the, which is all your karmas that have accumulated, you look at the future, and if you get a glimpse of the future, like I had dinner last night with a 91 year old friend, and very sharp gentleman, and he's saying, look at his body, he said, this is just vehicles falling apart, and this is what happens. He's coaching, he's a psychiatrist, and he's coaching, mentoring older people now. He used to do children and adolescents, and you have to look at, you go, that's time, not blindness. I look at him, you know, he's 20 years older than me, and I go, whoa, okay, this is a ghost of Christmas future here, this is gonna happen to me, and that's what those four reminders do. So it's not to make you freak out or feel bad, it's really not, it's a reminder to practice, that's what it is. Well, that's the, I mean, I didn't get like, it was intentionally trying to upset me or anything. If it's upsetting you, it's upsetting you because you have put some energy into not thinking about that reality, you know, not because it's trying, I mean, it would be like upsetting a fish by saying, you know, you're in the ocean, it's, you know, so the, but I started thinking to myself, oh, okay, so this is actually, like, you know, if human beings are evolving, and if part of that evolutionary process involved a more expansive view of time, if somehow we changed the rate in which we understood time so that we began to see in a different way how quickly things move, how quickly things change and could watch these things, then as a natural byproduct, I think that it would produce some of the effects that are attributed to meditation or attributed to a spiritual path. And this is why the old cliche, it's in country songs, something about you should live like you're dying or I heard some country song like that, but... Yes, everywhere. It's everywhere. But why? Well, nothing has really changed for this person other than instead of a monk coming to them and saying, listen, you don't understand how quickly things are flowing here. Before you blink, your body's going to be really old and then another blink and you're going to die, it's because a doctor said it. You know what I mean? And then because the doctor said it, you're like, holy fuck, I got to start telling people I love them. I've got to start like, you know, I'm not going to spend any more time doing this or that stupid thing. I don't want to waste my time with this shit. You know, to me, that's one of the really stunning things when you get someone around someone really close to death. Is there at least the ones I've encountered, they don't really bullshit. You know what I mean? There's not a lot of bullshitting going on. Like your mom was amazing in that transition, right? Your mom was like radiating wisdom on that eighth episode of Midnight Gospel that you put up there. That's an example of the proper use of the notion of renunciation right there. Right. And it's almost... Not to make you feel bad or guilty. I don't think... Not the point. Not you, anybody. Oh, right. Right. So renunci... So this idea of renunciation is... Let's talk about the common... When people hear renunciation, the common view of renunciation is... I'm going to give up something... Chocolate-kip cookies for Lent. There you go. And so there's a bitterness associated with the term itself. It's not seen as a joyful term. Like if there was a day each year called Renunciation Day, I don't know how many people... It's called Lent. Right, Lent. And I don't think people are really... And it's called Yom Kippur in the Jewish tradition. Everybody has a version of that where you go, hey, let's just tone down the consumption here for a minute. Yeah, it's called the end of the month for a lot of people. And you're realizing, you know, it's like... It's part of a cycle. But the associated with renunciation from that definition is like... It sucks. It's not viewed as a kind of great thing. Deprived. You're being deprived. That's it. Depriving. Deprivation. Is that the kind of renunciation you're talking about? No, it's closer to what you were talking about before. It's recognizing something about the fabric of the way things unfold that once you're in the veil of time and the unfolding thing, that it's worthwhile contemplating how you use the time. That's all. Right. Right. In the use of that time, this is where you land, and we always end up talking about the Noble Truth of Buddhism. This is where you land in the fourth Noble Truth, right? Or this is... Yeah, this is the path. Here's how... Once you have understood, even through faith, that this thing you're in is moving quick. There's not much time, and you want to find a way to spend your time, here's the path. In that path, at least from when I was reading in the appendix of this book, it seems like they were saying this path in a lot of forms of Buddhism is meditation. Is that correct? The path is meditation? Well, there's an eight-fold path, right? Yeah. It has eight aspects to it, and one of them is definitely meditation. Other ones are right livelihood, right view, right speech, you know, treating... By saying right, it doesn't mean by external judgment standards. It means like holistic, integrated way of going about those things. And bringing mindfulness to all of them would be an important cohesion factor there. That was the surprising part, at least in the appendix that I was reading. It seemed to be sort of saying that the basket that holds all of those, the eight-fold path is somehow... Like some schools of Buddhism say it's meditation, like that is the... And maybe it was... I don't know, maybe I read it wrong. I was on a plane. It was late at night. So I don't know, maybe I was reading it. Well, technically one of the eight would be right meditation. Okay. So if you wanted to make a cohesive wrap around it would be meditation and post-meditation, in the sense that you're not doing a formal practice, but you're addressing the elements of living with a kind of mindful awareness and the kind of sensitivity to the whole impact equation that you're unleashing on yourself and on the world as you move through the world. And that's where we get into what you were saying earlier. This is the interdependency idea, which is you... If you're not aware that not only are you a melting candle in the fire of time, so is everyone else around you. And in that relational quality, you have this potential to either really help people or completely fuck them up. And then the gradients of that become increasingly refined, but still within it is like you can really cause a lot of damage when you're wandering around here if you're sleepwalking. That's right. And it happens every day. And what the Buddhists would say, you started this conversation by saying, what would I change? And there could be a number of different ways of answering that, but about the actual iteration of the Buddha Dharma, so to speak, some views would say that it's perfectly iterated. It's perfectly stated. And that's kind of daunting, but nobody says therefore you just take it on faith. Nobody says that because part of the iteration is you should digest it yourself and see whether it's accurate or not for your situation or not. So personally, I'm at this stage of whatever practice or study I do, I'm trying more to fully penetrate into it than I'm involved with something, but I need to change it because something's fucked up. I'm more like, let me get a little deeper into it and see if I can find something that maybe could be... Now, no doubt things can be expressed differently in language and in culture. I think that's something that is separate from the question that you're asking, because language and culture do change. They're part of a flux situation, and we do have to find creative ways to express these things, but is the underlying statement of things as they are, dharma-ta, which means suchness or things as they are, is that going to change? It doesn't appear to me at this point that we're talking about something that's in the arena of change, actually. It's primordial. It's just what it is. It's as it is. It's just, look, if you're going to like hang out in time, this is probably what's going to happen while you're here. Here's like how you're going to get confused. If you're going to go on this vacation into time, here's the sights you're going to see, and this is probably going to happen to you. If you're feeling like weird, here's why. Then I think it's a magnificent explanation for that, and also an antidote to it. As I'm reading this poem on the airplane, I had this experience that paralleled an experience I had when I was in college where I was on acid reading the book of John. I thought it was the acid because all of a sudden, I don't know how to put it, but it clicked in me, not what he was saying so much as the impact that whatever he had been contemplating or whoever he had been around had had on his consciousness. It just clicked like, my God, even if this thing has been translated a million times, I can still feel or grok within the words. Whoever this person was or whatever they were, they had come into contact with something extraordinary. Reading the poem, I had the same experience, minus the acid, just sparkling water. It was like, my God, whatever mind wrote these words down in this order was not... That's some clarity to it. Yes, some astounding clarity to it, and then I was really moved by that, just that. You know what I mean where it goes from? I think this is probably true in any study of any wisdom, tradition, scripture, where it goes from this kind of analytical, oh, this means that, and that means that. I don't know, when someone turns the air conditioner on in the room, if it's hot, all of a sudden there's this whoosh of like you push into another experiential place that runs counter to the words, if that makes... Not against the words, but it seems... And Duncan, speaking of which, could we pause for one second so I can go open and turn on the air conditioner? Please do, I do not want you to bake while you're here. Okay, I'll be right back. Music When I'm enjoying edible THC, I don't want my mind to wander to the possibility that maybe HP Lovecraft was actually a historian. I don't want to wonder if there's some eldritch horror floating in the depths of deep space, just waiting to fly to our planet and suck our souls out with some kind of obsidian straw. I just want to enjoy a nice, relaxed, mellow buzz. And this is why I absolutely love Loomylabs, the creators of microdose gummies. My dear friends, these things are it. And by it, I mean they did what we thought could not be done. They created the perfect microdose of THC. No more wondering if you just consumed enough THC to wipe out an entire herd of bull elephants. Because they did it. It's the exact right dose. And I love it. To learn more about microdosing THC, go to microdose.com and use code Duncan for free shipping and 30% off your first order. Links can be found in the show description. Again, that's microdose.com code Duncan. I give them my golden seal of approval. Microdose gummies from Loomylabs. This is something that is always very exciting to me when something goes from being, I don't know, just like, I don't know, scholarly or whatever. You know what I mean? Where you're just reading a thing. It's fun to read. It's interesting. It goes from that to where I don't know how to put it. It's like you go from 2D to 3D or something. Do you remember those books that they used to have where you would squint a certain way and it would pop into 3D? I hated them. Magic Eye, the headache producer. I hated Magic Eye. But still, it's that thing where all of a sudden it's vivid and it's present and it's meaningful. And that is the fun part of being a Dharma student, I think, is you are not just studying some dead sea scroll, which is interesting in and of itself, but it pops into 3D in terms of how it helps you work with the energies and situations in your life in a kind of fungible way. So, yeah, I do think, for me, that's what the Dharma is, though. I don't have that fascination with dead sea scrolls. I'm not a scholar in that way. Do you know what? I think that more people would be interested in them if the sea wasn't dead. It's like something about the dead sea scrolls that makes them seem that much more musty, because it's like a dead, even though like, you know what I mean? The name itself makes them seem so old. Bad branding. Yeah. Bad branding. And really, for the sea, for the scrolls, come up with a better name. So, to me, what's really spectacular about that quality of Buddhism, which you, I think it can only be experiential. I mean, you either, which one I'm reading this, it was sort of pointing out like, first, you do, there is a little faith here in the sense that you're going to believe your teacher. If someone is telling you, you trust, this is something, you can have faith in that at first, but not like that's not enough. No. Then from that faith, you start exploring it more, and then somewhere along the line, the magic eye effect happens where you go underneath the writing or something, and then into this other, I don't know what you call it, another zone. Well, you know, when you are going into another country, you can't show them your teacher's passport. That's hilarious. That won't get you in. Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right. This is one of the very frustrating aspects of Buddhism, is that that's the problem, is, you know, yes, you have to do it. It's a thing for you to do. It's really, no one's going to, like, whatever this particular situation is, you know, there's a documentary on Netflix about those kids who got stuck in that cave. You know, that thing that just happened? Yeah, yeah. I think, where was it? Thailand? Where that happened? Yeah. It's poor kids who's stuck in a cave. I read that they actually gave them ketamine to get them out of there. Like, they drugged them so that they could, like, without, it was so dangerous to get them out. I don't know if that's true. So sorry, folks, listening, but, you know, they, all they had to do was fall asleep and, you know, they were rescued from the cave. This particular thing that Buddhism is talking about, whatever this particular situation is, you don't really, even Buddha, right? Like, even like meeting Buddha, hanging out with Buddha, if you could go back in time, sit down with Buddha, that's still not going to get you out of the situation. It has to be you. It has to be you. Well, and it's like also impossible to do. We don't have a Mr. Peabody's Wayback Machine. Right. Sherman, you know, remember that? And they go back and see Buddha. I've wanted to, I've asked questions like, how did, when Buddha was having teachings, how did people hear it? They didn't have microphones and PA systems. How did they hear it? That's a great question. I, so the answer that I got was, it was set up like that thing on Wall Street, you know, they'd have people who would repeat it for the outer reaching people. Whoa! So it would add. But I don't know, but that's what somebody told me. It would add go back. There's no electricity. Yeah. Whoa! That is so crazy. The, the, so that, those little details are so interesting. I've never even thought of that, but those little details of the story give it so much more life. Yeah. Like what that must have been like sitting in a room with whoever this was and hearing the, probably softly, whatever this person is saying and then hearing it sort of get repeated all the way back to the back of the room. It's hard to imagine Buddha yelling going like, you know, the for noble truth. You know, I mean, it's like, it doesn't really fit with the vibe, you know? I mean, is there, is there any record of like, how big were his crowds? Like how many tickets was he selling? Don't know. But, you know, there is an interesting thing also that how does something stay alive for that? Can you imagine all the other teachers who are around 2,500 years ago, who we have no idea what they were talking about? You know, and I think about that, making records and stuff like that. You go like, okay, you know, go 100 years in the future. Is anybody going to know who the Beatles were or is going to be some obscure, you know, loot player who, you know, 5,000 years from now is, so we don't know what the echo chamber is like for what we're saying. And, you know, my take, Duncan, I don't know how you do your creative work is I just don't come from that place of who's going to think what about it. Oh, God. You know, I mean, every once in a while, I have like a vision of someone stumbling upon my podcast on like, I don't know, some recorded media and like the smoldering apocalypse and for a second listening, I mean, like, what the fuck? But that's pretty much it. I don't have that. It could be 100 years from now and somebody could be building a government based on your, you know, your podcasts. If you're listening to this, please don't build your government based on my podcast. There's lots of other podcasts that will make better governments. I want to, like, what's really striking to me about that echo thing you just told me is that, and also that it's Marpa the translator and that is it in a weird way. So, yeah, you know, we don't have a way back machine. Like, nobody is yet is going to be able to go back and hang out with the Buddha. But in a weird way, that process is still happening. Like the Buddha spoke, people repeated it. They repeated it to the back of the room. The people in the back of the room repeated it when they got home to wherever they were going. Those people repeated it and those people repeated it and that repetition weirdly kept echoing through time. It's like, as opposed to like entropic echoes, I mean, that's all echoes are entropic, or we would be in a hellscape echo chamber of like listening to the shit people said to yesterday echoing around. The echo evolved or something, didn't it? I mean, I guess it goes back to that question, like what would you change? The echo transformed into not just different languages, it transformed into different forms, different styles, different modalities. Rituals, different rituals? Different rituals. So what a wild echo. So in the echo itself, and I'm sorry, is that the Buddha? In the same way, if you heard my voice from a long distance echoing around, I would still somehow be wrapped up in that voice. Yeah. I mean, I know you've had Professor Thurman on your podcast. Yes. I can imagine him saying, I have heard him say, that the Buddha is molecular. It's literally saturating every molecule. So some of these drawings, like literally, there's tiny little Buddhas in different parts of what you would think of as a Buddha, and in different parts of space, and in different parts of situations. So thinking of it as something that's a kind of saturation and only way down the line is it moving into the world of form. We pick up things in the world of form. It's like a bowling ball comes down the shoot, and you pick it up and you throw it at the 10 pins. But way before that, there's just the lay of the land. There's the 20 alleys in front of you. There's space. Right. So the question is, picking it up in the realm of form, you're really tracking it back to the realm of formlessness. That's what we're really doing with practice. We're using the crumbs of form to go back to the realm of formlessness. Right. Right, right, right. That's so interesting. You know, they talk about the tip of the iceberg or whatever, but in this case, it's like there's just the tip, and then there's no iceberg. Yeah, and you're on the Titanic, and you say, I don't get it. This is that little thing, that little white triangle on top of the water. What's happening to the boat here? It's going down, you know. Yeah, yeah. We don't see, you're right. We don't see the full thing. And a lot of things are like that. Aren't teeth like that? They have roots that go really deep into your gums. Trees have roots that go deep into the ground. We tend to see the surface form. But you know, it's like just that echo, like people repeating what he's saying and it going to the back of the room is so intense. In the sense that, like, what that would mean to me is that if you are hearing the Four Noble Truths, you are sitting in that room. It's a very big room. That's right. And a very old room, but you're still sitting in the room. That's, you know, that's exactly the way communication really happens. It ripples out probably endlessly through time and space, but becomes fainter from an obvious point of view. And some of the things that the Buddha iterated probably are very faint to the point where they're almost like a watermark on a piece of paper, like the average eye, the average perusal will not pick them up. They're more subtle. And, you know, that's the notion of things like terma, treasure teachings in the Tibetan tradition. There are subtle imprints of this kind of intelligence that, you know, they have to really listen pretty carefully to pick those up. Right. Right. Okay. So then I'm glad you said that because then I'm glad I've never really talked about those treasure teachings. Can you maybe explain to people terma or what the concept of treasure, treasure teachings is in Buddhism, another awesome term, so many cool terms, treasure teachings, compendiums, flowery barrel of life or whatever, but treasure teachings. So can you explain what that is? Yeah. Well, treasure refers to like a very potent value that's attributable to something. Right. And we often have the notion of hidden treasure, right? And that's like any pirate lore has hidden treasure. Yeah. So the notion of something being there that has this kind of richness, this kind of potency, and yet it's not immediately apparent might involve a search, you know, actually of some kind of deeper dive, so to speak, like in pirate lore. And then what's in that? Well, it could be material things, but it could also be wisdom. The treasure, the idea of terma is some kind of wisdom is packed, bundled, into a form that can be revealed at a later time by somebody who can uncover it, rediscover it, and through various methods. And that's called terma or treasure teaching. And the person who does that is called a tertun, which is somebody who's a treasure revealer, that means somebody who can reveal that. And that's a very rare, but, you know, noted phenomenon and noted teachers that have that attributed to them. That's part of what they do. Is it kind of like in physics or something? You, from like one equation, you can extrapolate all of these other ideas in physics. And sometimes people just using like these fundamental equations realize there's an implication that hadn't been understood yet or make a connection, or is it literally like somehow? Because this is my dumb idea of what it was until what you just said, is I thought it's like they literally find like a dead sea scroll, or they find like... Ah, well, see, so there's a couple of different kinds. I'm just telling you from the tradition itself, I'm not, you know, making this up, but classically there are different kinds of terma, and some are in the form of scrolls written down. Literally, there's instances of people diving into lakes and pulling them out of the bottom of lakes, putting their hand into solid rock and pulling them out of solid rock. That's one kind of terma, and then there's another kind that's called mind terma, which comes into the consciousness of that teacher very directly. It would be probably closest to what we would call channeling or something like that. Okay. And, you know, for example, Trungpa Rinpoche was a teritun, acknowledged as such, and he would just start reciting these things and didn't claim any authorship of it. You know, she's not saying, this is some sort of feeling, this touchy-feely kind of thing, and I want to give it words to it. The words just come streaming out. Yeah. And so they're considered intact in a way. So, okay, so this, okay, so this, again, it goes back, and I'm glad we're talking about this, because I love thinking about Buddhism in terms of time, because if our human understanding of time is past, present, future, but is limited, which it clearly is, I mean, it's not like hippie-woo-woo-shit to say that there's other dimensions where time probably functions differently than the way it functions in this dimension. We, where the potential for seeing time completely differently would be there if there was some sensory apparatus in that whatever that was. I can tell you one of those right off the bat is called old age. What do you mean? You see time differently. Oh, right. Yeah, right. The older you get, the more... You're in a different domain. You do not have the same sense of time and kind of expanse and kind of, you know, no particular issue. So the whole realm that we are in is a funnel towards appreciating the value of time or becoming oppressed by the lack of awareness of it, as you said earlier. So in this case, these treasure teachings, there is this... If you look at the thing outside of time and imagine that whoever the Buddha was had this outside of time capacity, then if that's the case, then it would be an easy thing to give these talks not just for the current place, but to like give the talks infinitely out. Sure. And that's what you would be picking. If you had the kind of microphone or, I don't know, sonic telescope or outside of time kind of ability, then you would in real time be listening to one of these teachings as though you were in the very same room. That's right. Only other people can't hear it. Well, and that, you know, there's something definitely to what you're saying. And again, coming to the classical definition of Terima, often they're considered to be revealed at a time when they will be most useful, most valuable specific teachings. And in the Tibetan tradition, there's one teacher in particular named Padmasambhava, who you have a connection with, you know about Padmasambhava. Yes. He was probably, he was thought of as a Buddha, you know, in Tibetan culture, and he was an Indian teacher who is, you know, credited with having brought the first iteration of the Buddhist teachings to Tibet, and very powerful kind of, you know, multi-dimensional kind of being. And he had 25 close disciples, supposedly, and he buried a lot of treasures, treasure teachings, specifically with a sense of when the future, you know, what would need in the future. And one of those quite frankly, which I've been thinking about today for some reason, is that the Dharma moving west, coming to the western, it's such a big event. I think we've sort of taken it for granted so far. We have headspace and calm and all of these meditation apps, but the Dharma has moved into a completely new civilization within the last 70 years, period over and out. And it's just the beginning of that, that, you know, who knows where we'll come from that. Look, it's, it's, it's, I'm going to try, unless you haven't memorized, isn't there like a famous quote where it's like a prophecy almost or something? Well, the iron bird flies, the Dharma moves west. Is that the one you're thinking about? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, when the iron bird... It's also a Hopi prophecy too, you know? That's an interesting aspect to that. I didn't know the... They said that the, the red man will come from the east, something like that. Whoa! So when Karmapa met the Hopi elder, that was like quite a, it was quite a powerful, you probably can read about it online. But you know, here's the thing, Duncan, this is, this world is a magical place. Right. You know, it is, it doesn't take a lot of letting go, just simply observing, tasting summer corn, you know, talking to a friend, watching your kid learn how to swim. If your heart and mind are open, you just see this level of complete auspiciousness that's, that's saturating everything. Right. Well, I mean, this level of auspiciousness that you're talking about, this is the other thing that I love reading about in these scriptures is, within the structure of the thing, it generally, I've noticed it's pointed out in more, not just in the one I'm reading, but in the way of the Bodhisattva and some other ones I've looked at that in some periods of time, in some Kalpas as they call it, there are no Buddhas. It doesn't even happen. There's not even, there's not there. So if you, if you, if you incarnate in one of those times, you don't even have the hope of like coming into contact with this stuff, probably in the sense that there wasn't anything there. No one came up with it. There wasn't. So if you're even born in. That's right. To the time, then, and it's weirdly, you are kind of born into the temple or the room that Buddha was giving these talks in. Like you're just way in the back. Your karma wasn't, you're in the cheap seats, baby. We're in the cheap seats. That's the Kali Yuga. We're in the cheap seats. We're like, The average thing would be you're in the bleachers in the Kali Yuga. You're not even in the parking lot. There's not even a ball that's going to get a big homerun that's going to come out and hit you in the parking lot. You're sort of on the other side of the river and there's no game going on. You're on the other side of the river and like trying from like the distant den. No, no, nothing, nothing radio silence. So you just know, but you know, there's some, there's a game going on right now. I'm pretty sure. I mean, your people are talking about the game. People are saying, look, there's a great, it's happening. It's, it is. I mean, this has been my, on psychedelics, whenever I've like brushed shoulders with this, it's always like, oh shit, it's happening now. And then I think, oh, I don't under. That's always seemed confusing to me a little bit with Buddhism where it's like, Oh, right. It's now like the things happening now, not just like being the present moment now, but literally like, Oh, it's now, like whatever the thing is, is now when they're drawing the sand mandala, they're not memorizing. It's not coming from some, put the dot here and then the dot there. It's more like they're looking at something and drawing it. When you're telling me this, it's not like he's memorized these things and then is repeating them from memory. It's like he's listening or something or it's just or transmitting from something that's now. Well, that's why I think, and you've probably felt or heard me communicate this before, that a great place to apply energy and, you know, effort is just getting people to be more curious about their experience that they're actually having. And I call that meditation, you know, if that's a fair way to think about meditation, just be curious about what's happening in your field of experience, in your sense fields, in your thought realm. You know, it's the four foundations of mindfulness. It's the body, what's happening in your body, what's happening in your emotional body, what's happening in your mental activity and what's happening in the phenomena around you. If you could just be curious about that and not have so much momentum that you think you know already, return to a more, a more direct observation post. I think the Buddhism would reiterate itself automatically. That's where it comes from, it comes from that. You would have Buddhas, you would have the same cycle go around again of somebody saying, oh, let's see what is true about the experience that we're having. A, there does not seem to be a trace of a solid fixed identity in it. B, mistaken identity creates suffering and for oneself and others. C, there is some kind of unfabricated quality to the ground of our experience that's got the texture of awareness and kind of luminosity and vividness and it's just there. It's not something you have to make up, you don't have to take anything to see it, you don't have to block anything to see it, you don't have to make it something happen to see it. Just be curious. So that's why you know me, I'm trying to get people just to sit down. Not that I'm like on some religious zealot thing about Buddhism or something, but when you do sit down and when I do it, you know, and sit down and I clarify the situation that I'm not trying to accomplish anything right now, I'm just trying to be here and I'm just trying to be curious and not resist what's happening and see the nature of it, that this is, has the possibility to actually transform the situation because we're always trying to manipulate it, usually. Wow, right. So that's why we do all this. That's why we're doing Dharma Moon. That's why we're doing these teacher training programs. That's why we're having spaces, you're offering spaces where people can get together and sit and you're not feeding them any kind of doctrine at that point. That's too late for that. Once you start meditating, you should put the book down. Right. Yeah, that's, yeah, that's what I love about the silent meditation as they call it is that there isn't a way. You can't, there's nothing to put in. Like, what are you going to, what are you going to add to the silence? What is the, what's the subtext? There's some great stories there since we talked and invoked Marpa, the translator, since he seems to be in the room. Marpa studied so hard, Duncan. People were so serious in those days, you know, and he studied so hard and his whole thing, I'm going to bring this back to Tibet and I'm going to translate it into Tibetan and I'll make a good living for my family and I'll be, you know, doing some valuable thing, you know, and he's in the boat crossing a river, you probably have heard this story, right? Yeah. And he's got all those books that you're reading and all those texts that were hard earned and there's a guy in the boat who's jealous of him, you know, a kind of competitive student who accidentally quote unquote knocks the books into the river. Oh my God, Marpa, I'm so sorry. Oh, did I knock all your books in the river? But that moment is regarded as part of the teaching as much as him collecting them. It's not, you didn't need to collect those books. You needed to collect them. You need to read them. You need to study them. And then you need to drop them in the river and see what, how much of it is really manifestable within the realm of your own understanding and experience. So that's part of, you know, that's sort of the touching and going, you know, you connect and then you also let go. But I think the sitting thing, I still will probably take less breaths, encouraging people to incorporate some kind of sitting practice into their lives, even if they could have to squeeze it in or, you know, maybe do a little less of something else, even sitting 20 minutes a day opens a gate to just that kind of sweet naive curiosity about what's happening in your own state of mind. There's no aggression in it at all. It's not trying to conquer anything or trying to, you know, get higher or lower or, you know, push somebody out of the way. It's just, it's that beautiful, children have it. Well, it's like that, it's like a little thought experiment. Imagine you really don't know what's going on with you. Yeah. That's easy for me to imagine. Yeah. Yeah. What if you don't, but a lot of people think they do. You know, I certainly do. A lot of people are like, well, I'm feeling this because of this. And I feel like that because of that. And it's obvious that's what's going on. I mean, even the notion that may just maybe the reason you think you're the way you are, that you know what's going on with you could not, it might be off a little bit. It might be, in fact, completely wrong is already semi-liberating. I mean, that's kind of. An awful little bit is semi-liberating. Yeah. Even an awful little bit is okay. Yeah. Just you might not really like have it all figured out regarding your own internal landscape or why you feel the way you feel. It might not be because of fill in the blank. It might not be because of whatever you think it is. I mean, just that alone is like exciting. And yeah, kids, because they haven't solidified. Yeah. They don't even know what's going on. They don't know what to think or what they're doing or what it is. I mean, the baby laying in the crib barely knows what it is. Yeah. How are your kids? Oh, they're great. They're great. They're about to start school. They're both very excited. What kind of school like kindergarten? Preschool. They go to preschool. The youngest goes three times a week. The oldest five times a week. It's been a long summer. You know, kids want to be around kids. It's like at some point being around old, like old people. You know, they love us. But I mean, you know, like when they're at the playground, they're like not excited because the adults that are there, they like the other kids that are there. So yeah, they're doing great. You know, I gotta tell you, David, I had a flash. But first, but before I say that, okay, let's go back for a second to this theoretical sermon. The Buddha is delivering in some place. Yeah. It's a big, it's a big enough crowd that you got to have like these people like echoing what he's saying back through the room. But let's go to the Buddha. Who is he listening to? What's it coming from? When he's speaking, where like he's not, is he, what's he echoing? Like what is, what is that? Great, great question. You know, there's some, there's some clues in the Buddhist teachings like in the Lo Jiang slogans, you know, contemplate the nature of unborn insight that just came to mind when you said that. Regard all phenomena as dreams between sessions be a child of illusion. You know, coupled with the idea of not blaming everybody else for your stuff is this idea of recognizing the unborn nature of experience, the kind of un-fabricated part. So in, in my sense of it, if somebody was able to have their mind clear, you know, and not chasing phenomena, not chasing projections, the way that they express themselves would have complete fruitional quality to it in terms of the potency of their communication, whether it's artistic, whether it's Milo Reba singing songs in the mountain, whether it's the Buddha giving these doctrinal, you know, discourses, whether it's the Buddha sitting there in Samadhi while Avalokiteshvara gives a, the Heart Sutra doctrine. It could take a lot of shapes but the essence of it is the state of mind and that is something that's part of our tradition is transmitted directly from teacher to student and that's less, it's less discursive, you know. How is that transmitted? Yeah, you know, it's, there's, there's no fixed way actually but it's, you know, sometimes called pointing out or the nature of mind kind of instruction is part of the, you know, tantric tradition in Tibetan Buddhism where something about the actual essence of consciousness is directly communicated and the experience of it is somewhat non-dual, you know. It's like, they call it the meeting of the minds. Right. Yeah, so it, and it's non-conceptual. In the, in the sense that like, non-conceptual in the sense that it's, it's like, it can't be articulated non-conceptual? Usually when it's articulated it's sort of more like poetry, you know, or songs or some kind of art expression, you know, like for example calligraphy or tea ceremony or, you know, all these forms that have come up as a way of presenting a container in which that non-conceptual experience can be recognized and not clung to but just recognized. So that's, you recognize it and you let go, that's the way those teachings happen. There's nothing to hold on to. You, okay. So that meeting of the minds thing, it's interesting. Buddha remembers his past lives according to pretty much every, every story. I don't know where there's a disagreement with that. He apparently had full memory of all his past incarnations. How, I don't mean how did he remember it in the sense of like, how can you do that? I mean, when he was remembering his past lives, is there any record of what the experience for him of that remembrance was like? Was it the way I remember Christmas a long time ago? Or how perfect was the memory and was it such a powerful memory that he, that there wasn't much of a distinction between the life he was in as the enlightened being in the previous lives? Well, your guess is as good as mine, but I'm going to go with first thought, best thought here, which is I thought of clairvoyance. You know, that term clairvoyance, it means clear seeing really. And we all, I think, have some experience of that where there's just a certain clarity to a memory, to a thought, and there's no real good reason why you're able to access it, you know? And it could be you have a memory of a childhood event or something like that, or something that hasn't happened yet. Right, precognition. I think most of our friends out here will have some kind of experience like that, where they go, wow, I kind of, I had this memory, but it hadn't happened yet. And then so-and-so called me later that night. Little trickles of that. And the instruction is to not really focus on that. Not really try too hard for that. Because then you just end up like, oh no, how can I reproduce that? Yeah, I don't mean personally, like how do you remember your past lives? I mean, I can't afford that many therapists, I'm sure it'd be a nightmare. I'm talking about how did he remember? And not how technically, but how, what were the qualities of those memories? Is there any record of- But I'm going to still stay with it. You know, where there's a quality of spaciousness in the mind where it's not cluttered. Okay, so in that spaciousness, it's the same kind of space that the pterama come in, that the insight comes in, that the intuition comes in, that the memory comes in. We dissolve part of the meditation practice once you get your mindfulness thing groove going, is to allow enough space so that your mind, it doesn't, you don't need to reclutter it every time you recognize a certain kind of spaciousness in it. And you know, think about the last time you wrote a piece of music. Where did that come from? Nowhere. Did you write that thing that's on your podcast with the children singing it? Probably children singing? Oh no, that's John Jones. Where did it come from? That's the People's Temple Choir. Okay, listen, David, this is the- Okay, I know what you're saying. I just, the weird flash that came into my head was, oh my God. Here, is that, is what enlightened? Like, if there's this possibility of enlightenment, and if the Buddha was enlightened, as whatever that may be, and then after that realization, whatever comes out of your mouth is going to be, to the right ears, some kind of Dharma teaching. Right. Then, what that implies is that like, when you get enlightened, you just are sitting on this, you're now giving, not like you're meaning to preach or something like that, or meaning to give some certain or something like that, but should you get enlightened, and if part of getting enlightened is you remember all your past lives and your theoretical future lives, and I'm sorry, I'm being way too, I'm going against everything you're saying. Let me jump in. I think I know where you're going, and I would just say intentionality, motivation, and spontaneity become utterly cohesive. That's so cool. Does that make sense? Oh yeah, totally, totally makes sense. Yeah, totally makes sense. It's really funny to think of like, it's fun just as a thought experiment to think from the perspective of the Buddha. You know what I mean? It's like, you know, just sitting there like talking, and then all of a sudden there's people, and then all of a sudden they're like echoing what you're saying back, and it's just funny thinking about that, but also you can remember your past lives, and also you can see everyone in the audiences, or whatever you want to call it, in the lecture halls, past lives, and their future lives, somewhere in there you're not going to really think you're different from them. Yeah, because that would bust the flow pretty good. That identification of me as like separate and different is where, you know, that crack then evolves very rapidly into a kind of very powerfully constructed dualistic festival of, you know, which we call samsara, you know, and that's where we live. We live there, so we don't want to disrespect it, and we don't want to like, you know, kind of just say, oh, it's just a thing, you know, you want to really give it its due, but I don't think it's the root of the tree. You know, the root of the tree is definitely more closer to a non-dual kind of experience, or interdependent experience like you're talking about. Even with people you don't like, that's true. When he, okay, so when he's giving the sermon, if you imagine you as him, then suddenly you could think, oh my god, he's not just giving it, he's listening to it. He's not just, he's not just saying it, and people are going back and echoing it. He's going back and, like, he's somewhere in there. If you're, I mean, just imagine, theoretically, that expansive realization of just seeing like this web of interconnectivity with everyone in the room, who they were, who they're going to be. My god, somewhere in there, you wouldn't know, he's not thinking, I'm the Buddha. He's not, you know, there's no sense of like, it's me. It's, I'm, he's the voice underneath everyone's mind. Well, you know, Rinpoche used to call it grain of sand at that point. Or like a grain of sand. The whole ocean is there, you know, it's vast. The vastness is, is not oneself is vast. The vastness is oneself is kind of reduced, and therefore the, you know, everything else is. But here's the thing, Duncan, that I really want to just say, and not to get ahead of ourselves, because as you know, I want to get people to start at the beginning, and actually learn to work with their minds, and really be responsible teachers. Yes, yes, of course it is. But having said that, what you just said is imagining yourself as the Buddha. There are like hundreds of Vajrayana practices, in which that is exactly what you are doing. That's cool. First you imagine yourself as the Guru. You know, you, you, you develop that kind of strong sense of connectivity with the Guru, who you respect and admire as, as, as if that person were a Buddha. And then you visualize all kinds of deities, you know, that are, that are enlightened beings, really, enlightened aspects of reality. And in some cases, at the end, in almost every case, they dissolve into you. It's called a front visualization, and then they, and you're there, and they dissolve into you. In some, you're already a deity in the visualization, and, and in some, you arise as the deity. That's what they say. So you, you finish your practice, and now who are you? You're, you know, you're Avalokiteshvara, or you're some deity, and you, and I've asked my teachers, does that mean I'm in the shower, and that's who I am? Yes. It's, it's, Avalokiteshvara is taking a shower. And what's the biggest obstacle is our own doubt, and aggression, and habits about our own worth, and our own, you know, we can't think of proclaiming our nature as something that's, that's splendid without clinging to the thought that I'm not worthy, you know? Right. Somehow. And, or I'm, or pushing our way towards a sort of exaggerated sense of worth. Right. So these practice gradually familiarize yourself, familiarize yourself with the atmosphere of the deity, and the mood, and the feeling of it, and then allow that to permeate your atmosphere. And that's quite a, you know, a strong statement about one's inherent Buddha nature, being something that you're actually practicing from that ground, not to that ground, not towards that ground, from the ground that Duncan has that Buddha nature already. Right. Yeah. I'm, again, yeah. Like, it's, you know, I'm not, I don't know about the Avalokiteshvara. I don't know if I can go there, but I could definitely just think, oh yeah, I get it. I'm in like a massive, a thousand-year-old audience hall listening to the Dharma talk given by the Buddha right now. And it's like, it's you. It's, it's like, I'm listening to it in that way. I could do that. Like, I can get there. And then in that case, it's a very sweet thing. Because look, you know what my number one bummer has been regarding, not just the Buddha, but Neem Krali Baba, all these stories of like, they, they get to meet the person. It's like, what's wrong with me? I didn't get to do it. But then, if you just think, you did. This is why they're celebrating. If you're born in a time where there's a Buddha, you're there. You're already in the room. It's a room that looks like time, and it's gigantic, but it's no different than the very same room, right? Like, that's the present moment. That's the room. And that's also called, since we're sort of in this part of the zone for a minute, sacred outlook. In those, in those Vajana teachings, you transform your ordinary perception of the, oh, this is just me, just told me with my, you know, into everybody in it is some kind of enlightened manifestation. And the atmosphere, and then you take very good care of the whole situation. You treat it with respect and dignity. And again, this is gradually restoring. It's like restoring a Rembrandt by removing layers of those little dabblings that people have put over it for centuries. You know how they restore a painting? Yeah. Right? Somebody painted right over a Rembrandt. That's what we're doing. Got it. I got it. That's cool. So again, I'm going to just keep coming back. Where do we start from? We start with the painted over version of the Rembrandt and take a good look at it. And I think if we can encourage people to just sit down, do the basic mindfulness practice, you'll realize that everything else that the Buddhist teachings are embedded in there and emanate from there. If we don't start there, then our imagination, our fantasy life takes over and we're just creating another kakamemi situation. So somehow starting very basic is really super important. I can't emphasize that enough. Well, I mean, that's an exciting way to think. I love the idea of curiosity. And I love thinking of meditation more in terms of like, look, you mind that you're time blind and so you don't realize you're sitting in that room with the Buddha probably. That's okay. Whatever. What happens if you just listen? Yeah. And then, and also I think, what would you do if you, aside from pretending you're the Buddha, which is lots of fun. I mean, what would you do if you were smart enough to know, oh shit, I'm sitting in the room with that being. How would you be acting sitting in that room? What would you be doing? How would your voice sound? Or what would you be, what would be a natural, not like a forced kind of formality, but how, what would spontaneously come out of you if you were like sitting in the front row instead of. And what comes to mind, Duncan, is what with the next thing you did after you got out of there and re-entered your life. Use the bathroom. Try a long lecture. I gotta pee. Yeah. For some reason, when I do those kirtans with KD, I can sit there for two or three hours without having to pee. It's a magical situation. Yeah. When I go on stage, it's the same thing. When I'm doing stand-up, it just goes away. It's very interesting. And you've been doing a lot of stand-up lately, right? Yes, I have. And what's it like? I love it. I love it so much. I don't like pain. So I don't like the beginning phases of stand-up, where you're working on jokes. If you want to refresh your set, you have to come up with new jokes. You might have figured out a way to make that hour work mostly. And that's why I love the process of stand-up. So I really enjoy the editing where you, and it's a real wrestling match with your ego because there might be things you're saying up there that have not been getting laughs, that got laughs once. And you're like, oh my God, this is a very funny thing. And then it's like, it's not getting laughs. Like, why do I keep saying it? And realizing the more you cut that stuff out, the more compressed the thing gets in a good way. That's tiny, right, yeah. You're saying that you can write jokes, right? You can make up jokes? I mean, people would argue with you if you said that I can write jokes, but I like to think I can. I think that's, you know, I know comedians, I love comedians for some reason. I love to laugh. I'm not alone in that. But I don't think I could compose a joke. I could compose music at the drop of a hat. You could just say, I need this song done. But how do you compose a joke? What's that process like? Okay, here's how you do it. It's as easy as easy as you could be at first. I mean, like on paper it's easy. Everyone, you know that story, like when you're telling your friends, and you know you've told the story before. I don't know if you do that, but you've told this story before. They have heard you tell the story. They like it so much, they don't go. You're telling the story again, because they want to hear you say it again, because it makes them laugh and it makes you laugh. It's part of a ritual of friendship where your friend will let you do the story again, and you like to hear it. So those, a lot, those, you could just, anyone could write down, what are those stories? Even if you can barely remember, it's like you're talking when you're out with friends, or on a date, or whatever, the funny story you tell. Now that is a joke. It's probably an unrefined joke. It probably needs a lot of work. It might not have strong punch lines, or whatever. But if it gets, if you've told it more than once, not on stage, just to people, and it's gotten laughs when you tell the story, you probably have a joke on your hands. Then bringing that in front of a group of people, and holding their attention to it, probably means that within the story, you need to find moments to put little mini punch lines into the story. You got to make it funnier. So then the evolution of the joke would be understanding points in the story that you could elucidate to make them funnier, and cutting out places that don't need to be there so that it's more funny than not. Take the air out. And then for me, the process of stand-up is like those compressing those stories down into a point where there's enough funny beats in them, and hopefully the story itself crescendos to some real punch line at the end of the thing. You nail it. Right, exactly, yeah. So learning how to do that is learning how to do it. There might be a similarity with giving a good Dharma talk, because you want to be able to get to a point where a certain perspective is delivered and clearly like, okay, that was it. Now I understand what the renunciation is really about. So I'm thinking, I'm wondering if there would be a way to create a new art form, which would be a Dharma talk that's also a comedy act. Could they be integrated? Listen, I don't think so. No. It would be a new form though. You'd be like dunking the first on that one. Well, no, I mean, there have been, I mean, look, what would be like the problem with all, like the problem with stand-up, I think, is that it's very ego, it's very hard on a person to be in front of a group of people and be reminded by your species that as clever as you might have thought you were in the composition of this joke or that joke, it didn't work. And then you need to have the ability, you have to be tough enough to be like, okay, that didn't work. If you were to go up there with some kind of secret desire to give a Dharma talk, which I'm saying, I'm only saying this because God knows, I'm trying because what would be better than instead of having to write jokes and punchlines, go up and then just look, we're not going to be funny. I've done this and like people will respond to it, but I don't know if I call it stand-up comedy. I think stand-up needs to be what itself, what it is. And that doesn't mean that it needs to take it. It doesn't mean you can't articulate, like any good comedy show, I guess you could say, any great comics that I've seen in its own way, you could argue, well, that's a Dharma talk. It's their reflection of truth. And if the truth is Dharma and they're talking about truth, it's a Dharma talk, but if the intent in the stand-up act is correctional, educational, if it has within it that, if it smacks of like, come before me and let me show you this or that, then you, I think at that point, you can run a ground accidentally. Even if your intention was good, I like the pure stuff and I only say, I just know from my own experience, if I can get out of that awful reality that what I thought was funny isn't, by subverting that with some kind of like, okay, here's the talk part of my thing that doesn't have jokes attached to it. I kind of feel like I've, I don't know, I've missed the mark to some degree, but I might be too dramatic. It's just speculation. You know, me, I like to see what's not heavy-handedly, but is it possible for, you know, for the mingling of the creative expression and the Dharma, you know, like, and in Japan, they have it. You know, there's certain, like, no theater is an example of it, if you've ever seen that. I haven't. It's, the sensibility begins to permeate so that you're not sure whether you're learning something about the way things actually are or if you're being entertained. That line begins to blur, you know? That's cool. You know, my friend put it this way, the only rule is that it needs to be funny. That's it. That's the purest version. So theoretically, based on that, you could say anything up there, but it needs to be funny. That's the only rule. It needs to be funny. And you have to, you can't, you can't, like, trick yourself into thinking that, you know, they're laughing on the inside or whatever. There's a kind of a goalpost. It's a game with a goalpost. That's it. It's not out on a meadow, just free-forming. So anyhow, long story short, God, I mean, we just, we just can talk. And it's so enriching, you know, these conversations. For me personally, I know, you know, people like it or don't like it, but for me personally, it's so enriching to have this conversation. No, for me too. I mean, whenever, sometimes what I'm talking to you, I'm telling you, I don't know, in this connection space, it really is like a, I don't know how to put it. Like, you know, that thing that you're talking about, the under-the-surface thing, the unconditioned, that thing, it just pops up. And then the moment it pops up, I ruin it because I'm like, David, it's like this. You're the Buddha, but then you're not. And then you're, it's into time. And then you're remembering your past lives. I do, you're right. I immediately try to fill that space up with linguistic boxes like, like a hoarder who found a new room in their house and it's like, oh hell yeah, now I've got a place to put my cat litter in comic books. I just want to fill it up right away. I think that's part of the process for everybody. So I wouldn't personally, you know, see that as necessarily anything other than exploring so that we become more, and this is, you know, again, the sitting practice is the base, it's the root of it, where we begin to just explore what happens. And I've been saying this to the Japanese students, they just simply notice. This is not the part of the program where we're kind of trying to make it into something or make a cake or you just simply notice what's there already. But I agree, that would be an interesting challenge if you were up on a stage and you were like, you know, trying to, you had, there was a premise for being there and you just went into a simply noticing state. It could be kind of very, very free-form and kind of like what just happened, or it's just going to be not the right context for simply noticing. Oh, I think that's the state. What you're talking about is like, you want zero latency in performance. Well, on that note Duncan, I do want to, you know, we've had such a beautiful synergy between the people who are magnetized by your, you know, what you're talking about. And I guess you call it the family hour. Do you call it the family? Is it sort of a family situation? Is that how you describe it? Yeah, it's the family. The family. So I love that idea as you know. And part of your family has been part of Dharma Moon's family. And I almost feel like we have kids together. We do, it's great. They're growing up fast. So I just want to let everybody know, you know, in closing here that we do have another one of the future training programs coming right up in, starts on October 1st. It's a 100 hour program. All you have to do is go to DharmaMoon.com and you can learn all about it. And we'll put the links in the chat. When we put the podcast up, I hope we can do that. Great, of course. And the first weekend is, you know, something people can come and just only do the first weekend and then see if they want to sign it for the whole course. And you and I are on target for next week. Wednesday, August 31st. So if people want to hear us talk a little bit more specifically about what's coming up with the teacher training program at Dharma Moon, just go to DharmaMoon.com right on the front page and sign up for our chat that we're going to have next week, August 31st, 6 to 7 p.m. Eastern Time. And talk a little bit more directly about that. But we have really co-mingled something here that I'm really happy about. And because it seems to be very genuine, it sort of happens spontaneously. Yeah, totally spontaneously. Yeah, so, and you know. Do people get a chance to hang out with you one-on-one when they take your classes? Yeah, I mean, the beauty of it is I'm there and I'm sort of, you know, doing a lot of the, you know, sort of major presentations. And so people have a chance to dialogue in that context. But what we have is these very well-trained and I'm quite proud of them teachers who are, you know, probably one to every 10 or 12 students. And they get to work one-to-one with one of those teachers during the course of the program. And they also get to work with each other, which is so something about this teacher training program that's quite unique is the way that it's very interactive. It's not just a bunch of downloads that you do in your house at your own time. And it forms, just like in your community, it forms a sense of community and sort of shared experience. And I'm very much part of that. And I'm, you know... But it's bigger than that at this point. There's a whole sort of mandala of other teachers who are really wonderful and take good care of people at this point, really proud of it. Well, folks, hang out with David from the Midnight Gospel. You see, like, I'm so lucky that we're friends. Like, whenever I'm reading these books, I'm always thinking about you, like, God, I'm so lucky. I can read this and not just, like, you have no one to talk to about it. Like, God, it's so cool to think, shit, I got to ask David about that. What's that? What does that even mean? Or why does it... It's such a... I get the why in all of the lineages. There's this, like, go, if you needed someone, you got to have someone you can bounce this stuff off of. It's really difficult without that. So I'm... And I've had that myself, Duncan. So I understand, like, we want to pass that forward. So the Kalyana Mitra, the spiritual friend principle, we want to pass that forward. I'm training younger people to do this in the future, because that's when you say, were you there in the iteration ripples? That's how we ripple it, is by... It's really this kind of personal communication going on and on. Yeah, that's it. That is so trippy, David. Thank you. Thank you so much. Not just for this, but for all the off-camera conversations we've had. Thank you so much. Thank you, Duncan. Talk to you soon. Talk to you soon. That was David Nickturn, everybody. All the links you need to check out the courses he mentioned are going to be at dunkintrustle.com. Join us Wednesday, October 1st. I'd like to see you there. Come to the shows, but if you don't want to do any of that, I get it. I'm just so happy that you listened to this podcast, and I'll see you next week. Have a wonderful weekend. Hare Krishna.

It's me, Trussell, and you are listening to the Dunker Trussell Family Hour Podcast. It's being recorded from a wonderful, themed luxury hotel room in San Diego, California. I'm staying at the Frenaz Hotel. I was lucky enough to get upgraded into one of the aquarium rooms, and guess what I've got swimming around right in front of me? A dolphin in an aquarium. Such a cute little guy. His name is Cameroon, and he is really fun. He keeps doing these flips and spins. It's almost like he's trying to communicate something to me. I think he wants to touch me, or I don't know what, but he keeps sort of pushing against the aquarium, and then he'll flip and spin and push against the aquarium. And sometimes he gets real still, and we just watch the ocean together. And I can tell he is enjoying the view as much as I am. All hail the seven gods of luck.

Many of you might not know that there was a time before Squarespace where if you wanted to build your own website, you'd have to do an occult ritual in the middle of the night that would involve cutting your hands and feet and bleeding into an urn, summoning a web-designing demon entity that would maybe build you a website or maybe rip you to pieces, leaving your scattered remains splattered all over the chamber that you did the ritual in.

You probably already know today's guest. He's written, I don't know, 17 books or something. One of them was my first real introduction to Buddhism and I'd love to recommend it to you along with all of his other books. It's called A Path With Heart. If you're interested in meditation, you could check out his book Meditation for Beginners or check out his newest book, No Time Like The Present, Finding Freedom and Joy Right Where You Are. For some people, Buddhism can seem dry depending on whatever the lineage is. Buddhism can seem complex, overly intellectual, too many lists, but Jack has this incredible talent for synthesizing Buddhism with Western thinking and talking about it in this way that is really gonna change your life. He has most certainly made my life much better just from his books and the fact that somehow by some great karmic act I must have done a previous incarnation, I get to have these conversations with him from time to time.

[""Welcome Back to Ducatressal Family Hour Podcast""] [""Welcome, Welcome to Ducatressal Family Hour Podcast""] It's the Ducatressal Family Hour Podcast. Jack, welcome back. Whenever I know that I have a podcast coming up with you, it puts me in a really great mood. Thank you so much for being here. Maybe I could mark it as sort of a mood stabilizer or something like that. You are, you are a mood stabilizer. Thank God for you. Yeah, here's where you sign up and send your prescription. That's right. I would freebase you, I would inject you into my veins. If there was something I would get addicted to you, I would probably have to go to cornfield rehab. Yeah, you would have to, you'd have to get off of that addiction. You can talk to my beloved Trudy, she'll tell you. You know, too much of a good thing and you get sick, so. Oh, she loves you. I don't think she's even close to that yet, Jack. She just did a podcast. She loves you. You know, COVID put us all in, do you remember Estelle Pereira's book, Mating and Captivity? Yes. Well, there we are. We're all COVID, COVID captivity. How are you, Duncan? I'm glad to talk with you. Hi, I'm Jack, I'm good. I, you know, I'm working on a book right now and just. I'm sorry. I'm sorry to hear it. Thank you. As an author. Yes. Terrible. And now I've got a real deadline and it's just, I feel sorry for everyone around me and I'm, it's just brutal, but amazing. And cause I've never written a book before. How many books have you written, Jack? Well, written and edited in 16, but who's counting, right? I mean, yeah, the first book is it's sort of like, Duncan, you're like, you're a virgin, right? And there's a bunch of things that you have to learn about how to do this dance. I'd be happy to talk to you more, some offline or something like that. What's your deadline? I've got five months. I've got five months and I, my editor is wonderful. Penguin is awesome and they know it's my first book. So it's not like they're raking me over the coals or anything like that, but I still have to write, I still have to get it written. You have to write a damn book, but let me say this. They know that authors, we authors are weird and quirky and they're used to us extending our deadline. So you should just be aware. I don't want to tell you that too soon because then you'll just freeze and not do it at all till the deadline comes back. I just extended the deadline, Jack. Now it's a real deadline. I recognize the previous deadline was kind of a, you know, I don't know, it wasn't really a deadline, but this is a deadline and I need that. I mean, that's what's really getting me just to start hitting the keys. But I gotta tell you, and I know you probably, well, maybe you don't, it's not so brutal now, but I don't know if you remember your first book or what the, you know, I go through days of where I'll sit down to write and it's like, my brain is muck and nothing is coming. And I think, oh, maybe I have some undiagnosed neurological condition or something. Why is this not happening? Those days will follow days where it's just, oh, there's a chapter. I did a chapter, there's something. And then I'm like, ah, this is easy. Why do people complain about writing books? And then bam, into this horrific windshield where I just splatter across it, doubt everything. But Jack, just before this podcast, I finally got the next, you know, unedited, rotten chapter out. It was about cancer, when I got cancer. And I won't go into details of the thing, but all of a sudden I realized I can't, I'm having a real hard time writing about this, not because I don't have the words, but because it hurts. And I can't tell you how wild this feeling I'm having right now is only because I assumed that I had gotten past all that, you know, that I'd gotten past the year that I got cancer and my mom died of cancer. And I just was wondering, your thoughts on this quality of grief or trauma, what is this? How is this still stuck in me? Does it go, does it ever go away? And I just would love to know your thinking on this. Well, I'm sensing what you say. I need to, before I leap in with all the, you know, wise presentiments and whatever that might've even be wrong, when you say it hurts, how does it hurt? What's the hurt? It's not the worst hurt, but it's, you know, I mean, it's so, I'm really trying to avoid tearing up on podcasts right now, because I think it's as cheesy as you can be, but I'm sitting here writing. All of a sudden I'm crying as I'm writing. Then I'm like, why am I, why am I, what is this? And so it's a kind of sweet, it's sweet, but it hurts, it's a, and maybe part of the reason it hurts, it's sweet right now is just because it's like an old friend or something that I forgot about, that suddenly it's like, oh, hi, here I am, just hanging out right in your heart, right under the surface of everything, just sort of hanging out here. And I've been hanging out here for a while for, since that year. So I guess it's a kind of sweet pain, and if that makes sense. Yeah, so your pains, so there's a few things to say. First of all, going back to your writing, you know, they're the days it comes out and you go, oh, I wrote something. And then days a little bit later that you look at it and say, this is shit. Yes. Why did I think this was, and it's like you were drunk or stoned and you wrote this brilliant long, long poem and the next morning you went and looked at it and say, this is dribble, I thought it was brilliant. So do you know what that makes you? What? A writer. All right, that's good news. You've arrived, you've arrived. So there's that, just to keep that in mind. And then to port that over to this next question about the grief that you carry, do you know what that makes you? Why? It makes you a human. Right. This is sorry to say. You took human incarnation, Duncan. Yeah. In the weird form that you did, the lie that we all done this. And you get praise and blame and gain and loss and pleasure and pain and birth and death. Yeah, and all of those things. And so, you know, that brilliant book about trauma by our friend Bessel Vander Coke, New York Times bestseller for years now is called The Body Keeps the Score. Yeah. And what you're experiencing as you write about it is you're opening that gateway in your psyche and your mind and heart. And then that which is held in your body, the grief for your mom and her death, the grief and pain and terror that came initially, probably for cancer and how you manage it. All that's still there. And I remember somebody describing therapy as helping people shift from the same damn thing over and over to one damn thing after another, right? That's brilliant. So that there's a necessary repetition in our life, but when you grieve honorably, which means you let yourself feel it and let yourself go through all the parts of grief, which include your tears, you know, and we all carry a portion of the ocean of tears that's there for humanity and there in the universe. When you let yourself grieve in the ways that grief does, then it's still there. It doesn't take you over so much or much, but it can be triggered because it's still held in your body, right? As Bessel would say, it is still held in the heart for this incarnation at least. And so any kind of Dharma expectations that, okay, now I've handled it. Anybody who said they've handled it, anything, is gotta roll up the window shades and look out cause it's coming again at some point. It just doesn't work that way. What we do handle is our capacity for love and our capacity to be present and say, yeah, this too. This too is part of the game. So you went through a really tough year and now you re-experience it some. And people know about grief. You know, when someone you love dies or there's the end of a relationship or marriage or something where you've been so deeply connected and then there's this huge loss. Grief initially comes in waves. You know, you have these huge waves of outpourings of all its parts of anger and, you know, blame or why did this happen or confusion and tears and so forth. And then the waves subside. Grief doesn't actually go away. What it does is there become space between it. So you're grieving horribly and then you have to go to the market and you have to figure out, well, am I gonna get, you know, tied or eco-soaked for my on that, in front of that counter. And you're trying to figure out cause they're all trying to get you to buy these 40 things with their colors. And all of a sudden you go, oh, I forgot to grieve because it went away for a little bit. And I'm back being a regular person, trying to figure out which, you know, a laundry soap to buy. And then a new wave of greed will hit, grief will hit. So you start to learn actually when you pay attention to grief that it's both honorable to let it be experienced and also to let it ebb and flow. That it's what it does. And then for you, I'm not sorry about this. You talk about the, you know, the tears, which is damn, I wish the world leaders when they get on the, you know, television and talk about, well, we're gonna invade this or we're gonna do that. I wish they were weeping when they said it. Well, maybe this is why Biden has started wearing sunglasses. Maybe he's making me laugh. I would hope so. That, you know, because that level of leadership also involves, if you're honorable about it, knowing that the decisions you make, even if the best you can do, involve a lot of suffering.

[""Limit of the World""] Because that level of leadership also involves if you're honorable about it, knowing that the decisions you make, even if the best you can do, involve a lot of suffering for a lot of people. I'm glad you said that, because this brings me to something I wanted to bring up with you. I just did this podcast with this genius Lex Friedman who just got back from the Ukraine where he was interviewing people for a month in the Ukraine. I saw him, he came to the door and was like, well, I've never seen dead bodies before, this. And we talked about it. And he brought up something that seemed paradoxical in that situation, which is that these are people who have had their homes destroyed, these are people who have seen so much death, who have lost loved ones. And he said, the spirit there is so sweet that everyone's helping, that people are really unified and very sweet. But then he talked about the soldiers. He talked about the state of consciousness one has to go into, to launch a missile into a group of people. And how many of these people are... I mean, if I'm still upset, if I'm still grieving because I lost my mom to cancer in 2013, these are people who have lost their children three days ago. And I realized in that moment, I was scrambling for some kind of pithy, Buddhist thing to say. And all I thought about was my kids. And I thought about if something happened to my kids, if my kids had been murdered, that I would not be able to... I guess it's just like, just even speculating it, I started questioning my own exploration in the Dharma and my own meditation practice and all this stuff, Ram Dass and you and Trudy and everyone teaches like in that moment, somehow just being around someone had just gotten back. I thought all I would feel was hate and all I would wanna do was kill people who'd hurt my kids. And I feel like I just ruined everything that in that moment where if I was cornfielding, I would have had something real to say, but I had nothing other than my God, I get it. I'm taking a breath because it asks for some space around it. And the fact that you were weeping, just cause you couldn't write your book, nevertheless, the fact that your tears were coming in part because of what you did suffer through cancer and your mom's death and so forth, we grieve because we care. If you didn't care, you wouldn't grieve. So underneath grief is the fact that we actually are connected and love. And that's part of what you were experiencing when Lex came back because it was the shared grief. It's not your grief. It's the grief that we carry as humanity and it's happening right now, not just in Ukraine, but in Myanmar or in, you know, South Sudan or in places all around the world, including in our own towns and cities and so forth. And then you say, well, what if I were to face the worst thing I can imagine, which is the death of one of my children? That's kind of for people that's like the, you know, even I, you know, would be willing to die or be, you know, hurt or tortured, but spare my children. Yes. Right. So now you're going to the right heart of human incarnation. How can we love when the possibility this enormous pain is there? Yes. And war is not new, by the way. We've been doing this for a very long time. And so this is part of our collective heart. And then you put on top of it some kind of idea. I forgive me for saying it, some kind of spiritual idea. Okay. If it were me and Ukraine, Czechoslovakia around us or, you know, some saint or something like that. Then they'd all say, oh, yeah, you know, it comes and it goes and who I am is so much bigger than all that. And my children were killed in a missile and it's, you know, it's just how it goes. That's nonsense. It's an ideal, you know, and we need ideals in some way to kind of look to see, can we be more wise or gracious or compassionate with all the suffering in the world and all the love that's in the world. But any kind of measurement, you can't measure grief. You can't compare it. You also can't even really prepare for it. Okay. I'll meditate and then when my, you know, something disastrous happens to my children, I'll be chill. Not me, not me. I don't expect that. I do everything I can. If my daughter was in the farthest part of the world and said, daddy, and she's like 37, right? I really need you. I would go. I would not hesitate at all. She was going through a hard time when she was working. She was doing internship in Cambodia for the war crimes tribunal. And then some stuff happened. This was a decade ago or so when she was, you know, starting to study law and I got this message and I said, I'm on a plane tomorrow. Yeah. You know? Yes. So you're just talking about the human heart and the fact that we do care and we're interwoven and that loss is painful. Yes. And there's no, and that means that we also have to grieve in some honorable way. My friend, Maladoma Somme, who was a West African shaman and medicine man with a couple of PhDs from the Sorbonne and I think Brandeis or Michigan or something, he said, the Dagger people, his people, they really understood how to grieve and it was part of their cultural ritual as it is in other cultures around the world to come together to grieve, to take their time to make rituals. He said, when I came to the US first, after this very deep shamanic journey that he'd done where this psychic and, you know, all the eyes that we don't usually have to see we're all open, and then his eyes almost cheered up. He said, I walked in your streets and they were full of the ungrieved dead. And I said, what do you mean, Maladoma? And he said, all the people who died in this Western culture, homeless on the street or along the borders or in the ICU tended by caring, you know, nurses and medical people, but not with their family, not with their community. He said, you can feel the spirits of those who haven't been honored and how important it is for us to know how to grieve as well as celebrate. And for them, grief and celebration come together, the celebration of life as well as the honor. So you're talking about something really huge. How do we as human beings navigate birth and death? Yes, that's it. But I have to say, you know, if in the face of this, what springs up is war. Yes. And not grieving if what springs up is war. Hatred and aggression and killing and war, yes. And, you know, I think it would be hard to argue based on what we just said that if someone is attacking your country and killing your children, it would be hard to argue that fighting back against them was not justified that- So who are you arguing with? Is this an argument Duncan's having with two parts of his brain? Very common for me. Or are you trying to read some sacred scripture that says you should never hurt anyone for any reason at any time? Or what's going on in that? Maybe I'm trying to bury the part of myself that years ago, high on acid, looking out at the world was thinking, you know what, world peace is possible. We could do it. There's a way to stop blowing each other up. Surely there's a better way for us to have this argument than exploding each other's bodies. And now, I don't know. It feels like maybe that was foolish or naive. You're confused, Duncan. You're taking, you are taking, well, I know that. We know that. You're confused, but that's not, so that's just, okay, that's how you are. How you roll, but you know, that's how we all roll, I assume. But anyway, no, it's not that. You're trying to put some half-assed Duncan philosophy about whether you should ever fight or fight back or whatever, you know? And then you're mixing it up with, well, what about my children and what about war and stuff? So let's separate them to make it a tiny bit. I won't even say saner, because the whole thing is nutty. The fact that human beings solve their differences by picking up weapons and trying to kill each other. In fucking kindergarten, you know, and one kid's hitting the other with blocks and you say, use your words, use your words. I mean, can't we get the people who are, yes, isn't there a better way to resolve our differences instead of just being lost and hatred and greed and ignorance? And that's what the spiritual teachings are about. They say the more hatred and greed and ignorance, the more suffering. And the less hatred, which is to say more love, the less greed, which is to say more generosity and caring and sharing. The less ignorance, which is to say understanding or wisdom. The happier, the better. That's the principle. Now, no spiritual teacher ever said, so now we're gonna get rid of war. I think we could. I love your dream and it's not just acid. It's a possibility in this universe that we could find a better game than war where we could still compete and collaborate, do things, but solve our differences in other ways. And we've learned to do that in a number of spheres, but in other ways, we haven't yet. So that's about war, war. Plato said, only the dead know the end of war. And so he was saying this is kind of built into human society. Maybe it's not always, and I don't think it has to be, but let's just call it a long-term project. And I think we can work toward that. We can see the causes, we can build institutions and make connections and hopefully in doing so, those of us like you and me who hold this as a possibility can actually support the work that step by step has people with differences listen respectfully or the true reconciliation work that honors the previous generation's horrors and tries to move past it. We know individually that it's possible. So there's that. And then there's your question, well, what if something happens to me, to my child, my community, my family, is it okay to stand up, should I fight back, should I not? There's no question, Duncan, that you should do everything in your power to protect your child, your family, your community. So that's, I've never heard a spiritual teaching that just says, let it all happen, it's all just an illusion. I mean, maybe it's out there, somebody on a different acid trip, but generally speaking, that's not what you hear. Okay, so then you're asking this much more difficult question and we have to bring Gandhi into the room because he's our guide in this. And he said, you know, he said, I'm 100% committed to non-violence, but let me see if I can figure, remember how he said it. He said, but if I had to choose between violence and cowardice, I would choose violence. Wow. Isn't that a statement? So he said, when I choose non-violence, I choose it knowing that I'm willing to bear the suffering rather than inflict it on someone else. Thank you ExpressVPN for supporting this episode of the DTFH. Fortunately for me, my children are still young and I don't have to worry about that terrifying moment when they go online.

When I choose non-violence I choose it knowing that I'm willing to bear the suffering rather than inflict it on someone else. Okay, so this is kind of the highest possible spiritual ideal. Wow. But then, you know, I told you this story about a woman I met, I met a guy on the train from Baltimore of Philadelphia and a woman he was working with. And he'd been, you know, he was helping to work in a program for incarcerated youth and particularly young men who'd been sentenced for long terms for homicide and things like that. Yeah. And he told me this story of a young boy 14 years old who was in gang in Baltimore, wanted to get in a gang. And the initiation was to go kill somebody. Kind of like the, because we don't have real initiation in our culture, you know, as there would be in most traditional societies. And if you were in the Maasai, they'd give you your spear at a certain age at 14 and you'd go out and you'd bring back the lion that you killed and they'd say, okay, now you're a man and you can be held in that way. We don't have that. So our kids are initiating themselves on the streets because they don't have any adults. They don't have any mentors who can say, all right, let me see how good you are, give them a task, make them do something. Because if you're a young man, the question is, is there anything dangerous to do around here? Can I do it? You know, let's get real. But young women too, I don't want to make it sexist. But in any case, we don't have that much. So for him, it was to go shoot somebody. And he shot this other boy who we didn't know, got arrested, court was convicted, given a sentence. And when he was about to be marched out of the courtroom, the mother of the boy who was killed, the judge said, do you have anything to say? And she stood up and she said, she looked at this young man, he said, I'm gonna kill you. And then to effect down. And then they took him off to prison. Well, she started to visit him a year later. And he was so surprised because he didn't really have a family. One of the reasons you joined the gang is, you know, his family had been broken by the poverty and racism of his community and, you know, addiction and all those kinds of things that happen in target communities. So she started to bring him a few things. She said, you know, I know you did that, but I'm, you know, I think in you in here and I just want to drop off a few things that might be useful. She started to make a relationship with this kid. You know, if I was him, I don't think I'd eat any food she dropped off, at least at first. Yeah, that's probably a good thought. Well, what you do is you get a taster in the next cell, say, hey, try to see how there's, somebody dropped off this great stuff, see how it goes. That is incredible to imagine. But anyway, there's a moment she decided, well, let me finish the story. Sorry. Well, it's okay. You can interrupt me and I'll not all interrupt you. So she's, so she visited him and he was in for, because he was a juvenile, he might've been 13 when he actually shot this young man. When it was time for him to get out, they were gonna let him out when he turned 18. And she was talking to him. She started visiting more regularly. And he said, I don't know what I'm gonna do. I don't have a family to go to, you know, a place to stay. And she said, well, you know, I live by myself and I have extra room. So maybe you could stay here for a bit. You know, let's see how that goes. Well, you've got nowhere else and now I've got to know you a bit. So she took him in and he said, I don't have any work. She said, oh, I'm working at this company. Maybe I can get you a job at the bottom, at least when she helped get him a job. And he lived there for six months. And she brought him one morning. She said, come in the living room, I wanna talk to you. He said, yeah. She said, remember that day in court when you were sentenced to prison for killing my son? He said, yeah. And I stood up and she said, I'm gonna kill you. And he said, yes, ma'am. She said, well, I have. You see, she said, I didn't want a boy who could murder another kid, not even knowing them, to still walk this earth. And so I said about visiting you and giving you stuff that you needed in prison and kind of helping you a bit. And I gave you a place to live, you know, and so forth. And you're not that boy anymore. But I don't have anybody. I have this empty room and no son. And I wanna know if you'd let me adopt you. And she did. And she did. Oh my God. So you're asking this incredibly difficult question about what do we do when we've suffered? And you're talking about the courage of the people in Ukraine and maybe in the places where we suffered deeply where there's emergencies, not just war. You know, remember Mr. Roger's mother said, don't just look at the horrors of the tornado and the hurricane and the tsunami and the houses lost and, you know, all of the earthquake. Look at all the helpers who flood in. Feel that whole field of human beings who get in their airboats from, you know, Mississippian and neighboring states and get there and say, yeah, we're gonna get the people and the dogs off their roof. So we human beings have both possibilities. We have the possibility of creating tremendous suffering out of our ignorance and hatred and greed. And we have the magnificent possibilities of the great heart of compassion and knowing who we are and becoming that, which Gandhi talked about. And so you Duncan, are there caught in the middle as a human being. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes, I, you know, when I'm around you, around Trudy or when I was around Rondas, it's so clear, like it's clear. It's clear as a bell and, wow. But yeah, I am caught in the middle of it because I can feel the other side of it. Well, we all have, or almost all of us, I can feel how I would, you know, how I would be enraged and want to fight back and hurt someone who hurt my daughter and so forth. I feel all of that. And now maybe there are people who get to the point where that doesn't arise for them, but I don't know many, I have to say. And in my business, I know this, well, I'm using llamas and mamas and, you know, all the rest of the spiritual hullabaloo, whatever they call themselves. But that's something entirely different. I'm talking about us as human beings and not as some ideal, but that woman in Baltimore, she reminded us as Gandhi did, because when Gandhi was fighting for independence from the colonizers of England, and when he was fighting for the benefit of the Indian people, he deliberately broke some laws and he'd become quite famous. And there was a British judge, he went into a court and Gandhi had broken his laws. And the judge looked at him and he said, Mr. Gandhi, Mohandas Gandhi, Mr. Gandhi, he said, ""'The law requires me to put you in prison ""'for what you've done. ""'I am entirely sympathetic, ""'not only to what you've done, ""'but to what you stand for. ""'But in my role as a judge, ""'I've required to put you in prison.'"" And so we also get dealt certain roles. And in your role as a soldier, we're going back to Ukraine. If you're drafted, which is a horrible thing, or if you volunteer in our country, a lot of people volunteer because of poverty. They don't actually wanna go, it's a way to get in college, or get educated, or get out of a bad situation. I mean, it's not every once I'm doing it because of a different sense of calling. But then you're in that role. And in that role, this is what's demanded of you. And I think about the poet, William Stafford, one of our great poets, who was also partly Native American. And he was a, he was a pacifist. And he was a pacifist in World War II and chose to go to prison rather than join the army to fight in Germany and Japan. That's an amazing thing. That's an amazing thing. So you're saying, how do we do this as human beings, Duncan? How do I do it as a parent and a husband, and a family member, a community member, and a member of society? And I think we need, we don't need. It's like, the universe is calling on us to grow up as a species, whether it's climate or whether it's racism, which is completely insane. This child, let's see, their color is sort of blue-green. I was actually, my mom said, I was yellow. I was jaundiced, so I was quite yellow, and my twin brother was really blue. So she had two kids who were colored blue and yellow, but... Jack, I have to tell you, one quick interruption. So when my oldest was born, he had jaundice, and he was yellow. And I remember Ragu saw him because he had, he kind of looked Asian. I can show the pictures. Ragu looks at him, Ragu looks at me, and I'm like, yeah, I'm thinking it too. This kid looks Asian. As it turns out, he just had jaundice. So I had a jaundice child. I see. Anyway, it's insane. There's nothing sane about racism at all. It's like a crazy thing. But it's a disease, but it's also part of the ignorance and greed. And underneath a lot of it all is fear, fear of the other. Who's different? Will the tribe or the group that are in the next cave, or the next, you know, part of the woods or wherever we lived in earlier days, are they dangerous? Will they come and, you know, kill us or, you know, take our things or take our children? So there's all of that built in, and it's wired for tens of thousands of years. But fortunately, we also have other dimensions of our life. And so we've created, you know, agreements where we won't send nuclear weapons to each other's country. You know, we won't do that. Or we have economic agreements or we have other kinds where we actually agree to care for each other within a country or even globally. And those come from our hearts, actually. If you were, you know, yes, there are people terribly traumatized and bitter and hurt who might like war. You know, there's a certain love of the battle of it. But in general, it comes out of fear and trauma and not out of, you know, oh yeah, suffering is such a great thing. And so what we're doing together in some way is reminding one another of our humanity like that woman in Baltimore. That's what you do. That's what you do. And you sometimes stop being Jack Cornfield and you seem to be, if there's an ocean of tears, you seem to be this ocean of something else. And I'm sorry if I'm taking things a little too ethereal, but I wanna ask you about this because when you were talking about this mother, I thought that's every mother. In that moment, she stopped being the mother to her child and became the mother to the murderer of her child. She was able to expand her motherness beyond the boundaries of her own life and she became something, the ocean of mothers. She became the ocean of mothers. When I was getting my, Todd, I put it off and I shouldn't have, but years later after my mom had passed, I went and finally got the scan that you have to get when you have cancer to make sure it's still gone, it's gone. But I was so scared and this woman who took me into the room, Jack, she stopped being a nurse and as she's walking me into that horrible machine, she says, I'm your mother, I'm your mama, you're fine, you're fine, I'm your mother. It was the damnedest thing. I thought I was, I thought I was hearing things or something, I couldn't believe it. It's like for a second, Jack, I'm sorry, she just became my mom or all the moms or something like that. And I wanna ask you, I don't know what happened here, friends, I'm sorry, my internet got weird and so we had to shift this to my speakerphone, recording it into a microphone. So I'm so sorry for the degraded sound quality, but I didn't wanna end the podcast early because of a technical error. So I beg for your forgiveness for the low-fi audio quality that you're about to hear. What is that, that thing that I've seen you turn into and Ram Dass turn into and the mother and the story you just told turn into, is there some kind of, I don't know, disembodied, transcendent, I don't know, spirit or archetype or ghost, what is that? You sure have a lot of ideas and I love them, ghosts and archetypes, they're a switch between ancient cultures and, anyway, you're asking a really deep question for all of us, which is who are we? Yes. And then nobody can answer that for you, but that becomes one of the deepest of all human inquiries. If you think you're your personality or your community, where you were born or your family and so forth, or your body, then that limits you a lot. But in fact, you're not your body, spirit came in to your body and it will leave when you die. There's this amazing thing that happens when you have the honor of sitting with someone when they're dying, because for the last moments you're there present with them and if it's one of those special deaths where someone is still fairly conscious as they leave, you know, you hold their hand, you love them and then their bodies just meet and the spirit's gone. All that's left is, you know, this slab of flesh. You can actually feel the spirit leave if you're really quiet in tune. It's like a falling star, it's so silent. And then I've sat with people over many, many times years and done it in my own meditations and past life regressions and things. You feel yourself floating out of your body. There's often a review like, wow, that was an amazing incarnation, wasn't it? Because who we are is not this body or personality or history. Who we are is consciousness itself. This is the play of consciousness. Consciousness divides itself and becomes all the things that create the world and the universe from the original source that's both fullness and emptiness, the creative principle of the universe. And so at different times in our life, we are able to function at different levels. You know, round us used to say, remember your true nature and your social security. So remember that who you are is actually timeless. You are love. You are the connection to all things. As my teacher, Nisargada, said, wisdom tells me I am nothing and love tells me I'm everything. And between these two, my life flows. And you feel that, that we know of this. There's this connection to everything Alice Walker wrote at one point of a character. She said, one day I was sitting there like a motherless child, which I was. And there you were that motherless person in the room getting your scan, which I was. And it goes on and she says, and then it come to me that feeling of being a part of everything. And I knew if I cut a tree, my arm would bleed. And I laughed and I cried and I run all around the house in fact, when it happened, you just can't miss it. And we do know this. We know it walking in the high mountains or making love or taking some sacred substance or listening to amazing music or being there. Those mysterious moments of birth where new being says, here I am or death. You know, when the spirit leaves the body, we know this. And that woman there knew it. So she was, yes, she was a, you know, technician or a nurse or something in her medical role. Yeah. She wasn't just that. She was the part that we all know that's much bigger that says, yeah, I have a role to play and I can do it beautifully. But that's not who we really are. Right. But she saw you with the eyes of, as you said, the universal mother. And you orphan that you were. Yeah. We're fulfilled in that moment because she reminded you of who you are that you're not an orphan, that you're actually mothered by her and all the mothers in the fact you're mothered by the universe, which gave birth to you. Right. And that's who you are. And we forget this, which is why there is, we forget this, which is why there's such a thing as spiritual practices to quiet ourself. Why at the mind tend to heart and begin to listen in a new way. Go, yeah, we all had that, now I remember. Right. And now I remember love, now I remember forgiveness. Now I remember what's possible. I have a poem to read to you. Wonderful. It's from Lawrence Jernauer called The Sleepless Ones. What is all the people who could not sleep at two or three or four in the morning, left their houses and went to the parks? What if hundreds, thousands, millions went in their solitude like a stream and each told their story? What if there were old women, fearful if they slept, they would die? And young men, and young women unable to conceive, and women having affairs, and children fearful of failing, and fathers worried about paying bills, and men in troubles, and men unlucky in love, and those that were in physical pain, and those who were guilty. What if they all left their houses like a stream, and the moon illuminated their way, and they came each one to tell their stories? Would these be the more troubled of humanity, or would these be the more passionate of this world, or those who need to create to live, or would these be the lonely ones? And I ask you, if they all came to the parks at night and told their stories, would the sun on rising be more radiant? And again, I ask you, would they embrace? No. Wow. So here we are together. You and I, Duncan, are telling our stories, you know, and listening to one another, and listening to all the stories that we carry, because this is our lot as human beings. And the gorgeous, amazing thing is that while the first teaching of the Buddha, the first noble truth is that they're suffering, and that it has its causes. We said greed, hatred, ignorance, fear. There's also an end to suffering. There's a connection that transcends the sense of fear, and separateness, and isolation, in which we become that mother of the world, or father of the world. We come that being that remembers who we really are, our own true nature, our Buddha nature, and go, wow. What a dance we're in. What a dance. What a dance. And it's so mysterious. There's no simple solution or something. This is how it's supposed to be. But we actually kind of braille our way half-blind through each day and say, how can I live this? And how do I handle the measure of tears and suffering that's given me? And how do I remember the unbearable beauty of the world and the joy of it? And that's our human law on our task. Jack. And that's what mindfulness and meditation is so good. Thomas Burt instead of what avail is it to travel to the moon if we can't cross the abyss that separates us from ourselves and from one another? All right. My God, you are a genius. I love you so much. Thank you so much. So are we winding up as this guy? That's all you want. Hey. How do you follow that? I don't know. I follow it with that passage that I looked up in scientific American, so it's presumably real where Albert Einstein said, if you can drive safely while kissing a girl, you're simply not giving the kiss the attention it deserves. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, and I'm ending in that way by saying that it's worthy of paying attention to what you love. Frank Ostasevsky, my dear friend, founder of Zen Center Hospice, his language is, what would love have me do today? Jack. Wherever you are, you know, that's a, that's a worthy question. Ah, thank you so much. Always a pleasure, Duncan. I am so lucky to get to have these conversations with you and Trudy. Thank you so much, Jack. I don't know what to say. You, thank you. This is the per, this is, you're, we're just very lucky that folks like you are floating around out there. Well, I'm lucky that I get to float around out here too. We're all floating it together. It's like Rondas in the ocean. Remember we used to go and eat. Yes. Oh boy, oh boy, oh joy, oh joy, and flop around in the ocean with this one good arm and a huge smile on his face. Are you gonna be in Hawaii? Yeah, are you gonna be there? Yes. Oh, let's do it. Jack, I can't wait to see it. Is there any, where can people find you? They can go to jackcornfield.com and I've got all kinds of foundations and teachings. They can also look and see that there's a fantastic two year training for people who want to teach mindfulness and compassion practices. Just great. We've got thousands of people in 70 countries around the world learning how to bring it into their schools or their clinics or their community or their business, so that's fabulous. And also in me here now at Network, there's a bunch of my podcast endings, so all of the above. Thank you so much, Jack. I can't wait to see it. Thank you, I love you too. Love you. Much thanks to Jack for coming on the show. Again, you can find him at jackcornfield.com. A big thank you to our esteemed sponsors. And thank you for listening. I love you so much and hopefully I'll see some of you in Miami next weekend. Until then, Hare Krishna. A good time starts with a great wardrobe. Next stop, JC Penney.

It is I, Dee Trussell, and you are listening to the Ducal Trussell Family Hour podcast. If you're coming here for Midnight Gospel, welcome. Thank you for trying out the podcast, and thank you for watching the show. Friends, my sweet regular listeners, can you believe this has happened? This is crazy. When we were making this show, you know, I didn't, I loved it, and my mind was constantly being blown by working with the artists I was working with and seeing what the show was turning into, but I didn't expect that it would be so well received. I figured it would be at least a little bit more polarizing. I don't mean that in the sense of like beating myself up over it or anything like that, but holy shit, this is incredible. And you know, I've been trying to do this intro now. This is probably like the, at least the 12th time I've done this intro, and I've gone from like a terrible, like really, really dry lecture on grief during the apocalypse. Ooh, and then I sort of reverted into absurdity and tried to do like some absurdist songs about blenders that reverse things back into their form or form. And you know, one, these are the polarities that I'm always trying to find some balance between because one part of me really does just want to do like a two hour long analysis of like comparing the grief process to the death of default reality or the first time you see like a wrinkle in your mom's face that you didn't notice before, like one of your parents exhibits some kind of like, you know, indication that they're moving into old, old age, that thing, you know? But fuck that, I don't wanna do that right now. I don't wanna do that. And then also, I don't necessarily feel like doing some kind of bonkers commercial for a blender that turns things you blended up back into their former form. You know, I gotta find some place in between, which is usually the truth. And I always know that if I find myself doing some dry ass fucking preachy correctional lecture on this or that, that I'm not really telling the truth. And I also know sometimes, not all the time, if I'm doing like singing like about whipped cream clowns, tap dancing on the nipples of God, then more than likely there's a little thread of something that I'm somehow afraid to talk about. And I think the thing that I'm embarrassed about right now is how obsessed I am with reading what people think about the Midnight Gospel and with the joy I feel about having a show come out that people actually like. Because I'm like, you know, a Gen Xer and I got really pounded into my brain from a variety of geniuses who I truly respect that slippery slope between creating stuff and getting caught up in the, you know, as I say in the Bhagavad Gita, you have a right to your action. You do not have a right to the fruits of your action. And that, you know, the moment your mind gets caught up and whatever is the result of something you've done, then generally that means that whatever you're doing right now is not fully you. You're not fully present there. Now, not to say that if you have some success or something, you're not allowed to celebrate it or whatever. It's just like, this is my own neurosis, but that's the thing, I am overjoyed. And maybe also because this awful pandemic is happening, I feel a little bit of guilt about that. Because so then that's when I really have been getting dishonest as I'm trying to express right now, maybe a little bit more unhappiness and I'm actually feeling in some dark attempt to like sync up with a perceived horror that everyone is feeling, which I don't even know if that's happening. And actually the other day I'm like texting with a friend of mine, I'm like, are you okay? He's like, I'm fine, any minute. And then I realized like, I'm actually okay too. Why am I trying to do this like imaginary like, oh my God thing, not that that's not there. Like for sure, from time to time, I feel like one of those skulls getting run over by that tank at the beginning of the Terminator. You know, just this claustrophobic, but a lot of the time I don't feel that, a lot of the time I just feel normal. And most of the time I feel like things are gonna get better for us. And I don't think my job is to go bugling some kind of like, everything's gonna be good, who the fuck? I don't know if everything's gonna be great. I'm also on Reddit conspiracy, looking up the comet impact stuff. You know, it just terrifies the shit out of me, especially if I've been blast and weed sprays. Don't recommend that. Regardless, one thing I would like to say to you, my sweet new listeners is welcome. And to those of you who have stuck in there, who've been there with me, stuck in there, is I stuck it out? What is this? I guess my podcast is a kind of marathon. We've been through a lot together. And to like, share with you this beautiful animated series that my podcast is the dialogue of, and to know that you've been there with me when it was happening, that is thrilling to me. And I am deeply, deeply indebted to you for your companionship over the years and for the messages that you've sent me and for the tweets that you've sent me and for the surprise gifts that you've sent to me and some of my worst moments in my life and for some of the advice that y'all have given me. And it's just to like, to know that we're getting to share this together in some way is just glorious. And I am so happy. That's the truth. God, I was, oh my God, I'm happy and I was trying to like act a little unhappy but that was the problem. There it is. That's the intro to this episode of the DTFH. We've got a glorious podcast for you today. One of the storyboard artists from Midnight Gospel who is just a brilliant artist, Sean Glaze is here with us today. We're gonna jump right into it but first, some quick business. A huge thank you to Fields for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH. My loves, I am a massive CBD fan. I'm a fan of pretty much all forms of cannabis but I really love CBD. And I remember when I first discovered CBD and realized that it was giving me this warm, euphoric, relaxed feeling that I thought was only available through marijuana but sometimes when I was smoking marijuana I was getting that warm, nice, euphoric, sleepy, relaxed feeling mixed in with a high level dose of amygdala pumping terror, you know? Like anytime a dog in someone's yard barked I would almost fall over with fear paralysis I was so stoned on a walk which is really fun by the way maybe not so much these days since it looks like we're living inside of a Philip K. Dick sci-fi short story but that being said, who knows? Maybe you love face masks. God, if there's face mask fetishes out there it must be on top of the world. I digress. Fields is my favorite CBD product out there. I've tried all kinds of CBD. There's varying types of CBD. Some of them have like a really grotesque, like that weird bitter taste to them. Some of them just aren't that potent but Fields is incredible when they send it to you. They, you feel like you're getting vials of some kind of fantasy forest medicine delivered to your door by a wizard. Like we're talking Frank Herbert, dune level, sci-fi, futuristic, healing goop. I use it to sleep. Like if I am having sleeping problems, which I often have because I love to drink coffee right before I go to bed, then I'll have a ton of Fields. I do drink it and if you're wondering about the dosage Fields is amazing. I had this long conversation with the people who run the company when they decided to advertise on this podcast and they are really passionate about CBD. They understand that it is a powerful, powerful medicine for the planet, not to sound like a complete hippie. I really love it though. And that means that you can get in touch with them if you're wondering about dosages or if you're just curious about what it might do for you. For me, I love it either after I've worked out, which certainly I'm not using it for that reason right now because I've sort of melted into some kind of sad, hairy birthday cake person. But I love it for sleep. And it's got a lot of other fantastic uses. Look it up, just look up CBD. The stuff is incredible. I once I literally had to smuggle it because it was illegal. I had to smuggle it to my mom when she was sick. And we don't have to do that anymore. And that is lovely. The other glorious thing about feels is that they deliver it right to your door. And nobody's wanting to go out right now. So that is just an added benefit. It's a CBD subscription service. They deliver it right to you. And if you wanna try it out, you can become a member today by going to feels.com slash Duncan. You'll get 50% off your first order with free shipping. That's feels.com slash Duncan.

Shake hands, glory to be blue. Welcome to you. It's the Duncan Trussell family. Sean Blaze, thank you for coming on the DTFH. I mean, it's a pleasure to be here. Thank you for having me. I am clutching. And are you recording on your end? Are you recording? I am recording on my end currently. I'm clutching my hands so that I don't touch any of my equipment, so I don't fuck something up. I'm recording on Zoom as doing a terrible recording or whatever it does, so that's great. You're recording on your end, fantastic. So, you know, man, when I got lucky, like I've been doing all these interviews and I keep describing myself as like Dick Cheney's plumber. He got invited to the Bohemian Grove. And because one of the cool realizations when I was learning about animation that I had, it was like, oh, wow, this is like comedy. Like this is inside baseball. This is a world that you don't just get to be part of. It takes a long time to get in here. And I think that helped me a little bit just because I at least had a map for what that sort of thing looks like, which is anytime there's an art form that people wanna learn how to do, there is some wall that appears between the place where you wanna do it and the place where you can pay your rent off of doing it. And you're one of the first like artists that I met with Midnight Gospel. And you know, you saw me when I was completely brand new to the thing. And like you taught me so much, man, about writing comedy because the way you write comedy is via drawing, you know? And so all I wanna say, and I know, this is like tooting your horn and I apologize. No, I mean, thank you. I appreciate it. I appreciate the symphony of horns getting tooted over my way. This is my stroke, queuing up the orchestra. I appreciate it. And also, I feel like when I'm tooting your horn, I'm not just tooting your horn. In some way, I'm tooting the whole animation industry's horn, sort of, which is that I don't think people out in the world recognize what a bizarre ecosystem is bringing them all the cartoons and animation that they love. I mean, is a different sort of writing completely? I mean, like it goes hand in hand in some ways with like normal, I guess, comedy, live action, film writing or sketch writing. But it's also with the added implication that we have to make the characters and the setting and the scene. And not only that, is everyone can do things that nobody can do in real life. Right. And so there's this added sort of like anything is possible, anything is possible. And I think that makes it alien. Like I've worked with sketch writers before and sometimes they end up being limited and like they're still writing sketch for live action and they just want like cartoons to do it. And it ends up feeling a little different. It's more about like, it's paying attention to, it's not only the joke, but how they're saying it and the faces that they're making and the timing of the delivery and like something could happen that's not even possible and that dictates what the camera is on to tell that joke. I mean, there's a lot. I mean, I think you adapted really well. I think that the biggest thing is just being flexible and on your end bringing that story and that experience on your end and that voice you have and your ability to talk and just improv and being able to give yourself over to, oh, okay, like, I mean, this is like 150 people that are gonna touch this after I touch it. You know, like letting it, like setting it for, I mean, it reminds me of sort of how meme culture works. Like it's like you make, like I could make a GIF right now and I could put it online and that thing's not mine anymore. Like once the internet gets ahold of it, like yeah, I drew it, but that's not mine anymore. And the jokes evolve as, you know, people put new text under it each time they send it off and it's like this evolving life form in this weird ecosystem that is the, like, internet. Sean, do you remember the, it wasn't an argument. Do you remember the disagreement we had of whether or not Clancy should drink from that statue-headed thing? Do you remember that? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I remember you. Will you talk about it? Will you talk about it? Cause like I want to talk about that. I just want to talk about that moment. Yeah, I mean, I think it was, it was one of the first times I met you and we were pitching episode one, the boards that we had done and we were pitching jokes. And there was a part where after Dr. Drew gets his two cups of hot cocoa from the president's head, which was part of the scene that I had done, I had Clancy pick up the whole statue and start to drink it. And I think at the time, you like, I think maybe you had thought you had been interpreting it as like mean-spirited or something, like, oh, he's taking the whole thing and he's going off. And there was some sort of argument that we had where I was fighting for the gag. And I guess from your point of view, you were like the creator of the show who had never met me before. And I was telling you like, no, but maybe it does work. And like, maybe we can tweak it or like, maybe we tweak it or maybe we can figure out like what his motive actually is and why he would do that or whatever. And I mean, and I could tell that you were sort of like, who the fuck is this guy? But also, I think that that's why we ended up getting along is because we could both sort of pitch these jokes and explain why we did it. I loved it. I hated that you were, I was like, it was, it was awesome. Because like, there were two things that, two things were happening simultaneously. Pendleton's so brilliant because he didn't prep me at all. He just like threw me in the deepest end of the pool you go into. He chose you. He assembled this like team of geniuses to make this. And first of all, I don't even know how he chose me because he had, I mean, he's worked on Adventure Time all these years and he has all these amazing artists to work with. And when I was on that first team, I was like, why am I on this first team? Like, I was like, what's happened? But I mean, I'm really thankful that like Pendleton, I can tell that he's somebody who loves finding new artists to work with. I don't, you know, I wish I could recall the process. I don't remember, like, I don't, and honestly, I don't, I don't know. I don't know how we keep. It's because I had worked with Tony before. He was the producer. Well, whatever it might, you know, this is what I love about the entirety of the show is I think all of us are scratching our heads being like, who made this thing? I don't know how it happened. But I remember that moment. And as far as like animation goes, I always look at that. I look at that moment in the way that I look at my first open mic doing standup comedy, which is that that was a humbling moment for me in the sense that like, what you might have seen is like, who is this guy was really you witnessing me trying to like get some, I don't know, any kind of footing in the completely new world that I didn't understand at all. And like, no, like trusting Penn and trusting Titmouse and knowing that, okay, okay, probably if I'm looking at this thing and not liking it and like feeling wrong about it, it could be that it's just not right for the moment, but it could also be that I don't know what I'm doing. You know what I mean? I mean, I guess that's always the fear. That's always the lurking, the sneaking suspicion that lays deep down within our guts. That's like, like, you're faking your way through this, you don't know what you're doing. But this is why we need teams. I mean, this is the reality of a team is it's like, yeah, no shit, you don't know what you're doing. What, like literally like the answer from the universe to that feeling could be, well, duh, when was the last animated show you made? When was the last time you even tried to do, like animate anything? Do you even know how that works? Do you understand what a key frame is or any of that? And how much time have you spent with that in like your life? Like three hours? You know, like four? You know, like so, so, so that's where the, that's, you know, in Greek mythology, what fucks people up is hubris, which is like you have this pride that's based on nothing. And to me, in that interaction with you, where there was tension and I was like, hey, move, Clancy, we'll do that. That was the beginning of my learning about. Am I the guy who's falling around Caesar going, you're just a man? Like, yeah, thank God, thank God. No, no, man, I mean, but that's, that's, I guess me coming a little bit from like storyboard driven animated shows like, like regular show or Pickle and Peanut or whatever. Like it's like the storyboard artists on Midnight Gospel. Like we weren't writing all of the dialogue, but there's so much visual comedy that it ended up turning into a little bit of a storyboard driven show. I mean, we're getting an outline and we're using your podcast and we're pitching all these jokes. And so I think that sometimes if a joke isn't working or if you feel like it's strong enough to fight for, sometimes you fight for it and then you can figure out, okay, I see where they're coming from. Maybe that, maybe we can twist like one thing that happens in the scene before where they look at each other a different way or he, I mean, he does a goofy face while he does it or whatever, you know, like there's a variety of things to remedy and compromise on any of these situations. Which I didn't know. That I think are really interesting. I didn't know that. Like I didn't, like I'm like going off of some kind of like, like really naive and potentially self-destructive impulse. Like it's the difference between empiricism and the stuff that gets witches burn at the stake. You know, it's like, at some point you have to look at like, wait, why are these instincts I'm having real? Or are- I think that for everybody, it's an ego check. It's, I mean, like I had that scene in the first episode originally when they escaped into the woods. I had pitched and storyboarded and pitched all these gags for a whole scene where Dr. Drew is doing like a cooking show with what he's making and he's making food out of bugs and like Clancy is getting stung by a hive of bees. And like, and the thing is, is with all of these jokes that you make, you put everything into it and you hope that it works, but you also have to do it, realizing that like when you pitch it, that whole scene might get cut and that's fine. And that's the thing is like, if I hadn't stood up for that joke and say if Penn had come in and said like, no, I think, I mean, I think Duncan's right. And I would have switched gears and said like, okay, how can we fix this situation and still make it funny to both me and you? And I mean, that's the nature of all this. The professional aspect of it is that you have to do that, but thank God, you were right, man. Thank God I didn't win that argument. Cause that's one of my favorite moments in the show. That moment to me encapsulates Clancy. That's what he's like. That is him. Like to me, I mean, he's escaped into the simulator. He's like trying to take in everything that he can and absorb things from this world that he can, these new things. And as long as, I mean, one thing that we ironed out pretty early is that other people are killing these zombies or whatever, but he's not. He's not malicious, but he is sort of like this, almost like Bakas or like taking in the grapes and taking in the fruits of this world and basking in the interview and the knowledge that this other person is giving. And in that way, he's entirely like present in what's going on. Like he's not thinking about what's happening at home. He's thinking about, he's like right now when he's taking everything. I mean, I think that, I think you're right. I think that it's funny that, but it's funny that something like that, something as small as that in just a storyboard or a drawing or whatever, that can end up changing things elsewhere in the series. I mean, like we saw that over and over again, like with Charlotte, the dog. Like, I don't know if you remember this part of it, but originally Charlotte, the dog was just pitched. He, Pendleton, when I was boarding the pool scene, when they were playing pool, Pendleton just threw a gif over at me. He just drew a dog and the pool balls were sliding under the dog. And I was like, whoa, this dog is cool. And so when they had to escape, I was like, what if Dr. Drew climbs on the dog and all the pool balls come out from under it and it makes all the zombies slip. And then that turned into them riding that dog. And then we were like, oh, this dog's cool. Let's bring the dog back. And then the dog, I don't know at what point we figured out that things would come out of the simulator, but that dog ended up being in every episode. And it's just based off of one drawing, one character building thing. But it's based off of one drawing and so many different people encountering that and making slight decisions, big decisions, little, commenting, whatever. This to me has been the psychedelic joy of the Midnight Gospel, which is like, you know, there's a really, to me, I kind of like, I think this is the kind of saying that people who are trying to rationalize their lack of practice might say, which is the hand who holds the brush is not always the painter. Because, you know, it's a double-edged sword. Any great spiritual saying is a double-edged sword. But you could bypass your own like, yeah, no, actually that person holding the brush was the fucking painter. You just sat there and like said three things and the person their entire life who studied art made a really great thing. There's all kinds of ways you could break that. I mean, you could essentially say that the person inside the flesh body that's holding the pencil, like piloting a little like mech, megazord thing is actually the one that's controlling the body and doing the pen. And then with the painting have come into existence if he had not perceived the world that was around him. Like there's all sorts of ways that you could break down that, I don't know, that saying and say like it's actually not he who painted the canvas. I mean, but that's true. I mean, this is to me like one of the like surreal and awesome things about having a show that comes out as you get to be interviewed, which is like, whoa, this is cool, I'm getting interviewed man. I mean, I've been doing comedy for like 70 years to finally get to do like a string of interviews has been sadly, narcissistically satisfying. You know, I'm like, oh my God, I'm getting interviewed. I guess that was worth it. You know, like- Well, it's weird because if you're doing, I mean, you know, you could do stand-up sets or you could like in conversations, you tell a joke or something, but when you come out with something like this, this is like, it has a lot of weight to it. It has a lot of weight to it. I was talking to a buddy the other day about like, they were talking about how they vent too much online and they're an artist, but they write out things on Facebook or whatever, Twitter. And I think that they always regret it. They always regret being so reactionary. And so I was talking to them about like, maybe you need to like put yourself through this like, this process of like, okay, you have the thing that you wanna react to at face value, the emotional reaction to try putting yourself through, okay, try writing that thing. And now is that thing good enough or valuable enough for you to make a short, the three panel comic of it? If it's not, then does that really need to go into the world? And so, like he's been drawing things out and sometimes he'll get to the end of drawing it and be like, I'm actually tired of this idea. It's not that good. And sometimes it is, but that's, but when you actually like, I guess what I'm trying to say is sometimes when something comes together like this, it's one of the big indicators that it meant something real. Like it wasn't a fleeting idea. It was something that made it through like almost a full year of people thinking about it. Yeah, yeah. And people being open to doing ego checks, you know, like to me, like, I don't like the term ego check because it sounds like something out of hockey or something. Yeah, yeah, no. Ego, ego check, check yourself. Check yourself, okay. But like, one of the things I started waking up to somewhere through this production was that, like whatever I thought I was or my idea of what Midnight Gospel was or what any of this was going to be was just one tiny piece of a much bigger thing that was a lot of connections and that, you know, right now the way we like look at creation is really kind of like, you know, like it's primate level shit, man. Like, I made that because I did that. And to me, like there's a whole can of worms associated with that realization, which is like, man, I don't know who made this. But like, you know, me and Penn, we sat together and we sort of built this. But did we even build the world? Like in my most stoned moments, I'm like, did we make the Chromatic Ribbon? Or was it a Chromatic Antenna? I did it, yeah. For all the hallucinogenic substances that you've had passed through your body, your show was made by a bunch of people that were sober. That, or, you know, they're on the clock. Oh, please. You know what I mean? You tell me those people aren't high. Get out of here. Are you telling me anyways? I'm sure there were plenty of people that were high on that show. Let me tell you something. Maybe, I don't know, Sean, and maybe you know something I don't know. And then maybe what you know is the opposite of what I imagined. But when I'm walking through Tipmouse and I'm looking at, like, animators, I'm thinking about me. If I had some ability to draw at all or some ability to do what you do. And I knew I was going into like a shadowy, alchemical technology temple in the morning to make stuff. I'm definitely getting high in the morning. Like, there's not even. Well, let me, I don't know if you, I don't know if you, if you knew this about me. I'm straight edge. Did you know that about me? You know what's so awesome is about you is like, you're such a wild, undomesticated creature that I haven't even gotten that far with you. Like, I don't know what the fuck you are, man. All I know is like, we get to have these great conversations. The sadness of this, not sadness, but the problem is with this particular episode, the lead up to it has been turbulence because of the goddamn pandemic. And because the show coming out and like, and somewhere in there, we've had all these great conversations. The only thing I can compare you to, I'll tell you what I can compare you to as far as sobriety or whatever goes, there was, and I can't even say his name, honestly, but it's the closest I comparison I have to you is that one of my best friends in the world, Emil Amos, we were friends in college. He ended up being the drummer for this band called Sleep. And he has a band- Sleep is sick. I love sleep. Yeah. There's a song in one of the credits that sounds very- Yeah, I know, no, that was completely, completely inspired by sleep. There was like, that was, I love sleep. And drummers, Emil's a drummer for that band and like, I've been to their shows and it's like, it's a religious experience. I mean, it's a whole other thing, yeah. It is, it's not mute. It's like, you can call, it's a band or whatever, fine. You can call it that if you want to, but it's like, it's something that's like pouring out of another dimension. And when you're there, you're like, for a second you get to be, you get to realize we're a lot bigger than we think we are. And that's what sleep is. But Emil, I got lucky because I ran into him in college and he had sort of been lucky enough to make contact with someone that I won't say his name because he wants to be anonymous. And this is like one of the smartest people I've ever met. You know, like Ramdas, the thing with like Ramdas and like, you know, all the people who met even Crowley Baba or whatever, is they get to say his name. They're like, oh yeah, we met this guy who was like enlightened or what. There's this someone we met that we, that is so like, so intently not wanting to be known that like, we don't even talk about him. I mean, that's the opposite of that ego check, right? That's this person that, I mean, I mean, that's, that's. But you remind me of that guy. That's cool. Oh man. That's what I'm saying. He's like, you're like, you remind me of that guy. And like you, but you like, you're also like, it's like, okay, I get it. Like you're like something floating in some other dimension and you're poking into this dimension kind of and the way you're poking into it is beautiful. It's your art. But like something about, like you have made the decision like I'm gonna be a professional. Like I'm gonna, I'm gonna have a professional career. You know, you hear so funny when Tibetan Buddhism or in Buddhism, you hear about these, like there's a lot of people meditating in caves, man. And like, sometimes like some of them like get the signal that they're the one that's supposed to come out of the cave and give some transmission and nine times out of 10, they don't want to do it. They're like, I just want to don't, I don't want to be the one. You know what man? I feel like I started doing it for fun. And then the career was just running parallel and then at some point they merged. Yeah. Because I still, I mean, like anytime I'm on a show, I'm still just making my stuff for fun. But that's what I loved about you. But I mean, that's what, I mean, I love it. I love it. That's what I realized about you, by the way. I realized that about you. That was like where, that's where, I don't even know if you know we connected that level. That's where I realized like, that's a wild animal. Like I don't know what, I don't know what it is. I don't know what it is. I think it's probably smart of me. Well, I mean, I think that you're another person that has this compulsion to make. Like you like, you wait, you wait, I feel like you wake up and you need to make something. I mean, even if making something is talking, like having a conversation, like you release enough, I guess content is a word that not everybody likes, but you release enough things and music and art, I would say, that I can tell that you're somebody that needs to do it. I mean, you want to do it, but you also need to do it. And there are some people like that, and I'm like that, and I think Penn is like that. I think that Penn is somebody that I can tell that it seemed like he wanted to back away from having a show, but keeps making other shows. Like on Adventure Time, he relinquished it, I guess, being a show runner to write and storyboard on it, but still started to make others. I mean, there are some people that just have to do it. And I mean, going back to what you had said before about, I guess, the ego check and being communal or whatever, I think that Evan was talking to Penn at one point, and Evan was, because Evan's a huge fan of Penn, has always been, and he was like, how does it feel to have this show that everybody loves? And Penn was just like, I don't feel like it's my show, I feel like I just made a show with my friends. And I think that's what you're talking about. You end up feeling like, oh, I mean, yeah, it's Penn and Duncan's Midnight Gospel, but how you feel is that it was a bunch of friends making a crazy show, and it's almost like you're traveling. I mean, one of the only ways that you can travel through 120 artists' minds and psyches and weird dreams. Yeah, that's where it's not fair, right? Like to me, that's where our quantification mechanisms, not just from a capitalist perspective, but from all perspectives, reveal themselves to be like the way chimps are banging rocks against something. It's like, man, yeah, sure, okay. I'll say, I love, from an ego-driven level, it's like, yeah, me and Penn. Oh yeah, we made this show. But it's like, why do we even, that's a lie. Like, no, we didn't. Who the fuck made this? Like, who holds the brush? And that question is going to haunt the next 50 years of human evolution, I think. It's like, that stupid fucking question is the question. Because it's like, from a universal scale, it's like, who made us? Where do we come from? And then from the individual scale, it gets deeper and deeper until you end up in this like crazy web of like legal like realities that is the creative process. I hadn't thought about it, I hadn't thought about it. In that terms, for most of my life, but I remember when I first started dating my girlfriend, my girlfriend is a very proud communist and she was talking about- Hold on, what? If you- I don't mean to cut you off, I don't mean to cut you off. Guys, we're going to cut to commercial right now. What did you just say? What did you say, man? I'm saying that my girlfriend, she's a proud communist. And she's talking to me- Honestly, I'm going to stop here and do the most idiotic fake commercial for like missiles. But hold on, I've got to pee, honestly, I have to pee. I'm going to just- Yeah, do it, do it, do it, do it. Don't hit pause, just let it roll though, right? Like let it keep recording. I'm going to let it roll. Okay, great, great. This is such a good podcast, thank you. I got to pee, I'm sorry, thank you. Hey, Sean, are you there? Yeah. I just want you to know that when I just peed, I pissed blood and it looked like Karl Marx and I blame that on your girlfriend. I blame that on your girlfriend. It's a sign and an omen. It hurt. It's contagious. No, it hurt, it just, it hurt, it hurt, it hurt. I pissed death, wait, so your girlfriend is a what? So my girlfriend is a communist. You need to find communist. Define communist? Yeah. I'm not sure if I'm the best person to do that, but from my understanding, she's somewhere. From my understanding, it's when giving everything over to the working class people and taking away things from the ruling class and having the government be ruled by the working class. But I'm sure, I'm... He's caught on fire! He's caught on fire! What I wanted to say is what we're talking about as far as this show is, it's very communist. It's very, I mean, like this idea, and the reason why I brought it up is because when we first started dating, she was talking about, so what happens if you ever get a show? And I was talking to her about, well, I mean, I guess I would own that IP and I would be the showrunner, and she brought a lot of things into question that I think that from what you're saying, it makes me think about a lot, is this idea of if everybody worked on this thing and what you said, you hardly feel like you own it or whatever, like how I would act in that position, and it's something that I had never thought about or encountered before as this collaboration. And it was a worldview that I hadn't really come into contact with, which was like, if I'm making this show, there are people out there that don't even believe in this intellectual property and someone owning that, and it really being this collaboration where someone doesn't own that thing, everybody, like this true essence of I made this thing with my friends and it's everybody's. Not supposed to go there, Sean. Those are the forbidden realms. And like, it's the forbidden realm, and I love the conversation because it hits into the forbidden realm. And all silliness aside, there is a thing in me that, the closest, I've gone to Burning Man a few times and that's called a quote, gifting economy, meaning that you can't go to Burning Man and buy a t-shirt with money. Like if someone at Burning Man were selling t-shirts, it would be a really bad day for that person because like, the whole festival would collapse onto them in the most horrific way, I imagine, and they wouldn't be able to sell any. You can't sell things there. There's two things that you can buy at Burning Man. Ice and coffee. After that, it's fucking up for grabs. And so, this thing happens in the desert once a year, which is happening this year and I'm very sad about that because I was so looking forward to this year on every level of my soul. This thing happens in the desert where a bunch of people get together and they put themselves in a place where no one can survive alone. And I remember the first time I went there. Have you ever been? I haven't. Ooh, we gotta go, baby. I promise you. Baby. I don't know, I've been saying that a lot of times. That reality seems so distant. No, not to me. Not to me. From now. A reality where we can leave our houses. That shrieking baby that you just heard was like a micro-orgasm of me connecting with a multiverse where you and I are at Burning Man. You just literally heard, like, whatever is the thing we can't see, the tendril or probisci, shooting out and connecting to you and me being at Burning Man together. We're there. We're gonna do it. I'm telling you. Like an avatar when you connect your ponytails and you have sex. No, no, no! Why don't we connect? Just like that! I don't mind the sex parts, okay, but why do we have to connect our ponytails? This is so fucked up. I mean, it's all like in tendrils, tendrils, ponytails, I don't see the difference in mine. There's a big difference between tendrils and ponytails! Not to me, like, see, I- Pull up the definitions. Pull up the Wikipedia. This is great. Everybody's gonna be like, yo, Duncan's in the alt-right. He thinks- Yo, Duncan hates ponytails! Duncan's in the alt-right! He thinks tendrils are different from the ponytails! Yo, it's tendril gate. It's ponytail gate. Ha ha ha ha ha! Exactly! Well, listen, you and me and your girlfriend and my wife are gonna be a burning man, and we're gonna have to deal with it. And the funny thing, the problem with communism is like, you got this like word, which even you saying it, I mean, you're responding- The gas, right? Well, it killed a billion people. You wanna say the word that killed a billion people? Oh, hold on a minute, didn't you see what the billion people said? And it's like, you say a word like that. How many people have capitalism killed? You know what I mean? But within it, the whole thing is like, as interestingly enough, connected to this problem of like, look, you know, you look at a monkey. I don't know if you've seen these videos, man, but like they're sweet- A monkey video? Yeah, I've seen these videos. Have you seen the 700 monkey videos? Yeah. No, there's a thing that like, I don't know if it just started, or if they just realized it was happening. This is a weird thing like, I think it's chimps are doing, where they take a stone and they're like throwing it in front of a tree. And like, these chimps are doing this thing that looks ceremonial, or it means something to them that we don't understand. Like, what is it? What are they doing? Are they voting? Are they praying? Are they, what is it? We don't know, we don't know what it is, but it's organized, but it doesn't like, based on like, you know, normal evolutionary principles, or like, we gotta find a place to have shelter and food, or none of it makes sense. But they're doing this thing. It's like, what is that? What is that? It's something to do with sentience, you know? And anytime you take that, and try to shove it into a word, a number, or to quantify it, you absolutely dilute it, don't you? You absolutely, there is no way that... You either dilute it, or you make it, I mean, you could make it stronger with a word too, but I think that anytime you express it with one, anytime you express a whole theology, or a whole theory, or a whole, you know, belief system with one word, yeah, I mean, of course, it's an oversimplification the same way as anything else. But I guess, my main reason for, I guess, bringing that up is like, with how you were talking about everything feeling communal, I was just curious about what your reaction to that sort of thinking is. This sort of, like, what if we lived in a society where you, we didn't have that, like, I made this thing, I own it. Man, what a relief. Like, to me, in Buddhism, they say life is suffering, and the cause of that suffering is attachment. And it's like, God, anytime I find myself like getting jealous, who are you talking to? You know, anytime I'm like, find myself in a weird place with like my wife, or I'm like, who are you talking to? My wife. My wife. My wife. You don't have to be, anytime I'm like, oh. My wife. That's my wife. That's my wife. That's my wife, you're talking to your buster. Yeah, any of those moments, it's like, whoa, what have I become? And anytime I'm like in that space of this is mine, you know, there's pain associated with it. This is not a trumpeting of like, oh, therefore we must become communists. I'm just saying like, owning something is painful. Property hurts. Yeah, yeah, I mean, I think it spreads across multiple systems of thinking in one way or another. I mean, whether Buddhism or whatever, but like, I guess, is it like, I mean, are we the chimps who like, I have this, or I have this bundle of bananas, and then the other chimp comes over and bashes my brains in with a rock for my bananas, and it's like, you don't own those anymore, and we're all fighting over what we own. I mean. It's insane. You know, is that what? It gets worse than that. Because it's not even bananas anymore. It's like, a lot of times, the things people are fighting over, like, pictures. My wife. My name and my wife, a picture of my wife. You know, like, that to me is one of the most bizarre genres of porn, come-tributes. You know, where someone like. Come-tributes. Yeah, someone like, comes on a picture of someone, and says, oh, it's a come-tribute. I mean, it's very, it's very, was that chaos magic? What is that? Yeah, it's very, it's very ritualistic. It's some kind of, you know what it is? It's some kind of, like, tumor on, it's like a tumor. It's like, your, your progenitive impulse is landing on a symbol of a thing that didn't consent to get come on it. And somewhere in there is a maelstrom of, like, madness that is, like, to me, cancerous or something, you know? It's like, well, what is, we're, we're, we're confusing reality with symbol sets, you know? And which is, and God, forgive me for saying this, I'm sorry, which is why I love Burning Man, because that's reality. You're in the fucking desert. There's, we have to, if we're gonna be out here in the middle of nowhere, we all have to, like, connect in a way that isn't based on symbols anymore, that we, you need water. I mean, it's meant to be an equalizer. It's like everyone's going in there with, supposedly, is, it's themselves and their ability to help another person or, right? Well, that's the idea, it's self-reliance. Like, the idea isn't so much that, like, oh, I'm gonna give everything I have to everybody. For sure, for sure, yeah. It's really, for every time I've been there, this is what has happened. I go there and I'll always have a cooler that has within it some stash, strawberries. I don't know what, some shit that I think, like, this is gonna be for me and my lady, are we gonna enjoy these in the privacy of our little, private little thing and then, what happens, naturally. Not enforced, not shoved upon us by some authoritarian tyrannier. Not like, you better give your shit away. Suddenly, what you begin to realize, like, if I give one of these strawberries to somebody who just helped me build this tent or who just walked with me in the desert for a little while or just someone who's got, like, who's really cool, I enjoyed a conversation with, there's, like, a 30% chance, they're just gonna start crying. Oh. You know what I mean? You're telling me it's not somebody coming up to your tent and is, like, oh, I see you and your wife for eating strawberries off of each other. I was wondering if I could have one of those, too. Is it like that or is it? No, no, no, there's no, there's no, there's no, like. I'm trying to eat a strawberry off of you, Duncan. Dark force pushing this kind of reality. It's just, you know, the best way to put it is this. I will, like, fill a bottle with milk and I'll give it to my baby. And I don't want, man, you know, at seven at night, I don't want milk. There's no part of my body that's, like, man, I really could use a little sip of cold milk right now. That'd be real nice. But you know what my baby does? He'll just spontaneously push the milk bottle up to me so I can take a sip of the milk. He's not reading Karl Marx. Inside of him is a natural inclination to share. That's in him. It's not regulated. There's no government telling him how much of the milk he has to share. There's no baby network of babies around the planet. It's like, don't share too much with your dad because you don't share enough with your daddy. Won't love you. There's no stock market for milk sharing among babies and dads. It's a primordial, perfect, garden of Eden-level impulse that holds within it a kind of hold on, which has the map of the garden of Eden inside of it. And so anytime in this realm we're in, we start trying to push that shit into words. Suddenly we're saying, oh, are you a communist? And it's like, no, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not a communist. My baby is not a communist. My baby is not a capitalist. My baby just likes milk and fruit and also likes to share. So to me, you know what I'm saying? Like somewhere in that elemental primordial furnace of togetherness that is society, there must be some way of calibrating things that isn't going to rob us of our souls. I mean, I think that any of these philosophies that are trying to really boil everything down to, I guess, like a faith in human nature, like a faith, I mean, whether it's Buddhism or Taoism or whether it's the initial, you know, thought behind communism, despite the connotation that it might have with certain people, I think that any of these philosophies that are trying to say, just at the very core of it, people are good in nature, people want to share, society would be better if sharing was encouraged. I mean, I think that there's at least merit in thinking about any of that stuff, even if you don't subscribe to one, just strictly one belief system or a label or whatever, I still think that they're interesting things to thought. And for that same reason, the girlfriend that I was talking about before, I appreciate that she challenges me to think outside of, I mean, like that stuff I'd never thought about in my whole life, my whole life I've thought about, like I own my art, my art is my life and my ownership and that's my, it's my identity, it's what I identify myself with and I commodify it. And I say like, how much am I worth, like by how much my art is worth or whatever. And I think that, I mean, it all boils down to like, I guess, what's, you know, if money was taken away or whatever, why would you do the thing that you still do all the time and why would you do it? And if, I mean, for me, I make stuff to make people laugh. Like, regardless, I mean, before I was making any money off of it, I was making stick figure cartoons to send to my buddies, hoping my parents wouldn't see them because they were not super safe for work. But I think that it's, I mean, it's always been for me a way to bond with people, a way to share my ideas with people in a way that's more tangible than an inside joke even, it's like I'm making something to give to you and it could give to anybody. It's like, like forging an inside joke out of thin air that I could get anyone in on. Oh man, that's so beautiful. I've always thought, you know, I'm looking at flowers and I'm like, damn, it'd be cool to talk to a flower. That's kind of happy right now. It's so cool, man. It's like, to me, I think one of the qualities of the world we're in is that there's this thickness about it, you know, there's a thick quality to it. It's a thickness about me. Me too. That's what, that's what you know what I mean? Yeah, I know, trust me. You know, it's double seat thick, you know that kind of, juicy, same juice. No, but I get what you mean. Yeah, it was juicy and thick and thick. You know, there's a juiciness about everything. There's a thickness about everything. Yeah, it's like- We're all BBW, we're all- What's BBW mean? Big, beautiful women, I think that's what it is. Listen, man, this is it. This is the condo. It's like, to me, imagine if there were a heaven and to put it in the most reductive terminology, that heaven is on the top floor of some condo, right? And on that top floor, let's not even talk about it because we don't know what's going on up there. But because whatever's going on up there is so amazing, shit starting to drip through the floorboards, right? The bathtub is from up there. We don't know if it's a bathtub. We don't know what it is. All you know- I mean, we put our mouths under it, it tastes, I mean, tastes good, whatever it is, they're bathing in something up there. Shits dripping. Ambrosia. There's something dripping and that dripping is art. And somewhere in there is the realm that we're living in right now as these temporary human beings. And for whatever reason, the realm that we're in right now is really obsessed with like metrics. And so we're like, oh, how long was it? And isn't that annoying? To the millisecond. To quantify, and then you convert that. And what does that do? It sends it further down the building. Now, if you keep going lower and lower floors, the thing that we're in right now, which thank God is like, at least the dripping of the like, some amazing party happening in the God realms, when it gets lower and lower down, man, it gets thicker and thicker. It turns into like, it crystallizes and suddenly it becomes like some kind of like, thing that can't change so much anymore. Now it's like steel. They used to cut and cut, poke and shit, right? And then it gets even denser than that. And down there at the bottom of this fucking building is a goddamn black hole. And now you've got the Kapalistic Tree of Life. And that's where we're stuck in, right? It's like- You're invoking a future, a potential future where artists are the holy men. Artists are the ones that are creating the portals through which we see the divine, right? How about this future? Everyone's a portal. It's blasphemy, but I practiced my own laughter. The piano. It's like, you lived for eight to 80 years. The universe is 13.7 million years old. Like, you know what I'm saying? It's like, yes, thank you for practicing. I am so lucky that you practiced. I'm so glad that you practiced. And I mean that. I don't mean that from sarcasm and thank God you did. But if you think that you're practicing is bringing into the world a thing that wasn't there before, that's crazy. All you did was open the window a little bit more for us. And we need the window to open up. But that's the thing. If you're making a portal to God, you're not making a new God when you make the portal. You know? I mean, it's like when children are born, like people say there's an artist in everyone or whatever. And like, so this, this baby's born, there's this little, there's this little glimmer, little speckled glitter dust of the portal just waiting to be open. And if they access it, they can open it up. And I mean, I mean, what, yeah, for sure, what's new? I mean, what has any artist made that's genuinely new, I guess? But I mean, if we're playing into this belief system that everyone is a portal and art is the gateway to God or the divine or whatever, then, I mean, then we're all just opening and seeing little glimpses of what godliness is or whatever, right? I mean, it doesn't have to be something new, but that's the thing is even if it's something that's derivative of what you've seen before, it's, I mean, a lot of it still feels new. And maybe that's just- What if it isn't? Maybe God's just spinning slowly and each time you look through the portal, you're saying, oh, that's God's back. This is good this time. Once I ate so much wheat, I had a terrifying vision. And in the vision, I saw a version of God that was literally every millisecond dying and being reborn. So that in every millisecond, this being would have to suffer death, complete catastrophic disintegration and reintegration in every millisecond and each time it kept getting better. And I remember like realizing, oh no, but simultaneously it was beautiful. It's like, oh, I'm part of that disintegration, reintegration, but also it meant that like, shit, if we're like attaching ourselves to scriptures or to words that were spoken a long time ago that are trying to reflect that progenitive, renewing, novelty wave, then we're fucked. It's like a surfer, like I surfed a wave like two months ago and I'm gonna surf every wave like that wave that I surfed two months ago. That surfer's doomed. Well, man, but maybe God is every single surfer that's ever surfed, caught a wave and then beefed it and then the next surfer that came after them. I mean, is God every surfer in a road that is catching a wave and then fucking beefing it on the, and getting destroyed on the rocks? Like, I mean, if we're made in the, if we're made in the Lord's image or whatever, then are we not all continuously dying and being reborn? And I mean, aren't we that exact image of God that you imagined, but in a sort of like spread out, like where each one of his molecules or something? Like, I mean, all of our cells at all times are dying and then new ones are being remade, so I don't, Star Trek, right? The teleporters, you know, these motherfuckers, they like go in that room, they shoot down to a planet, they spark a little bit, they're on the planet, they spark a little bit, they come back, right? What happened, right? This is a sci-fi, like anyone who loves sci-fi thinks all the time about teleportation. We're always thinking about it. It's like in the back of your head, you're always kind of thinking about like, wait a minute, is that Captain Kirk? When he lands on the planet, the same Captain Kirk that came out of the Enterprise? Like, did it, is that the, how did they know, how did whatever technology teleported him, did his soul get included? Like, are they sure that's a pure transmission? Are they sure that's the Kirk that came back? You know, this idea of like identity, this is what we're running into right now when it comes to, I think, society as a whole. It's like, we're all like little tiny pieces of Captain Kirk trying to be Captain Kirk. That's not gonna work. You can't do the, you can't have a, you need one Captain Kirk. You know. Put that on your dating profile. Yeah, just a little piece of Captain Kirk trying to be Captain Kirk. Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, God, no, I will never, no one will ever reach out to me. I could look like, I could look like the rock. I could look like the most beautiful, I could literally be Dionysus, like the most beautiful man to ever lift. And there could be, I'm a little piece of Captain Kirk and anyone with any working sensory apparatus would see them, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, fuck that dude, that guy's an asshole. He's like, we're all, that's scary. I think, but that being said, you know, I think what we're gonna have to confront eventually, not now, not where we're at right now, these tiny little mothling things that we are, these little temporary sentient fluttering bits of matter that are meaty and like have our little bits of stuff around them that we give to our kids. Like, we're just barely getting it. We're barely seeing the reef. We're barely bumping up against the elephant or whatever the thing is, and we're doing our best. I believe that. Do you think we're doing our best? I really believe that, man. I think as a species, we're doing our best. I think we're doing our best under the circumstances. And I think, I mean, I think that there are certain, it's hard to account for everybody because there's certain people that are not doing our best, but we as a collective whole, maybe under the circumstances are doing all we can do, because I'm sure that there are plenty of people that aren't doing their best, but it's because they were born into a, they were born in a trash can or whatever, like, and what is their best? It's not the same best, but I mean, I guess at all times, I guess all we can do is just try to do our best under the circumstances, right? Well, right, and also, this sounds absolutely insane, but for those listening, imagine being stuck with Sean Glaze in some kind of communal situation. You would love it, right? That's the other thing, the way you're talking is like, I'm just thinking like, fuck, I wish we were trapped in a high rise together, which we are. It's like, come here, be my muse. Yeah. Like everybody, come in my room, I'll draw something that your soul reminds me of. Yes, that, that. That to me is like, to me, one of the most blasphemous consequences the current way that we are expressing our selfness into time is that work has become a term that isn't synonymous with love. To me, that's so sad. People, I gotta go to work. Yeah, I know, you're doing something you don't wanna do. It fucking sucks. That's sad. And I know that sounds naive and like, I'm a crazy ass fucking hippie or whatever, whatever. But to me, that is an, when the word work and the word love seem like the same thing, and without, I think that's where we're gonna be. That's when we'll know we're in heaven. Because this is the, this is what it is. You know, we're, God is oozing into time, whatever you wanna call it, creation, the progenitive outflow, the outsource, the blech that is the magnetic flow of all creation or whatever you wanna put it. That's what we're in. We're in it right now, man. It's like, if there was a volcano that exploded into time, we're in that volcano. And we're thinking, rivulets of lava. And so, you know, to me, the sooner we like stop being afraid of what we actually are, you know, this isn't, that's why I hate the word, I don't hate communism. I don't hate capitalism. I just hate that. You hate what the words and the connotations transform them into or what? I don't even hate it. It's just like, God damn it. It's like, I want it to be in heaven, Sean. You know, like I would like to be where I wanna, I don't wanna be kind of like looking at the droplets oozing down through the floorboards from some insane hyper-dimensional party and analyzing them to determine what divinity is. I would just love to be the person in whatever that fucking bubble bath is. You know what I mean? Like, that'd be awesome. I would like- Well, I mean, it's the same thing, like with, you know, when you're talking about the word communism, when you're talking about the word heaven, too. I mean, like with all of the millions of words and descriptors that anyone could use for it, everyone boils it down to just the word heaven, which is, again, the only, I guess it brings up one type of, well, we're open the clouds and we're, whatever, you know? But I think that even that is an oversimplification of what people feel about it and mean by it. I guess- Absolutely. By the way, I just watched David Burn on Netflix. I think it's on Netflix. There's a David Burn, I don't know what it's called, but there's a song he sings. And the lyrics are, heaven is the place where nothing happens. It's so beautiful. It's so beautiful. It's so pure. You know? It's so pure. And like, I fuck it. I use the word God all the time. I use the word heaven, too. I've started using the word heaven because I don't have time to come up with a better word. I think you just ran into why the communists use communism as the word, huh? I just turned red, what have you done to me? There's a single tattoos appearing all over my body. Nah, dude. Nah, heaven is a place where you can make plans and cancel them over and over again. Oh my God. You just make plans and then you cancel them and you feel good about it. No one has ever said that. There's no guilt. Don't, wait, hold on. Wait, you can't just say that and then start, you can't say anything now for a second. All right? Hold on. Like when they whisper the mantra into your ear. Wow. That is heaven. I think that we have certainly, I'll tell you what, you know, one of the metrics I use of whether or not a podcast is interesting is if I feel like I've put myself in danger. If that's the metric, the paranoid, it'd be part of myself who wants to pretend I'm different from you. I'm different from you. It's like, shit, man, I don't know. So thank you. I knew, by the way, I mean, you know, man, I imagine you run into folks like me all the time and I've met folks like you before and we've got to figure out how to work with each other but thank you so much for giving- I've never met anybody like you, Duncan. Likewise. And I am so grateful to you for shining your light on the Minerva Gospel and putting your love into this show because it's through the whole show. It's like, you know, if the show's ice cream, you're a cinnamon and it's cinnamon ice cream and it's in there, man. And I am so grateful to you for being patient with me, recognizing that I was just starting to learn about this new world. Yeah, man, thank you for not just firing me. I appreciate it. I appreciate it, I appreciate it. There's some people that would have put me in my place a little bit, but I appreciate you allowing me to be, allowing my personality to be, it's natural state of big and allowing it space in the room. You mean like the leader of the Illuminati? You're not fully me, Glace. I see who you are. They're actually, but by the way, and I know you didn't mean, are you just joking or whatever, put me in my place or whatever. But I was talking to a friend of mine who recently, and I don't mean to end on some dramatic note or whatever. I know you're just joking. I was talking to a friend of mine who had been abused and one of the qualities of abuse is people who've been abused feel like they deserve to be put in their place. There is no place, where you're at is your place. And nobody needs to put you there. You're already there. So you don't need to be put. My man, I mean, my first job out in LA, I moved out here for a writing job and I got fired in the first week. And I had left everything came out with two bags. And I mean, things like that happen. You know, you come out here, you come out here and you just get, you know, you try your best and you realize your best was a little too much and then you get fired. And so you never know. You never know who you're working with. You never know. And then also, by the way, I can think of times when I've been outcast, where I deserved it. And I don't mean that as like, oh, no, I'm just, I literally like, I wasn't in key or I wasn't tuning into that or whatever. I'm not trying to apply some system of like everything's the same or what. I don't know what I'm saying is, when I think of the Midnight Gospel, you know, which for me has been a resurrected, transformative moment in my life where I got to like meet my mom again, you were one of the pillars of that. And, you know, when I, if I'm ever gonna think about my mentors artistically, you're gonna be one of them. And the way you did it was just by being you, not being afraid to be you. And that like evolved to me. Like, if you hadn't had the courage to do that, then the show wouldn't be what it was, what it is. And so I'm really grateful to you for that. And you taught me a lot, man. And thank you for giving me your time on my show. I mean, thank you so much for having me. Again, it's always an honor. It's a special kind of feeling to be able to bookend a series and to be able to start on the first episode and end on the last episode, especially when it's such an important episode to you. And not only that, to feel like the work that you did or the love that you put into it really genuinely affects people. It's a real honor. And the show is really something special. I'm really proud of it. And thank you for letting me be a part of that and part of your journey, too. Listen, man, this is gonna make me sound like Charles Manson of some loony, but we were always a part of it. And I didn't let you be that any more than you let me be it. And all I could say is it's grace and hallelujah and much love to your wonderful girlfriend for transmitting so much wisdom or whatever your connection is with her. She told me to say hi. She's a fan of yours. Oh, that's wonderful. Yeah, yeah, it's great, man. We need each other. That's what it boils down to. You wanna call that communism? Go ahead, call whatever you fuck you want. We need each other and I need you. And thank you for this. And I'm a better person because of this conversation and our friendships. So thanks, Sean. Thank you so much. Hare Krishna.

347^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - DUSTIN MARSHALL Transcript and Discussion^2015-06-29^Hello, y'all. It's me, Duncan Tressel, and you are listening to the Duncan Tressel Family Hour Podcast. Hare Krishna, God bless you. May the true angels of God be smiling in your heart as you journey into the ever-present moment. Whatever the fuck that means. Oh, holy Christ. Freshly single. I am freshly single. Like a fresh loaf of lonely bread. Pulled out of the oven of impermanence and placed on the table of boredom. I am so incredibly bad at relationships. It like dating or being in a relationship. I just can't. I don't know, man. I don't know. Maybe it's, maybe I just, I don't know. Maybe I just can't do it. Maybe I'm just one of those incapable, neurotic, troll-like beings who's destined to pad through their empty home in slippers and underwear, eating cat food, and listening to old Joni Mitchell albums while they contemplate the fog of confusion that surrounds all truth. I don't know. Never been good at them. They always end to the point where anytime I get into a relationship with someone or start dating someone, part of me thinks we're going to hate each other one day. It's that bad. I know you're not supposed to think those things and you're supposed to have a positive outlook on it, but it seems like the whole process is fundamentally flawed. I mean, I don't know. Maybe at my expectations are too grand for these things. I think that might be what it is. I have these insane expectations when it comes to a relationship and you shouldn't have any expectations about anything. It should just be like, oh, this person's funding out with and I'm enjoying my life hanging out with this person, but then what happens when it's not as fun to hang out? What happens when you start feeling like the initial passionate romance is gone and then you feel like you're having to force things or make things happen? That's when you're supposed to get into a responsible relationship, but I don't want that. I think that's the problem. Who wants to experience that the doldrums, the flat seas where you're just sort of floating out there on a life raft with this person started off as this insane, wonderful, romantic yacht cruise through the sweet ocean of passion and love with mermaids climbing up on the banks of secret islands singing about the glories of transcendent love. The stars overhead dancing as you and your sweet new lover made passionate love on the deck of your magical ship pirated by a captain by a romantic skeleton pirate. Sounds scary, but he's awesome. He like brings scotch down to your sumptuous room in the ship where you play some mysterious piano instrument made of crystal keys and seeing songs of love to your darling and listen to the waves pound against the side of the ship and think about how you have found a bastion of harmony and safety and comfort in this turbulent universe of disaster and chaos while all those around you flail miserably through the awful world lost their hearts closed down somehow this moment of perfect beauty has opened up for you and all the things that used to seem so boring and dull all the crappy songs that used to strike you as being mediocre lies spit out by overpaid cocaine addicts who seem to have generated their obvious lyrics on a rudimentary computer from the 1970s seems like the poetry being sung by angels in heaven and that's what it's like to be in love and then something happens something inevitably happens perhaps it's a realization maybe you realize that there's no fucking way that you're going to be able to maintain a relationship when there is a massive age difference between you and the person maybe you see that you just recognize that you realize like oh this isn't fixable neither one of you is bad it's just how can you make up for time this whole thing where older guys date younger girls is a kind of like thing you know what is that is that a good idea i don't see how that's a good idea i thought it might be a good idea maybe that's the problem but then you can't really judge someone based on their age on either side of the spectrum right you just have to let things be as they are and if you love someone you love somebody so you forget about the whole age thing or whatever but then cracks start appearing in the windshield of the science fiction utopia that it's not a windshield this is what it's like it's like mars think of mars mars the barren dead planet just one big fucking desert nothing used to be water there used to be possibly super advanced hyper intelligent green-skinned shaman-like beings that lived in verdant forests and tamed scorpion creatures that they rode around at festivals that happened every couple of martian days maybe maybe they smoked incredibly powerful martian vapor that allowed them to see through time and space um who knows but now it's just a dead rotting planet it's like somebody built on mars some sort of utopian paradise a bubble a glass bubble terraformed the bubble returned some tiny little piece of mars to the former beauty of what mars was brought a little piece of mars back to life now you look out that window surrounding the science fiction geranium that you're somehow living in and all you see is death red dust rocks rising up but inside this little geranium it's beautiful beautiful the oxygen is so pure and clean and the martian pet scorpion creatures are so cute and everyone's singing and it's glorious but then a micro meteorite smashes into the side of that fucking martian geranium in the form of a realization you know a realization pops into your head like oh my god there's no fucking way that i'm going to be able to to uh to maintain this uh this this relationship because our priorities are completely different maybe that's what you realize and then now you've gone into this now you're in the mode of like oh fuck i'm gonna have to like pretend that this is working out and then it isn't and then you know then the fights start happening and that's another micro meteor and the next thing you know the whole fucking thing is falling apart cracking in the the sacred sweet oxygen blasting out until finally you realize this is not a place where two people can live together anymore and that's when the relationship ends you're back to square one again contemplating the impermanence of everything having probably lost a really close friend because you how do you end a relationship gracefully like how does that happen you know i mean i guess it can be done you know kind of like the way the Mayans maybe used to sacrifice children it was probably like a sweet thing i know that sounds weird but maybe they figure out a way to make it kind of beautiful and poignant and you know the kid gets fattened up on candied apples and honey and and Mayan booze for a year until the kid's super fat and covered in perfume and then doesn't even thinks there's a steak at the top of the pyramid and before he can blink there's a Mayan dagger cutting his heart out and holding it up to the eclipse or something maybe that maybe the Mayans knew how to do it but how do you end a relationship how does a relationship end in a non tumultuous brutal fiery sizzler level crap steak you know what i mean so there you are you know alone in the ruins of this former Martian utopia looking at the shattered bits of glass that used to protect you from the horrible climate of mars breathing in an oxygen tank seeing all the smashed cute martian pet scorpions that somehow made it into this terrible analogy festering on the soil of mars the thing that was once this beautiful lovely environment is gone and now you're just sitting there on mars alone staring up at that weird black sky and you realize this is reality this is the truth the truth is this a wasteland a blasted wasteland i've got to get used to this this is what i've got to get used to and gradually over time this is in my fantasy you begin to learn how to live outside of that stupid bullshit geranium that you always construct where you pretend that you're on some kind of romantic ship floating through an ocean of peace when in fact you're murking through the darkness that is the darkness that every human being must confront in their lives if they want to actualize themselves and that's where you want to stay right there in that world not distracting yourself again with some other bullshit relationship not getting lost in the hypnotic spell of this thing or that thing but just realizing that if you really want to terraform mars if you want to terraform the mars of your life which is the rubble of all the past relationships and everything that went away if you want to if you can't build something made of glass on an alien fucking planet you've got to figure out how to be alone that's what i'm trying to say in some weird hippie hemp speak you got to figure out how to be alone that's it alone really alone laying back in that cold or super boilingly hot martian dirt and letting your body get fried and melted and re amalgamated into the soil of the emptiness which you are somewhere on the other side of that i think you can really find some some amazing romance you know but i'm trying to find romance or love or trying to like make these secret intimate special connections with just one person is probably a waste of time anyway not a waste of time but it's a kind of selfish act do you ever consider that do you ever consider that your obsession with your relationship your obsession with this one person is in its own right a selfish act that that is in its own way a mistake one of the one of the great mistakes that we all make that we all fall prey to you know like when you're a kid and you got your security blanket or your pacifier that kind of thing it's like maybe the answer is to just be alone not in like a depressed way not alone like you're you're the elephant man sort of hobbling through the world with a cane and a bag over your head maybe alone in the sense of like i am no longer going to seek um relief in any one thing i'm not going to try to soothe the pain inside of me using nectar that i have extracted from a false impression of another person anyway you just decided that this it's like what you don't want to fucking date a walking placebo where you think this is the goddamn answer and all these songs they sing on the radio know trick you into believing that this is one of the main goals like that's the bullseye they trick you into thinking the fucking bullseye is located in between someone's legs or in their heart or whatever whatever there's far less vulgar ways to say that like that awful song that came out what was that terrible song that came out a while ago was so bad oh my god i'm trying to try to try to remember this fucking song it's about some loon who like comes to somebody's door and and tells him that she's happy he's like i'm gonna find someone like you i can't remember the name of the song it's really weird though like a loon the whole song is about this loon who hobbles up to somebody's door after they've gotten married and is like listen i'm i'm really happy that you're married and just you know i i think i might be able to find someone who's who's like you out there it's like a song it's like a stalker anthem there's songs like that get shotgunned out of the fucking radio to the point where so many people are just wandering around desperately trying to find some person to the matching piece of the puzzle god how weak is that like you're incomplete you know like the idea is you're this incomplete thing and you're trying to find this other thing to complete you like like you're a you're a you're a lego and there's some other lego that will perfectly fit into your lego and man once that great conjunction happens oh lordy here come the angels but that doesn't happen you find conjunctions desk people are definitely made to fit into each other's holes there's no question about that all of life depends on the fact that we fit into each other's holes quite well but before you put it in somebody else's hole you need to find your own hole w h o le you need to be a hole a hole not a hole because if you're a hole h o le and then you end up becoming obsessed with someone else's h o le then all you are is one big h o le hole a pit that's it a suction one big black hole sucking each other down into some kind of miserable state it's very sad god damn it the suck the thing that sucks the thing that sucks about this this black hole problem the thing that sucks about when a relationship implodes on itself is that when you find inevitably walk away there's the potential for walking away a little darker you know like that a little less trusting a little more confused i don't know maybe that's good maybe that's good it's just i wish that there was a like a magical relationship counselor unicorn that would appear out of a rainbow when things started getting weird and would just sit down with you and your and your and your lover oh don't you understand here's what he really means to say this is what she really means that's all see underneath it it's all just love that'd be great but that doesn't happen that doesn't happen and you know i've been lucky i think i've been lucky because i don't have babies and and that you know quite often that happens is is you you find a person merge together the merger creates a baby the baby is a kind of manacle that locks you two together even though these you realize like oh no this is just a terrible mistake that can happen too that's why the divorce rates are so high you know i don't you know you guys know i'm friends with christopher ryan he wrote this incredible book sex at dawn christopher ryan's the reason the sounds better on this podcast because he gave me an incredible soundboard this book sex at dawn is all about how monogamy doesn't tend doesn't work quite often i'm a monogamous person i've never been in an open relationship and though i often contemplate how i maybe i would give it a shot yeah it never ends up happening because i'm i get jealous so stupid but you know i was talking to a friend and they were like well monogamous relationships never work or non monogamous relationships never work non monogamous relationship sweet open relationships never heard of them working it's like i've never heard of a relationship working they don't none of them fucking when do they ever work and define work what does work even mean like in the same way that whenever you start talking about some kind of i don't know idea of how you should love yourself and practice mindfulness and meditate and spend your time in disciplined contemplation so that you could become a better person and help someone near and close to you inevitably somebody will say yeah but what about the starving african children your meditation won't help them there's always a starving fucking kid who comes into any any kind of subjective solution to the suffering inside of you you're always supposed to be worrying over this starving kid or fukushima or some thing out there in the same way there's in in our minds is the myth this bigfoot legend of this elderly couple that's been married for 30 years and has never had a single fight in their entire lives and they bake each other bread and they they go out and sit in the yard and sip tea and stare at the garden that they've cultivated together for years and their grandchildren come and they they give the grandchildren little mints and the grandchildren dance around them and sing beautiful hymns about how wonderful life is and how happy they are that these two elderly people copulated back in the 40s and popped out two more people who copulated and blasted out these little kids who are this kind of wave of happiness rolling through time of which this elderly paradise couple is a part it's fucking Sasquatch man where is this elderly couple i want to interview them for the goddamn podcast and then after the podcast i'm going to strangle them they don't exist they don't exist i think it's a myth it's no fucking goddamn titanic you don't end up in an in the afterlife you don't end up in the goddamn afterlife in some magic boat a child again that doesn't happen or being misdirected here i'm not saying that you can't be happy with a person or you can't find someone who like is right for you or someone that you can connect with but you can't fucking connect with somebody if you haven't transformed yourself from a whole to a whole and i don't know many people who've done that and most of the people who have done that don't seem to really care about being in a relationship it's a paradox it's like eating you know this you know how like they say that you should eat before you go to the grocery store so you're not hungry at the grocery store so like if you eat before you go to the grocery store it makes grocery shopping like much less exciting because you're not really hungry and then all this shit that you end up buying when you're hungry and stoned at the grocery store doesn't make its way into the cart you'll just end up with some kale and grapes or something a couple of oranges as opposed to like five bags of cashews some 16 kombucha's overload a banana's two rotisserie chicken some kind of weird sushi to go plate soups just end up with some kale and like saltless saltines that's what it's like i mean if you go into a relationship with this kind of like famine mentality you know or i don't know this kind of just sucking hole inside of you then yeah it's great at first because in the same way it's great when a heroin addict finally manages to get a hypodermic needle filled with some new juice blasted into their oozing sore on their fucking arm it's great it's the hunger you know the hunger amplifies this the the sense of the hunger is what paradoxically creates the pleasure of eating but this is a cycle that only ends up in more hunger so i don't know i'm single now that's it that's it for me i'm cashing in my bitcoins um speaking of bitcoins i would listen to this amazing i first of all somebody from the interwebs sent me a real a smart email about how i should start accepting bitcoins for the shop at the dunkatrustle.com and then i've been investigating this stuff listen to bitcoin a bitcoin story on npr and uh does anybody out there really understand bitcoins who listens to this and if so uh what what do you guys what do you think about creating a dunk and trustle family hour bitcoin mining collective because there's this thing you can do mining for bitcoins where you basically use the uh uh you when you're not using your computer i don't know what it's doing it's like processing some kind of weird algorithm that over time finds bitcoins which then get deposited in some account and then if you do it by yourself um you'll it's like you'll find one bitcoin every three years or something like that but if collectives do it then apparently it's i don't know it seems fun but i don't want i don't want to spend any time bothering with it but if somebody out there knows how to do it i think it'd be an interesting little experiment for the the listeners of the dunk and trustle family our podcast to become a part of just to see what happens if it's easy and it doesn't require somebody to spend uh inordinate amounts of time uh working on this stuff so and you know how ever all really great things in the world are easy i'm sure it's incredibly difficult but i've been thinking about that and um that's me single and mining for bitcoins doing great okay we've got a great podcast with the creator of the podcast network which i am part of feral audio my friend dustin marshall and uh he's gonna break down podcasting he's gonna break down uh what uh what the various podcast networks um it's gonna be a mildly controversial podcast um not really controversial i love dustin and i love feral audio and uh there's so many great shows on there um if you if you if you only listen to this podcast you should give a listen to um like call chelsea paredi listen to her show man she is so funny she is such a funny funny person and her show is so hilarious and uh and weird so listen to that listen to steve agie show listen to harm in town there's a lot of great podcasts on this network and um you should check them out man so listen i didn't mean to seem negative in the beginning ran i'm just trying you know i'm processing this stuff myself and uh thinking about it and and i've always told you i've generally been completely on open about whatever i'm dealing with uh personally and uh so that's just what i'm thinking about right now and uh i don't mean to seem negative about it if you're in a relationship cherish every precious moment of it because it's great they're great when it's working it's incredible it's incredible enjoy it suckle at that sweet nipple sticking out of the time space continuum enjoy it absorb it hear the angels sing i don't mean to sound so negative and if you're in if you're in a relationship that isn't that great don't just end it work work on talking to each other because underneath it guaranteed you guys just love each other and you're just trying to like it's a language barrier a lot of the times but if that's not what it is then definitely get out of it because if you feel like it's if you feel like if you feel like that lego isn't plugging into the your hole in the right way you gotta you gotta go there's no point in that there's no point in that you know if the screwdriver isn't the right size for the screw you'll fuck up the top of the screw and then other screwdrivers won't be able to screw the screw in or out as as sigman froid once said so brilliantly so there we go let's do some quick business

for a really low price so there you go there are my commercials and for you assholes who get mad about these commercials you can skip ahead this isn't tv man i'm not fox news i'm not cnn on serious radio where you go to cnn and it's you're lucky if you hear anyone talk about the news where it's just blender commercials and commercials for rascals this is like the just a little tiny piece of the whole fucking thing somebody tweeted to me like make your commercials under five minutes fuck you man jump ahead isn't that one of the joys of the digital age you can just jump ahead you don't have to listen to the commercials if you don't want to i'm not what are you that sensitive it's just that it's weird when the combination of like liking a thing but then like being pissed at the monetization of the thing it combines like what are you especially when you're not helpless i mean maybe if i started like if i figured out some way to do the thing that they do on youtube or before you watch the youtube video you've got to get injected with a no kia commercial for two minutes you know maybe if there's a way where like i you could only listen to the podcast after having consumed a commercial and you had no choice then i could kind of understand some complaints because that's annoying you know no one likes commercials nobody likes it just feels weird you feel like the the guy from the clockwork orange he's got his eyes pried open and it's like before you want to watch the video of the guy being electrocuted at the top of the tower you've got no kia has to sell you a phone which is pretty weird when you consider that it's like and on the internet you know that seems kind of normal in the sense that you have to it's like you're almost paying for it with your time like two minutes of watching a no kia commercial buys you three minutes of a man being eaten by an anaconda but if that happened in real life like someone came up to me was like listen man i've got this video that i want to show you it's a guy getting it's a guy with an anaconda climbing into his asshole do you want to see it you're like fuck yeah i want to see that and he's like okay great let me just tell you a little bit about no kia that would be weird but on the internet's okay and i guess what's weird is you're being held hostage in the situation of podcast commercials there's no you're not being held hostage you can skip ahead and also if you find yourself getting angry about commercials at the beginning of a podcast it's time to sit down and really think about your life like is that really activating rage inside of you is that really upsetting you that's where you're at that's creating reactivity consider it just think about it sit down and think about that that's where you're at it's a sign that you need to start drinking kava kava perhaps i get mad at stupid shit too guys so don't feel bad i get mad too oh well that's just part of human life isn't it we have to be the entire pendulum sweeping from mediocrity and rage to blissfulness and joy somewhere in that terrible path through the polarities of the self that is where we'll find happiness good luck if you find it send me an email today's guest on the dunca trestle family our podcast is the creator of feral audio the greatest podcast collective in existence today he's also a dear friend of mine and a beautiful sweet

technically marshal yeah welcome thanks for having me fuck yeah man we're made it finally we did it i shouldn't have put it off so long come here but you know hold on cute little puppy in here yeah i got my dog here feral audio is uh is is everyone who listens to my podcast knows the duncatrussell family ours part of feral audio and you are the founder president and uh everything of feral audio out except you don't have your own podcast no which is weird yeah i never really wanted to be on mic but i'm on kind of brody stevens on the reg now i've been on actually a couple but i don't have my own now uh but yeah the the podcast collective that was started in your volvo yeah that's right almost over a year and a half ago oh wow yeah except like the whole antithesis is heavily involved with you and your show and when i came here and met you but it yeah that's a strange thing because you used to listen to the lavender hour before you came to los angeles yeah i used to stock groceries like frozen food and i was always a big comedy fan and like a diy bedroom producer then i started going to college for like electronics because i wanted to like learn how to fix shit when it broke right and uh i just became obsessed with podcasts and then i found the lavender hour and it just uh it was my my favorite and then i came out here and you are always looking for like sound help on the show yes i came out here and i saw natasha and i was like i used to looking for help and she's like yes please and then my second sunday here you and i met you on your doorstep that is wild it is trippin and and but before that like cuz it was very cosmic to me because what was the headphones um i had you you were kind of my conduit into like spiritual like uh meditation and i started practice that in college and i kind of attribute my success in college and like getting out of there alive to like mastering breathing and right anxiety and all that shit but you were the first person when i started listening to it you'd like reference crowley or something and i was like oh shit who is this guy but you got me to alan watz and rom das and so like for six months i got heavily involved in meditation and you were like my my introduction and all that that is crazy and then and then um you you came you started helping us to the lavender hour and uh natasha and i separated one our separate ways yeah that was brutal that's like my parents getting divorced or something yeah yeah you're like my mom and dad out here my first my first six months in la you just mentored me to care of me and then yeah and then uh it's so strange i remember you were working for ear wolf yeah i came here to work for ear wolf as an audio engineer you were working at ear wolf ear wolf ear wolf ear wolf how do you fucking mispronounce wolf it's the ear wolf you were working at ear wolf and uh you were deeply involved in pod podcasting and then i remember that conversation we're sitting in my volvo i think i was a little drunk maybe yeah we were at the big foot lodge and we were like kind of in the back of a bar seat because uh the stuff that your wolf wasn't working out it was just like really dramatic and and it wasn't working out and then i wanted to keep doing and i was like well how do i keep doing this and then you just kind of took me under your wing and like really mentored me and uh we were like okay so originally it was gonna fair a lot it was gonna be like uh like a seminar or something i think you were like the idea was you were gonna um introduce me to comics and i was gonna like teach people how to do podcast for like a small nominal fee yeah and then i was gonna kind of be there on call if they needed help and then we were like well what if we did it as a like a network and i was like well i i'm from madison where there's like these art i used to volunteer in art collective and i used to work at like a community radio station so i had this idea of doing it like an art collective where everybody just pulls their things together and we just i i asked a bunch of people and they all said yes and then it happened in a month we launched that it happened from your car in a month we had five shows on the website it was crazy how quickly it expanded and because it was because what was happening you know i don't know what podcasts are doing these days but there was a time when so like um you know podcast networks started springing up and there was let's see there's the podcast networks i can think of right now are feral audio death squad uh earwolf nerdist spot adam corolla adam corolla smott smodcast smodcast so there's like all these networks that are uh that started springing up and then basically all of these networks had various deals that they were working with the people who were doing the podcast and not naming any names but some of those some of them had fucked up deals where like they would get podcasters you would go in and they would tell you before you started they're like look you're never gonna make any money from this podcast and you're gonna like get people to come to your shows this is the classic like you'll get publicity thing right but but uh that is crazy that's crazy because then like the uh the podcasters would advertise and the network would get everything yeah it wasn't just what it's not just one like everybody basically what all these in like uh my my history with earwolf was kind of amazing because i started going i'm from madison wisconsin i started going to chicago to this comedy festival just for just for laughs and that's my first year is where i met dino um we're at star burns industries right now which is owned by dan harmon and dino cementopolis which is now they're letting us use the studio to record you're you're jumping ahead too far um but uh i met dino and like uh bob odin Kirk and david cross my first year there who and i would later work with and my next year i met like ocherman and this guy jeff allrick and they started they were starting this thing and it wasn't called anything yet so i had like i was volunteering and helping so i've watched all this all the networks like boom and it was really interesting it happened in like two years man so this thing happened like so fast but they were trying they're everything they popped up like tv networks like they were making people sign stuff that were like uh okay um we own uh all of this and we are doing all the bulk of the work and so um yeah it was like you they're just straight up in the pitch meeting like you're not going to make any money from this and then i would go to like the lavender hour we'd have these big meetings or whatever and we're constantly talking like well how do we monetize podcasts like how is it how does it work and then go to the lavender hour and you're like let's fucking just put a dollar episode up and you guys paid your rent and i was like holy shit that's how you do it well it's still i mean that's yes that's one that's definitely one way to do it and but for that to work you've got to be putting out a bunch of other you have to i think for every one episode that you charge for you need to have just a ton of free episodes so for a lot of different reasons uh the one reason that i just did my first bonus episode for the dunker trestle family hour and uh i'm glad i did it but then a part of me feels like man it's cool but then you're cutting your audience so much and you know i don't know there's two different schools of thought when it comes to monetizing a podcast one is subscription model you the like you get four episodes or something and then if you want to go back in the archives you've got to pay this really nominal price per year to go into the back archives and then there's the pay per episode one that a lot of people do and i think that's the most logical one because i just like the idea of the podcast being available to everybody and also i'm sure i haven't checked but i guarantee somebody already uploaded the bonus episode i did this youtube or yeah pyro bay or something which is fine because i think people listen to the podcast know that you know if they really looked i bet they could find a pirated version of anything they're just doing they're just it's a way to support the podcast if you feel like they want to they want to do it so it works yeah that's the idea but uh to get back to uh feral audio where it came from um you know these networks start springing up and and some of them are offering a kind of uh and they're being honest about the deal you know so it's not like they're being unethical because they're clearly presenting to the person who's coming in look you you're not gonna have to buy equipment you're not gonna have to buy microphones you're not gonna have to edit this shit all you have to do is come in here and talk and that's it and then you're gonna get some you're gonna get a lot of publicity for this and uh and we're gonna make money from it and the money's gonna go to pay for all our overhead and that's a classic network model except for the fact that no one's getting paid at all like networks generally pay people but that model was was the publicity dollars month publicity currency yeah the bitcoin of fucking crooks yeah no i came out here like some people were the network was giving like 95 percent of everything and it was just it was nuts and it was outside of podcasting too because when i came here and i started working as a comedy fan like a lot of comics and i like don't get like mostly mostly don't get paid for doing sets out here yeah comics work for free and they work their asses off and so i was thinking like the the how long it takes to be a a good comedian you put like 15 20 years and then yeah my idea was like i put an emphasis on the creative part of it as like the bulk of the work and then so we did this radical thing where i was like well instead of slowing things down with contracts and like all and negotiating stuff we'll do like a handshake deal you'll give 80 percent of everything and then we'll get like a little kick back 15 percent goes to me my volunteers five percent goes to my webmaster who's your webmaster who you set me up with a great steed steed grief uh chroma dial chroma dial he's amazing and then we just started doing this and the idea was like to have every one of our shows as big as your show because you were you were like really inspirational because you were just pounding out these great great content really honest like not forced and you were you were experimenting and you were you were able to make this like successful donation model and do all this stuff and like just by like putting yourself out there and experimenting like you figured something out so the goal is to like start with the Duncan Trussell family hour and then start new shows and have all the shows as big as our biggest show yeah and then you the the good part about a network is that it's a home base and what i like to think about Ferrell is that it has we have good taste like across the board yeah so the the good part about having a network is that you know you can share audiences and uh so if 50 000 people are listening to Harman Town and then Dan Harman goes on Duncan's podcast and then 50 000 of his people move over and start listening to that too like it maybe it's the same people but to advertisers and download numbers it it doubles essentially and by the way all of you guys right now are feeling upset about the fact that we're talking about the business yeah sorry well no don't be sorry because this is i i think there's like you know on the internet there's these weird archetypes of people that emerge and one of my least favorite forms of this is the asshole who complains over the fact that people are getting paid to make entertainment they they hate it they have this idea like somebody you know when i released this bonus episode some cunt on my website uh on the forum wrote something like you get paid to mess around with stand-up comedy now why are you charging for this and it's a really weird thing to say to somebody i think because it's like well you don't really know how much i get paid to do stand-up comedy and even if you did uh it doesn't seem like it's your place to tell anybody that they shouldn't uh they shouldn't get paid for entertainment as though entertaining or i hate that word because entertaining it makes me think of like somebody in a tuxedo dancing in front of like a cartoon spiral or something it just is a i don't i don't know what what exactly this is but i don't i don't think there's anything wrong uh with people creating content uh getting paid for the content i think that's a good thing and in fact i think you would rather people on the fringes uh get paid than the than the people at the core of the fucking thing which is like the uh like mbc or cbs or abc that is sort of like you know some of this content they create it's great but a lot of the times it's gross and it's always riddled with these creepy fucking commercials that are being spit out by various corporations that make you feel like you're living during the apocalypse it seems i like the idea of the these fringe things which right now we're calling podcasts right being successful in a traditional way which means that the people putting them on uh are getting paid as though it were their job i think that's great and uh so i don't think there's anything wrong with it and it's really annoying when these fucking uh web hippies on your by the way this guy's posting this shit on my forum like on a forum where i give somebody a percentage of everything i make to maintain and also that costs a monthly fee to put up he's using the fucking thing to complain about the thing that's why we don't have a message board on feral like a message board culture is i love your message board but it even every message board gets all these problems with like they become really clicky reminds me like high school or something but yeah there's people who absolutely i the the support for feral's been amazing we're still relatively small but like yeah some people hate me hate the idea of it don't like i what is it they hate about it the they think that just because you live in like la or they they don't understand and i i'm i've worked every shitty job you can imagine like a janitor a medical clinic mcdonnell size 23 like i'm from working class wisconsin janitor in a medical i was cleaning up like bloody pus vomit and diarrhea and shit with a toothbrush with a toothbrush yeah yeah like out of toilets it was nuts i've done every i was like a bookkeeper at a gas station like and then so i came out here from that background and my first thing was like holy shit like people in la work really hard yes it's just that work here is completely different because there's all this downtime because one second like early like i've made more money this year than i've ever made congrats thanks but i just spent three months almost like moving into my car destitute just destitute like almost wanting to blow my brains out like what the hell am i going to do work a whole like destitute for those of you i mean guys i'm sorry if this is a kind of meandering interview but just so you know uh so like i uh when i work on my podcast when i when i put out a podcast depending on uh you know what what i decided to do in the beginning of the thing just putting out one episode of this podcast can has it the most taken me you know two or three days just to put out one and and it's not always like that sometimes i just decide to do commercials in the beginning and then go into the interview if i really if i feel like that's enough or if i just want to get episodes out but sometimes if i really want to get into it it's like two days sometimes you generally it's like six hours eight hours something like that but if it varies wildly uh dustin is when when ferrell was just starting off was doing that kind of editing for five different podcasts and not just the editing but the scheduling this fucking scheduling having to wrangle comedians to get them to come to some place and do anything is not an easy task they're masters of cancelling yeah masters of canceling i i have a phd in cancelling if you ever need help cancelling something email me and i can definitely help you come up with a good way out uh that's what comedians do yeah but you so you are um uh editing hours and hours of content scheduling the content running a website and then getting everything uploaded and then during all this insane work by yourself you were um uh simultaneously trying to figure out a way to monetize the thing right and of all that the money that you would have made you would have only gotten 20 percent reduced by whatever you're paying st and the rest go into the artist so a very very ambitious utopian idea uh started ferrell audio and what's interesting uh is that you you kept going in this kind of weird robert deniro cape fear pull-ups in the closet weird tattoos yeah desperately stalking uh this the success of ferrell audio so i've always been massively impressed by your dedication to the thing and uh um i just don't think a lot of people understand that no it's it's it's still to this day ferrell audio has always been 12 to 20 hours a day i haven't taken a day off since i started it is 12 to 20 hours a day of recording editing management all that shit um and i love it it's it's like i i live for it the i i fall asleep with my laptop i wake up with it the first thing i do it's the last i've like it's it's a it's a lot of work and um i mean i push myself to the limit like i i think we have over 26 shows now so jesus yeah man and i master every single one of those as if they're a comedy of mine i don't cut corners with anybody show like every show i i it's never like well i got to go to better i got to go to a show no no i give every single minute of audio i touch i it's really important to me that it's quality and it's the best that it can be so and it's and and and so from all that hard work yeah uh i it's cool to watch your it's cool to watch your trajectory because you came it's trippy yeah it doesn't even feel real to like me and atasha when we are recording on shitty microphones at her house and then over the course of the the the transformation that happened to both of our lives because of podcasting yeah um over the course of that i ended up you know giving you my the vault the very volvo yeah that we plan ferro audio in i was able to give to you because i was able to get a new car and then in the or lease a car and then in the in the course of this uh growth of ferro audio you went from um you went from like pretty if i no offense but i you i don't think anyone i don't think you would be offended by this but you went from a pretty wretched situation dark wretched situation to like starting to work with dan harman and then uh harman uh got involved with ferro because he's a an incredible guy who uh i think like all of us senses that this podcasting thing is much more than just podcast yeah he really gets him believes he gets it yeah and you get it and i get it and and so that so uh and a lot of people get that this is more than just people who don't understand you know like a lot of comedians and not a lot but a common hack a new hack thing a new hack joke comedians make is everybody's god yeah i love i love podcast jokes because i'm i'm like one of three assholes in the world that takes it seriously and then i have to laugh like how seriously i take podcasting yeah but i like i think it is serious it is serious well with the the networks really like like you can see earwolf are having a very successful tv campaign another production company their intention from the beginning was to make tv shows yeah podcast podcasting was a jumping point for Nerdist and them they want to make tons of media which is awesome like ferro wants to do that stuff but i and i i sound like a broken record with this it's on the website but like in my lifetime i'm i i was never a great artist i was never a great musician and and like i really liked subversive movements of of art and music and in my lifetime the podcasting boom and this stuff immediately like it was uncensored it was so much more dangerous than what like rock bands were doing right i was hearing these crazy ideas and getting exposed to shit in my i was like 2526 when i started listening to them and i was getting exposed to like really out a adult awesome conversation relevant stuff because it was turned out so timely like the most relevant conversation and it enhanced my growth and i was like well this is the most like subversive thing in my lifetime right obsessed with it i want to know how it is how it works and then the idea of like the engineer like a podcast engineer didn't exist until this guy that i replaced at earwolf this guy dug they called him engineer dug at earwolf he was kind of this like awesome hip hop guy and then he would he would do these things on like comedy death ray radio and he would do these awesome like rap beats and sound effects and he would his contribution to it like you knew who he was and you knew everything he touched and so when i came out here you like and personal life stuff in tandem like with the acceleration of my life like i had never been on a plane before and my first time on a plane was to los angeles from wisconsin wow a carry-on bag i broke up in like a with my girlfriend of five years put all my stuff in storage i came out here with a carry-on bag and slept on like dirty clothes in a after slum for like two weeks and then just bought an air mattress like worked my way up um worked your way up to an air mattress yeah yeah and we started ferrell in the shitty apartment and like and so i just came out here and i haven't stopped moving like but and this is where i think it's gonna get more interesting like i'm kind of a simpleton like i don't of course like i think and i i think about this stuff constantly and it's all i can think about and it can it's consumed my life like uh but i also feel like at times like i'm in the passenger seat of what's happening yeah like i've been swept up and and i think for some reason i was very lucky because um like the month we started this was like the darkest month ever i had no money my college loans had kicked in i i started ferrell thinking it would only last for a month and then this awesome group uh this artist group called puny did animation for yo gaba gaba like gave us a space in their office paid me a salary and let me do ferrell audio out of their thing while i worked for them and when that expired and i went on tour with harman um we we toured the country with a podcast this is an amazing experience and all these ferrell like people who this is gonna sound however it's gonna sound but it was literally like i had lost touch with what it's like to be in the midwest listening to this shit because i was in the room for so long but like people were coming up to me who were just like there because of ferrell and like that was the point was like oh holy shit like it's i'm having an impact you realize you're having an impact and that's like that that's a reminder that this is more than just recording a bunch of narcissists and yeah and in and editing what they say forgive me i'm joking about that but but you realize like oh this is actually touching people is having an effect on people and then that's gotta be that i mean that's that is a a massive acceleration from scrubbing diarrhea out of toilets in a medical clinic it's so rewarding and then uh i i think like it was it's so it was so exciting like i just uh i feel like i try to like live a life of service i try to like wake up and go i love nothing more than to help people and i the thing i like to work like work makes me happy and i like to just uh be working on something that i like that i believe in and that's when i'm my happiest so when i got to la and i was an audio engineer like there's always audio engineers right now are like struggling for work and they're like can't find music because the music industry is basically collapsing yes i got all this freelance work and was working a web series and shit because comedians all the audio engineers that they have are just music guys who don't give a shit about comedy right if you do audio and comedy get out here you will get work immediately sure and so everybody was like yeah can you help me with this and i was like yes yes whatever you need and i just like to i like facilitating more i want to make and it's part of itself ish but it never felt like any of this belonged to me it felt like it was a big thing that i'm all of it i felt like i was a part of all the networks like it's it's it's funny to me that there's all these networks bringing up because i think that there's going to be some device or something and like in like less than five years we're all going to get sucked up into some kind of like ufo with like it's going to be desquad and ferrell and earl finertis and mary and we're all like hey remember when we were like kind of competing this is funny yeah the competing thing is is one of the weird byproducts i don't i don't think people would really uh it's a surprising thing that it happens sometimes and it gets very dramatic and very vicious sometimes and and and it is a frustrating element but i guess that's just you know what that is that here before you get into that stuff yeah the one thing you said that i really like is you feel like you're in the in the in the passenger seat yeah and i think a lot of us doing this stuff feel like i don't really i don't really feel is that i'm doing this as much as i'm getting to experience it as a bystander that happens to be involved in it that's a really clumsy way of saying no no no thank god that's exactly what it is i just i just wake up and i just do it because i do it i don't i'm not i i literally i mean i at this point i like money because it allows me to have experiences and do things and then allows me to like do more of this stuff yeah but my goal is not to be rich or anything i just like doing the work because it feels good but it's sometimes i wake up and i'm just like uh everything i accomplish that day it's like uh i don't even know where it comes from well you feel like there's a this is why i really love uh taley ardee chardon and uh however you say his fucking name and terrence mackenna and rupert shell drake and a lot of the great philosophers and mystics of our time present a version of the time space continuum where we are being drawn into this ever perfecting harmonious future and that um what ends up happening is you get pulled into this thing is that uh you see this complexification and harmonization of matter which is what technology represents and uh these are pre-existing forms in the time space continuum like structures that already exist and you're just a part of this structure or if you get sort of drawn into the eddy of a certain emergent form then you don't really you it's no longer you doing the thing as much as you've been pulled into this expression of time and that one of the great expressions of time that's happening right now or the time space continuum is podcasting but podcasting sounds so small compared to what it really is and what it really is is uh the ability to purely and honestly express yourself with no censorship at a using uh technology that was not in existence 10 years ago and if it was it was in such a rudimentary form that uh it was nowhere near as precise and great as it is and it was also very expensive compared to the how much it costs now so the point is what's so exciting about podcasting is you are bypassing or undermining all these monolithic ancient gates and and keeps and castles and walls that formerly separated lunatics from being able to communicate their ideas to the entire planet and now that's happening uh all everywhere that's exciting to be a part of that man that's bigger than podcasting we're talking about a revolutionary information dispersal uh machine it's like a like what you said you're affected by these ideas in the midwest hearing like people yammer and talk about real things and then that profoundly altered your life and compelled you and and so that i that i that idea is simultaneously beautiful and also incredibly sad the reason it's beautiful is because it's it's wonderful to know that uh media can cause positive changes in people by being honest and not being phony it's sad when you consider the networks whose content is not an honest reflection of anything more than their desire to get rich and to manipulate people into watching something so that they'll see advertisements and when you consider like fuck what would what would it be like if the main distribution mechanisms that information is transmitted to the people which is right now tv uh what if that was actually was honest what if it was really putting out big ideas or challenging people or doing more than just showing pregnant teens lulling around their shitty apartments what would it be like if it was more than just showing people with ocd who can't stop wiping their assholes or eating bleach what would it be like if if the main if the main networks started putting out truth what would that do to the world what would happen to the world in three days what would what would the world be like three days after fox news decided to stop being a mouthpiece for whatever globalist capitalist consumerist shitbags were controlling that and came out and just said look we're we don't need to be at war anymore and we can just take away four percent of the wealth of the most wealthy people on earth and transform the planet in radical ways and if we stop going to war in afghanistan and if we stopped going to all these ridiculous wars if we stop supporting the military industrial complex then we can send every american every person in america could go to college for free think about that that's i think that i on reddit came up that it's like a month a month you stop the war machine for a month and you send everyone in america to college for free it's so attainable and there's and a lot of like universities have their courses uh availability right now there's this great like open source website where there's a bunch of stuff like that right now i podcasting to me it's like it is it's the it's the it's a broadcasting revolution so it's like the voice of the internet right yes and like you want to talk like your episodes of joe rogan's podcast were like when they were those were coming out a couple years ago like 2010 or whatever yeah those were as influential to me as like radio heads albums like wow on the drive home for my grandfather's funeral i we me and my girlfriend listen to like six hours of you and rogan talking about shit and it expanded her mind and she was like a hardcore she's a fan of your podcast ever since but like i like expands consciousness and so the so it's it really is like it's the voice of the civilians and people and they can make the joke like everybody has a podcast yeah yeah i want every household like everybody should be broadcasting themselves you have this pirate radio station ability exactly and that's why i hate that elitist but go ahead that was the intention of radio and television like so there's this tryout that happens there's there's science and then there's art or creativity and then there's industry so the idea of radio was that it was going to be free voice of the people that it wasn't owned by the government and so what happens is all these ma and pa like companies were building these little radio towers in their community so you would have these little communities building their like as they got the tools back in the day like electronics like when you look like that whole you know the idea of like steampunk like that whole steampunk thing is is based on this early version of electronics where um when you got a phone or like a radio it was basically on a piece of wood and all the parts were exposed because basically if you owned an like piece of electronic equipment is because you knew how to build and maintain them wow so it wasn't till the fifties when they started industrializing uh um basically science and this DIY art form of like electronics that they started putting phones and shit and like cheap phone casings you know the idea like the plastic phone to hide the fact that they were using cheaper parts wow so industry comes in and industry is a very huge important part of art and science because absolutely science is the ballast art is the thing that makes it rise like okay so science lays the groundwork for the whole thing it like it lays the laws of physics science is like god right and so the art the creativity of the people involved in that science like like early science fiction has informed so much of basic like science fact like predicted quantum physics and stuff so what art does is it builds up in this kind of fractal way all these ideas and what industry does is it blasts it to the general populace and that's what business and industry does really well yeah but the problem with uh industry is that it doesn't give a fuck about art or science or people it cares about money and so what happens is with these tv networks like nbc there's this and i and i wouldn't dare try to quote it now when nbc first launched the the founder of nbc went on the air and he gave this amazing speech like about television was supposed to be basically what the internet is now like an open source information like field it was going to just like expand the consciousness of everybody that used to get when everyone's home it's a tool for your kids to learn and for like to get information out there immediately and what happens is uh there's nothing wrong with advertising like advertising works sure it's just that like the the industry happens where all these business people latch on like parasites and there's all these middlemen and people and they're only interested in money and so they inflate and they they crush everything they go on and that's like capitalism but the inner and they will happen to podcasting but right now you think it'll happen to podcast oh yeah it's art they're already trying to a million things to try to stop podcasting right like what they're they're trying to oh there's the patent role thing they're they're i heard that's getting knocked out hell yeah and that's because the e electronic frontier foundation i heard they found past versions of the thing that the guy was patented they already found versions of the patent pre-existing versions of the technology that the patent owner was claiming to have that's awesome that's true that's awesome that they're gonna squash that but for years they've been trying to put like tolls on the internet basically yes basically charging you to go to websites but the internet as we know it is we know it's garbage it's being monitored it's it's too corporate so there's all the there's already this dark internet did you hear about that sure i know about the dark yeah so dark net all these internets are gonna spring up and uh i think as far as like when the shit goes down the way i see it if shit ever really went down like dystopian stuff like podcasting is going to be readily it's going to be like a huge source of news for people right that it's going to be the quickest way to get information it already is a quick way to get information and it is a way to go ahead no i'm so sorry to finish my thought don't be sorry the reason comedians are such a great catalyst and the reason that it works so well with comedy first of all super entertaining and so and i'm having a hard time right now uh it's like i treat everything like art like it what's art what's entertainment what are we doing but comedians are above cops politicians your city council the president comedians get this license they're the bash the last bastion of free speech they get free reign right to have thought experiments and to just say shit that's crude they get they they're the last people on earth that get keys to the city verbally right and so it works well as comedians because it's under the skies of it's sure you know so that we're allowed to be honest we're scandal free like you know everyone knows we're all freaks you know jim norton freely talks about he likes to uh give blowjobs to uh transgendered people is how you say it not transgender like uh so so yeah man like uh uh yeah so but but i think that's just for now everyone needs to realize that they're allowed to say whatever they want they're allowed to be as honest as they want and this illusion of the entertainer this illusion of the singer the actor being somehow this always happy sophisticate who is like everything's always great that's the only way there can be scandals you know like somebody comes out of the car and you see her pussy or whatever and it's like what you those are buffing because because that why because all that is just rich just the the runoff uh all of that is the sweat dripping off of the demonic head of the monolithic evil juggernaut that is popular media it's sweat scandal it drips a scandal because for scandal to even to exist there has to be repression you have fucking Miley Cyrus is in Amsterdam and smokes a joint on stage and it is being projectile vomited out of every mass media source everywhere and everyone's gonna have their own dumb little take either an eye roll or i guess it's okay now or whatever but it's just all crap because it's like that's what's affecting us yeah the fact that some fucking uh singer inhaled plant matter that's it's the meat that's the media is bad man it's not good it teaches people to hate themselves to be small to kill themselves to to take to consume to not only consume to sexualize and romanticize like products and and in things that like kill them it's really and it's been like a thing like all this awesome art in the 80s uh and zines and bands were stuff like like uh even early maryland manson stuff about like kill your television like god is on the tv stuff but like it's really been used as a tool of evil and the intention of the television was the opposite yeah the intention of television was in and it can still be if it's utilize it has to they have to adapt to the internet the internet is like it's sprawling honesty it's unstoppable and um like with podcasting right now like yes people will do everything they can at some point when it when it gets when it starts making money like there's this cap on podcasting right now like i've talked to maren about this but there's like the cap of the podcast audience is like 1.7 million or 2 million people there's really like 2 million people in america or something that know what a podcast is okay i mean i don't know about that statistic but it's a fluid number yeah that's an insane but it's not it's still very underground you like usually like i think there's going to be some sort of device or something's going to happen that's like whatever when podcasting becomes gen pop when my mom i don't have to explain to my aunts and uncles what a podcast is anymore you know when it basically goes zack alpinakis when podcasts are in the hangover or whatever uh and you go to lots you go to lots you go to the like las vegas airport and this podcast t-shirts and shit yes um that's like going to be a whole that's when the sharks and all the all the big scary industry stuff's going to move in it's going to get really wonky and it's going to be scary and you're and so um i hope to my goal with feral is to like first of all like intelligently and properly monetize it and for we held out for a long time and i got really lucky with you know dan harman's financed me and and puny financed me and i got really lucky in that respect it would not have worked i don't think it's luck man i mean you know people get around you and they sense that you're kind of like one of the great uh patron saints of podcasting in the sense that you're so into it and what's rare about you is that you don't have your own show you have to understand how crazy that is for so many other of us attention hungry yappers to have you know like uh mitzsche started the comedy store and the comedy store is controversial and as much as like uh certain comics like to revile it you can't deny the fact that uh when it was during the comedy boom the comedy store was the nucleus of that and coming out of the comedy store were so many super famous uh or pre-famous comedians you see old pictures of mitzsche sure standing next to young jim carrey you know before he was even on on tv or before he even had a pilot and um uh uh she was his legal guardian in the united states you know yeah and also she had a house where she let comedians live there but she didn't want to she wasn't a stand-up yeah she just wanted to like she just wanted to create a place where stand-up could happen because she loved what it was and loves what it is she's still around i'm sorry i'm talking about her like she's not but the uh so that's what i'm saying it's like when people like you emerge on under the scene it's always very exciting and people recognize like okay great here's somebody who's actually gonna do the work because i'm sure it's not gonna do the work and dan har i mean i'll do i like putting out my own podcast but the idea of managing a network and going and editing other people's pot all that i couldn't do it it's not the type of creature i am it's just too much for me to imagine but you're somebody who it's just coming out of and i think that's a really beautiful thing man and that's why people are that's why people are eager to help you is because they recognize that this strange being that is currently called podcasting and all the can the all the the sum total of the thing is not just something you listen to while you're jogging it's just like what you said it's a voice for the people it's a voice and fuck yeah everyone do a everyone do a podcast god damn it why wouldn't you do it you just record yourself talking and upload it on the internet and why do you do it you don't do it because you want to be famous or because you want shit tons of money or because you want like whatever the thing is you do it because it feels good to connect it feels good to connect it feels good to connect with other people and it feels good to throw your voice into the void and see what comes back uh what what what comes screaming back out of that darkness and what you find generally what comes screaming back out of the darkness is love pure love exactly a hundred percent that it's just like overwhelming i i and i i'm so i've i'm i'm very uh like a i could i'm a i'm a depressive negative person sure you are but in my life jesus your twitter is like opening up a fucking coffin doomsday scenario why do you tweet these dark tweets all the time it's funny to me like i like dark shit is my comfort zone and i come if you met my family i'm i know i'm like the teeny bopper of my my family is dark like i just i know my family is dark i'm like the i'm like i might as well be christina aguilera of my family but uh so i'm like comforted by that like but but i what am i in my actual life i'm actually very like pretty outgoing and positive person yes like my actions are very true and honest but i i think that i mean i don't think and this is going to be weird because i think zen buddhism really helped me with this like as far as me not having my own podcast like i'm on a lot of podcasts on feral now because the hosts have invited me because we have a very personal relationship i did like a dating podcast on erin mcgathie show i'm on brodie stevens show now so if i if i have a podcast it's brodie's but you should do a podcast go ahead thank you but like i my i don't want to impose myself in this situation i i'm sort of in this awesome i get to like experience and absorb all of this stuff but i i'd like um for for whatever reason it is i just understand comedians and i work really well with them and it's not and it's because i'm not i'm not trying to get anything from them i'm not trying to like be a comedian i'm not trying to be a stand up so when i step to a comedian i understand their work and i was like well here i can i can i'm good at this thing i can help you with this thing um for some reason it's just like i'm very fluid in that right i lack in a lot of areas that like basic human areas that a lot of people don't have like day-to-day happiness relationship stuff uh structure like i thrive in chaos i'm a very chaotic person and and me being that type of chaotic person has hurt feral like i i feel like feral could be way bigger than it is right now um i've you know there's this great you know i think it may be alan watz you said it but he's you know he's talking about like self-deprecation is as egotistical as like yeah it is self-inflation yeah it's it's still self-absorption yeah it's it's as egotistical it's like self-absorbing you think so highly of yourself that you're better than people you think so lowly of yourself that you're beneath everybody it's the same thing the whole point is that what's come what what no matter what you're still stuck on yourself yeah and and the trick is if you can to just help other people and then forget about yourself this is the this is the place this is the thing that makes me forget about myself and i was like an anxiety to be written depressed you know i never went out and then i i found out i'm this idiot savant networker i think just because i'm just honest with people um and i mumble when i talk i'm not a very direct person you seem pretty direct in this podcast thanks people listening aren't going to agree with you okay well i think that you know anybody could do what i do but i love everything that you're saying right now you should write it down on a pad and then mark it off and say well that's not me anymore because then whenever anyone starts saying i'm this or i'm that it's a really funny thing to get into you know like here's what i'm like it's like really that's what you're like well who's the one talking about what you're like what's that thing like that's what i want to know because the moment you do the thing where you're like here's what i'm like now you've split your self into these two things there's the you doing the commentary on the you that you think you're like but the you that you think you're like clearly can't ever exist because it's being spoken about as a symbol by the thing that you really are and the thing that you really are talk about that that's the big exercise like all right aside from all the ways that you're like that you think you're like what is the way that the thing talking about what you're like is like get into that thing and then you end up falling into infinity into that weird white oblivion i mean that's what you've given me and that's like i think you're i think like dan harmon fosters a lot of artists and creatives and he's done it with like channel 101 and stuff i think dunkin's legacy is he's giving a lot of people empowering people with like the spiritual practice so like i don't think anybody's worked with you as closely as i have now but you've given me even before i met you and now working close like you've literally taken me to your place you've taught me meditations you've you've you've taken me through like thought experiments in like the darkest lows that have like i had to call you the next day and you to talk me down because i was like i i try to wrap my mind around it but like uh yeah there i couldn't even comment on that i'm i'm too uh i have apparently no i'm here i'm commenting on myself again but i don't have perception of how i really am because i'm still uh super neurotic and in depression well the point you don't have to stop it's just like you know it's a mindfulness exercise where you begin to notice like okay i guess i've defined myself as this way or that way and then you realize oh the very the act of defining defining myself as this way or that way is actually a prison because i don't have to be this way or that way and that's why like you know with uh when i am when i get the most blocked creatively when i get podcast block it's always when i think i need to be funny it's always when i think i'm a comedian so i should be funny and then when the moment i start thinking like that then instead of being the way that i i might feel like being which who knows the way that is maybe i feel like being sanctimonious as uh feral audio has described me on their website or maybe i feel like being what where not feral i mean ear wolf they have some episodes sanctimonious so i guess i am sanctimonious but if i feel like being fucking sanctimonious i'm going to be sanctimonious or if i feel like being uh you know drippy and new agey and talking about how great love is then i want to be able to be like that and if i happen to be lucky enough to be funny then i want to be like that too but i know that i start getting into trouble the moment i start saying well here's what i am here's what i am i'm a comedian well i'm a podcaster well i'm a i'm a um uh whatever the fucking thing is man i'm spiritual or i'm not spiritual or whatever whenever you start doing that you're always like well i don't think i really am like that because all i'm really describing is the way i used to be yeah because all that i am right now is this very single moment it's a meat puppet show like even i know i am aware of me running around like well i'm a podcast producer i'm this this but underneath it all i have had the spiritual practice so like also like when i was younger like really messed up childhood but we got into psychedelics like uh lots of psychedelics when i was younger and i don't partake often anymore but like i like to think of myself as like a psychedelic thinker so i have this ground my because of like uh a bit of a spiritual practice and some psychedelic use and i feel like underneath it all is like a melted there is no ego and i use it like it pops up and it controls me right now and then but i do have that rock where it's like i can dissolve into that thing where oh it's it's it's nothing it's a it's a show i'm yeah i've been in i've been in like fights with girls where i'm just super dramatic or all of my fights with with friends or anything is all all ego driven stuff and i can be inside my own head and be like why am i acting like this why am i putting on this show like i could drop it right now walk away but is it pride or what and like i'm in my own head while i'm putting a while i'm like maybe decimating somebody with words or being so over the top and i'm in my own head going like i don't believe in this it's like you're it's like when you're in that situation you're like somebody some inventor who's spent a long time building this giant metal robot and he's riding around in its head and the thing is rampaging through the village kicking over all the houses and he's screaming out of like a little portal in its head this isn't me i don't want it to do this this is not what i'm like i don't want to hurt anybody but this that's the ego you've constructed this ego and then you ride around in it and and you and it just fucks everything up it's very similar to constructing a government and being a citizen and watching the thing constantly at war you're like i'm not like this at all i don't want to afghanistan total we are totally cool i have nothing against any of you i don't understand islam i don't understand anything about what you're doing and i certainly don't want to be blowing you up and that goes for anybody out there who's getting blown up by my country at this very moment i don't i i don't want to blow you up and it's it's just it seems to be the tendency of nature is weirdly that once you build it up to this certain powerful level or to this certain thing it it'll it just it seems to want to attach it ship fox my sweet little dog when i take him on walks we'll pass the nicest little chihuahua and he'll lunge at it like he just passed hitler it's he can't control himself it just seems to be built into the world to hiset things so anyway i don't know what that rambles all about but uh the point is that we have to separate ourselves as much as possible from being the doer because when you start thinking of yourself as the doer then you instantly limit yourself and when you really know what it is you're making then you really limit yourself too uh and and then you get stuck that's why you know sometimes that's why sometimes i to get back to podcasts when you hear a comedian who's come up with this very clever idea for their podcast like i'm only gonna i'm only gonna interview comics with brown eyes we're gonna call it brown eyed chat i don't know why i like the gimmicks of i like i like a good gimmick gimmicks either so much it's like a band like there's so many podcasts out there you do need a good gimmick i don't know i feel like you get trapped in the gimmick i would get bored it's fucking well no you abandon it's all comes back to the same thing which is just a honest sprawling conversation between two people that's either funny or interesting yes the gimmick is just like the gimmick is just what gets you in the foot in the door it's the vacuum salesman or it's like the it's it's it's the it's the fucking title card or the it's the gimmick is uh the reason you watch a tv show you know like and then within the tv show you might like get something out of it like uh i think the thing that i'm really proud of a feral and maybe this is because of my like you know uh emotionality or something but for some reason i'm really proud of and and it's all happened on its own volition like outside of my control or anything but the the podcasting you were doing like uh with you with your cancer and your mom and like brody stevens during uh his thing and like harman's cried on stage and and erin megathie's like bringing on her exes and and all this like really emotional stuff we've done like brody stevens tentatively titled us the emo comedy and i laughed at that because i think that if the feral audio brand when i really try to think about it is that we have a lot of emotional intelligence and for whatever reason it's kind of like a safe haven for not just really funny and interesting shit but really emotional human like because that's what life is man and it's like you know the the the idea that i you know whenever somebody starts doing their fucking shtick i just want to put a gun in my mouth like when you get around some a comic who like hops into this weird fucking puffy costume which represents their shtick and they start doing the thing it's like get the go fucking spin your cane on some other stage wacko nobody wants to fucking see that shit it's like what are you doing morning radio snap out of it if i'm go ahead and by the way i don't i got i got really bored with my podcast pitch for a while because i like got it down to a science and it all made sense but i was saying it to people and i was like this doesn't feel like a conversation i'm just and like i now i just whenever i'm talking about podcasts with people i'm just try to be way more direct but for a while i had a whole sales pitch and i'm like this sounds really sales mini and like i'm shticking it's an old school shticking sucks and the idea of comedians doing a shtick is like a very old school thing like i was on stage once at the laugh factory and i you know this is just after having gotten radiation and getting one of my balls snipped off you took me to the fucking surgery actually i like to talk about that too but um uh i remember getting off stage and the comic running the show comes up to me and is like why would you talk about that on stage why would you talk about cancer on stage and it was really weird and i'm looking at him and like you know i think at the time i was actually getting fucking radiation so i was already i was a little nauseated and i didn't know how to respond but ever since then i've been thinking about that moment and i've been i not ever since not every day i wake up i have the words to get pigs of it though but i i think like okay well i guess that's the old school reacting to the way things are going which is that uh they think the idea is people come to a comedy club because they want to be taken out of their sorrows and laugh and have a break from the horrors of the world it's like that is fucking retarded like that's why people want to consume art that's why people want comedy is because they want to be numbed out or taken i think the reason people like comedy or the reason people like honesty or people like emotionality or people like what seems to be the emerging style of many many podcasts is that it makes you realize that you're not the only one in the world crazy suffering hurting freaked out lonely lost weird but in fact everyone's experiencing this thing in our own different ways and that the great conspiracy is that the weird power of mass media has taught people that you're the ugly one not us you're the crazy one not us you're the one with problems not us look at us successful celebrities and great people and great newscasters we're all perfect symmetrical beautiful level beings who always stay the exact same way if you look at fucking bill o'reilly now compared to the way bill o'reilly was three years ago you get the same fucking bill o'reilly his personality hasn't shifted at all he didn't learn anything no new thing no moment where suddenly bill o'reilly is like you guys you know what i don't i don't feel quite so angry anymore i don't feel quite the way i used to feel yeah an anger will exhaust like you get exhausted being angry like i like i was i have anger problems but i was really angry when i was younger like that's just that's just exhausting to keep that up it's got a yes assuming yeah or yeah or it's like the the if just fucking once bill o'reilly would say on his show you guys i had a really bad fucking week man i feel kind of lonely yeah just once if just once he'd say man i feel a little i feel fucking lost i'm lonely or like i miss my mom just something like that would spread through the world uh such healing because all these hard cases who want to imitate bill o'reilly and pretend the way you're supposed to live is as though you're we're a walking human leather cod piece if if if if you know with this fucking tough exterior surrounding your true self they would realize like oh oh o'reilly gets lonely okay well i'm not i guess i'm not that crazy for the fact that i actually feel lonely and miss my mom or whatever the thing is yeah 100 i i like comedy maybe it takes a very dark person to do this but i like comedy it is the darkest thing in the planet but if i if there's like an ongoing thing like i like to like uh i like to make fun of my own darkness and my own in my own depression and it's right like because my i come from like a very serious like my my family is like very huge history of mental illness and so my way to cope with that is to and then to to have my own is to make fun of it so i like comedy because it's dark as fuck like it's it's and it's the only thing that alleviates the pressure from that like that's what it's that's what it like you laugh at dark shit because like it's such a scary crippling folds you inside like i feel it on my chest like sometimes like how heavy everything is like i really feel it in my chest and like i i laugh uh maybe that's like i i feel like i have boundless energy because i get to laugh so much all day but like when i it's just that expression is just like the only thing that relieves that tension for me so i and maybe it's like feeling like a giant hole and maybe this whole thing is just like i need to be around so much comedy to to feel okay but i i love that not comedy that isn't dark that plays it safe like a joke can be good without being dark don't get me wrong but club comics or whatever like comedy that's that's playing it safe is is i mean it's so recognizable and easily just like so dismissive yeah um and so the stuff that i'm attracted to is like really dark stuff like you are the most positive influential person ever like the day of your testicular cancer um surgery whereas like you know i've been around people in my family who are really anxious or whatever you've put so much you are the darkest person i know you've said things that are so dark that i you've said you said more positive things but you've you're dark person i know you explore your in your in like you don't beat yourself up about it you explore it or whatever and and you um work really hard to be happy like when you go to your house there's flowers it's clean you put the work in the practice you go okay okay i have things to do you know you exercise like you've put the work in to be happy and it takes like most human beings baseline um is is is negative and it's actually like most people are programmed to be negative because um we're hunter-gatherers and you have to look over your shoulder like you have to be like okay well a lion could pop out of there so we're programmed to be anxious and have negativity so to be happy is a lot of hard work and so the day of your testicular cancer surgery when you told me that you had cancer like i won't lie you're one of my best friends and it was devastating right thank you and and and uh i didn't know what it meant and it was really sudden you're like i got it in five days i got to go i'm like well whatever you need you know so i picked you up at four in the morning and this is probably the most formal conversation we've ever had yeah we just fuck around a lot and honestly the day of your testicular cancer surgery was one of the greatest days of my life wow and i'll tell you why what would have been like i was i was dreading it and i had anxiety and i was picking you up and i was like happy to help you the second i picked you up at four in the morning uh you were so funny and alert and like bright and you're like hey man it was just like any other time we were hanging out and because you put the work in and it was just like we were we never we didn't release it but we were recording stuff and like podcasting stuff on the way and then we had this weird moment where we got to this place like 430 and we're trying to find parking we couldn't get into this building yeah and we didn't know that it opened at five i remember that and so we go to this elevator and this elevator doesn't work yeah and so in the middle of this whole like you know literally like right before we got out of the car like we were shooting this shit and you're like yeah but seriously like here's my brother's number and my mom's number and in case something happens and i was just like when i just i remember breathing out like really hard all right and uh where like anybody else in my entire life would be a wreck quiet we were just it was one of the funniest car rides ever and then in the middle of all this really heavy real life shit we got lost in this parking garage yeah we couldn't get into the building in this pedestrian mundane uh thing where we were like asking the parking tenant like how do we get in there is like oh yeah but like it was like the most like real life interrupted this drama yeah right and it was we were laughing about it like isn't that funny like even if you die like it's just like that's just what it is exactly it just keeps going on never as bad and then so what's there to worry about well you know uh yeah exactly the worry is always a million times worse than the thing and i think i was probably in a good mood that day because i was getting a cancerous fucking ball cut out of my scrotum which is like a relief you don't want that in there but thanks man uh yeah i you know it's it's uh shit i am dark and i have ups and downs and that's why i have to be very careful because if i don't if i'm not careful like really careful like if i don't get shit done in the day and if i don't keep a schedule and if i let myself go like i go really far away and i can turn into such a monster so i i have to like like i don't when i was younger i would meditate because i i thought it helped me get girls and i would uh use it as a tail feather like you know and i think i i still probably use it in an egotistical way i talk about it or i'm still sometimes proud of myself or something but that's a very small part of it compared to what it used to be now the reason that i do it is like somebody rubbing cream into like venereal blisters you know what i mean like it's like if i don't do it then i my ego flares up and my life gets so disjointed and weird and i become so shut down and so shitty that like i have to do it in the way people have to take their aids medication or something you know what i mean like i i so that's when you say it's not i don't look at his work as much as it is like just just um recognizing that if i don't do that stuff then i end up feeling so angry all the time and so weird and sad and freaked out that it's not a i don't know it's it's a it's not like work as much i don't know i don't know what i'm saying so the so yeah i don't and it doesn't offend me that you say that i'm very dark because i am very dark and uh and i can get really dark you know that's probably one of the reasons we're such great friends man is because like we both have inside of us the suicidal part definitely and and and i that part when it emerges is like whenever that comes up that's when i know it's like oh okay you got to start fucking working out or even though you don't feel like you you got to start going to the gym again you have to clean you just need to clean your house now and put down every put down the video game and clean your fucking house because the demon is growing inside of you and if you do if you let it grow too much you'll start destroying relationships and then you'll stop you'll you'll stop doing anything more than just hurting yourself and people so it's a very dangerous thing to not to not grab control of yourself you know though to me i think the greatest example of this is i think i talked about this on another podcast sorry you guys the greatest example of this is uh there's a video on the internet of a guy working late at night at his office have you seen this the woman comes by the vacuum cleaner guy was working late at night he's working working working it's like a camera's on it's real it seems very real to me cameras on this guy maybe it's not but it sure as fuck seems like a death video and when it was on reddit and none of the comments were like this is fake they're all like yeah he probably died this guy's seeing her fucking working and this maid comes by the vacuum cleaner and he i guess the sound of the vacuum cleaner triggered him and he jumps down on his hands and knees and he has scissors and he cuts the vacuum cleaner cord and he gets electrocuted oh god yeah 100 yeah so there you see all the different times that guy let himself go out of control because you know that's not the first time he lost his temper all the other times that he lost his temper were warnings to him like you got to get you got to take control of this shit man because if you don't you know your life's gonna get really fucked up but he didn't listen to the warnings he just let himself go and well how did it what did it ended up late at night with him killing himself because his the demon took control so much yeah you know what i mean that's why it's fucking important as hell and i'm not saying you does and like you are you're you're you are someone who is very very hard on yourself unnecessarily and you said a few things in the beginning of the podcast that i meant to mention which is you were talking about like i'm not a good you're saying something you're diminishing yourself as an artist diminishing yourself as a musician and i hate hearing you do that because i've heard your music and it's great and you are you're you're as much of an artist as any of us are and for some reason you don't accept that because maybe you're still getting off on the idea of being of some weird hierarchy or something no i i i like reveling and all that like i think i my my my depression is very real like i am manic depressive so like i have so in mania states like it's better than any drug i've ever had like you don't need sleep you don't need to eat in but it doesn't last for long but i spend most of my time down and like uh for a while it was like well my mom's bipolar borderline personality disorder is this something that i've learned am i imitating it it wasn't until my mid 20s like no this is something that i may not have a severe case of but i do have i have a chemical like sure but i also like the one thing that i am proud of like what sucks is that i'm not the type of guy that walks in your room that lights up a room and so a lot of the times with my friendships like people kind of need breaks for me and so i'm not the type of person like you're gonna invite like oh let's have a really awesome party that's called dustin but i'm really proud that because i think i'm fluent in this stuff that like when you're really depressed when when you're really depressed or any one of my friends are like on the really i'm gonna pause you they can call me and we can talk that's damn right and you're a great person to talk to you're a wonderful person but i just want to put on pause what you just said yeah now if somebody came up to me and said hey man you know dustin he uh he's not the type of person who lights up a room and i gotta tell you if i was gonna have a really fun party i wouldn't invite him if somebody said that to me about you then i that would put me in a fucking position right if you're like fuck you yeah it's great what are you talking about yeah do you know what i'm saying yeah yeah so it's like but yet somehow you're allowed to talk about yourself that way and so and yours and i think if you really watch this this interesting like self refer dark reference that you give for yourself then you might find within that perhaps the roots of your depression are that there's somebody in your body who constantly diminishes another part of your body as our great lord jesus christ said a house divided i don't think he talked like this but a house divided among itself can not stand and you know it was if you got to be very careful yeah with especially with like uh broadcasting to you know affirm what you're doing is affirmation so when when you so the affirmation that you just did is i am not someone who lights up a room i am what does he said i'm not someone who lights up a room and my friends have to take breaks from me and these are all negative affirmations like if i went up to a four-year-old or a six-year-old say i went up to six-year-old hey kid i'm going to teach you i want you to say this every day i want you to look in the mirror and say i am not someone who lights up a room and i want you to say i am someone who my friends have to take breaks from and and and and then talk to me in seven years after you've done this every day because i want to ask how you feel right right he's probably going to be like i don't feel great so that's why you got to be very careful it's a very easy thing it's a very easy thing to start referring to yourself in shitty ways i have friends who see you like i'm you know constantly talking about how ugly they are how fat they are people who like all of them all of us have this strange mantra you know it's very dark mantra which is like i am this and the thing that it is is bad so you know man the the the i i there's a cheesy quote that inevitably floats up on twitter all the time which is that uh forgiveness is the realization that you can't change the past and so in that same way it's like you when you say i am this thing you really what you're saying is i was this thing i was this thing because what you are right now is this moment so by saying i am this thing what you're really doing is taking what you were and bringing it into the present which then pushes it into the future so the moment you stop doing that is the moment suddenly you are no longer a thing you just are and then from that place that's where you can become something maybe that isn't depressed that's all i'm saying is you know just run the laws of the of mysticism and the occult and and and well my biggest successes are spring from me unintentionally being in the moment and being the best person i can be and not and having no self-awareness but because my my root home is like literally it goes way deeper than that it's literally i look in the mirror almost every day of my life and say i hate myself like it's not healthy and that's probably a habit and routine like well just i have i have a lot of like i think my a lot of my perceived confidence like a lot of people like how the fuck can you walk up to dan harman and odin kirk and stuff and not and it's like i like i'm not afraid of people because like i used to be so nervous to talk to people but after a while it's like i really like it comes from a dark place but it could be spent as a positive but it's it's a it's that whole thing where it's like it doesn't it doesn't matter i don't think that highly of myself like i i don't care what they think of me like if they're gonna hate me they're gonna hate me but right yeah now you're doing the thing where look i'm not by the way i feel like i'm being preachy hey man no you should because this is what you do like we this is like you talk me off the ledge a thousand times but i think this is important because i it's it's uh you're doing magic you're announcing to the world all these things about yourself that yeah or just thought patterns you're giving voice to like thoughts that aren't really referencing what you really are and that's what so many people do so like okay if you're like imagine this just create this one little fun little rule for yourself which is whenever i say something just go into mindfulness so the next time you find yourself saying how you are and the thing that you're saying is bad just be mindful of it and just say oh there i am saying bad things about myself right so just start that and then you can even add to that if you wanted to uh when i say you decide here's an idea saying bad things about myself is as bad as shitting my pants so in other words like when you say you know it's as bad it's like you don't want to shit your pants yeah it's no fun when you shit your pants it leaves a mess you've got to wash your pants it's probably going to embarrass you in front of people and ultimately it's going to make you not smell that great uh in the same way when you say bad things about yourself what you're doing is you're polluting uh you're creating a form of pollution you're sort of like sullying yourself in a way that is completely unnecessary so the next time you find yourself wanting to say bad things about yourself you could think oh i've got to take a shit you know what i mean in the same way and it's like maybe instead of doing this in in to the world i'll i'll just be mindful and wait and then i won't i won't do it i'll just i'll watch the thought that desire to do that emerge and i won't say anything bad about myself just try that as fun as a fun exercise and see what starts happening to your mood state yeah you know i mean dude did you see that fucking video i'm sorry i'm talking way too much no no please and we have to wrap this up yeah but uh uh i just want to i'll put this video at duckatrosil.com forgive me for raining so much dustin no thank you i'm gonna have you back on again yeah i hope i hope that like serves a purpose for somebody because like i think a lot of people like kyle canane had this great quote he was saying during the show that i saw like he the reason he's so hard on himself because he has to be his own quality control yeah and i kind of related to that where like i think i'm constantly like well uh i i have done i've certainly done more good in my life than bad so like i should just be in the moment and like all that stuff should have a shelf life it's way expired well i gotta be hard on myself because i gotta do my own quality control i do understand that idea but it does seem to be a kind of industrial revolution ethic where you're running this factory where yourself is the child that's you know work that's doing just trying as hard as it can to do what it can do and then your super ego is the boss who's like you it's all ego yeah you shitty you shitty child you'll never you'll never make clocks at the rate that we need at stuffy bergen francis you know there's no i don't know man i think that a lot of the it's fun to experiment with just loving yourself and then seeing what starts that's where most of my successes come from is like loving myself and being in like loving the people around me and like letting people help me and and then well i love doing good shit i love you dustin and i'm very glad that you're in my life and i'm sorry you know saying speaking about saying bad things i'm sorry i'm a shitty friend sometimes man i get busy and distracted uh but you're great friend man you've done more for me than anybody man well you're a wonderful human and uh friends listening go to ferroaudio.com this is more than a podcast network it's a social experiment and it's something that you can watch in its still embryonic phases as it grows into whatever strange wonderful mystical being that it's going to grow into and um you too man you're gonna grow into a even more of a mystical being thanks for being on my podcast thanks for having me duncan harry christina that's dustin martian and what you're

You are listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast, and I'm recording this on Wednesday, July 13th, which is a very special holiday that many of you might not even be aware of. It's called Guru Purnima, and this is the day where people all over the world celebrate the guru. In the West, many people are guru illiterate. We have an idea of the guru that comes from a kind of amalgam of terrifying stories of cult leaders who called themselves gurus. It's an entire genre of documentaries where these mystical figures inevitably end up getting caught up in some kind of rotten scandal, and then everyone's embarrassed and it's a tremendous mess. I guess the classic example of this is the song Sexy Sadie by The Beatles on the white album that originally John Lennon wanted to title Maharishi, but they decided not to. It's considered one of the original diss tracks, and they wrote the song about a guru that they had been hanging out with that tried to hook up with Mia Farrow. So because of countless stories like that, a lot of people in the West, whenever they hear the term guru, they bristle because they associate that term with charlatans, grifters, scam artists, and nefarious narcissists. Whenever I say I have a guru, I kind of cringe inside because I know whoever I'm saying that to is probably going to think that I'm about to invite them to a sleepover where we drink coconut juice mixed with Xanax and weed killer and try to fly our souls into a spaceship that's orbiting planet Earth. But traditionally, there's lots of different types of gurus. There's not just the ultimate radiant, eternal portal through which all love shines into the Earth realm. There's also the teacher, like one who gives you basic instruction about some spiritual practice or the guide, like a guru who actually helps you with rather mundane aspects of your life. And then there's the sort of guru that you're going to meet today, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar. I don't know how I got lucky enough to have the conversation that you're about to listen to with this beautiful human. It's actually a little confusing to me and I need to look up who connected us so that I could thank them because this was one of my favorite conversations of my entire life. So my apologies if I seem like I'm stammering or sort of, I don't know, off a little bit. I was just dealing with this person's presence and how wonderful it was making me feel and how I kind of just didn't want to talk anymore. I just wanted to sit with him because he radiates this wonderful, sweet, joyful energy that I can still kind of feel it now in my podcast studio and in my heart. And I know that might sound cheesy to a lot of you. I can't help it. It's the truth. So regardless, I'm very excited for you to meet Sri Sri Guru Dev Ravi Shankar. He is a wonderful human and hopefully you'll get the chance to see him one day. We're going to jump right into this episode, but first this.

Welcome, welcome on you, that you are with us. Shake hands, no need to be blue, welcome to you. It's the dunkintrustle. Guru Dev, what a joy to have you on the DTFH. Thank you so much for being here. I only have a little bit of time with you. So I have a question I have been struggling with that I think you might be the perfect person to answer, which is the concept of world peace, which you promote with your life and everything you do, to many of us feels unreachable, impossible kind of dream. And to me, in particular, the connection between the technology and the computers, the phones, the cars and profound suffering in the production of those tools that people are using for world peace feels paradoxical, if you know what I mean, that we are using chips and phones built by people like in a form of human slavery in different parts of the world. And even though the technology itself is being used to promote world peace, how do we square the problem of its connection to deep human suffering? You see, technology has united the people across the globe. It has done so much good to our society that information is able to flow freely. Having said this, I will say overuse or misuse of any technology is not congenial for human evolution, human growth. So no doubt technology is needed and we can't go back. We are already in the technological era that there is no question of going back, but we can judiciously use it to benefit us rather than creating harm to our own nervous system. And technology is like a tool which should be used, you know, with care. Otherwise, you know, you end up losing your good sleep, you end up, you know, destroying your own sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system, which we have seen that's happening in kids when they are addicted to cell phones, you know, they can't walk even properly, they start wobbling. So we have to take good care of those misuse or overuse of technology, yes. Yes, thank you. But the technology itself, I was having a conversation with a friend regarding activism and this is something that I'm inspired by what you do. You're activism, you're the volunteerism you've inspired all around the world. But how are like the technology that we are using to do the good is connected to people in China and various places who are not being forced to do the work or not being paid enough to do the work. And I'm sorry if this seems like a dumb question, but it seems like behind everything, there is profound suffering, violence, oppression and that peace or world peace or even how can we even find inner peace knowing that the things around us that we are using have been manufactured in a way that is hurting the environment of the earth by people who are suffering. Do you understand my question? Duncan, yes, I understand. I mean, I get your question, you see. Suffering is insurmountable. Today in the world in various areas you see whether it's due to poverty, illiteracy, ill-educated people taking weapons in their hand and there is religious tensions in the globe. Yes. All sorts of problems are there. You see humanity swinging to two extremes. Post pandemic we see so much of depression and even World Health Organization has recognized in the biggest challenge the planet is facing today is of depression. That could be the biggest disease mankind is facing. Suicide of tendencies. Can you imagine 400 doctors commit suicide every year in US? There are doctors who are supposed to save others life. And so the depression is high on the one side. On the other side there is aggression and the drop of the hat people lose their temper. Yes. And they, you know, they're ready to kill each other. Yes. On the other day I heard in the traffic lights there was some argument between two taxi drivers and they got out of the car and they shot each other where passengers are sitting in both the cars. I mean, this is height of intolerance. Yes. And the root cause of all this is lack of education in peace. We have not learned about our own mind, our own consciousness, neither in school nor at home. They teach you how you can manage your mind. Yes. You know, how you can manage your emotions, how you can be patient, how you can be resilient, how you can have hope in your life in the darkest time. Yes. These are the things that we need to bring as education. See, with lack of education, diseases spread. If people don't know that they need to wear masks or they need to follow certain protocol, they start inflicting disease to others. In the same way, we need to learn how you can manage your negative emotions. Yes. This, you know, education is missing. And that is what we are trying to do from Art of Living Foundation, educate people about their own mind, about their own, you know, consciousness. Yes. How they can manage the inner peace, because inner peace is the key for outer peace. Yes. Thank you for that. This terrible polarization between aggression and depression is, it seems to be being amplified by technology, amplified by this incredible device that we are using to communicate. Based on what you have said, in a world where there is this polarization, this lack of education, this sort of spiritual illiteracy or whatever you want to call it, how to possibly even start the conversation? What is the best way to get any kind of information out there? You know, people like me, I think I like to fantasize that people who listen to my podcast, they meditate, or at least they're interested in some of these topics. But how do you get this information out past that group of people, to the people who are getting out of their taxis and shooting each other, to the people who are in shadowy rooms and can't even get out of bed? How do you even break through the, how do you break through the defense mechanisms that seem to be? You know, this exactly is where technology can be, the same technology which is disrupting social and, you know, the normal life in society can also be used to help people to get out of, say, someone is depressed in their own home. And there are a number of, you know, messages like what you are doing in the podcast, watching the podcast or learning to meditate online. These things will help them. You know, we are doing online courses ever since the pandemic began. Yes. Millions are doing it around the world. You know, about one million healthcare professionals have done the program online. I tell you. And then, you see, the letters they have sent me, the messages they have sent me is very touching. They said, this has pulled them through the most toughest time of their life. And I feel this is how we need to help people where the need is there so much. See, today because of the social media, people are able to know information which they would otherwise may not be knowing so well. So, there are the other side, the flip side of that also is there, that it can help many people to get over their depression. For example, healthcare professionals, you see, they are so busy, they can't go to any class anywhere. But if something is available online, they put their, you know, earphones and they sit and relax and take the 20 minutes to relax and meditate. And it definitely helps them. Yeah. Yes. Thank you. But gosh, why is it so hard to meditate? I meditate once a week. And sometimes I'll meditate. I'll meditate maybe two days in a row. That's pretty good. Three days in a row. Wow. Inevitably, though. Entropy kicks in. Something happens. And then I'm not meditating anymore. Why is it so easy? Why so easy to watch TV? Why so easy to play video games? Why so easy to drink vodka? Why is it so difficult to meditate? No, in fact, meditation takes away the other difficulties in life. It's not so difficult. See, if you meditate that little bit time, you give it to yourself. I usually call it mental hygiene, you know. In the morning, kids who rebelled to brush their teeth in the night, they would say, you know, I don't... But the mom pulls them and make them brush their teeth so that you can keep all your teeth. You see. Yes. And then once it gets ingrained in your routine, then you find it is so easy. It just fits very well with you. Because it adds time to you, it adds energy to your routine. And whenever you are a little tired, it just pumps you back with energy. I mean, the benefits are many. It keeps you healthy. Not only that, it boosts your immune system five times more. See, when you know the enormous benefits it brings to you, then you would not miss that, you see. You would like to do it. And for this reason, I have made a number of meditations and I put it out there in the YouTube and also in the apps. Several apps are carrying my meditations. So people can download it, can do it. All by yourself, you may find it difficult and that is where you have the guided meditations. Oh, I see. It makes it very easy for you to do it. I see, yes. Meditation is not an effortful process. It's just like taking a good nap, but a conscious rest. Yes, I've never heard that description of it and I love it. That's beautiful. If you don't mind, could you explain a little bit the sort of meditation that you teach and what lineage is it in? Where is this method coming from? Well, you know, if you observe a baby from the age of three months to three years, a baby is a yogi. It does all the yoga exercises. Yes. And the way a baby breathes is yogic breath. And the way baby sleeps, you know, baby sleeps like this. You will see world over. It's a sort of meditative state. So, yoga and meditation, though they have come from the Eastern tradition, but it is common to people all over the world. It is just a matter of you observing. I often say you observe a baby at home. You don't need a yoga teacher. You know, they live in the present moment. Yes. The baby is crying and the tears are still in its cheek, but it starts smiling. So, it lives so much in the present moment, not like an adult that you had an argument and you frowned for weeks, you see. Yes. It's not over. So, it gives you the ability to let go of the past and be in the present and move forward. So, these are the benefits that meditation brings. Though meditation is coming from the Eastern tradition, from the Hindu tradition, Buddhist and Jain religion. They've all been advocating also in the Far East, Taoism, Shintoism in everywhere. And I'm sure when we go to the deep roots in the Middle East, you will also find it in Christianity, Islam and Judaism too. Because meditation is not religion actually, but you can find that in every religion. There are roots, but unfortunately we have moved so far away from the spiritual part of any faith. We are so much caught up in the outer, the external rituals and we are caught up in theories and theology. We miss the basic essence that is love, compassion, peace of mind, you know, putting others before you, the service attitude. These are the values that have been forgotten. And I call these as spiritual value, that which upholds life, that which creates enthusiasm in you, that broadens your vision to embrace everybody, you know, bipartisan approach to life, to society. These are spiritual values and they are common to everyone. Another example I can give you is, it's like emptying a cup. You know, emptiness in any cup is the same. But if you want to fill it with the cup, okay, one cup could have soup, another could have ginger ale, another cup could have tea or coffee. You know, when you have to fill cup, you could fill with many different things. But when you empty the cup, the emptiness is same in all the cups. See, and meditation is getting to that inner emptiness which gives rise to fullness in life. Thank you, Babbel, for supporting this episode of the DTFH. Here's my fantasy. I want to take my wife to Paris. I've been wanting to take this trip for years but it got interrupted by a global pandemic and us having kids. But it's a fantasy. The fantasy is we go to Paris and she doesn't realize I've been using Babbel and that I am fluently speaking French. I don't think she's going to care. Honestly, the fantasy kind of ends with me ordering food for us having like a passionate conversation with a accordion player, one of those accordion players who's got a monkey.

Even in a very full cup or a very full person, is it a fundamental quality, this emptiness? Or is it something we cultivate or harvest or expand into? You know, it's so interesting. Our human mind is akin to an atomic structure. The central core is positive protons like positivity. The negativity is only in the circumference. So it's not the very core of any individual. Because every child who has come into this planet has come as an angel, has come with so much joy. No bad child was born, I tell you. If someone has cultivated all these bad habits, it's due to environment, lack of proper education, whatever reasons. But basically, human nature, which is good and benevolent, is always there. That's why I say that it's possible to get rid of, reform anybody. Thanks to the reformers in the world, capital punishment is almost gone. Almost in every country has banned, except few countries, they still are in the barbaric age. See, inside every culprit, there is a victim crying for help. If you heal the victim, the culprit will disappear. And that's what we need to do. And all these techniques, meditation and breathing exercise, the sky breathing techniques that we do. Some people say, oh, I have no time to meditate, I can't meditate. But nobody can say I have no time to breathe. No, I can't. Or you just do the breathing. I'm too busy to breathe. I've got to go to work at a long time. You can't be above the ground also. So it's very important to do that, you know, attend to our own breath that can remove a lot of stress and anguish from us. Yes, it's breathing. I forget to breathe. I mean, I don't obviously, I don't forget to breathe. But sometimes when I am meditating, watching my breath, I'll think, ah, your breath, it's so shallow. It's barely breath at all. And so are you saying that you have to retrain yourself to breathe? You have to, it's something that we have to work on consciously. And from that, a lot of the problems maybe we're connecting to other things in life might just go away. Meditation, it should be sandwiched between the breathing exercise before and after. When you do breathing exercise before meditation, it helps you to go deep in meditation. And when you come out of meditation, when you do some breathing exercise, it can clear a lot of toxins from the system and make you more dynamic and fresh and alive. But during meditation and breath goes all very shallow. That's a very good sign of meditation. That is okay. Oh, good. Good news. Guruji, would you mind for those listening, could you explain to us your breathing method or a simple breathing method that maybe people listening could do now? You know, this is 42 years since I've been talking about this, about breath and meditation. You know, around the world, 1981, I started and now with the 40. So there are a number of techniques that are there. But some of the breathing techniques like sky breathing techniques, Sudarshan Kriya Yoga, it needs an instructor. A couple of days to initially learn. And then you can just do it 10 minutes on your own. Sudarshan Kriya is very, very powerful and interesting in the sense that it instantaneously gives us the much needed relief that we are looking for in our life. And it just elevates our whole consciousness. It makes you happy. That's why we started calling it happiness program, you know, happiness course. Because it brings so much joy in people's life. See, there is a rhythm in the nature, right? Seasons flow in rhythms. There is summer and then there is fall and then winter and spring like that. In the same way, there is rhythm in our body too, you know. Biorhythm is there, you know. There is an archaic cycle that we go through. You sleep at particular time and you feel hungry at other time. So there is a rhythm in the body and there is a rhythm in the breath also, which rarely people have noticed. Your breath moves in certain rhythms and it is connected to our thought patterns and our emotions. There is a rhythm in our emotions too and there is an innate rhythm deep within you. Now what Sudarshan Kriya does is brings harmony between all those rhythms. So life no longer becomes a noise but a music. There is harmony. See, the difference between chaos and noise and music is a symphony is where all the rhythms are in alliance. In the same way, when our body, breath, mind, intellect, memory, all these faculties, inner faculties, they rhyme in rhythm. Then the impact of it is since a blissful experience, which people go for, you know, with hard drugs and they try to get some high through many other means. You don't need to do any of those. Attaining to your own breath and learning the breathing technique, meditating, can uplift your mood beyond your wildest imagination. Speaking of drugs, have you ever taken psychedelics or mushrooms or hard drugs? Have you ever experienced any of the substances that some of us are taking? Do you have any curiosity about it? You don't even wonder what that must be like? No, I haven't tasted because I saw the people who have been in it and they don't look very inspiring to me. They were not physically fit or mentally alert and, you know, the downside of that which they go through when they come out of the impact, that is good enough to put you off, you know, and the suffering it has caused to people, their families are something that, you know, I cannot even describe. And so I never even venture to even try it even once because I have seen so many young people's lives are destroyed, their careers are destroyed, their families are in pain and suffering. So that is why, you know, I say that, of course, now today in the West there are many other versions of it and there are opioids issue for pain killers that people take. And then you get addicted to it and then many are dying out of opioids. We have done some experiment here in the state of Ohio. That's true. For opioid addicts by giving the breathing technique and it had worked wonders for them. You know, they are able to get out of it. You are able to manage your pain without the pain killer when you attend to your breath and meditate. So I find when you have something so beautiful, which is, which makes you healthy, happy and uplift the spirit in you and everyone around you, I think everyone should go for it. Yes. Now, let me thank you for that. I'm sorry. I think my question. Somebody's speaking of it. Someone just overdosed nearby, I guess. Now, if I could be a little more specific, I mean, yes, I do agree with you, the opioids, those sorts of drugs. I guess I meant more sort of like soma that they talk about and the Vedas or the ayahuasca. So many people are drinking ayahuasca now and having these healing experiences. That's more what I meant. What are your thoughts on those? Not so much, you know, going out and getting blasted and waking up feeling like you just got run over by a truck. But people who are going through rich, you know, the ritualistic purification process or the psychedelic therapies that according to a lot of research seem to be quite beneficial to people. You know, if you ask me honestly, I would say there is so much more, so much so many dimensions are there within the consciousness. Exploring consciousness itself through your own nervous system, being in your own body is something that's stupendous. It's so it's a phenomenon to discover the self, the consciousness, what you are, who you are. And, you know, it creates so much thrill and newness every moment, you know, you go on this journey. Then, you know, nothing else charms you anymore, you know, you don't need an external substance to find what you are already inside. If you have already a password to it, key to it, then you don't depend on something external, right? Love it. Yes. Yes, beautiful. Thank you.

Now that we're talking a little bit about consciousness, are you familiar with, this is all over the news right now, a researcher from Google is claiming that an artificial intelligence has gained sentience, that a machine has woken up and is, you know, having conversations with him. It says that it meditates actually, and it's just very interesting. I'm wondering your thoughts on that. Do you think it is possible that artificial that one day maybe it's already happened that artificial intelligence or AI can become self aware? Artificial intelligence waking up, yeah, it could be a phenomenon, but I don't know whether it has a soul like you and me, you know, it can be very intelligent, you know, it can do many work like supercomputers and AI has its own, yeah, great dimension. But there is another dimension of bliss that's very much nature of your being, your consciousness. I'm not sure. I don't know whether that it has that blissful being within it. Yes, this is, it's one of the big questions of art. I think it will become one of the big questions of our time. It already is. But what is that the soul? What is the soul? Is it an energy? Is it a data packet? Is it something that is individual? First of all, you have to see that it is nothing, no thing. It's nothing, it's no thing. And then this no thing is full of energy. It's simply energy. You can call it energy, you can say bliss, you can say love, you can, I mean, it's hard to define, it's hard to encapsulate in vocabulary, you see. Yes, yes, but isn't it a joy to try to articulate it? It's so fun to try to understand it and maybe I'm foolish for the attempt, but I wonder, is there, clearly there is individual karma, clearly there is, and certainly in the Bhagavad Gita or in the much of the Eastern scripture refers to the individual soul, that each of us have this thing that reincarnates, that when the body stops working, it finds another way of expressing itself. So I, the no thing, something I love so much about teachers like you is it's very frustrating. People like me, we want answers. What is it? Where is it? How do I measure it? Can I see it? But if you had to describe it, what is it? That's something which can only be felt, which can only be understood by your heart, not through your intellect. If you try to understand the self through intellect, you'll be frustrated. But you can be it. When you let go, relax and just repose in yourself, then you discover, wow, wow, this is it. You know, you come up with a wow experience. And any wow experience, I tell you, you cannot articulate it. You cannot put them in words. Right, right. Now, if you could just, if you don't mind, what, what do you think for people listening? What do you think are the first steps when it comes to connecting to this and this thing that we can't articulate what I, and it kind of goes back to what I was saying earlier, which is, if you do find yourself in the sticky trap of depression or the binds of aggression, and you are hearing these kinds of conversations, but you think to yourself, there's no, I can't do it. I'm in a tarpid. I'm stuck. I'm glued by my karma to a variety of rotten habits, probably crawling with demons. What, what can a person like that do? What are the steps a person like that could take? You know what? Okay, I'm going to give one idea. Pretend as though you are dead. Gone. Just lie down and say, oh, you're dead. It's done. The curtain has fallen. Nothing more. Okay. You know, the awareness of death suddenly can bring in you more life. Make you aware that, see, everything is going to finish one day. However, you have lived your life, whether you are passed or you're failed, you're a, you know, you're rich or poor, you're going to die one day, right? Right. Happy or unhappy, you're going to die. Death is the permanent thing that's going to happen to everybody. And just realize this fact, this truth, you're going to die one day, but don't try to kill yourself. Pretend as though you're already dead. Then what happens then? Suddenly relaxation dawns within you and this mind which is galloping on some impossible desire or cravings or frustration or hatred you're holding on to will simply fall out. Your cravings and your aversions are the biggest impediment to know your blissful self. When these two extremities in the mind just drops, you find yourself in a better space than it instead of exhausting your energy, now you get in touch with the source of energy. You become more energetic, you know? So do nothing or just breathe, do some exercise as much as you can when you feel so tired, exhausted, you lie down, when you collapse on the floor, then you will see your body takes over. Your body takes over your mind and just relaxes you. At that moment also you'll find some peace dawning on you. And also at the peak of any emotions, for example anger, you should not be angry lukewarm, you should get angry as much as you can. Any emotion will ultimately lead you into a space where you start laughing yourself. You must have seen many of those who got so annoyed, so angry, they shout yell and the next moment they're out of it and you find them smiling, laughing. Yes, yes. What is that? That's incredible. Wow, yes, I know exactly what you mean. No, my wife and I were arguing a day ago and that happened where we're like angry, angry, but then somehow it pushed into just being funny and we were laughing. That's interesting. Wow, I never thought of the way out of that as amplifying it, but you're right because it becomes absurd. Any emotion when it is amplified to its maximum, flips over and gets you back to yourself. Wow. Those moments if you don't miss it, you'll find yourself in a sense of meditative, if you find a sense of meditation there. Wow. Yeah. That is fascinating. Wow. Yeah, that's so interesting. It's like adding wood to the fire. It's making the thing blaze. That's so interesting. I'm going to do that the next time, but I don't want to do it in front of anybody. It's embarrassing. May I ask? Make sure you don't have glasses and other things around you. May I ask why? You know, when I was a four year old, I don't know what I was doing, but I know I was not reciting the Bhagavad Gita as you were when you were four. Why? How is it that you at four have this incarnation where this is coming out of you? What is, do you, what's the explanation for this versus those of us who we weren't, I don't think I was reciting anything at four. I don't know what I was doing. No, well, you know, this is not the first time around that we are here. We have been here many times and many children have the memory of those previous lives. So it's very common thing you go on YouTube on past life reincarnation experience. You can tons of people. I mean, dozens of people talk about that. And so, well, I haven't forgotten. I kept all those memories. Yeah, so just happen. Forgive me if it's an inappropriate question. How far back do your past life memories go? That I'll keep it to myself for some time now. I've been here many times. Why do we forget? It's good. It's good. We forget and we move on. Because the problems of this life are enough. We don't need to be caught up in whatever was going on in the past. Correct. Correct. Correct. And from your perspective, from where you are, how do you see time? How do you see time? In other words, my experience of time is linear. The past is something, you know, in the background, there might be some future coming. But if I could remember my past lives, if I could, if I had a connection to the vastness of time, I feel like it might change the way I think of time itself. I'm curious. Do you feel like your perception of time is different from other people's after a lifetime, many lifetimes of having this practice? You know, I never compare myself with anybody who says I don't see that because I see everyone is so unique on this planet. Everyone has come with a mission. Everyone has their own role to play and no role is good or bad, but people have their roles to play and that's it. So I never compare myself or I don't say, you know, this is better or that's not better. Life is what it is. You know, we just take it as it is and rejoice and do whatever good you can as long as you are here. As far as time is concerned, usually people think the past was all free will and they keep regretting, oh I should have done this, I should have done that, I could have done this better. So this sort of regret about the past is because you think you had a choice then. Oh wow! And then when it comes to future, many times people think, oh it's all destiny, what has to happen will happen. Anyway, nothing is in my hand. That sort of future we take it as destiny. Past we take it as free will and this is the perfect formula to be miserable in the present. It's true! You just described how I wake up in the morning. Why did I do that? I shouldn't have done that. Oh wow, these decisions are made. But what about right now? Is this free will now? Is this autonomy now? The better way to see it as, you see the whole past as destiny, it has to happen, it was in a grand design. With every mistake you have done, you have learned something, you have grown, you have become more mature. So see the past as destiny and see the future as free will, then you have enthusiasm in the present moment. Wow! You have no disappointment, you have no regret. When you have no regret, you are not accumulating toxins in your system. And you feel happy, you feel grateful, you have many things to be grateful. And when you are grateful and you live in the present moment, then you have all possibilities for the future. I think this is the most wise way to look at life. Just a little flip of our idea of time. Yes, that is so cool. Thank you for that. Thank you, thank you. We have a little bit more time. And again, any of these questions, I'm sorry in advance, free will or not. If any of them seem odd, but what are your thoughts on Jesus? What are your thoughts on the Christ consciousness? Yes, Jesus is an embodiment of love. He spoke about the inner love and of course it is a valuable contribution to human existence. Jesus' contribution of message of love and peace and service is a great, very great impact on the human society. Yes. And see, in India we have so many saints and we consider Jesus also as one of the saints. And there will be no time and again there has been different saints have come on the planet, different we call the avatars, the incarnation of pure love and wisdom and knowledge has come. And in the same way, many of the things that Jesus said, I find Lord Krishna has said the same. Yes. You know, if you read Bhagavad Gita, the same thing Krishna has said that, you know, come unto me and I will relieve you of all your sins and I'll free you. All these things, you know what Jesus has said, many of those words are strikingly similar to what Lord Krishna has said. And if you read Yoga Vasishtha, this is a very beautiful treatise on consciousness. One of the Rishis Vasishtha given this wisdom. I mean, New York University has published this book also in English version. Talks about the consciousness, how there is one consciousness, which time and again assumes different roles and different names and forms. So when you go beyond name and form, you see that one blissful non-dual consciousness which is enveloping the entire globe from time immemorial. I feel that when I'm talking to you, but when the computer goes off, I don't know if I'll keep feeling it, but I like the idea. Do you, may I ask, do you in not just in Christianity, in Eastern traditions, in Buddhism and at least the wisdom traditions I'm aware of, they say coming is another avatar. There's different names, matreya, the second coming of Christ, a being that's to come here and reharmonize and rebalance things. Do you imagine that that being is around the corner? Do you feel that? You know, we must know that the divine is already present in everyone in every heart. That's what Jesus said, the kingdom of heaven is within you, right? Unless you become like a child, you can't enter the kingdom of God. See, all that is needed for us to become innocent and go within. Instead of going within, we keep looking outside. The scenery is not what will give you what you are looking for. You know, if the seer, that getting back to the seer is the door for higher states of consciousness or the basic truth about consciousness. So this is where there is a little difference between religion and spirituality. See, religion talks about the morality, about how you should lead life and what you should do and all that. Spirituality enhances the core values of life, like peace, compassion, love, service. It gets in touch with you, you see, much deeper. You know, see, there was only one Jesus, right? But you know how many sects of Christianity are there, 72? There is only one Lord Buddha. There are 36 forms of Buddhism. Yes. There is only one Prophet Muhammad. 135 sects of Islam is there. And similar in Hinduism, you can't even count. So many schools of thought. Usually people feel that these diversity should not be there. Everything should be only one. Everybody should follow only one school or one ideology. This is where the problem is in the world. Religion which is supposed to bring peace to people has become a point of contention and division because of our own wrong understanding. We want to say only my book is correct, only my way is right, every other way is not the right way. This type of fanaticism has grown. What we need to see is this diversity we must embrace. See, the divinity or the God has not given you just one type of vegetable. He didn't make only potatoes and eat this all your life. He makes so many, ono, flora, so many types of people and species on this planet indicate God loves diversity. So we must embrace the diversity in wisdom too. Laosu has something great to say, Upanishads have something great to say. Shintoism has something to offer to the humanity. Christianity has some valuable contribution. So every school of thought has added to the richness of the global wisdom. We must embrace the diversity and go deep in your own roots. Honour everyone and follow your roots. This is what I would recommend for people. Instead of saying only my way is the highway, everything else is nonsense. That type of narrow mindset has to be done with. I think this is the time. It's the time for people to wake up to that reality, embrace the good things from over there and find the inner peace. See, if a person has found inner peace and stability, he can influence his surroundings. He can calm people down. He can create more love and compassion in everyone around him or her. This is possible. And I've seen this happening around the world over and over again. See, when we have done these programmes in the prisons, in the correctional homes, around the world, nearly 800,000 people. 800,000 people when they went through the breathing and meditation. Complete transformation in their life. This is possible. That's why I'm saying, see the world from a different outlook than the stereotype that we have been used to for years. Thank you so much. Thank you, thank you, thank you. It has been such a good fortune that I got to spend this amount of time with you. I'm very grateful to you for your time. Thank you. This conversation meant a lot to me. And Hare Krishna, thank you, thank you. Namaste, namaste. All the best to you and continue to inspire everyone around. Thank you.

If you've ever had the experience of watching somebody that you love pass away or if you've had the experience of watching a baby come into the world, then you have probably for a moment been in the presence of something that doesn't seem like it could necessarily be defined by the language that is available to us as a species. You get this sense of like, holy shit, this is so incredibly big and so incredibly real that it is as one of its qualities in the way a fish is wet, it's revolutionary. And within that experience, it happens on psychedelics, of course, it can happen with DMT or mushrooms. It happens during peak experiences and lots can happen after that experience. Some people go absolutely nuts. I mean, I'm not saying nuts in a way to stigmatize it. It's kind of awesome if you go a little nuts because you rub shoulders with the divine, that's okay. That's a cool kind of crazy but it isn't necessarily going to sort of bring that experience into this realm. And I think this is what's wonderful about language is that if you are lucky enough or blessed enough or diligent enough or capable enough, you can actually sort of take the transcendent realm and put it into the confines of human language and people who read or hear you talk about the thing can actually get a taste of that thing that you experienced. I've had this happen, man, contact highs just from listening to Terrence McKenna lectures. I don't know if that's ever happened to you but if you spend enough time listening to Terrence McKenna, whether you're high or whether you're not high, you can really start feeling something that seems to be very similar to a psychedelic experience. I don't know what that is but Terrence McKenna was interested in maybe being able to go into the DMT realm and bring an object back. I mean, he didn't bring some shiny, jeweled and possibly complex dimethyltryptamine dimension bobble back into the world but he sure as hell brought back an incredible body of work that has as a byproduct of reading it, a feeling of being high as a fucking kite. And not only that, but a sense of holy shit, maybe I'm not quite as insane as I thought I was. And somehow just by being able to become the linguistic outflow valve for the transcendent, you allow the transcendent to begin to inhabit the world. You essentially become a runway for a linguistic UFO and through your mouth or through your writing or through your art or through your work, something comes into the world that creates a kind of ripple or an echo or kind of a shift that has the opposite of creating war or catastrophe but has the effect of creating peace. I mean, in the super broad scale, this is every prophet that ever lived, but in a very small way, this is every great musician or artist or poet or writer, but it doesn't have to be a great poet or artist or writer. I mean, that's the problem. That's where my brain goes. What I learned from this conversation with Charles Eisenstein is that how easy it is to forget all the people who are out there writing poetry through action and doing incredible things with no reason behind it other than having this sense that the best way to express themselves in the world is not through accruing bullshit and getting stuff but through giving. And I think that Charles Eisenstein has really come up with a pretty simple yet incredibly profound way of talking about how this is maybe what life is all about. One last commercial and then the podcast. And I recognize the irony of breaking up this rant with a boner pill commercial. According to a study I just did, over 90% of my male friends are unable to achieve an erection if they know that I am in the room. Much thanks to Blue Chew for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH. BlueChew.com, that's blue, like the color blue. Blue Chew brings you the first chewable with the same FDA approved active ingredients as Viagra and Cialis, so you know they work. You can take them anytime, day or night, even on a full stomach. Blue Chew works twice as fast as a pill so you can be ready whenever an opportunity arises. And I know what you're thinking, when am I gonna have an emergency need for an erection? You can't imagine how many men find themselves in the presence of an angel or a succubus ready to hump and because of the radiant glory or the sulfuric demonic power emanating from their velvet breasts, the men are not able to get it up and how disappointing, not just for the men but for the angels who wanted to be impregnated by a human man and spawn either the Christ, an antichrist or just a very powerful baby. Also, this isn't just for guys like me who haven't been able to get an erection ever since the last episode of Game of Thrones. This is for any guy who wants extra function to enhance their performance in the bedroom.

This is Ram Dass, hanging out in Neem Karoli Baba and coming back here and being able to talk about it in a way that we could understand, knowing how to express the realizations he had in a non-threatening, non-alienating, non-elitist way. And anytime anybody takes up that incredibly important work, it's a really good thing for the world. And I think Charles Eisenstein is doing that very thing. If you like what you hear today, check him out at CharlesEisenstein.org. And if you're confused by what you hear today, I don't know, reach out to me and give me some questions because this is only part one of this conversation with Charles Eisenstein. This is the first time we had met and I feel like I just scratched the surface but I'm definitely ready for round two. So without further ado, everyone please open your heart chakras and explode transcendent love all over the etheric form that is Charles Eisenstein's eternal soul. Here he is everybody, Charles Eisenstein. All right. Welcome home to you. And you are with us. Shake and glory to be moved. Welcome to you. It's Duncan Chasen. Charles, welcome to the DTFH. Thank you so much for coming on the show. Hey, thank you, Duncan, happy to be here. I've been looking forward to this conversation. And almost like, I guess, coincidentally, I just stumbled upon some interesting stuff relating to quantum computing. And the video I was watching, I thought it must be from a UFO convention or something at first, because what the guy was saying was so wild, which is these quantum computers are dealing with multiple realities. And somehow they're using the overlap between two multiple realities to solve problems. And this, of course, if you get into quantum computing, then you start getting into quantum super positioning. This strange idea that things are simultaneously in two separate states at once. And to me, you seem like someone who is plugging into the other universe that we're not quite in yet, but could be in the universe that tortures people like me, because you've since, like, yeah, this is a possibility. And I wonder if you could start off by describing the differences between the potential world that you write about and talk about and the world that we keep hearing over and over again whenever we turn on the news. Yeah, that's an interesting way to frame it there, Duncan. I do often have the feeling that I'm describing something that is real, but that doesn't exist yet, which is kind of a paradox, because in the mythology that we live in, real and exists are the same thing. In the world that we're used to, truth is the same as facts, what's actually there. And so when I'm describing the world that could be, even though it doesn't exist yet, or even if maybe some part of myself, even not to mention other people, thinks that it's impossible and some idealistic pipe dream, I never have the feeling that I'm making it up. I have a feeling that I'm describing something that already exists. And it's almost like trying to, it's almost like there's like multiple realities that just like in quantum mechanics that exist in a superposition of states, and whichever one comes into manifestation is the one that we communicate with or that we align with. So yeah, one more thing I can say about that. I think the reason that my words evoke something in people, it's because I'm not the only one who has seen it also. Like everybody who I've ever met has at least one experience in their life that feels like the incursion of some other reality into this one. And I don't necessarily mean it's like something supernatural or anything like that, but it's an experience that's like maybe could be a forgiveness or generosity or healing or something like that, cooperation, community. And there's the feeling that the world could be built on this. This is real. I'm seeing something that wants to happen on Earth. And yeah, I guess where I am, kind of like you were saying, I'm coming from that world and trying to describe it. What are the qualities of that world versus this world? For example, the gifting economy, ideas of pure sharing, this sense of not just rehumanizing each other and recognizing that everybody wants to be happy, but in a weird way, rehumanizing the Earth itself. This is what I've gathered from your writing. Yeah. Yeah, so the basic quality is that we are rehumanizing and re-sacralizing each other in the world. A lot of the problems in the world today are based on dehumanization. For example, racism is a fundamental kind of making somebody else less than what I am, lesser being. But more subtly, any kind of judgment also makes somebody into less than fully human. Because you're saying, yeah, if I were you, Duncan, man, I wouldn't be doing that. I'd have a much more tidy beard if I were you. You'd be right. You know, like this idea that I'm fundamentally separate from you. If I were in the totality of your circumstances, I wouldn't be a racist. I wouldn't be a greedy corporate executive. I wouldn't be X, Y, or Z. That is almost universal kind of dehumanization. And then, of course, seeing nature as just a bunch of stuff, something to be insulated from or to be dominated or harnessed or exploited, that's also a reduction of the sacred into something that is valuable only for its use to myself or to us. So to rehumanize and resacralize is a profoundly different way of seeing the world. And it's not just a philosophy, but it also leads to different kinds of relationships to people, to land, to place, to community. And I mean, I guess that's still a bit abstract. I don't think it's that abstract. I think it's the language. I was delighted when I took this plunge into studying superposition only because the descriptions of this aspect of the universe are so weird that it made me feel less crazy in the sense that when you say things like this, it makes me think, oh, this is a form of traveling. This is a form of moving through states of possibility. And the moment that I am looking at a tree with my baby and I'm telling the baby, that tree is alive. That tree loves you and has a spirit in it and loves you. It's like I pop into a different dimension temporarily that is different from the one that I have been taught to be in. I can't maintain that state, though. Another thing that has happened since I've had a baby is I've really lost my ability to be as much of a dick as I was convenient. Because any time I find myself judging anyone, which is lots of fun, the idea keeps popping in my head. That person had a mom, has a mom who held them and loved them. And you're looking at them like they're furniture walking down the street or something. And then it destroys the ability to create that space. And man, if you need that space, you need that barrier if you don't want your heart to hurt. It's quite intense to accept the concept that, yeah, all this stuff around you is as alive as you are. All this stuff around you is as deserving of joy and safety and comfort and love as you are. Wow, man, that hurts. That hurts. Do you think maybe that's the reason people are resistant to the sort of relationship with the universe that you are so good at articulating? Yeah, maybe because, like you're saying, when we open up to that, the level of suffering out there becomes intolerable. Also, it makes life in the matrix less tolerable, too. Because the whole system that we live in only makes sense in separation. So when we understand, like, really feel the cost that's being extracted from other beings, like, we don't want to participate in that. And that's pretty inconvenient. I think that what you're talking about with your baby and stuff, in a way, and saying, yeah, the tree is alive and stuff, and you're talking about how hard it is to hold that belief sincerely, in a way, the baby probably knows that more than you do. Yes. Because this is an inborn knowledge, like, to be born into an enchanted world full of beings. You don't have to ask the child to imagine too much to say, yeah, the sun is looking at us. That's a native intuition that gets crushed out of us. And I really think that I write about environmentalism, economy, like all kinds of stuff like that. And I always have the conviction that this is not, the solution is not going to be to switch to some more sustainable fuel source or to come up with some nerdy tweak to the money system. And these kind of technical level solutions, they're not irrelevant. But unless the revolution goes down to this level of seeing the world as alive and sacred, then nothing's going to work. The revolution we're being invited into by the multiple crises of our time goes all the way down to that level that you might call spiritual or whatever. But everything is going to change down to the depths or nothing really is going to change. Well, I mean, based on the every single bit of data that is being shown to us right now, something is going to change. I don't think the change is going to be as pleasant. Or as it seems like there's a catastrophic, it seems like it's a difference between fusion and vision. Or society is at the brink of either just being completely fragmented in a kind of apocalyptic, catastrophic way or fusing together, which is where we're already at. I mean, this is why I thought it was so cool. I was reading this stuff about superposition. And maybe in my lack of understanding about it, I'm turning it into something it's not. But this idea of like simultaneously being two things at once, the apocalypse and rebirth, the Garden of Eden and hell, all of these things happening sort of simultaneously. And what you're saying is something that I have thought, which is if there were to be a revolution, a real revolution, one that was completely unstoppable, it would happen inside of every single individual's heart. And it would be a shift in perception that would be impossible for any kind of power, principality to reverse. For example, if suddenly everyone started seeing a mountain that for whatever reason was invisible to us, it doesn't matter if there were people saying, no, that mountain's not there. You're wrong. No, it's clearly there. We can see it clearly. And even though there might be people who have made a great deal of profit from ignorance, if the ignorance fades away, they have no method for extracting energy in the way that they currently are. Because this is the, how are you going to create a good, strong, functioning economy based on getting people to work for you and you pay them less? And then the CEOs get 1,000 times more. And then there's certain people get 1,000 times more. And in it, you kind of justify the starvation based on a sense of like, well, they probably brought it on themselves. How are you going to do that if the person is your hand? No one has ever looked at their hand when it's bleeding, because they cut it and been like, well, it's my hands problem. I'm right. I guess it sucks. It's stupid. Cut itself on a knife, dumb hand. Not my problem. Now I'm up here in my head. I don't have to worry about that. That's how close we are, I think, to paradise. It's just that shift. And the moment that happens, I suppose, in some ways, it is an apocalypse. That is an apocalypse in its own right, isn't it? Yeah, I love that analogy and how it illustrates the changes that come to us when we start seeing others as not really separate. But as understanding, yeah, the rainforest, if that gets cut down, that hurts me, too. If there are people being locked up in prison or being bombed and droned and walled off, et cetera, that's hurting me, too. But it's more than that. It's not just some self-interested rational calculation that, oh, I guess we'd better save the whales because if we don't, bad things will happen to us. It's just like, I have children, too. And I'm not saying, well, I better feed and protect and take good care of my son, otherwise, bad things will happen to me. That's, and I'm sure you're the same. It's that your being has expanded to include your son, is it, or daughter? A son. Yeah, so your being includes your son now. If he's happy, you're happy. That's right. If he's unhappy, there's a part of you that cannot be completely happy. You're not just you, the separate individual anymore. And I think that this something analogous is going on with us with our relationship to the rest of life. I'm not even sure if I'd like to use the term environment, which makes it into this kind of passive thing that environs us. But it's like the rest of life and the rest of this planet and this cosmos even, when we fall in love with these other beings and this vast being we call Earth, then the question no longer is, are we gonna survive or not if we continue the fossil fuel economy or whatever we're talking about? That's not the right question. The question is, are we contributing to the flourishing of life? What part are we playing? What do we want to be? What world do we want to live in? How do we take care of the world that we love? So it's a revolution of love, not of more enlightened self-interest. Ah, cool, that's cool. It's hard though. I mean, this is hard. Our language is so, it's based on self-interest. So much of our very language is based on an economy that's an economy of self-interest. And this brings me to something I wanted to talk with you about, which is debt forgiveness. And you know, on the, it's an idea that's floating around right now along with universal basic income. This concept of like, look, what if we just let go of debt? What if we just forget it? It's gone, no more debt. Everyone's out of debt now. And people, if you think stuff is owed to you, well, you're out of debt, but you're not gonna get what you thought was owed to you. It's sort of complete reset. And I wonder if you could talk about that a little bit. Yeah, I'd love to. It's like, don't get me started, but you got me started. So let's say a few things about it. So that idea that we could just cancel all debts, that is a really good starting point because it makes debt into something that we understand to be a human creation, a story. It's, it doesn't exist in physical reality. It only has the power that we give it to. And we could rewrite that story. It's not like this, whatever the $20 trillion debt as if it's this unalterable thing. But once we go there, then the question becomes, okay, how do we want to rewrite that story? And it may not be like a blanket cancellation of all debt because your grandma's savings account is a debt that is owed to her by the bank. Right. Are you gonna cancel all pension funds? Are you gonna cancel everybody's savings? Oh, wait, I'm sorry, I'm confused. I thought you meant that I get to cancel all the debts I owe to people, but they still owe me. This sounds like a terrible idea. I'm sorry, go ahead. Yeah, so obviously we have a situation where debt is a tremendous burden on people and on society. It is driving entire nations to liquidate their natural resources. It makes people kill themselves. People hang themselves and shoot themselves and jump out of windows because of this constructed story that they owe someone so much money. Right. And so the question comes up, are these debts legitimate? Because there's some kind of moral calculus that says, well, we have a moral obligation to repay our debts. Yes. And that makes sense unless people are put in a situation where they have no choice but to go into debt and they're in conditions where debt is inevitable and they never get out of it. Then maybe those debts aren't legitimate and this is arguably true on an international level where countries are forced to go into debt and if they refuse, then they get regime changed and CIA-ed and invaded. They get help. No, no, no, they get food trucks filled with soldiers. It's so fucked up. Yeah, okay, so it's right. That's like a whole other topic we could go into. Well, let's keep. The construction of narratives, but so yeah. So basically what I wrote about, I wrote a book called Sacred Economics that is basically saying what would the story that we call money look like embedded in a new story, a new mythology of interbeing, interconnection, interdependence, gift, reciprocity, mutual care and so on. And one of the things that I came to was, there are two basic things. One is changing the way that money is created. Today it's created as debt. So it's inevitable that there's always gonna be more debt than money and we're always gonna be in competition with each other for never enough. It's like a design feature of the system. So I explored reversing that, having money that bears negative interest that if you hold onto it, it gets less and less and less valuable. Cool, that's cool, man. Yeah. And the other thing was as what you mentioned, it's universal basic income, which only makes sense with a very different view of human nature. Because if you believe that everyone out there is seeking to maximize their self-interest and you're giving them enough money to live on, then you're like, well, why would they ever work? If you don't make them work, if you don't make them contribute to society, then they're not gonna do it. They're just gonna sit around and play a world of Warcraft all day. They're not gonna give, they're not gonna create, they're not gonna heal, they're not gonna take care of other people. And that, I mean, that view of human nature, like, are we going to just assume that that's the way people are? That's not what I see in human nature. I see people who are burning to give something to the world, who want to start permaculture farms and work with homeless people and do all kinds of things and create art and create music. And the only reason they're not doing this work, some of which is the most important work to be done right now, is because they do not have the money to do it. So the story of money that holds certain things valuable isn't encouraging what the planet needs the most right now. This story that you're telling, and I'm sorry to cut you off, this story you're telling, it is the boundary, isn't it? It's like the wall between us and the Garden of Eden is made of this story. Every brick in that wall is made up of this very sad story, which is that humans are self-interested. Humans, if they need that universal basic income, they're probably lazy. They shouldn't care about that $1,000. They should have already been working, figuring it out. You're just giving them handouts. It's gonna poison them. It's the last thing you should do to someone, the best thing for a person is to face the cruel, hard world and become someone strong like I did because I was down in that dirt. I was fucking roaches were crawling. I have a story that's really good based on me pulling myself out of the dirt and it's bullshit, but if I'm drunk enough or if I'm feeling really sanctimonious, then I can plug into that story and produce a situation where I don't have to feel bad for people who aren't doing okay right now because I can think, well, I did it. If I could do it, anybody can. And this is the shittiest feeling. So please continue. Sorry, I love what you're saying. I love what you're saying. I'm imagining you in the dirt, in the roaches and stuff. And the moment before that change happened, you were probably feeling completely despairing and completely helpless. And I'm curious, what changed? Was it something that you did or was it something that happened to you? Oh, yeah, it was a series, it was good luck. It was privilege, it was a lot of various things intersected, love of the universe, good friends. And these things led to some form of success, but the reality of it is that when I was, there and when I'm here, there wasn't much of an internal, I still feel kind of the same. It's like the balm of success, it really, I don't know. It didn't do much. But to get into this idea of sharing, I'm assuming you go to Burning Man. I was there once. And they have this gifting economy. And you can only buy ice and coffee there. I see you kind of rolling your eyes a little bit. You think it's like, it doesn't fit in with your idea of it. I'm not rolling my eyes. I appreciate the beauty of Burning Man and the ideal towards which it strives and the compromises and imperfections of it. Oh yeah, imperfections galore. And I, listen, by the way, I hope that I didn't make you feel bad for rolling your eyes. It's almost done. No, I don't mind. Okay, cool. Well, good. The, but okay, so let's just imagine instead of, that it's some like utopia. Let's imagine it's a Renaissance fair where you get to pretend you're in a utopia. And, but still within it, there's this chance to give something to someone with no expectation of return. And people are giving you stuff with no expectation of return. And right away it produces this very interesting mirror which is shame. If someone, if people give me stuff, I feel this sense of, oh, thank you. I mean, you shouldn't have. I just don't, I, and it's, and when, and when there, when you give people stuff and they overreact or you can see this lifetime of conditioning based on this sense, if you give me something, I'm now in your debt. I owe you something back in some way or another, or if I give you something, you owe me something back. And it completely reduces, if not annihilates this basic joyful feeling when that kind of transfer happens with truly no expectation of return. It's the craziest feeling ever. It's better than any feeling. It's, and what's really sad about it is that it seems like the way things are supposed to be. It reminds me of when you see those depressing videos of when it snows in the polar bear part, in the zoo. And the polar bear comes out and it gets to be in snow. He gets to be in snow that he was supposed to be in. And he, and suddenly you see him joy, delight, rolling around in this stuff. He's experiencing what he was born for, snow. No big deal for a regular polar bear, but a polar bear in a zoo, it's gonna be one of the best days of his life. Similarly, when you put a person in a situation where they could just give with no expectation of getting anything back, that person almost instantly, at least this person, feels like this is what I was supposed to do all my life. This is what we were born for, to give to each other, to just give, to just outflow and not inflow. And that is why I love Burning Man. Even if all the other stuff's surrounding it, it's one of the only things that's ever really given me that experience outside of having a child. Yeah, no, I think Burning Man really can be really powerful in introducing that new data point that doesn't fit the story that we've grown up in and the world that we are immersed in usually. I feel it too, like when I'm in that kind of situation of just universal generosity, I have a feeling of safety, of liberty, that it's okay to give, it's okay not to guard, it's okay not to hoard, it's okay not to control, because nobody else is either, and I'll be okay. If I give away everything, I'll be fine because everybody's gonna be doing the same thing and giving to me too, and if I'm in need, somebody will pick up on that and they will meet my need. So this is the thing, the system of scarcity that we have in the world, it creates the conditions that generate the story of scarcity, and then the story of scarcity turns around and creates the system. So the system and the story go together, if you're in this society, like you better be on guard, because people are trying to take advantage of you all the time. Every time you log on to the internet. So you have to be on guard. That's right. That's crazy. The internet is like, it's milking us. It's like, it's a milking machine for human energy and human activity, and but I have been experimenting a little bit with interpersonal debt forgiveness or the concept of like the variety of currencies that exist in the world that aren't just money or cryptocurrency, what do you think are the other currencies out there besides money and cryptocurrency, besides the general ways that we tabulate debt? Are you talking about like social currencies, gravitational guarantees, that kind of stuff? Yes. I'm a little wary of attempts to make those things into currency or into something like money in the sense of something that can be counted and quantified and exchanged because the reduction of relationship and nature and the experience of life into numbers, I think is part of the problem. No, this is an excerpt. This to me is one of the ways to, for people who maybe seem a little confused or supremely skeptical or even offended by the notion of universal basic income or debt forgiveness who think this is an unnatural state. It doesn't work like that. One of the tricks is okay, but I want you to start keeping track of the currency of love in your family. And I want you to start writing down every time you give the baby food. And I want you to start writing down every time you call someone in your family back and listen to them talk about Trump for 30 minutes. And I want you to start making little debt charts on how much people owe you for what you think you're giving them. And that your reaction is right. It's disgusting. I mean, if like my- Yeah, cause those things are already written onto the ledger of the heart. You don't need to keep track of them. Well, there is no heart ledger. This is the thing when I've started like looking at my own patterns that are not conducive to a happy family. They all are rooted in a ledger that is non-existent. They're all rooted in a sense of like this. And I used to believe this shit. A relationship is like deposits and withdrawals. You've got to deposit a certain amount of love. You can't just keep taking and taking. And if you do, you're gonna fuck everything up because you oh, oh, oh. And it's like, I remember hearing that when I was younger, I mean like, yep, that's how it is. This person, this is explains why I don't like so and so. Cause they are deeply in love debt to me. Cause boy, have I been given to them. And it's bullshit. And so that's why I mentioned it to you just cause I think I agree with- Yeah, I'm speaking more metaphorically. It's the opposite of what we normally think of as a ledger, but it's true that any act, any time somebody shows love to me, it is recorded somehow in my body and it shifts me into the reality of love. And I think it's also recorded into the ledger of the world. It's not a plus and minus ledger. Ledger, it's not that if you give love to one person, you're taking something from somewhere else. It's additive. The more love that you give, the more love you have, it's the opposite of money in fact. So- Or maybe it's more like there isn't, it's like in the ocean giving water to someone. You know, like if we are on the ocean and I gave you a nice gift of seawater, it would be ridiculous because we're in the fucking ocean. And but if I'm like, here is a nice glass, seawater for you, my friend. This, it's similarly this concept of love, being a thing that you get more of is like being in the ocean and thinking, if I swim over here, I'll have more water. And it's like, you know, you're in the ocean. So to me, I love the debt forgiveness thing. And I love your idea of like, this is an internal revolution. And I've been trying to quantify or to look into the ways that I've been holding accounts for people and then trying to apply debt forgiveness there. Because- I see, yeah, yeah. People don't owe me a lot of money, unfortunately. Yeah. But the ledger of my heart and the, and the, how do you say it, Dickinsonian? The Charles Dickens style banker in there, this bank needs to be shut down permanently. And by quantifying this currency of love, it's given me real leverage to do debt forgiveness. And because debt forgiveness of the heart is just forgiveness, isn't it? Yeah, I think you're letting, I mean, you're talking about letting go of resentment too. Resinment is the feeling of holding somebody in our debt. Oh, yeah. Oh, whoa. Resinment is the feel, so like, oh my God, yeah. The more, oh, that's so, so resentment is the pain of being owed love by someone. It's the pain of telling a story or creating a paradigm where love can be given back or you can run low on love. And then you start feeling resentment because your whole brain is attached itself to a conceptualization of the universe that does not match what's actually happening, which is that we are in an infinitely abundant present moment-ness, I guess you could say. You can't run out, we're not gonna run out. It's not gonna happen. Does that make sense or do I, am I? Yeah, and that coexist with the lived reality for many people of tremendous scarcity, not only material scarcity, but scarcity of love, scarcity of fellowship, scarcity of community, scarcity of intimacy, scarcity of beauty, scarcity of authentic communication, scarcity of silence, scarcity of connection, so much scarcity in this society that there's more to it than just say, oh, well, that's just an illusion because it's a constructed illusion that we live in. And I'm interested in how to deconstruct that. And there's the perceptual level because a lot of times there is abundance. The very things that we need are actually right there if we just change the way we look at things. And then there's also like the social and political level, the abundance of the world, the abundance of food, for example, something like one in seven children in this country go hungry sometime during the year. I mean, there are millions of people literally starving to death on earth and we waste something like 40 or 50% of the food that we grow. So over abundance, side by side with scarcity, these two realities coexisting. And the reason that people are starving is also because of a constructed reality called the money system or the economy that makes people not eat simply because they don't have enough, it's not because they don't have enough food really, it's because they don't have enough money and money is something that we just create. So yeah, it's about changing the narrative, the story and the system. And where do you begin in this chicken and egg thing where a story creates system and system creates story? That's not a trivial question. Give everything away. Can I, before we answer that question, may I go Tucker Carlson on you for a moment? Yeah, do whatever you want, man. I'm not even sure like what, I'm game for it for any way you wanna play. I'm completely aligned with your POV, by the way. But just because people listening when they hear this sort of thing, they think, no, it's an impossibility. So I'm going to take on the role of Tucker Carlson, only because I wanna come up with in this conversation some actionable things people listening can do that can really demonstrate that your conceptualization of the economy or what the economy could be can happen. It's not just a pipe dream, but let me be the devil for a second, okay? What are you gonna do? What's your idea? You're gonna take money away from people who don't wanna give the money away? What are you gonna do? What are the millionaires and the billionaires out there and the trillionaires out there? This is theirs. The mansion is theirs. The yacht is theirs. The armies are theirs. They own it all, man. And they got it or their parents got it for them. And if you're suggesting that they're supposed to forgive debts, that they, money that they loaned, trusting they would get it back, then what's the difference between that and just outright theft? What's the difference between, isn't this just a sort of a hip-fied way of rationalizing, stealing from the rich and redistributing the wealth to the poor? And how is that even possible without some form of violence? And in that, don't we find ourselves back in the same place that we were trying to get away from, which is that we now are the conqueror. We now are pillaging. And what we're pillaging is the bank accounts of the rich. And so how does this even work? There's no way to make this happen. I can possibly imagine outside of some form of violent revolution because revolution has to be violent, because people are holding on very tightly to what they got. Yeah, beautiful. That's very well said, Tucker. Thank you. Thank you for your question. Yeah, so facing the situation, there are basically two ways to address it. And you named one of them, which is to violently take from the rich and give it to everybody else. And you could muster up plenty of very valid justifications for doing that. Going back to the origin of wealth and the way that it's maintained and justice and so on and so forth. And these people don't really deserve that much. And they're only able to make that much because of a social contract that allows them to engage in commerce and that enforces property rights. And they should be compensating the polity for the maintenance of this social contract, contract, et cetera, et cetera. If they don't wanna let go of it, then we're gonna have to take it by force. Or if not outright violence, the imposition of political will upon these people against their will. And that is conventional political thinking. But there's another piece that needs to be in the mix because if we rest our hopes on the violent overthrow of the ruling classes, sooner or later, I think we end up in despair because the fact is that the ruling classes, as Tucker was saying there, have more guns, more money, obviously, more media, the surveillance state, the propaganda machine, et cetera, et cetera. Like how are we gonna overcome them at their own game? So the other piece that's essential is to understand that the millionaires, and trillionaires, as you put it, aren't actually benefiting in the way that we think they are. That they're not, the system is not working for them either. And that this vast pile of wealth that goes way beyond any conceivable material need is a compensation for what they're actually missing in life. What are they missing in life? Yeah, and if you're coming to them with the knowledge that what I want is for you to be happier, what I want is a better world for you. Not what I want is to take something from you and make you make do with less, but I want a better world that you'll be happier to. And how do you know what that looks like? Go to Senegal, go to some remote place where people are in joy. Even places that have been affected horrendously by war and strife and economic extraction, there's a lot more joy there than you'll find in the wealthy enclaves of America where suicide and depression and opioid addiction are sky high. There's something not working for anybody, not even the 1%. And as long as we, if we do not accept that and understand that, then we will have no other option, but war against the rich. But when we understand that it's not working for them either, then there's no enemy. I got you. And yeah, and then like it takes skill to speak to that part of them. To speak to that part of them, you have to actually see it. See the part of them that wants a more beautiful world, that wants to be in the gift, that wants to contribute to something meaningful. You have to see it. And to see it, you have to look for it. And to look for it, you have to put down the fog of judgments that prevent you from seeing that divine peace, that magnificent human being in front of you. And to put down the judgments, that requires healing of trauma because the judgments are the external winds that's part of an experience of, so yeah, inner and outer, they're all, they all need to change at once. Holy shit. That's crazy. It requires healing of trauma. So it's, you're saying that the revolution, or this thing that you're talking about, starts with healing your personal trauma. It starts with getting in there and finding where the trauma is. And then from that, there'll be a natural reduction of the judgments for others. And then in that, the separation, the density of the separation, maybe will become a little, it'll seem less dense. Yeah, I wouldn't necessarily say it starts with that. I don't wanna lead us to trauma fundamentalism, where it's all about trauma, but it's an important piece for sure. I'm sorry, I have to stop you. Is that a concept trauma fundamentalism? No, well, I just made it up. Holy shit. That's awesome. Ah. Everybody's like, here's the thing. Here's the one thing. And if we change this one thing, then everything will change. I got you, that's me. I want that. I need, that's my, that's cause I like easy things. So if I can, I was just, anytime you can find the one thing, it's fantastic. But okay, keep going. Sorry about that. That's cool though. Well, yeah. So that's just an example of how the inner and the outer are so intimately entwined and how you cannot separate personal healing, relational healing, community healing from political and ecological healing. They all go together. They're all part of the same movement. Right. And that means that as an activist, you have to, you can understand that maybe one person's working on the level of government policy or trying to save a forest from being cut down and somebody else is doing, I don't know, men's work, you know, or community healing or some working one-on-one with people. And to understand that we are all allies in the same thing, serving the same thing. That creates solidarity and liberates people to exercise their unique gift in, in their unique way. Understanding that really everything is a political act. When you understand that the only hope lies in ending the war on the other, which could take the form of the war against the rich, the war against the corporations. Yeah, this is, this seems actionable. This seems like it's a, there's not, it seems like the kind of thing if people were to start experimenting in small ways with this, it could build up some kind of momentum. As you're saying, as you're talking about this, particularly like just we're all allies and not everyone has to be working on a specific, like it's a massive undertaking here. When it's like, it's building a house requires people with varying levels of expertise in many different things. And that we don't all have to be working in the same situation, but it sounds like what you're saying is just if you can find one little corner of the house to start working on, and maybe that corner is your own hangups, maybe that corner is your own family, or maybe that corner is your direct circle of friends. And to me, this is what Jack Cornfield says, which I love, tend to the part of the garden you can touch. Because when I start thinking about the melting ice caps, or when I start thinking about the rainforest, it's a distant kind of suck. You know, like I think, oh, that sucks, but it's like a suck with a volume turned way low. But, and so it's hard for me to get real passionate about the rainforest. It's hard for me to get passionate about the ice caps. But when I think about friends in my life that I know are depressed, or people in my life who need help, or even if I just think, what could, how much could I give away my shit? And who would I give it to? Something in there, that's sparked something for me. And, yeah. And then sometimes it was just like the thing that gets under your skin. And it might be the rainforest, or it might be, I was just in, where was it, Orcas Island, on, you know, near Washington state. And there's these whale watching companies, you know, and I learned that what they do is they go out in the morning with helicopters, and they search for where the Orcas are. And then they bring these really loud ships, like really loud motors out to, and chase the Orcas all over the place. The Orcas never get to rest. They're getting harassed by helicopters, and motors, and stuff like that all the time. Just so people can have the experience to put into their experiential backpack of, oh yeah, I saw the whale. They're like George Clooney. They're like George Clooney of the sea. That guy can't go anywhere without people taking pictures. You know, they're like the celebrity, it's the sea paparazzi, poor Orcas, that sucks. Yeah, yeah, it sucks, you know? And somehow like that one got to me. And maybe if I were in a different station in life right now, like that might become my, if I lived there probably, I might become an activist about that and try to change that and stop that from happening. Is that going to end climate change? Is that going to end racism? Is that gonna make any difference to anybody except for those few Orcas? It's hard to say. But if something calls to me, calls to my heart in that way, then I like to just trust that. And trust that somehow this is part of the global revolution that I'm talking about that is not primarily a revolution of force. And it's amazing, like it is the power of seeing somebody in their divinity or in their magnificence, we're seeing the best version of who they are, who they can be, it's amazingly powerful because the story that we hold about somebody is an invitation for them to step into that story. And I'm reminded of one of Gandhi's, gosh, I wish I could remember his name, Singh maybe, one of his most prominent followers who basically traveled around India talking to the wealthiest landowners and persuading them to give up, I think it was a sixth or a fifth of their land to the poor, to the landless peasants. And he would just show up and speak to them knowing that that's actually what they wanted to do, holding them in the story, not of greedy landowner, but in the story of somebody who would really like to make this gift, but is afraid to do it because of his upbringing, because of his cultural surround. He's afraid, but I'm gonna help him because I know what he really is. And imagine how powerful we would be if we were able to hold that about other people. We could create the invitation and it's not to like blind ourselves to the horrible shit that people are doing. You have to actually see it to be able to exercise that invitation. And as I said before, to see it, you have to look for it. And to look for it, you gotta put down the judgments. And where do the judgments come from? I mentioned trauma, but every time that we judge, say Charles Koch or Donald Trump or somebody as worse than ourselves, we're actually also elevating ourselves in comparison. And we're saying essentially, when we're in judgment of somebody, we're saying, yeah, I'm good. I get to like myself. I'm lovable. I'm deserving of approval. And that points to the trauma. Like why would we need to do that? Only if we've had experiences of not being approved of unconditionally for who we truly are, of not being loved, of not being respected. So yeah, so there's a lot of healing. And then we can also, well, anyway, I could go on and on, but you get the picture there. I get the picture, but still it's, to me, it's, it feels exciting, but I'm, I want something, I'm just trying to think of something like truly actionable based on this. Like as you're talking, I'm thinking of like, is it a some kind of repository where, you know, collectives can put money in and fill it up. And then that becomes the universal basic income source. You know what I mean? Like some way of like, instead of always depending on the governments to do this shit, like if enough of us just started giving away, and there was some like, again, you have to do this as a thought experiment and imagine some utopian system where this, this type of resources could be pooled and then an administrative body that could then like, give this out. I mean, this has been the church, you know, and tithing, you trust your church is going to do charity for you. You don't have time or you don't know. And some people have charities they give to, but as you're talking, I just keep thinking like, whoa, what would happen if like enough of us just started filling up some repository with art, with dough, without just giving to that. And then there was a way to like dispense that so that people started getting checks and it wasn't based on the state. And in that, this kind of weird in a dream, this weird revolution does start happening, which is that if we start equalizing or balancing where there are imbalances in this particular way, then it seems like it would naturally begin to lessen the potency and the control factors that allow the exploitive elements of our society to continue to solidify this type of hellscape that we call modern life. And, but it requires first, it seems like detaching completely from the idea that anybody else is gonna do it for us. We don't, it's not gonna be the government. It's not gonna be the president. It's not gonna be Bernie Sanders. It's not gonna be this, it's not gonna be, it's gonna be a global consciousness that springs up and begins to store its resources in a shared pool that is somehow distributed in a way that is unexploitable. Boy, that sounds like a real pipe dream. Well, let me talk about actionable and more practical and what we actually mean by that. You kind of mentioned two levels of it. Actually, one would be what we as a society could do. How would we implement a system like that, that brought the spirit of gift and the spirit of interbeing into economics. Then the other thing, that's actually not practical if you're talking about what we should do because you're not, we, you're you. So then there's the action step that we as individuals, like people listening to our conversation can take. And that's really different. Sometimes I get a little bit tired. I call it political bypass of like, you know, your spiritual bypass, right? Well, political bypass is something that takes the onus off yourself to actually do anything because you're just going to talk about ideas. We could do it, gang. We'll do it. We'll make this thing. Isn't somebody else fucking do this, please? Cause I'm not going to. I'm just going to say we should do it and hope maybe if somebody- Here's what we should do. In the meantime, I'm just going to keep doing whatever I'm doing, right? Guys, we should do the dishes. We really should. Not me, but we as in you. Okay, that's cool. Right. Not to say that, I mean, there are, and not to take the other way too, and say, well, forget about political action, just be the change yourself. Like, I think both are necessary. So I'd like to say a little bit about both. Please. Starting on the collective level, the basic, basically the way I see it working is starting with massive debt cancellation or actually it's more of a debtor's bailout. Next financial crisis, there's going to be trillions of dollars of unpayable debts. Last time this happened, the creditors were bailed out. But did the debtors get bailed out? No, they still owed. It was just the Federal Reserve or the government bought the debts and they still owed. A debtor's bailout means that the debt is either canceled completely, your student loan is gone, for example, or the interest rate or it's canceled partially or the interest rate is cut to zero or negative. That's the first step. To do that requires massive monetization of debt. Like the Federal Reserve has to, will have to buy trillions of dollars in debt and replace them with money. So the creditors are not destroyed either. Whereas, so if I'm a creditor and the people out there owe me a hundred billion dollars and they're not going to pay, the government gives me the hundred billion dollars. So I'm good, but this money now is negative interest money, which is implemented through a liquidity fee on bank reserves. So money in the Fed is subject to say a negative 5% interest rate, which means that if I've got a hundred billion dollars now, I don't want to just hold on to it and watch it shrink by 5% a year. I'll lend it out even at zero interest, which allows a zero growth economy to flourish. Because today in our current system, it's impossible to have a healthy economy without strong economic growth, which demands the depletion of nature. Anyway, that's a whole other thread, but to say, so the money gets, so money is subject to a negative interest rate, trillions and trillions of dollars of newly created base money subject to a negative interest rate, that's what funds the universal basic income. Wow. So it all kind of goes together. How do you, why though? Who's going to do that? How do we make that happen? I can't imagine that happening. Like, how does that, that seems like, I mean, I, that, like, I'm definitely not going to start a pool of like, blockchain money to give to the people of the world. But the thing you just said, I like, barely, and like, I feel like I would have to go to school for, I'd have to have your brain. I need to have a, just Charles Eisenstein brain to understand what you just said. The thing you just said is like high math to me. And I think, I don't- I've been, yeah, I mean, like, yeah. I mean, I spent years thinking about it. So I apologize for taking shortcuts and not explaining it, but I'm also feeling like I don't have a huge amount of time, but it can be explained. And like debt cancellation, that's pretty darn easy to understand. I understand that. But I don't understand why, what would motivate the state or creditors- Because, because, because it's a crisis, because nothing else working. And because like central banks already kind of want to do this. They kind of, because monetary policy is not working anymore. For it to work, they have to be able to go below zero. So there's, there's reasons. This is not an unknown concept in central banking circles that I'm talking about. So it already kind of wants to happen because it's the only way to allow a steady state or degrowth economy to function. So they're like people who are, you know, the cognizantie will understand what I'm talking about. The barrier to overcome is that it is not in the interests of the rich to, they, they are going, it's like inflation, you know, if, if interest rates are negative, then you can no longer become richer and richer merely by owning money. Yeah. I mean, to me, it just seems, it seems like- So there needs to be political will. Political will or like to me, it goes back to, you know, a general sense of like, look, you guys have to let the steam out of the pressure cooker. And if you think that you can keep sucking the dough in and not giving any of it back and the people are not, are just going to like walk around like that's cool. Look at what's happening in Paris. Look at the yellow vest. Look at what happens. This shit will break out. And, and to me, that's the, that's what, that's the reason behind it is like, there's way more of us than you. And that's the bottom line. Eventually people are going to blow, man. You can't suck it all in and then expect people to be like, oh yeah, it's just fair, man, the game's fair because the game, people will start seeing and right now you can see it's not fair. But when it gets to more and more extreme levels then it becomes so apparent that, okay, sure. Well, maybe we're not supposed to violently take their shit but the reality of it is, is they're violently keeping us away from what we should have. So someone's going to fight back. And I don't want that to happen. But maybe we can bring it down to someone listening right now who wants to be part of this sort of unfolding into a new reality, into the part of the multiverse where we are experiencing not a slow shift even though that may be it, but in our own personal lives you can experience a dramatic radical revolution. And to me that means emotional debt forgiveness. That means looking at all the accounting you've done in your own mind of shit people owe you and having a, you don't even have to tell them you've done it, but just forget it, you're not getting it back and that's fine. And I love what you said about resentment being the burn that comes from feeling like somebody has an emotional debt to you because that gives a little X on the treasure map, so to speak, which is like who the fuck are you resenting? Who's somebody, just make a list of the people in your life that you resent deeply. And if you don't have that list, congratulations, you're enlightened, but make the list and then look at why you're resenting them. And if it has something to do with a sense that they owe you something, you help them move and they didn't say thank you, whatever the fuck it is, forgive that, start there. Because I think that what I love about what you're talking about is that these debt economy, the story, it seems to be a symptom of a shared interior resentment. All of our individual resentments have gathered together and formed this massive shadow, the gestalt, the reflection of all of our interior resentments, debt, the Federal Reserve, the national debt, all of this stuff is actually just a reflection of the sum total of all of us thinking somebody owes us something. It's like, how the fuck can I suggest that the Federal Reserve forgive all debts when I'm still pissed at my brother? Right, you're not living in the universe in which that is even possible. That, yes, right. Right, and this gets back to the quantum reality shift. And there is this mystical level of it that I am just gonna put out there without scientific proof, which is that any act that we commit that is aligned with a different world than the one we live in helps bring that world into alignment with the choice that we've made. And this is this mysterious intimate connection between the inner and the outer. So if we are in, yeah, so if we forgive, if we are generous, if we are able to see others that way and act from that place, then we're basically making a declaration to the universe or a prayer saying, here's the world that I wanna live in. And it's not just an idea I have, I'm willing to commit to it through my actions, even when I'm afraid to do it. And I think that ultimately when enough people do that, we're going to kind of vibrate the world into alignment with those choices. I think it's a migration. I think it's a multiverse migration. Listen, don't worry about saying things that aren't scientific, by the way, because I can spew it, man. It's a multiverse migration. I think there is, we're living in a universal world, a society where there's a specific type of density that is completely unappealing to what it is, it was antithetical to what it is to be alive and to be a human and to be part of nature. But we're in it right now. I don't know how we got here, but we're here, we're here. If you're listening to this, you're in it with us, we're here, but I think we can migrate. And I think that we see birds migrate all the time. How do they know where they're going? What are they doing? What is that? But similarly, I think, and I know this sounds so insane, we can migrate between these multiverses. And right now, there is a world, there is a human society that did it, that did it, that pushed past the boundary created instinctually or over time or something that was coupled together by consciously nefarious people, but mostly unconscious people who are just scared. And I think we could just all start moving away from that. And I don't know, I think that if you were, if like after this podcast, I was to just take a bunch of money and give it to some, a school, you know? I know there's a website where you can just look, classes need money for paper for their students. I feel like if I did do something like that or found some other profoundly scary way to give a thing with just to give, I think maybe I would start moving out of this creepy society that we're in into some other place. And I've noticed that there's a magical thing that does happen and I feel crazy talking about it, but come on, the moment you start giving, synchronicities do appear in your life. Now I sound like a televangelist, plant the seed in the tree, but it's true. The moment you just start giving, I'm sorry, your universe gets more magical and it happens almost instantly. Yep, I have, I ran this online course called Living in the Gift. Yes. And I'm gonna wait till your friend starts barking there. Living in the Gift, that's the gift. Living in the Gift. That's the gift of Poodle Bark. And one of the things, so one of the themes that came up was exactly what you're saying. People would, I suggested people do something generous that's a little out of the ordinary of their normal flow of generosity, because actually all of us are very much in gift all the time when you realize it or not, but something a little bit, you know, not normal. And people had some amazing experiences of synchronicity that followed that. And I think that it happens because in giving, there's a release of control. When you release control, then another order of things, another intelligence that's not based on what you can make happen comes up. So it creates the release of control allows space for synchronicities to emerge. Wow. And yeah, and it comes from an orientation. Like the first, so the starting point might not be to, you know, send a bunch of money to the school. The starting point is an orientation and a recognition of a willingness to take that next step into gift. And that orientation then makes you receptive to the right gift at the right time, the right opportunity, which may be something that you can't even recognize before, but that becomes apparent to you. And I think that, yeah, there's no formula to doing this. And that's why I can't say, if someone says, well, where do you think I should give my money, Charles? I'm like, what speaks to you? What calls to your care? Because the listening organ called the heart will orient you toward the best application of whatever gifts that you have. So that's the orientation. And then to be able to awaken it in others. Like you talked about forgiveness. And my thought is, well, why? Why should you forgive other people and let go of resentment? Give me a practical reason. Because the goal of all of this is not that you get to be a good person now. There's, like, why are we doing this? There's a reason that is mostly invisible that answers that question. But it's not that you'll benefit in any way. Where is it? Oh, wow. But yeah, really practical here. Like, why should I? Why should I forgive? Because it hurts, man. It hurts. It fucking hurts to be angry. And what I read some, I don't know who said it, but anger is the way we punish ourselves for other people's mistakes. Right, but resentment is like drinking poison, hoping that the other person will get sick. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, something like that, yeah. Yeah, so just that. It's like, why? Because it's like, why should you not run your car on shitty fuel? It's burning your car up. And it's like, why should you, why should the circuitry of who you are be fueled by resentment and anger and fear? All of these things to me are qualities that harmonize you with a type of world that is really quite wretched. And so I don't wanna say like why, all this revolves around benefit. But, you know, I don't want my heart to wonder how it can like do better than my other organs. You know, I don't need a successful heart. I need a functioning ecosystem where everything's, where it's working out for everything, or I'm in trouble. No one's ever gone to the doctor and been like, bad news. You're fucking pancreas is just failing. Good news, your heart. You got a really, really healthy heart. It's, you know, this is, so we need the whole thing to work. You know? And I don't know how to talk about it. Unfortunately, I wish I could come up with a thing. Right now, my sense is benefit-based. And maybe that's okay. Isn't it okay to start there just to think, well, okay, I am gonna get something out of this. You know, I can't get- Yeah, the problem though, the problem though is that when you come from that place, you often end up with fake forgiveness or attempted forgiveness. Yeah, right. I find that real forgiveness comes as a side effect of seeing something true. Ah, okay, cool. Yeah. And the basic template of that truth is that, is it's the understanding of the other person's situation. Understanding that, oh yeah, this is what they were thinking. This is what they were experiencing. If I had been in that situation, I might have done that too. Oh no, but then I'm the asshole. God damn it, damn it. The moment you do, you use that part of your brain, it's like the whole thing backfires and it's painful. I mean, I love it. You're right, you're absolutely right. It's just you don't get to be, that's funny, I'm saying you're absolutely right. Yeah, you don't get to be the good guy anymore. You don't get to be better than. You don't get to be the hero. You don't get to be the conquering victor. You don't get to be the Conan the Barbarian. What is it in Conan the Barbarian? Yeah, and why do you want, so then you can take it another level though. Why do you want to be that? Is it because you're bad? What happened to you that you're craving to be the good guy that you have sanctimoniousness and self-righteousness? Right. What happened? The same thing that happened to that other person maybe, that made them do that shitty thing. Right. We're all in it together. Yeah. And if we could look at each other through those eyes, we would have a lot more access to creative solutions to our personal and social problems. Man, you are so inspiring. And I'm, this is like, this really has given me some good motivation for doing some emotional debt forgiveness that needs to be done and not being the fucking hero, man. And it's like when that dumb song came out with one of the Mad Max's, the Tina Turner song, I never understood it. We don't need another hero. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. It's such a cheesy song. But they, you know, all we want is the thunder dumb, really dumb, but heroes are the problem right now, man. And it's really messing everything up. We've got all these heroes out there, man. And the problem is a hero depends on catastrophe to exist. By wanting to be a hero, you're wishing there to be some catastrophe that you could then function within to elevate yourself. And it's a really innately rotten thing to wanna be. So yeah, I think surrendering the concept of wanting to be a hero or understanding why we want that in our lives. Why do we feel that starved that we wanna be a hero in the world? Yes, and to ask that question without an agenda of blame or guilt, and I'm gonna, you know, uncover this bad thing about myself, but with real gentleness. When we ask ourselves that, when we ask other people that too, when we ask them, yeah, why did you do that thing? Help me to understand and to really mean it, not as an attack, but- That's so good. Yeah, I want understanding so that I can change the conditions. It's the opposite of Superman. It's like we all need to go into phone booths and walk out in normal clothes. Yeah, it's true. Like what we need now is not heroes so much as warriors. You know, in the layout of Moore and Gillette, they talk about the male archetypes of the warrior, magician, lover, and king. The hero is the immature version of the warrior. It's a boy archetype. And the hero's journey ends with, I did it, you know, look at me, you know, Luke Skywalker getting the medal in front of him. Yeah, and you know, that's a valid archetype, and it's part of the process, but what we need in this world is people who do not need to get the recognition. They'll settle for the world changing. They'll settle for healing, even if they're never even recognized. That takes courage. That's a warrior. He doesn't need the glory. He's passed that. Wow. Okay, okay. Thank you very much for your time today. I really appreciate it. And thank you so much for the work that you're doing in the world. If I had a medal to give, I would give it to you whether you like it or not. You could have all my medals. Thank you so much. How can people find you? CharlesEisenstein.org. Great.

Sometimes when I'm watching television, and I think that most of the people in the movie are probably dead. And it's spooky. And when I go to a funeral, see the people weeping, and a body in the casket. And it's spooky. And then the Casper, the friendly ghost, car too. I always wondered how it was. And he died. And it's spooky. Sometimes when I'm watching television. That was a cover of It's Spooky by Daniel Johnston and Chad Fair, a true power couple. Speaking of power couples, today's guest and I are a power couple. At least he helps me a lot. I have had an ongoing conversation with this man about Buddhism and meditation. I guess it's been going on over for many years now. And I love sharing him with all of y'all. You know him from the Midnight Gospel. It's David, David Nickturn. He is the principal instructor at darmamoon.com. And he's also a good friend of mine and incredibly talented musician, among other things. And today, we had a really wild conversation about war, violence, secret mystery schools, the roots of Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam. And we even brought up the great mystery that hovers around anyone living today, which is the roots of the term OK. I hope you'll stay tuned. It's a great chat. But first, this. This episode of the DTFH has been brought to you by Superspeciosa, purveyors of the finest Kratom on planet Earth. Kratom gets you in a really cool zone. It's a wild buzz. Kratom's been around for centuries. People have used it for all kinds of things, from relaxing to getting energy. It just makes you feel good. I don't know what the buzz is. The plant is related to the coffee plant, which is really curious, because it sure doesn't feel like coffee. I like it, though. It really helps me chill out at the end of the day. And it's just a wonderful, nice, after-work, wind-down herb. If you're a beginner at this stuff, order the capsules. Don't do the powder. They sent me powder. I'm not going to use the powder. I'm afraid of the powder. I need it measured out for me. I like to be like a laboratory animal that doses itself. So I don't know about the powder. If you're an advanced Kratom user, then you know about the powder already. Order the powder. All I can tell you is this stuff is top-notch, high-grade, holy shit-level Kratom. And I hope that you will give it a try if you've heard about it, if you're interested in it, or if you're looking for a new Kratom source.

The last time I was there attempting to do stand-up comedy, I was beset by the plague and had to spend 10 days in a hotel room. But I'm flying back to make it up to you for canceling all those shows. I hope you'll come out. It's at the Vulcan Gas Company. All the links are at dunkatrustle.com. Also, to my sweet LA friends, I'm going to be there at the end of the month doing a live DTFH for the Netflix is a joke comedy festival. Dan Harmon is going to be one of the guests on this episode.

And now my dear sweeties with us here today is David from the Midnight Gospel, AKA David Nickturn, AKA principal meditation teacher at darmamoon.com. If you like him, check him out over there. Take one of his classes. They're offering a teacher training program in May and lots of other stuff. You can find it all at darmamoon.com. But before you do that, tune in for this conversation with David Nickturn. Hello. Good to see you, David. How are you doing? Everything's OK, Duncan. But do you know what OK stands for? No. Neither do I. Oh, my God. I've never considered that. We say it all the time, right? OK. OK. OK. Well, there's the O part and the K part. OK. Holy shit. Wow. I didn't mean to derail you completely. This is just going to destroy my life. I've been saying that over and over. Never once have we thought to look it up. Is this the clue? Is it hidden in that? If we look up OK, suddenly it reveals our true reality. Well, if we looked at it as mantra, O is opening, right? And K is cutting. Open and cut sounds like a scary mantra. But yeah, I get it. I mean, that's kind of revision, right? The opening part is the writing. Then the K part would be when you have to go in and actually work. My favorite part of writing is the very initial vomiting out of some idea onto the page. Everything after that not quite as fun. They call that writing down the bones. Yeah, right. Have you heard that expression? I have, yeah. I have. Yeah, writing down the bones. And then that's when the real work kicks in. I think that's why a lot of people aren't never become writers is because they don't want to go through. They like the bone part, but they don't like structuring the whatever it is they're working on. I don't. Most writers I know hate the revision part and the trimming part. How do you feel about that part of the process? They like the old part, but they don't like the K. They don't like the K. Yeah. This is, the creative process is so interesting that it dawns, and it just kind of opens up. Yes. It comes out of space and gap and nothing in particular. Right? Whenever you have a creative idea, it just seems to come from nowhere. Yes. And then your right to follow through is what separates the manifesters from the dreamers. Yeah, exactly. Right, exactly. Because the dreamers, if you can stay dreamer, if you can stay the O part, then you can fool yourself into thinking that there's something, I don't know, soft about you, sweet about you. You know what I mean? You can trick yourself into it. But because anytime you see the people who are into the K part of stuff, there's this weird rugged quality to them or an oxen-like quality, where they just keep, like I've run into many people living in L.A. Of course, you're surrounded by people who are good at both parts. But the second part, the first part is like riding around on your fancy horse in front of some nice palace and some fantasy countryside. It's a sort of like you feel like a poet or like the fool in the tarot card deck or whatever. The second part, it really is more like digging trenches or planting seeds or, you know what I mean? It's hard. It's hard work. And I think it turns a lot of people off. Well, and then you can have too much K. They're not on a pole. Well, this is why they say, write stoned, revise sober. That might be interesting to switch it around. You can't. Because if you get stoned and try to do revisions, this is just not me. I've talked to editors, and they have told me that they cannot edit. And I'm sorry for the editors out there, like this is I'm always stoned. But some editors I've talked to, they're like, I can't edit stoned, not because it incapacitates me, but because I become too. I zoom in too much on just the little bits of the thing. You can become like it too into the little parts. Yeah, are you getting stoned a lot these days? No, I haven't been as much. You know, I'm always like getting stoned here and there. But no, I go through phases with marijuana. I mean, my last big marijuana phase was years ago. And I stayed stoned for two years straight. But I haven't come back there. It was fun. It was a fun two years. Fun. Yeah. I was in the best shape of my life. You mean because you exercised a lot? Yeah, because I liked I had I had wrapped together getting stoned and jogging, which is one of the great experiences in life. Have you ever even ever done that? Well, you know, I don't get stoned all that often. But sometimes. And I jog even less. OK. Ah, well. Maybe I'm missing that it's a couple. Oh, my God. Yeah, that's like I think that of all the substances out there that I'm aware of, marijuana is the best for exercise. Wow. That's the first time I've ever even heard that. Really? That's wild. That's about eating and, you know, kind of spacing out and listening to music and things like that. You can do I will I would eat while I when I used to jog. I would carry a backpack full. Oh, God, that's a formula for potential disaster. Well, dogs, the problem is dogs chase you. But the the no getting stoned and exercising because, you know, marijuana is a very like earthy high. Like you're you're in your body. This is why a lot of people get paranoid because they're like it reminds you of all the earth stuff that you need to take care of. You know, whereas like other substances like ketamine, LSD, they're more ethereal. You know, you can say I think you can say argue that mushrooms are and very earthy high like they but some things seem to not be earthy at all. They seem to be alien or sort of, you know, disassociates associatives in particular. Anyway, yeah, job getting you should try it, David. I'm serious. You would like it. Yeah. Well, you know, I practice Tai Chi. And that's my main and I'm studying a sword form with the Tai Chi. That's very interesting. Tai Chi is really cool. I took a Tai Chi class in college and I didn't. I couldn't. I just didn't understand it. But now and now I think about it sometimes wondering what is going on there? Like you see people doing it in the park and stuff and it's like some form of dance. But also it's moving energy in a certain way or what's what's going on with that? Yeah, so it's got a knowledge of the inner landscape, the channels and energy channels. So it's the same knowledge as acupuncturists would have. Usually a good Tai Chi person can also do acupuncture. My teacher can do both. And energy just gets blocked in your body. You know, look at the way anybody's sitting at any one time. You can just you can see almost an energy diagram around them of their physical energy. All right. So. But in terms of all in K. You know, I think that's a we stumble upon stuff. Don't we, Duncan? You know, yeah, we just kind of like put on our goggles and go down. Yeah. But there is something about the. Allowing space, you know. And I saw your podcast the other night on BHN. Oh, yeah. And I was just thinking, you know, how many people just leave a little bit of space at all, even in the conversation or in their day? Right. You know, just and that's oh, you know, it's just like there's nothing to do. Yeah. Oh, yeah. And I think maybe, you know, people might think that drugs could enhance that. Do you think that some people take drugs to enhance that sense of oh, and spaciousness and yeah, sure. Definitely. Yeah. It's a tool to to get there. It's one of the ways to get there. I mean, it's just one of the problem with drugs that we haven't fixed yet, which I hope we will, is that you there's this. It's like, OK, balding medications. You want to take the balding medication? Guess what? Your dick's not going to get as hard. Right. You know what I mean? So why wait a minute. What? That could be one of the effects is maybe you're putting it in the wrong place. It can fuck up your sex drive. So like you're putting it in the wrong place. What you mean? I wasn't pushing into your cock. Holy shit. I got to get more. No, like this is the. So this is the trade off, right? You know, certain types of MDMA, right? It makes you want to cuddle. It's like makes sex great. But guess what? You can't come. So there are these like satanic things built into certain substances where there's either a price you have to pay that that is not equal to the experience, but can sometimes exceed the experience in suffering. You know what I mean? Like MDMA, at least if you've done it as many times as I have, I don't take it anymore because the it's not worth the two days when my brain doesn't have enough happy juice in it. And I go into a depression for a couple of days. So I can't do it anymore. And I know a lot of people who just they just can't. And then to try to mitigate that, there's all sorts of things you can take after and before that might help you balance out a little bit. But it's just to me not worth it anymore. In the beginning, it was great, but now not so much. I'm down to only a few drugs that I can like take that don't have a repercussion marijuana being one of them, at least as far as I think you could. What would be the consequence of you just stopping completely for a year? Probably like I've become too productive. You become productive. No, wow, you're pretty productive already. What do you mean? No, I'm just like, well, I don't like, again, I'm not really I'm not a stoner anymore. I used to do it all the time. I mean, so that I don't know that there would be any consequence. Anything would really change that much. You know, any habit is so interesting to shift any habit. So even I sometimes say, do this with your hands. OK, I just reversed it. The placement. All right. You feel that? Yeah, it's totally different. It's totally different. It's and it doesn't feel comfortable or normal. All right. Yeah, right. So resting in spaces that are comfortable or normal. It's almost a good practice. So yeah, this was OK. So Crowley in his book, Lieber four, I believe it's in that book. He in that this is the beginning phases of magic. He would recommend exactly this, except it was weird stuff like stop using your left hand for a month or, you know, don't say I for. A month, you know, things like that. But then he because it's Crowley, he added to it. And again, sorry for my felonites out there. He added to it, like the punish yourself if you mess up. So like, you know, and he recommended, I think, like cutting yourself, like hurting, hurting yourself. No. Yeah. But it was I think he was mirroring the in India. And in fact, isn't this when the Buddha goes into the forest? He encounters the ascetics and the ascetics were doing stuff like this. They were not eating. They were in India. You see people who was like out of some penance have put their hand up and won't lower it. And so it just, you know, that thing. So this is what you're talking about. What Crowley was talking about. It's like a way to shift out of your comfort zone. Yeah. Of course, he walked on by. In the words of the immortal Bard. He walked on by. Buddha hung with the ascetics, tried the ascetic thing. He was down to one grain of rice a day, according to some stories and sitting in campfires. And, you know, the general notion was if you if you can switch off your attachments to sense perceptions and physical sensations that you will experience some kind of mental quietude and, you know, space in which something is more luminous is revealed to you. But he tried it and found that it left a residue or a trace of that effort of trying to do something in or get rid of something. So that that didn't work for him. I mean, he you could say, well, we should try it too. I mean, I'm I'm I'm intrigued by if somebody else has already tried something like you've tried all the drugs I ever need to take, you know. OK, sure, David. I OK, David, like you've never taken drugs. Of course, I know you. I know this. You're in the 60s. I know you're hanging out with you. But my point is that you can learn from other people's experience. If you if you like the whole idea of Buddhism, you know, well, it's just one guy in the forest, as you said, twenty five hundred years ago. So why should you even care anything you said or what he did? Because you have to find out for yourself. But there is some efficacy in hearing other people's stories along the way and learning, benefiting from their experience. Right. Yeah. Right. You can save some time that way. I just the the you have to verify, though, you have to verify. But just to stick around in the forest with the aesthetics, you know, this is I like this part of this of the story of Buddhism. And I like how it's generally it's sort of like at least as far as I'm aware. Maybe you can correct me on this, not detailed. There's just this sort of thing he goes in the forest, he does penances. He gets so thin, you know, there's the emaciated Buddha statue that you see sometimes and as an example of his discipline and all that. But they don't talk. It's like Jesus, when Jesus disappears, it's a similar thing where like and this is like in the stories of these avatars, there is inevitably a period. Muhammad goes up into the cave. There's a period where they kind of disappear from society. We don't know what happened in a lot of cases. I think in Islam, we know that he was visited by angels who help who gave him the Quran. But with Buddha, same thing. He goes off into the forest. He trains with these people who represent. Ancient lineages in India that many of them might just be gone forever. So we don't even know if they even exist anymore. But again, he's in the if you hear the story, you imagine him maybe just hanging out with like, you know, people in, I don't know, loincloths and dirty robes or, you know, I don't think that's what it was. I think like he came into contact with a mystery school, some sort of group, perhaps, or some kind of religion or a cult or something in there. And they did teach him stuff. They did, in a way, you could say, open the pathway for Buddhism to exist in the world, because would you have come to that epiphany if not for the starvation period and the asceticism? So I think one could argue that those ascetics were not quite as like unintentional as people might imagine. Oh, yeah. I mean, you could you can color the story however you want. But the fact is that now you have your choices to make about how to live. And the amount of rivers that come together to inform your options is this massive at this point, unprecedented. So the question is, how do you choose how to how to format your own existence? And all these are just rumors, basically, how somebody else did in the past. Well, yeah, I know. And it's speculation. The reason I think it's it's it is a good form of a good thing to think about. Yeah, is because you want number one, you're in Buddhism. You are invited to do this form of analysis. And in other words, like, you know, that's a big difference, right? You're actually invited to use your discriminating awareness to process whatever somebody's suggesting that you process. Not just if you have to. It's not that you're invited. It's if you're going to do it, right, you have to. There's no choice. You can't get faith your way out of the damn thing, unfortunately. And so that so in so in the reason I so aside from that, the reason I think it's cool to think about that period is because to me, it implies something that I that I think is really wonderful, which is in the world. There are anonymous groups of people who seem are directly responsible for shifting the planetary culture for thousands of years. And no one ever knows who these people are. But the one thing they can erase from the stories, and I think they would, if they could, is these periods of time that the great teachers spend in seclusion that aren't detailed at all. It's like they and they don't, you know, that they can't get that off the record. They can erase themselves in the sense that no one knows who the names as far as I'm aware of the people Budo was sitting with in the forest. You said, why don't you stop eating for a little bit? You know, it's good to cut out habits, you know, matter what they are, just like what you said to me, that's what they said to him. And he was like, all right, I'll give it a shot. And so all I'm saying is it's cool as a fantasy to imagine that those people haven't really gone anywhere. They're still there in their little spirituality Messiah factories. Who knows, you know, sculpting some new Buddha right now that they're going to release into the world. Oh, God bless today's sponsor, Athletic Greens, for sending me, finally sending me a vitamin powder I can use. I'm not a vitamin person. I feel embarrassed when my friends have big fat Ziploc bags full of vitamins. Oh, what's going on with you? It's not good for you. I've seen my friends vomit, projectile vomit, fall down on the street and have mild reactions to the massive amounts of vitamins that they're taking. Aside from all that, I just don't have the discipline to do the thing. What are you going to, in the beginning of the week, what do you do? Put your vitamins in your, in your, in your medication.

Thank you, Athletic Greens. Well, when you do any form of retreat practice, you're mirroring that process to the extent, you know, if you do a weekend or a week or a month, but like somebody like Dilco Kensei, who was Trunker Rinpoche's one of his teachers, supposedly had spent 15 years in a cave. Exactly. That's old school. You know, anybody these days, it's going to be the hard thing to orchestrate. I'm sure there are people doing it actually, by the way, right now. In fact, I know there are. But, you know, is that going to be the right orchestration for your life with two kids and a business? And yes, and is there some way that you can? Is it even possible for you to consider achieving any kind of understanding depth of realization without doing that? That's a really interesting question. Yeah, yeah. Well, OK, two answers to that. Number like number one. And again, this is like a fantasy. But they're like, I think that there is the possibility. And I've you know, I did a podcast with Lama Somo. Have you ever heard of Lama Somo? She's cool. But she's like we talked about the four immeasurables in Buddhism. But the within the conversation, she was sort of talking about how and we've had this conversation to this idea of shared mind, you know, shared mind. And so or this concept of, you know, being connected to everything, everyone on the planet, everything connected. So in other words, these beings, whoever they may be. I don't even know. Maybe they're not even planetary. Who knows? Maybe they are or they sort of like channel through people sometimes. Or who knows? I don't know. It's all speculation. Well, that's not just totally speculation. For example, there are documentable oracles within the Tibetan Buddhist tradition. Yeah, I've actually met the two principal oracles of the Dalai Lama and actually got to talk to them about their process. So there is a pretty definable process in which they vacate the premise of the body. They're not really there. They're sort of nearby, but they're not really there. And another entity, another discreet form of intelligence actually occupies that situation and has access to a different field of knowledge. And there's the Necheng oracle, who's kind of a very ordinary monk and very lovely person, but doesn't claim to be any kind of particular teacher himself. But they do a ritual and he is gone and then Necheng comes into his body. And it's quite, anybody who wants to look at this, you can look at it on YouTube. It's just look up Necheng, N-E-C-H-U-N-G oracle. And he becomes this other entity, which is kind of startling. Yeah. Anybody who's seen it. And then he speaks an arcane Tibetan language that only certain of the monks can understand. And the Dalai Lama consults with him. Yeah. And that's the oracle. That's the person who said to the Dalai Lama, you have to leave Tibet tonight. Yeah, right. Right. So it's not like horoscopes, like the data that they give them is very usable. And he's given him imminent information about things, like actions that need to be taken right away. He probably is the reason that Tibetan Buddhism made it to the West is because of that oracle. Well, and he's still very much alive. There's a monastery in Dharmasala, which is the Necheng monastery. And that's where he resides. So, and the quality of, there's a big O there and another entity comes through the O. Yeah, right. Yeah. There's an opening. And these are people who, for whatever karmic reason, have the capacity to just open themselves. There's another one, which is a Khandro Seringma, who's a woman oracle, which is quite extraordinary, but a very lovely kind of grounded person. But you can feel that there's operations going on on more than one level of the elevator. You know, it's like the person's elevators at the ninth floor and the third floor at the same time. That, right. And we have that right now. Yes. There's multi-dimensional quality, but it depends what we're paying attention to and how obsessed we are with whatever we're trying to get done. Yes, right. That. See, that to me, that's why the consideration of not just the fundamental, down-to-earth basics of some of the wisdom traditions, but the stuff that's left out, but is clearly like the progenitor of the thing itself. But it gets left out. I mean, that's just to me, that's always the, that's where things get really curious is because those are always the smartest people. Like the smartest people are the ones who, who don't want to be the mascot. You know what I mean? We're like, I don't want to. OK, so, or another way to put it would be, Brian Eno has a term called Senus, the genius of the scene. So like anytime you get a David Bowie, anytime you get an Andy Warhol, anytime you get an Alistair Crowley or any of these people, whether they're, you know, teachers or whatever, there is a whole community behind them that's been cooking up the ideas that they're expressing through their particular mode of communication. And you hear that and you think, ah, wow, well, I guess David Bowie lucked out because he got to be David Bowie. But some of these people who are cooking up the David Bowie, they don't want to be David Bowie. They don't want to be on stage. They don't want to be, they don't want to be in front of anything. But they're the ones who are like offering it to the world in the most selfless way. Well, Duncan, it's like Lenny Bruce, you know? Yeah, I know Lenny Bruce. But what do you mean? We're all singing, I have the mouth. Yeah, right. That, that, that. Yeah. I think that's, isn't that what you're referring to? Exactly. Yeah. And it's the, you know, dummies like me, like the mic, I like to have the mouth, but the, the, like there's. I'm going to interrupt you with a K. See, this is the K part. K, K. Why are you saying dummies like me? Why did you say that? Well, because like, I think that, that the, the impulse to get it into the spotlight. Yeah. I'm not, I'm so happy it exists because I love movies. I love movie stars. I love performers. I love art. I was just listening to Miles Davis on the way here. So glad that he decided to stay in front of a microphone and make music. Cause he seems like someone who maybe didn't want to necessarily do that. I'm so glad these people exist. I mean, by that, I mean, like he seems so like weirdly reclusive or I don't know. When I'm listening to his music, there's a loneliness in it. It's a different podcast. My point is, and I don't want to emphasize this too much. I just think it's cool to contemplate the behind the scene people. More Oh, more Oh, behind the scene people are interesting. The, uh, like that to me, to me, they're particular. They're very interesting. We, you know, paranoid people tune into this and they call them the deep state or they come up with these really crazy conspiracy theories about these people as being shadowy, dark creatures. But the really, the reason they seem so shadowy and dark, I think, is just because they're like, I don't want to be president. I don't want to be the Buddha. And in fact, I think Dilgo Kinsey, Rinpoche, didn't they have to like, they told him, you need to come out of the cave. Like, wasn't he invited out of the cave and he didn't want to leave? Well, circumstances sometimes transcend one's own intention. Yeah, right. And you, you, um, if you have a general, I think what could unite the O and the K is a sense of service for both. Yes. And, and then you go, you know, you almost would say, let me be where it would be most helpful for me to be in the O realm or the K realm. Or what I think is, you know, there's a lot of art in balancing the O and the K these days where you have some contemplation, but you also manifest in the world. That's, you know, that's kind of my song. Yes. And yes. And that's the second, the second answer to your question regarding like the contemplation of these things and the reality, like most of us, I know of a cave in the forest, but I sure as fuck wouldn't sit there. There's broken glass all over and it's slimy. So I'm not going to a cave. You're, I know most people listening to this probably are not going to go sit in a cave for 20 years. But you could go to your meditation cushion for 20 minutes. And it'll feel like 20 years. Maybe it actually is 20 years, you know, depending. Yeah. Right. I mean, this is to me that like the where too much fixation on the cave stuff and the that part of it can accidentally create a weird sense of guilt. You know, I think some people have a family. They are fully in service to their family. They wake up with their kids. They put the kids to bed by them. They're so tired. They fall asleep. They're, they're going to work to feed the kids. They're engaged in this like purely selfless activity that I think for some parents, it's incredibly pure. And even if it isn't incredibly pure at the base of it is this selfless activity that is no different than the going away down from the cave like Dilgo Kinsey Rinpoche did or that is no different from any of the great servants of the world. But because, you know, I think we live in a culture where the centralization is celebrated that we like love to focus on the apex of things is why there's the Olympics and football and all that, that accidentally a lot of people just at their home serving their kids. They feel like, oh yeah, but I'm not up in a cave like I should be. If you took that parent and that parent did some practice for 20 or 30 minutes a day, that's a powerful cocktail. Yeah, the combo of a combo, one from column A and one from column B. Yeah. You know, seriously, I think it's overlooked how transformative and how potentially good for the whole system and the whole gang of us would be that kind of balance of O and K or deep contemplation, actually skillful action at the same as part of the same equation. I'm totally committed, you could say, to that equation. The at our home at my house, I came home, my brother-in-law is there. He and Aaron are watching like Fox News, which we have managed to cut out mostly, but I sat down to watch it a little bit. They're watching it because they couldn't find their remote control. So, you know, you're sitting there just, you know, talk about the Oracle, right? Like the reason that Dalai Lama's Oracle seems spectacular or is interesting is because it's a human channeling a being. If the Dalai Lama had a special radio that tuned into a radio station somewhere else in Tibet where there was a monk who just told him what to do, it would be cool, but it wouldn't be as interesting, right? So, in other words, we, everyone at their own home has oracular devices. It's not a person, but you flip on the hypno rectangle and you can channel the howl of misery, suffering, violence, fear, and anger in the world right into your house and fill it with a perfume of fear and get it into your body. And so I'm just backing up what you're saying, which is if there is this possibility of slowing down, getting still, and it's not just a one-way street, but in that practice, you're opening up a little bit to something bigger, then you are going to not, you're going to bring not just your own self into the house, but you're going to bring with you just that whatever that is, whatever that is. And that, I think, is, that's what, I mean, that to me is the, you've told me a little bit about the, what are they called? Dralas, I think? Dralas, yeah. Yeah. Can you describe that again, like the house Drala or the? So, Drala is just the notion, well, the literal meaning is beyond aggression. Okay. So, La is above, you know, like Lhasa or Lama, it means above and dry, it means war or aggression. So, what kind of energy field is there beyond aggression? It has a kind of uplifted, fragrant, light quality of energy, you know, it's, you can feel it in certain spots, power spots in nature, you can feel Drala energy. The home has Dralas spots in it. People have Drala, you know, so it's a sort of a general form of understanding the sparkly energy that comes when you stop struggling and fighting so much. Okay. So, it's natural energy and you can tap into it. That's the idea is there's particular Dralas you can tune into with certain rituals and things like that. Whoa. Oh, wow. Like what rituals? Well, like there's one, you use cedar smoke and you raise smoke and then they come down on the smoke. It's, you know, it's a way of organizing rituals, a way of organizing people into a kind of process in which these things, you know, you clear away the deck so that you can invite the Dralas in. But there's a, there's a corollary to it, which is called wind horse, which is a sense of raising one's own energy level. So, when you raise wind horse and, you know, you can just visualize what a wind horse looks like. It's a powerful, uplifted, kind of confident kind of energy. When you rouse that in yourself, because it's there, it's resting, nesting in you, but it's stifled by your doubt and it's stifled by your hyperdiscursiveness and it's stifled by your fear. But when you raise that energy, the Dralas are magnetized and they come. So, you know, it's a way of talking about rousing confidence and, you know, your own energetic field and then it meets the world in a more magical way and a very spontaneous way.

If you have the right conditions, sprinkler, sun, you make a rainbow appear. It's not that complex. You can do it, but it's always incredible. And so that's kind of like what you're like the drawla. It's like a rainbow that appears when you the right conditions are in a certain place. Suddenly you're like, holy shit, what is this? Things do, you know, I have noticed sometimes just not like we'll be playing music and the kids are like I made them breakfast and everyone's eating and like smiling and laughing and it's good. And then this other thing comes in all of a sudden, you know, it's not it is us, but there's something more than us. And then things get really luminous or like there's a quality that's incredible. And you know, my whenever that appears, I notice it and then I want to like, how do we make this out? How do we make the house like this forever? I want it always to be like this. Yeah, there's a lot of letting go involved. Right. You create the right circumstances. You magnetize that kind of energy and then you have to let go is a sort of an important part of the process to but there's drawl is in all kinds of cultures more in the pantheistic cultures, polytheistic cultures, because they don't rivet so hard and there's just one big thing and it's a blob of, you know, all or nothing kind of approach right spirituality. So every like Greek culture had drawl like energies, you know, early Truscan cultures, you can you can see them names for them and everything like that. So they yes, they it just we aren't like in like, in our culture, you even coming close to talking about it, you have to replace it like it's not raising wind horse. It's not contacting some sort of divine energy. It's like getting confident and keep your house clean. And yeah, you know what I mean? Yeah, that's right. If you're manifesting some kind of dignity and, you know, kind of steadiness of mind, state, you know, clear clarity and stability of mind, that that is energizing and magnetizing to the drawl is if you're, you know, course and out of control and kind of out of sequence within yourself and struggling, they're repelled by that. So there was a very interesting thing that I back in the day, I was at a house in Boston, where we're trunk room, which I used to stay and there was a calligraphy there. And it I asked somebody what it meant was Tibetan and they said, and this was when he first came to the West like in 1970, the calligraphy said adult body's children's minds. Wow. That was his take on the West. And then there was a quote from one of his Dharma brothers, Trangur Rinpoche, who was a very great lama. And Trangur Rinpoche said that Trangur Rinpoche, when he came here, he saw that the drawlers had been scared away in America by things like strip mining and just a general lack of regard for the environment and also how people are taking care of themselves. And he said that he instituted a number of practices and rituals that would invite them back. Like what? Well, like raising wind horse and also there are certain sadhana practices where you can tune in. It's like tuning into a frequency. You know, if you and I are sitting together, we go, let's listen to Love Supreme, John Coltrane. We're tuning into that frequency. Right. If we watch porn, we're tuning into that frequency. What if you listen to John Coltrane and watch porn simultaneously? And meditate at the same time. Yeah. Now you've invented a religion. Now you've started a cult. I don't know. I think it's all been done. But lurking beneath what you're saying is it possible to enjoy sense pleasures going back to the ascetic discussion and do that in a non-degraded way, in a way that doesn't make you unhappy, basically, fundamentally. And definitely in Patanthic Buddhism, you have to do that. You're supposed to relate to the realm of the senses. Yeah, right. You can't boycott it. But I think, here, why do sense pleasures so often make you unhappy? Yeah, it depends. I think even if you examine your own reality, you would say you would come up with the answer that it depends. Because have you had a nice cup of coffee this morning? Oh, absolutely. But I'm talking about the easy mistake you can make. I love the description of the skandhas. And I believe the initial skanda was described. And maybe it's the second one. I don't even know the name of the skandhas. But this is the way that the self forms into time, I guess. And so one of the descriptions is a pig rooting around for food. It's like that's the initial skanda. You have some separation, some sense of a thing in the first place. Sense of duality, but it's quite vague in the beginning. Yes. And so you're like snorting around looking for something. And so maybe you found something that was at some point in your life. As we call it chasing the dragon, instead of chasing the dralla, chasing the dragon. You find a thing, oh my god, that's really nice. Like anyone who's ever been addicted to a drug knows what I'm talking about. You know what I mean? You find this thing and it's like, oh my god, I've been looking for this my whole life. This experience is amazing. Wow, I'm connecting with the universe. And then cut to like six months later. And it's like nothing's happening anymore. It's gone from being transcendent and beautiful, which I think is the tantric invitation to being like worse than a course. Course and pointless and embarrassing. And you're like, what am I even doing this for? So it is, I think, interesting to note that a lot of the ways people think that you're going to get that big burst of whatever, it's not working for you at all. And you've been trying over and over again with no success. As you said, cut to, you know, which is we know what we mean there. But that's what contemplation is. In contemplation practice, you cut to, you look analytically, then the outcome that you know is from time in memorial has led to a certain causes. They've led to certain effects. Right. So therefore, through the power of, you know, really applying your intelligence to it, you have enough strength to say, I think I'll take a pass on this at this point. Right, yes. But then you have to marry that to some kind of practice because otherwise the contemplation, you see clearly that it's not, you know, like, for example, the eating buckets of sugar is not great for you. But your body is tuned into it and you can't cut the habit. So you need both the analytical and the sort of rehabilitation part to achieve good habits. And there's such a good thing as good habits, don't you think? Oh, yeah, absolutely. Yeah, sure. I mean, this is, for me, this is why having a family has just been the most enlightening experience in the sense that you hear all the service, you know, service bullshit and like, you know, become a servant or help other people or the meta nonsense. You know what I mean? And if you, at least if you're like me, you're like, all right, I don't know, sounds good, whatever. But then when you have to, when you're, when you have a family, you really, there is a binary, which is like, you can either like be selfish or not. And except when you're the consequence of selfishness in a family versus the consequence of selfishness when you're living by yourself, you can't, what are you, your dog's going to seem like grumpy or something because you're not petting them all the time versus like you're, you know, you're seeing in your kids, like the way your karma is sort of radiating into their lives and imprinting on them. It's a whole different type of mirror. You know, and then also when you just the most basic stuff, the most basic stuff, you know, putting them to bed, making them food becomes the most transcendent experience, you know, and this is where I, from watching the other day, I think it is true. And, you know, we Buddhists can be very analytical and intellectual, but I, I feel especially at this point that if you center in your heart and you drop your energy literally physically into your heart center, you have a very different access point for, for doing the right thing. Yes. And a lot of times people's energy lifts up with wind and it goes into their head. Yes. And moves around kind of quickly in the head and it's harder to, it's harder to find the natural thing to do, the organic thing to do. So that's why stillness, you know, just dropping and dropping into the heart center and simplifying, I think is the essence of everything we've been talking about for years, you know, just slowing down. Everybody's slow down. Can you imagine that if like, if people had to meditate before they bombed each other? I think, sadly, I think some people probably too. Oh God, that's a horrible thought. Yeah, yeah. I mean, yeah, I know, but I do think probably it like gets people's like minds focused enough to be able to, you know, I don't think meditation keeps you from, I don't believe the idea that if everyone meditates, we all have this dream that it's the classic like anyone who's taken acid is like, if only we could get this and imagine the every president taking acid or whatever it may be. And that is a really, I think naive assessment of, you know, like, it's the, it's, I don't think it necessarily is going to cure the world's problems. And then, of course, I've heard that, you know, a lot of people in the military are practiced mindfulness and have been taught mindfulness practices in the Russian military. I would not be surprised. I mean, because they did have science experiments going on for sure about, you know, remote location and things like that, for sure. But I'm not talking about meditating and sort of orchestrating your mental activity. I'm talking about feeling. And I think that's when people go a little deeper into meditation, they realize it's not, it's not just folding the sheets up in your brain, you know, and color coding the underwear of your brain, so that it's all organized and neat. It's what happens if you just touch in and look and feel. You think they're doing that? I don't think all of them are, but I do. I think in some warrior traditions, actually, you kill with love. Like when you're killing, you're killing in your heart. Like you're in your heart. It's the most honorable way to kill is to kill from that place. Instead of killing from your head and being all numb, you are, you have such a respect for the person that you're killing that as you're killing them, you're seeing them as you and you're loving them and doing it. That's not what's happening though, Duncan. What's happening is being driven by speed, aggression and greed and ignorance. 99.9%, don't you think? Yeah, I mean, yes, absolutely. I do. I think like most of the time what you're seeing is people doing something that if they don't do it, they're going to get arrested. You know, we did it. The United States did it. We took a bunch of kids and threw them in the fucking jungle in Vietnam, forced them to go there. They, you know, we like, which to me, I mean, you know, any, I think you see right now, people who are saying in the United States, you really don't have a right to say anything about the fucking what's going on in Ukraine because your country has been doing this shit over and over and over and over again. And for the, you know, anyone in the United States to take issue with what Putin is doing is the height of hypocrisy. I think it's the stupidest take because I've been to the peace marches. I've been to the, like when we tried to stop the war machine and they don't listen to us any more than the people who are trying to stop it and Russia are being listened to, meaning that you are allowed anytime wars spring up because of aggression and greed to be like, this is horrible. Don't do this. Stop doing this. You know what I mean? You would, no matter what country you're in, whether in Russia, the United States, you could, and also you're allowed to recognize like how fucked up it is that a lot of these rushing kids, they didn't know they were going to war and said they're just cannon fodder. And these are, these are all people. So I think you can kind of a universal sense of compassion for all, all sides involved. And I'm not suggesting that like all of them are meditating and stuff. I just know Putin like is a martial artist that he's judo and any, I know. I mean, you know, I've had that conversation and here, here's, here's a kind of caveat around it. Mindfulness alone, you know, the focus point of meditation. See, a lot of people have thought a meditation just means you focus your mind and control, learn how to control your mind. That is very primitive approach towards meditating. If I could say so, it is foundational because if you don't have any concentration, it's hard to cultivate anything. Right. It's hard to cultivate judo or anything. Yeah. But mindfulness alone could make you a perfect assassin. Yes, exactly. I've said that many times, but if you add proportionate to it, if you add loving kindness to it, if you add some kind of compassion practice to it on that foundation, that begins to destabilize that, that sort of colorless quality of mindfulness. And the kind of purely functional part that is so popular in the West. Look at the ads. Oh, this is going to make you calm. This is going to be stable. It's going to make you efficient. It's going to make you productive. You know, that's a very early, you know, stage in the Buddhist path of practice. It's just laying a foundation. It's not a house that you want to live in. No, I know. And, but this, I think this is why Trump Arimpashe was like, had all this cautionary stuff in his teachings because he knew he could tell right away what we are like. He saw what we are like. And adult bodies, children's minds. Yeah, adult bodies, children's minds. But I think he also saw something else in us that was probably for him, which is why when I've seen him speaking at lectures, there's just this lonely quality to him. Not a, not a neurotic loneliness, but like I'm on another fucking planet here. You know what I mean? Like I'm like, he's wearing our clothes and he's trying to like use our language to communicate these ideas. But I just think he wrecked, he was like, Oh my God, if I don't, this could just as easily turn into something people use for eating. There weren't even drones back then or drone pilots back then. But he grogged. This is something that if people decide to stop at the part you're talking about, then now what have you done except created like sociopaths if they want to be, or, you know, or, you know, cause you can hear, you can hear we're all the same person or we're all completely connected. We are, when you see another person, that's just you. They're literally Tong Lin, right? Becoming another. That's what Tong Lin means, right? Like, not exactly. Not exactly. It means exchanging your sense of self absorption with attention and care for others. Like swapping. It doesn't mean you become the other person, right? You're willing to take on some aspect of them that makes you less comfortable. Okay. Give out something. It means sending and taking. Sending and receiving. Yeah. So what are you sending? You're sending out your own, you know, kind of positive feelings about wanting to do well and to be healthy and to thrive. You're sending that to the other person. And what are you taking in is their sense of discomfort, which usually makes you want to avoid them. And you're saying, no, I'm not going to avoid them. I'm going to take it in. Take it in. And that's a big, that's a, like Tong Lin, for example, is a powerful transformative practice that's not like just becoming, you could not become an assassin and do that. Actually, it would stop you from being an assassin. Right. I mean, there's a, I think it's a toll story or this wonderful book called The Kingdom of Heaven is Within. Have you ever heard of this book? But I haven't read it. Well, the book is like a profoundly anti-war essay stating that you cannot be a Christian and a soldier. You can't do it. Onward Christian soldiers. Yeah, exactly. That whole thing, onward Christian soldiers, the Crusades, all of it is an example of, I guess the rather obvious point I'm making, which is religion can be warped in ways that turn it into the most horrible, violent, but insane thing. And Buddhism is no different. Like you can, from a muddied comprehension of it, just as easily decide that there's really like no point. You can go nihilist. I'm just saying from a muddied. Oh, it could be worse than nihilism. It could be imperialism. Right. Which is actually worse than nihilism. Explain that to me. Well, you feel like you have divined a superior perspective, a superior point of view. And from that point of view, for the benefit of beings, I'm going to impose that point of view through manipulation, cleverness, seduction, whatever. But the fundamental self-deception has gone unexamined. Right, that's why it's so dangerous. That's why in our teacher training program that we have at Dharma Moon, we always have self-assessment as the ground practice. Because there's no other way. I could tell you whatever, but somebody else could say, Duncan, unless you would look at yourself and want to know, or I would look at myself and want to know, probably none of these processes can. And that's why Buddhism is not theistic. Nobody can save you. Right. That's a big difference. A lot of religions say somebody could save you if you only just dropped your trial low enough and surrendered or whatever. This energy is going to come and it's going to save you, but Buddhists don't say that. Right. And if you do give somebody that power, you're missing the point. Right. Yeah. And maybe that is the danger of Buddhism is that in that saving yourself an accidental egomaniac and spring up, mania can spring up, right? That's the problem. You can, I'm doing this myself, pulling myself up on my fucking bootstraps. I don't need anybody else. No one saved me. I saved myself. You have to save yourself because I'm not going to. But it's nihilism. That's nihilism. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That is the nihilistic one. And the other one is that some, you don't have to do the deadly squat, but, you know, just open the grace or surrender to whatever and somebody else is going to save you. That's eternalism. So, you know, this is a tricky thing about the Buddhist practices that you don't ally with extremes. If you can identify them. Right. It's non extremism. It's kind of moderation in a way. Right. Yeah. And moderation is a good intersocial practice. Like if you and I are talking, we don't agree. It's good if we be more moderate and try to understand the other person better. It's healthy. But let's go back to the K part, though. We got there right away with that. You know, because that is the, that there is, there is that quality in Buddhism as well, though. I mean, it is a, you know, there is, it is the fucking Mongols were Buddhists. Many of them, they started the Genghis Khan. Would Tibetan Buddhism exist without Genghis Khan? Well, that's, you know, that's, you know, that's not a multiple choice question or yes or no question. But yes, there's no doubt at all that the, and let me just frame this out a different way. What we would call neurosis or confusion. There is no way enlightenment would exist without it. Right. Right, right, right. Yeah. Okay. So that's a, you know, a broader stroke. Now, so what do you do with, I think there's a different levels of how to work with it. One is definitely abandon poison fruit, you know, ground up. If you know something's bad for you or bad for your family or just stop doing it, period, over now, if you can. But then there's idea of transforming and seeing its essence as maybe there's a confusion built into it that could be, could be a knot that could be untied. Right. And then it's just energy, you know, like, like for example, when people are having a good debate, you can say, oh, they're fighting with each other, but they're not actually. Right. Because they haven't stopped communicating. Right. The point where they stop communicating, they start fighting. That's where there's real trouble when they, It is, and everything gets tight and you can feel it, you know, you feel like, and passion is the same thing, right? When you get tightened up with your passion, stuff's flowing between two people becomes, you know, a constricted experience. So the, oh, thing is really important to come in here. Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You got to, oh. Both. Yeah. Both. I just, no, I, you know, I, it's a, it's a, there's something where there's just something I've been thinking lately and it's, and I just can't get it out of my head, which is there's a certain sort of person in the world that could destroy the world. I mean, it's every person, but there's a certain sort of person specifically that can get into a place of power and then cause incredible amounts of suffering from getting into that place of power. There's a personality type, you know, that, that, and it's, we're seeing it play out now. Jealous gods. The jealous gods. Yeah. The jealous gods. And because we, okay, so we know this, people know this, we're aware of it, right? Like people know, and again, I'm not, I'm saying any of them, Putin, Biden, Trump, Obama, any of these dudes who find themselves in the position, who have put themselves in the position with lots of energy, gotten into a position where they have control of nuclear missiles, right? Like any of them are a danger to the planet. The, they're not helping at all. Is that, but I don't mean to interrupt, but is that fundamentally different than, for example, a domestic fight between a husband and a wife? And let's say you had a little red button that you could push and your wife would blow up. Yeah, right. Would you finger not be hovering over that sometimes? Well, no, I mean, everyone has that. This is like everyone has in their stupid domestic arsenal, like the thing that you pull out, that's the big mean thing. And then they'll pull out a meaner thing and then you have a stupid nuclear war fight. You have to go to marriage counseling to repair the radiation from it. You know what I mean? So yes, I know what you mean. Exactly. Yeah, that's a good point. I mean, it's in, it's in all of us, but But who are these people and how did they get so powerful over the whole situation? And is there a way to like defang it's like poison. Is there a way to defang it? That's really a great question. That's to me, I think that that that's, you know, even more imminent than, I guess you could say they're interconnected really, because a lot of these people happen to be connected to oil. But more intimate than dealing with the climate stuff is like recognizing like, wait a minute, we have created a system that is up pushing up to the very top or the front of the bus, the craziest among us. And once they get control of the bus, it doesn't matter if they've been like, let me drive y'all are a little drunk. Where do you want to go? Don't worry. I'll take you where you want to go. Sure. Pretty soon. It's like, wait, we said right. And they're like, yeah, we're going to do a little fucking detour because I'm driving the bus. You know what I mean? And so I'm just saying like this. I still think though that that's basic ego is who's doing that. Right. And you're just on a very large scale with it at the moment. Yes. But that exact dynamic is at work in every situation that I experienced during the day. All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, wait, I thought we're going over here. No, we're going this way. And so I'm not saying this is a glib answer and a kind of new agey kind of answer to like, what do you do with global titans who are like, you know, every day we're watching the horror, horror show. And I just, I've been really upset lately. I'm sure everybody's been upset just watching. How could somebody do that? You know, how could somebody say, yeah, send tanks into this relatively peaceful place and just start blowing the shit out of everybody? Yeah. What logic? The how and new or do you have to be to human suffering to even and then create a whole set of propaganda and lies around that? You know, what's going on with that person? What the hell, man? Right. Well, they they're there. I think I know what's going on with those people. Like, you know, when you I don't know if you ever went hunting as a kid. But like, well, you have to learn how to kill animals. You know what I mean? You don't you don't want to do it. Like you have to learn to do it. And then you can do it. You if you will, you know, and so I think it's just the exact same thing, but with people for them, like they don't really think like we like there's a humanist. Like I there's a lot of idealism in people like us where but in that there's this weird assumption that well, it's the heart of everyone is this. But maybe you are you know, the thing you might be onto there and it's, you know, is the predator prey model. Yeah. Which are you going to be? Right. Right. That you talk to certain warriors, they're really tuned into that model. Yeah. Look, it's me or that one. And if you're going to be one or the other, be the predator. So I know some very intelligent people who argue that point of view, but a bodhisattva would not argue that point of view. Right. I'm not saying that we should argue that there's only one choice or the other. I'm just saying, well, wait a minute, though, we should make sure we didn't overlook the possibility that there's something to it. I do think that it's safe to acknowledge that there are some very mentally ill people who have managed to work their way into political systems that don't belong there. And that this is one of the grand flaws of democracy is that it is like, or just the thought, the flaw of whatever is inside tribalist. Like the try the idea of it. We need a chief. We need a head. We need the top. We need a daddy. You know what I mean? I think we need a guru. We need a blah, blah, blah or this or that or someone to save us. We need to end this idea of needing someone to save you. That is the fertile ground for dictators. Right. And for the predator prey model to really achieve full force. Exactly. So here's another thought is like, if you go into that model and you say, well, we as people, we as the people are the prey right now. So maybe we need to learn about being more of a predator. Yeah. I mean, yeah. And that that's the K part. Yeah. Right. How do you get into the machinery and, you know, kind of create some kind of more positive attitude towards leadership? And I, you know what I think the answer to that is, is it's just what you were saying earlier. It's like, look, you're, you're, especially if you're in the United States, what are you going to do? Go to Russia and like run for the run to be the new food and like stop. You're not doing anything. But I do know when I'm being Putin in my own house, you know what I mean? It's like all these world peace, all these people yapping about world peace. It's like, have you been able to achieve any kind of harmony in your family or your own domestic situation? Because if you, if you're finding that you can't do it there, then forget the, we're all fucked. You know what I mean? That no one can do it if you can. It's like, well, that brings it right back Duncan to, you know, small, conquering through the small, like it says in the Yicheng, you know, taming through the small. And if you at least preserve the hegemony of your own little domestic kingdom and your own world and improve your relationship to it through practice, through study, through, you know, learning about compassion and learning about, you know, what tools you have available to even pull that much off. I think it does have a ripple effect. I take that view that it has ripples. Some people might say it's useless because it's too small. No, it ripples. It does, it does ripple. I don't think it necessarily ripples in the way a lot of us would want to imagine it's going to ripple. But I do think that no matter, like no matter what, it's still great. I mean, no matter what, it's, you know, if, if, yeah, okay, great. If we all hit a certain frequency, then the whole planet turns into Shambhala vibrates out of this part of the time space continuum and appears in a paradise world or whatever. Great. I don't think that's going to happen. Or if things become increasingly chaotic, you, you are going to be one of the people who helps, you know, you don't know how you're going to help or what it's going to look like. But if you're training up now, you know, and then, because that's who I would want to be. If I was, if I had to be something, I wouldn't want to be the person dropping the bombs, you know, I would, you know, what it might come to though, is when you saw that loneliness factor, when you saw Tung Brumichey, you saw he looks very lonely alone. That's a real quality of warship. The way we learned it, you have to be willing to be alone. Yeah, very, very deep way. And that means, you know, nobody's going to confirm or deny your perspective. It means you're not going to get a medal. Yeah. It means maybe nobody even knew that you existed or did it. Yeah. But you still have a feeling of like, I'm going to do this the right way. Yeah. I'm going to do the right thing. But that's, that's a very personal level of integrity. And then, you know, I think you can cultivate and train in that perspective. I do. Oh, that's so nice to hear. Yeah. Because I, you know, I, One can. I didn't mean you personally meant one can. But I know, I think we all, I think, but that's why I mentioned this stuff earlier, because I think there's something really quite, and again, it's just great. Maybe it's creating a romantic reason to meditate and stuff. But I do think like, if you imagine that we are all Christian soldiers. No, but if you do, if you do imagine that there is like, is that the O and the K and there is conflict. And that there, there is a sort of like an interesting back and forth conversation, I guess you could say happening between a very like two seemingly opposite ways of living in the world, then you can immediately join up and immediately join up. But like what you're saying is you're not going to meet, you probably won't meet the generals. You probably won't meet any sergeants, lieutenants. No one's coming out of a cave to give you a jewel that is magical because you decided to join the part of the world that's trying to cultivate compassion or whatever. And the reason for that, aside from probably there aren't people living in caves that we're going to give you jewels, but the bigger reason would be strategically an army that has no commanders, no King, no visible upper echelon doing the plans, but it's just completely decentralized and yet fully in the world and present is undefeatable. There is no way to stop it. Use any of the techniques that work if you're on the other side, which is on that side of things, the conversation is, oh, I'll just blow it up. Poison it, kill it. But who are you going to capture? Who's out there? There isn't anyone other than this basic intent, right? A basic undefeatable intent, which if you tune into that, that is signing up for something, I think. Well, that's a phenomenal world. You can have it. Why not? A medal? Sure. Why not? Right. Medals are dumb anyway. You can dress up the world. We've talked about it a number of times on our conversations, but absolute and relative truth. The word for relative truth, which is kun-sup, means all dressed up. Kun-sup, K-U-N-D-Z-O-P. It literally means you put on the outfit, you put on your vest, you take your canteen, you go for a walk in the woods, you buy your hunting cap, you subscribe to magazines, but you don't confuse it with some kind of definitive level of reality. It's just a relative situation. Yeah, but you do work with it. If you don't engage kun-sup, and that goes back to the Buddha, those people were not engaging kun-sup. They didn't have a good sense of relative reality. They were going for absolute truth, and that's considered the imbalance from a certain perspective. So if you can keep both levels braided, that would be a very powerful way to live. Braided is what they say? I'm saying it. That's so cool. They say inseparable, and absolute relative truth are inseparable. But braided is the way to think about it. So, and it's O and K. You have your mantra. David, these are some talks. I just love chatting with you. Thank you so much for coming on the show. I just really love talking to you. Thank you. Yeah, it's, you know, I have a kind of rule talking to Duncan, which is that we always start from zero and end at zero. I know. I was ruined, too, because I had a couple of serious questions I was going to ask you, and then I realized, don't do that. Like, let's just talk and see what happens. I'm so glad I did that instead. David, I know, can you tell people a little bit about what's coming up with Dharma Moon and ways they can connect with you? Yeah, there's such a sweet magic between Dharma Moon and Duncan Dressel. It's really notable that, you know, some of your friends come and take our trainings and then reenter your ecosystem. And they're such good people, Duncan. It's so honest what's going on there, and it's, you know, not, we're not conquering the world or changing anything, but we are teaching people how to work with their own state of mind and being a little more gentle and compassionate with themselves and more precise. So that, the main form that crystallizes into is this teacher training program that, you know, a lot of the folks have taken. We have one coming up starting May 18th. So if you just go to DharmaMoon.com, you can log in there. And the first weekend of it is, if you're not ready to sign up for the whole thing, you just take the first part of it. And we're doing it not on weekends in the summer. You know why? Why? I think people want their weekends back this summer. Yes. I don't want to steal their weekend on front of a computer. So we're doing it Wednesday and Thursday mornings. Wow. Okay, cool. And also it's set up so that in European time, we have a lot of people starting to come in from Europe. So it'll be like four or five o'clock European time. But if folks are working, how can they, they can't participate? Well, nobody works that way anymore. Okay. Thank you. You know, I mean, we'll see, but it's 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Eastern time, which is 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. Okay. West Coast time. So, okay, you did that before you went to work. Yeah. Or you took them a couple of mornings off. And then in Europe, it's, you know, four or five o'clock. So you finish your work day and you end a little bit early and you still have your evening with your family and friends. And you have your weekends free in the summer. Love it. So we're, it's all indicated in the, if you go to damamoon.com and maybe we can put it into the chat, into the, you know, written thing. So I'd love to just continue the tradition, the grand tradition of the Dunkites invading Dharma Moon is and then sending them back with a little training. I love it. So please everybody just, just check us out. And if you have any questions, you can, it's easy to write in and there's, you know, there's payment plans and scholarships. We're trying to make it easy for people to do this. Thank you so much, David. All the links, if you can't remember, damamoon.com will be at dunkitrustle.com. Thank you, David. I really appreciate it. And I feel like I just stayed a plump. Yeah, me too. You know, Duncan, you're really a sweet person. Thank you. I know, I know that you get pissed off at times and so forth, but I think your heart is really, it's really good, Duncan. Thank you, David. You're the best. Howdy, Christina. Thank you. That was David Nickturn, everybody. Take his class. Go to damamoon.com.

Now, everybody, please welcome to the Dunkin, Trussell, Fabley Hour podcast, the great Steven Kotler. It's the Dunkin, Trussell, Fabley Hour podcast. Hi! Hi! Hi! Hi! Hi! Hi! Hi! Hi! Hi! Hi! Hi! Hi! Hi! Hi! Hi! Hi! Hi! Hi! Hi! I just have to tell you another story first. Okay. I live in the middle of nowhere. And, as you know, middle of nowhere, technology doesn't work exactly the way it works for most people. So, my Siri, which has a voice activation thing, it took forever for that to actually get set up. And it finally came online last week! I've had my iPhone for five years but, finally, the voice activation software kicks in and I can have conversations. Cool. And I realized this and I'm like, holy crap, I can ask Siri questions like all over the place. I'm going to be like, hey Siri, no any good jokes. And so, I did this. Yes. Right? And mind you, at the time I'm doing this, I'm writing this new book with Peter DeMandis, talking about the dangers of AI, questions about like, right, all this stuff is on my consciousness. Hey Siri, no any good jokes? This is what Siri says to me. Bartender says, we don't serve time travelers in here. So a time traveler walks into a bar. Shit, man. It's fucking with us. I know. That's what I'm saying. The matrix is waking. Yeah, it's really starting to wake up and there's going to be a mischievous period, that's for sure. Oh my god. I was like, oh my god, I am totally being fucked with by a conscious AI. This is so good. You especially, man. I mean, you've got to be on not just human radars, but on AI radars. You're so out there and what you're talking about is probably somewhat influencing the development of these things, for real. Maybe a little. A little. Okay, well, welcome back to the DTFH, Steven. Thank you so much. I've been really looking forward to this conversation and here's some flattery real quick. Of all my guests, man, I think about the stuff we've talked about the most, I think. Like you popping in my head all the time. Oh, that's so nice. Thank you. And thank you for writing this book. This is so right up my alley, man. I knew it was. I knew it would be. Yeah. I totally knew you were going to dig it. So I just want to start off, man, on page 102 of this book, somehow you just tuned in to so many of my favorite things and I was wondering if, do you have the book in front of you? Yeah. I've got it to 102. So where do you want me to start? It starts with last tango and cyberspace says Lorenzo and then, and then, and then if you don't mind just end on the lion finishes the stands and with that awesome Wadi quote. Got it. All right. This is the first time I've done a reading from last time. The very first reading. Here we go. Awesome. Page 102. Last tango and cyberspace says Lorenzo. I don't know that phrase. Cyberspace, the noosphere of the internet, William Gibson called it a shared consensual hallucination. Shared being the critical part. No sharing, no communication, no communication, no cooperation, no cooperation, no empathy. Game over. An AI that makes sharing information impossible as NEM tracker, you should get this. Last tango and cyberspace says lion, the end of something radically new. Copy that. Lion, by the way, is the protagonist. An open air bus passes by the bench. These tourists wearing wireless headphones and VR glasses with opaque lenses. Their heads point in the same direction, like something out of 1984. The people you called asked lion. Anyone mentioned Moa Dib? Hector quoted from the collected sags of Moa Dib. He did ask lion. Do you remember which one? Give me a sec. I wrote it down in my moleskin. One of the ones I gave you asked lion, the notebooks were Lorenzo's birthday present last year. Have you become a convert? Completely. First class on the way over to Tokyo, which was a miracle. One of those private rooms and women in short skirts, bringing me drinks and actual waterford. Halfway through my second walker blue, I realized that somebody needs to turn apocalypse now into a blues opera. I filled a whole notebook, a blues opera, the horror, horror blues, grounds, which Moa Dib sang. I'm still looking. Lion hears pages turning, cigarettes smoking, more pages, got it. This is a transitory experience. It is never consistent. It depends in part upon the myth-making imagination of humankind. Lion finishes the stanza. The person who experiences greatness must have a feeling for the myth he is in. Wow, congratulations that I came through you. Holy shit, man. You covered in that Dune, Moleskine notebooks and William Gibson and made it an apocalypse now. An apocalypse now. It made it all work. It's not just like you're grabbing cool shit. This is really an accomplishment, man. Cyber, this is great. I wonder if you could tell me what that quote means to you, the person experiencing greatness must have a feeling for the myth he is in. What does that mean to you? Well, I mean, on a simple level, right? Cultural context matters, right? And in a really simple level, you've just got to know what game you're playing at what particular time, right? And what's the right note and what's the wrong note? Let's totally take it out of out of this context and let's just talk about it in comedy in a way that like we can deflate it of all. So Dave Chappelle, I'm just thinking about his, the three Netflix specials, the second one where he comes out and says, tells that joke and says, you know, I've got this barrel of punchlines I write down and I grab one out and I read it and I decide that I'm going to integrate it into night show. So the one I grabbed today says, and I punch her on the pussy, right? Yes. Which is the most insane. And then I punched her on the, I mean, like, how do you even say that out loud? Let alone get away with it. Yeah. David Chappelle, and he knows the myth that he's in. He's both David Chappelle and he's David Chappelle inside the myth of David Chappelle, which has different outrageousness bounds than most other people's myths. So Dave Chappelle can do that, right? If I go up on stage and I try to tell it, he punched her in a posting joke, right? Like, I'm in the wrong myth. Yeah, that is certain. Like it's just like, so that's a really like small, weird, you know, not a grandiose level. But I think, you know, one of the things a lot of people talk these days a lot about like, you hear these terms like cultural architecture as if you could steer culture if that was even possible. And I don't, I'm not actually sure that's possible, right? Like, I'm much more of a Darwinianist. I think there's too much complexity and randomness in the system that you can even steer. And like, it doesn't go that way. But I do think that the people who have showed up and managed to make some level of significant, magnificent change, a Gandhi, a Martin Luther King, you know, though that that level of impact, they knew exactly how to play the game. And what they what they figured out is the Rostas did this. There's a lot of Rastafarian stuff in last tango and cyberspace, right? Yeah. And one of the questions, one of the reasons is I'm interested in the question of how beliefs and religions get assembled and the Rastafarian faith was built in plain sight over the past hundred years where most religions were constructed out of sites. You can't even see them. The Rastas, you've got to sort of watch it. But like their their faith was a reaction to the worst kind of socio political classism in Jamaica, right? They were at the bottom economic period in a very stratified class society where there was no way to get there was no way they were going to claim power from anyone. Right. So what did they do? They inverted the whole thing and they said, we're going to make garbage sacred. We're going to take the very everything you've rejected. Yeah. And we're going to turn that into heaven and say everything else is Babylon. Yeah. That was the myth they were in, right? They played a very, they knew exactly what game they were playing and how to win. And it worked, right? They not only did that faith lift tons of people out of poverty, it actually managed to help split apart shape Jamaica's class consciousness. It launched the punk movement. It launched the hip hop movement. It shaped so much global culture, but it started with somebody playing inside a very specific myth is what I was thinking. Whoa, OK, that's cool. Wow. Yeah. And this, this one of the things I love about this is that it happens. This is not bullshit. Like this is one of the things our species definitely does. It's from time to time. A bubble emerges that changes everything, at least in, you know, it could either globally change everything or certainly in countries, there's, I don't know, every country has these people who shifted it permanently. And so I love that because we are, that implies that in the same way, prior to the discovery of electricity, there was still electricity. And similarly, in this very moment, we're always just teetering on the edge of another one of these people popping up, and except now they're going to pop up with the amplification of technology. You know, when the Buddha gained realization, think how long it took for that meme spread. Yeah. And that to me is the these two things. This is like the, um, an electrical cord dangling over a puddle of water. It's that we're all in the water and it's just a matter of time before that son of a bitch drops. And when I got a vision, ever been in a bus and no breaks. Yes, man. Everyone in a bus and no breaks, but I'll tell you, somebody's going to start driving the bus and, and, and we, we all know that's coming. And so we, you know, you hear this like over and over and over again, every religion. You've got the matriarch. You've got the second coming of Christ. You've got in every world religion. There's this, it's coming. Another thing's coming. Somebody's coming down the pipes and it's like, sure, what, what was that? Maybe they were smoking DMT out in the desert. Maybe it's just, you know, the babbling of people from the antiquated dusty past. But this same story is being told by technologists by it's the book you're writing right now, which is somebody's coming. You better get ready. Well, yeah, I mean, you know, so this was something we poked at in stealing fire and this is really common, right? Like people start having in altered states of consciousness because the part of your brain that calculates time, right? That separates past from present and future and prefrontal cortex is shut down. Right. So everything you're plunged into the eternal present, the deep now, this is the psychological term, but it has this feeling of immediacy, right? So this is a problem for, say creatives, because a compositor will get into flow and they'll have a vision of an opera and they'll think, oh, this is amazing. I'll be able to scratch it down and be done in a couple of weeks and it'll come back to reality. It takes fucking 10 years to write, right? Or it's Wagner's the ring cycle that takes 40 years to write a damn thing. Kind of thing. So that is one problem for creatives, but it happens all the time with apocalyptic cults, people get in and they, they see something is coming and they think it means right now. And suddenly you're Daniel Pinchbeck writing a, Daniel is a smart guy, friend of mine, great writer. And then he wrote 2012 because he did a bunch of drugs in the jungle and violated rule one, which is don't do a bunch of drugs in the jungle and decide the world is coming to an end because it's probably not, right? Like bad idea. Didn't work so well for Terrence McKenner. Didn't work so well for Daniel Pinchbeck. And it's not working. It's not going to work well for the Silicon Valley dudes who are doing drugs at Burning Man going, oh my God, the AI apocalypse is not going to, no, probably not, not so much. Well, it is. Yeah. You're talking about that rule is Robert Anton Wilson's rule, which is maintain agnosticism. You cannot get pulled in to the siren song of the, who, whichever it is, the DMT elf style, a wasca goddess or whoever over there is telling you, get ready, strap it. Cause if you do your, it's embarrassed. It's innately embarrassed. I mean, like, I, you know, I, I just tell people, and this is, this is a rule with flow. And I mean, you know this from, from comedy, I'm sure. Don't trust the dopamine, right? Don't trust the dopamine. Don't like, when you're high as a kite, right? You're in a deep flow state. Like I tell people, don't go shopping in a flow state because you'll buy everything because it looks good. Yeah. Don't start, right? Don't trust the mega millennia that comes with these states of consciousness. It's built in like the ego goes away and when it comes back, it comes back ferocious. And it wants to say, oh my God, you're the only motherfucker who's ever had a vision. You're the one who's right. Yeah. Not everybody. You're really like, what are the odds? Yeah, the odds are zero. Uh, the odds are you're having a manic episode and it's time to like get some help and that's okay. I know plenty of people, to me, the manic episode that comes from these things, it's like, some people get embarrassed by, I have more than a few friends have gone in there, come back with a big message, very excited about it. And then, you know, that they were able to cool their brain down a little bit. Now they're fine, but it's just good to recognize that the, the odds of you being picked to transmit some, you're not more deep. All right. Just forget it. It's a relief by the way. And also, uh, that being said, though, um, we're all more deep. And this is a story that a Ramdas tells, which I love, which is his brother got committed. He was put in a mental asylum and, uh, Ramdas went to visit his brother's after he got him back from India. This is beard Ramdas with the, you know, he was doing the whole like, um, aesthetic wandering, uh, Indian saint character. And he, his brother, they found him in an apartment surrounded by senior citizen women who all thought he was Jesus and he had convinced them that he was Jesus. And so he said to Ramdas, look at you, you dress like Jesus. Do you have a beard like Jesus? Why are you out there and I'm in here? And Ramdas said, well, the reason you're in here and I'm out there is because you think you're the only Jesus. And I think everybody's Jesus. That's the difference. That's pretty good. It's cool. It's cool. That's good. And I have heard, you know, I don't normally hear a Ramdas story you like. You're like, Oh, wow, I really like this one. He's great. You got to listen to more stories. There's some good ones, but there's another story. It's not a Ramdas story. And I think it could be an urban myth because it's so incredibly unethical. But supposedly they took a bunch of people having this messianic fantasy that they're Jesus and put them together in a room to see what happens. If you get five people, you think they're Jesus in the same room with other Jesuses. I read about that. No, they, this, I don't know who did this. I remember this experiment and they didn't, they couldn't believe it. They, I used to argue with one another, right? They couldn't, nobody would give up the throne, basically. Everybody else is the imposter Jesus. They're all the devil. I'm the real Jesus. This is a bunch of bullshit. And so this to me is the wait a minute, this is great reality television. Why hasn't the show been made? Because it's this I watch this. I would watch. I mean, I've never seen reality television show. I don't know, but like this, like I'm the real Messiah. Oh, God, ten Messiahs in a house and see what happens. America's top Jesus, ten Jesuses enter one Jesus come out. It's the real Jesus. They have to do like contests, you know, walking on water, the classics, you know. But raising the dead, raising the dead. That's one of the problems is like one of the one of them actually can raise the fucking dead. But but the dead is they're still sick or something. Like, you know what I mean? They get raised the dead, but they're still sick from rotting. The the. So but this to me is like when I think about like the sort of like perceived problem. Like one of the problems right now is that we're experiencing something that's being called radicalization, which is that, you know, people are getting sucked into various like reality tunnels on the interwebs. And and then the people are giving or in these reality tunnels are all distorted and warped and weird. And so then these people start getting the real sense that they need to be a hero. They need to be Jesus. They need to save the world. And so then these heroes go out and they do, you know, we just saw what fucking happens, you know, these people who think of themselves as as as doing something that had to be done. When, in fact, they just got pulled into a sick echo chamber with sort of exponentially amplified distortions of truth that led to them freaking the fuck out. And so to me, this is the problem is that we have yet to realize that we're all we if we're going to if we're going to do this, it needs to be more of a decentralized, my silly old Jesus, so to speak, you know, a sum total game where we're all sort of converging together. Rhizomal Jesus. What's that? Rhizomal Jesus. Can you tell me that's the in the old days? I'd be like, I'd nod my head like I knew. Rhizomes are the the the structures that fungi networks put out. Oh, so they're the you use the mycelium, right? So I just went one level. I went down into the biology of the mycelium. You're right. It's a rhizome, not mycelium. The mycelium is not. Yeah, we need a rhizomal Jesus. And that's that's. And when you and when you think about it, that's to me. If there is going to be another of these things that pops up, it's going to be a collective. Because, I mean, on I'm a little bit of a conspiracy theorist, and I imagine that if somebody did appear that was clearly too charismatic and somehow antithetical to whatever system is being supported by, you know, folks who have a vested interest in keeping it going, that person is not going to they're not going to last that long. They're going to be shut down pretty quick, I would think. It's an interesting I mean, it's an interesting question. How do you how do you keep that stuff down? And what when it can go global so fast? I what's what's interesting to me, there's two side. There's two things that I think one is on the. Proscriptive side on like what's the problem? I think one of the problems and I and it's sort of like the difference between kind of punk culture in the 90s, which was really like never beat your chest and millennial culture, millennial culture, they like I so the flow research collective, like the first rule is have a passion and purpose and keep it to your damn self. Cool. And I like I like I'm not like I'm not interested in millennial culture seems to like think somehow if you've got a passion or a purpose like everything lead with it. My name is Stacy and I'm here because I want to save the world. Yeah. And I come from a generation like like we care about execution, what have you actually done? Right. And it's very easy to once you because sort of I have this passion, I have this purpose and then I do this drug and that combination together tends to produce that reaction when your value system is not the lip service you pay to your passion, but the actual thing you do in the frickin world that's what matters. It tends to like, you know, the ego gets checked by the actual action that's required. So I think like one thing is sort of worth pointing that out. And by the way, the other thing is just in general high performance goal setting theory, like there's really good evidence that says if you set high hard goals and you'd like to accomplish them, keep them to yourself because the minute you say it out loud, your brain, you actually get dopamine from saying the like high hard goal that you want to accomplish out loud. So your brain goes, Oh, you've already gotten the reward for accomplishing the thing that you were trying to do. So you have less motivation to do it. So like, first of all, if you actually mean your passion and purpose, keep it to your damn self because you have a better chance of actually getting their basic psychology, high performance theory, like not the other thing is like, I think it tends to produce this kind of megalomania when you couple this, this passion and purpose value that millennial culture seems to have and it's spread everywhere, like spread in business. I get into business meetings. I'll get on the phone with somebody and they'll be like, my name is Michael and I'm a lawyer and I came out of Harvard and blah, blah, blah. And my passion is, and I'm like, the fuck are you telling me your passion for? Like I'm trying to do business with you. Like you're a fucking lawyer. I'm trying to hire you to a contract. I don't care what your fucking passion is. I care if you can execute a goddamn contract. Fuck you, right? I mean, like, I have to listen to this. Kill me now. Yeah. The word's so passion. Why are you calling it up? Don't even call it a passion. Come up with another word for it. Like not a passion. Do the thing after you're done doing the thing. I'm going to pay the fucking attention. Yeah, like. Yeah, that's cool. No, see, first, I think you have to discover relativity. Then you get to brag about discovering relativity. That's just sort of the way I was taught. Well, yeah, well, this is. And this is like that you were taught, right? And the problem is this. People have people really can feel their potential, I think. Well, I agree with you. You could you could feel it in you and it's real. And you know, it's real, even though you might be looking around at your life and it's just a wreck. You could feel this thing in you and you know, holy shit, I could do this. The problem is the birthing process of getting that feeling out of you and into the world in a way that's consistent and creates some kind of change that is quantifiable is can be a very long, painful, difficult, lonely process and fucking boring, too. This isn't a montage. This isn't like the movie where they play the pop music and the thing it's done. This is boring. It's like it's a grind sometimes. It's so funny. I was I was having a discussion. I don't remember where I was, but somebody asked me. I've got a class out right now called the habit of ferocity. And it's not about it's every I call it everything but the flow. And it sort of emerged out of this realization that peak performers do a bunch of stuff, motivation, grit, primarily stuff, intuitively, that sort of like most other people don't do. And somebody wanted to know, what is peak performance? Actually, what does it look like? And I was like, what is it? It looks like a checklist. Looks like you wake up in the morning, you got 10 things to do and you get it all done and you're proud. You gave every one you gave your best to. And then it looks like the same thing the next day and the next day and the next day. And the difference is that's what it looks like for years. Yeah, in a row. Like that's what peak perform. That's what best of the best looks like. It looks like a damn checklist where at the end of the day, you're like, did it again? Everything on my checklist is checked off and tomorrow you do it again. And tomorrow, that's what it looks like. I mean, the things on the checklist may be sexier. You know what I mean? It may not be mop the floor. It may be, you know, create a robot AI or, you know, they may be sexier things. Yeah, it's just a fricking checklist. That's not this. Yeah. And it's not real. That's to me. Yeah, I do. But I think I had to sort of like give up a lot of conditioning. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Totally. Like, no, that was like one of the one of the hardest realizations for me. And they say this is one of the realizations you sort of make in your late 20s. Like there's an adult development transition stage between 27 and 30, where one of the things you realize is like, your life is going to be nothing more or less than what you make of it. Yeah, like you are actually driving the bus. And if you don't decide to like sit down and actually take responsibility for all of it and work hard, like it's not going to happen for nobody. The fairytale doesn't happen every now and again. You end up with Brad Pitt's abs in Thelma and Louise. Like it happens, right? But it turns out even Brad Pitt, like he was like, even he was smart enough to go. Okay, look, I got great abs. So I got the part, but then I fucking busted my ass at that part and kept like worked really hard after, right? The great abs may get you a break. You may get your, you may get a lucky break once or twice, but it's all about can you execute and execution is, can you do the checklist today? Can you do it tomorrow? Can you do it the day after that? Can you do it when you're hungover and you're tired and you're fighting with your girlfriend? Can you do it when you have a broken arm? Yeah. Can you do it when you're in the hospital? Can you do it after they've stolen your favorite teddy bear? Right? Like that's, that's what matters, right? Yeah, that's how you do it. That's how we know. But here's the thing, judge a tree by its fruit, as our Lord said, you have produced so much good stuff. It's not like you're spitting out crap, man. It's like you have your prolific and you're just blasting. Oh, I guess I'll just write a legendary fucking cyberpunk sci-fi now. What? And you liked it, by the way. You liked it, huh? What the fuck? No, but this is to me like the, I don't know, you know, it's like a lot of people who have a system that they claim can put a person, like an upshift a person's life. It's a weird thing when you look at what they've produced and you realize like, yeah, they wrote some books, but all the books are on the system of upshifting a life. You know what I mean? What else did you do? Where's the other stuff in there? Not that that's not enough. But man, you've like, this is so cool, you know, because it's like this is just by the way, this is so, you know, my first book is a novel. Now, you know, I do remember you telling me that, but I am not familiar with that one. It's so nobody's familiar with it. And so it has a, it was a bestseller and it has a very like devoted cult following. But let's be totally forthright. Not as here. It's not a very good book. I did not have control of my craft. It was a big idea. It's really cool. There's great stuff in it. It's not a great book. And then I wrote two more books that are sitting in drawers. Two novels. And then I went, okay, you know what? I don't have the skill. I don't have the craft. I don't have the, I can't do this. And I switched to nonfiction, wrote nonfiction for eight books. And so like when I came back to last tango, A was was something to prove, right? Cause I had sort of gotten my, I hadn't been able to do this thing, right? So I really wanted to get it right. And I also, um, you know, I wanted to write a fun cyberpunk thriller, Neil Gaiman, William Gibson kind of, cause those dudes weren't like, most of them stopped writing them, right? Gibson was writing, but he would get a book every five years. And which is too slow for me. I like his chip too much. And the other guys, Stevenson went into hard science fiction. He's a hundred years in the future. He's an outer space, Neil Gaiman wrote Neverwhere, which was sort of on the straddle line and now he's doing straight up fantasy. And like, I'm not interested in Norse God science fiction and I'm not interested in a 300 years from now in a galaxy far, far away. I'm curious, but like, I, like I was always, what I liked about those guys is they gave me a look at the world five years from now, seven years from now. Like, what am I living into? And, you know, Blade Runner was an incredibly useful movie for my entire generation, cause it let us know what we were living into in it. And right. And we're still living into that though. I always point out that the Blade Runner Blade Runner was set in 2019. So I don't think LA is going to look like Blade Runner LA, but I think Tokyo might actually look like Blade Runner LA. Well, I'll take the flying fucking cars. I'll tell you that, man, you can't get around LA anymore. It's done. It's over. I just try to find, by the way, I was, that's opening chapter of the new book. I'm writing with Peter Diamandis is set at the Uber flying car conference. Uber flying car, autonomous taxis in LA by 2023. Thank God. Thank God. It's, it's crazy. I can now, I can get, I get, I'm not allowed, damn it. I have to keep saying this. I'm not allowed to talk about it. I can get to work. It's like, you know, I can get to work not like eight miles away from my house on my bike faster than in my car. And that's nuts to me. That's insane that I can do that. That's crazy. I mean, I, I left LA. I, the other reason, well, the main reason I was in LA was the surfing. And when I started to realize that like, I took the wrong turn or went at the wrong hour and I was like, I could, it could take me four hours to get home from Malibu. And I was just like, I can't like, this is not okay. Like this, nobody should live like this. All that time, man. All that time is just getting sucked up. And the other, the other thing is this, like there's in the field of positive psychology, we've advanced to the point that like, there's certain things we can say for sure. Like we've, the data is in, we're solid on this. And one of them is one of the biggest hits you quality life takes this traffic. There's no coming, like there's reams of data that says we don't do well with being stuck in traffic. It's not good for us. Yeah. And there's no, your podcasts, right? Or audio books are the best fix. Anybody's gotten for it. And it's a, it's a good fix, right? If you're stuck in traffic, those are fantastic. Yeah. I love it because it means that I've got this great LA market for audio books. This is fantastic. God bless gridlock. I appreciate it. Yeah. But no, I mean, like, you know, it's just, it's a quality of life hit. No shit, man. And, and, but, and this is the, and yeah, you can, you could sit in your car and listen to audio books, which I used to do, but it's not, it's like you're stuck in a metal bubble surrounded by miserable people, all varying degrees of awareness that something seems to have gone completely off kilter in our culture. That this is even happening. Most of them know I didn't need to go to where I went. I could have done it at my house. Why did I go there? It's like, we're doing that thing. Like, um, in the dawn, this is a very weird reference, dawn of the dead. There, all the zombies are wandering through the shopping mall. Some of them are like trying to play hockey. Some of them are, you know, it's not, it's obviously not about zombies, that movie. It's about consumer culture and the hypnotic trance. A lot of us have gotten into, but one of them was looking at the zombies, one of the survivors and it's like, they've gone to, they, they're just doing what they were familiar with. And it seems like historically something happened where we had to go to offices. We had to be together. There was no phone. There was no way to instantly communicate like this. And so we all gathered together in these fucking offices. And then we do shit that we could have done at home. And the price of that is, of, I guess, inhaling each other's goddamn pheromones is that the fucking ice caps are melting because we want to breathe each other's farts. We want to breathe each other's post lunch farts in these offices. So it's a, it's a little bit of a mess. And this is why I'm encouraged by the advancements that are happening in technology. And I wonder if you could tell me which, and I don't want to turn you into Nostradamus here, but in this book, which of these technologies do you think we're the most likely to see first without giving the interest to everything in last tango. Um, and I say this in the acknowledge, which is the very end either exists in a lab or right now. So everything in the book is actually real at some level with the exception of there's a pharmacological compound at the center of the book. That's the only one that stretches the bounds, but everything else. In fact, some of the stuff I made up, uh, for example, uh, there's a, uh, the one scene, there's, there's a character flying on an airplane and there's a VR app where the camera's mounted on the hood of the airplane. And you can write what, so from between the time I wrote that, and now that already exists. So like three or four of the things that I put in there came into the one that's the weirdest and the one that is coming and doesn't yet, it's in the book. So, uh, is the face reading aquarium where it's like it's in certain foreign countries, as you enter the country, you walk through a tube, that's an aquarium. Right. And what they're doing is they're using computer face reading and they're face reading you and you can't, when you have lots of things, life, life, things to pay attention to, you can't mask your facial expressions. So that it's literally, they're using life as a anti-lying detection mechanism and they're building these. Yeah. So that technology, that's real. Those will start showing up at airports over the next five years. You're going to walk through like aquarium tunnels so the computers can read your face accurately. That is fucking nuts. So wait, yeah, that's kind of fun. When you have a bunch of like variables out there, you have to pay attention to and you have a lie simultaneously. The lie likes flickers out. Yeah. You have to, your, your attention gets distracted, right? Because you're, so one of the things it's sort of everywhere in the book is, uh, we come with all these built in proof of life detectors, right? The, the first thing any organization wants to know is like, are you alive? Are you dead? Right? That's the first thing any, when you encounter anything in the world, it's, are you alive? Are you dead? The next question is, if you're alive, right? Are you like me or not like me? Cause if you're like me, I may want to fuck you, right? And if you're not like me, I may want to run away from you or I may want to kill you and eat you. Okay. Like those are the choices, right? So, but the first thing we have to do is are you alive or you're not alive? So we have all these things that are built in automatic proof of life detectors that happen automatically. And we don't even think about it. And the example, the easy example from technology is when it goes wrong. So in robotics, there's something called the uncalate value. Yes. If you have a robot, right? That it is almost, but not quite human. That almost, but not quite brings up a sense of disgust in us. We don't like it's too close and not quite. So we have a reaction. We're detecting a fake. It's a proof of life detector. But one of the things that happened in the book to me, uh, and the opening scene takes place in, uh, the United wing of the new Newark airport. And I flew into Newark one night. It was like Friday night at like 1130, 12 o'clock at night. And I got off the plane and the airport felt like there was a party going on. It was like filled with people and energy. And what was it? And I realized as I walked off the plane into it, that it wasn't, it was actually Friday night, 1130, but everything blinked and scrolled and was liquid and moved and movement tricks the proof of life detector. And so I got tricked into believing that this airport was actually filled with people and alive and going on. And it wasn't. It was just designed to do that. Right. It's designed to make me feel the sensation of life. Even when life's not there. Right. And so think about, this is in last hangout, uh, we, we think about, we do this sometimes with like, think about a party, right? When everybody leaves and goes home and you're, you're left. If you manage to stay sober, um, that empty house has a sense. It gives off a sensation. Absence of life feels like something. Yeah. Absence of life, right? There's sensations. We know what those sensations are. We don't have, right? With sad, it feels like you can feel the, right? Like, so there's something that we're, I think what it is, is our mirror and our on systems. When there's life around, we're always mirroring. And when it, when there's nothing to mirror, we notice this lack of things to mirror. That's what I think, I think that's the biology under. That's the biology I play with in the book. Um, but I think there's like, so one of the questions, like where, where this gets weird is people always talk about the line is going to be, when does an AI wake up? Yeah, maybe, maybe that's an interesting line, but there's going to become a point where we no longer the series story. I start told you where I can't tell, well, you can't tell, is it awake? Is it not awake? Right. Which is a different thing than is it awake? Right. But like where we can no longer tell when the cars are autonomous and they're making decisions, there's a point at which you're like, I don't, I don't know. Anymore. And I don't know anymore. We've never lived in a world where the things we make could become conscious. That's not happened before other than by sex, right? The only way we can make something that wakes up is through sex. Every other way does, it doesn't wake up. And that's going to start to change in terms of how it feels, the texture of reality, the fabric is going to shift in weird ways. And that's one of the things I'm trying to get at in last hang on cyberspace is that the feeling, I'll give you an example from your own life. And you, so if you, maybe, maybe you're, maybe the error is wrong, but like the world felt one way before the internet showed up. That's right. Right. It was much more localized. It was smaller. And suddenly the internet happens, which is, this is where William Gibson's cyberspace, the term comes from. He's talking about not the actual web of connections between people. He's talking about the mental feeling of suddenly, oh my God, I'm now connected to the world in a way that I've never been before. And that connection has a feeling. The phenomenological texture of reality is different post internet than it was pre internet because when they're connected, right? That's going to shift again in like five years, right? Like reality didn't feel the way it did 20 years ago and it shifted. But like technology is moving so quickly, that's going to shift again in five years and then in four years and then in three years. So we're going to go through these phases where the way life feels, what sort of like gives us our concrete anchor to reality sense is going to start shifting faster and faster and faster. And this, I think if there is a redemption for the people who got pulled into the fucking 2012 thing, this is it. Because what do you know? The prediction for Quexacuato returning in 2012, it was actually pretty good when you consider the fact that the universe we're existing in now, as you just described it, is at least subjectively completely different from the one when I used to have to memorize friends, phone numbers in Hendersonville, North Carolina, pre internet. And this world that we're in now is so very different. You could almost say that old world died. It was, it's gone. It was sort of liquefied, got restructured, however you want to put it. And that's the world that we're living in now. And this is another thing that happens to our species is that our shared realities dramatically shift from time to time throughout history. But usually in between these shifts, we have a long time to get used to it, to integrate long periods of stability. Yeah. Long periods of stability punctuated equilibrium, right? To use the evolutionary term. Okay. Long periods of stability, big, big, big unstable period. Long periods of stability. No. And so Rick Kurzweil has said, and head of engineering at Google, right, runs their AI department and wrote the singularity is near and has been very good at predicting patterns in the future. And what he has said is we're going to experience 20,000 years worth of technological change over the next hundred years. Yes. So to put that in context, it means we're going to go birth of agriculture to the industrial revolution twice in 86 years. Now, he could be off by a factor of a thousand and it's still going to be faster than anything we've ever possibly experienced. Yes. And the reality shifts, like the reality tunnels to use Wilson's word, that we're going to experience just over the course of our lifetime. If you get another 30, 40, 50 years out of this game are going to be massive, right? Like our life totally changed in and around the mid 90s in a way that, you know, I, like I try to explain to people before the internet culture was disseminated in this thing called magazines. Like now you think that this thing at the airport that you've seen, you're supposed to read them on the plane. If you're bored, right? Yes, you can't get your phone to work. No, no, it turns out those used to be the major engine for disseminating culture. I remember when interview magazine showed up in Ohio and interview magazine was this magazine that was created by like all of the, it came out of like Andy Warhol and the kitchen crowd. And it was like New York's arts culture from the 70s and 80s. And it like made it to Cleveland, Ohio, where I was. And it was like our first glimpse of like, Oh my God, there's this other thing out there in the world that they're doing that sort of resonates with what we're doing. And it was that, the idea that magazines were once the dissent for a long period of time, they were the once the disseminator of cutting edge culture. It's so such a weird thing for people to wrap their heads around. Fuck, Matt, I, you just brought back the memory of the time at this gas station. They got a magazine rack in Fletcher, North Carolina, and it had all these fucking skater magazines and you could get, and it was like, and first time you saw a thrasher or something like that. And you were like, Holy crap, there are other dudes like me. Yeah. Yeah. There's, yes, yes. And that, that was almost like, it's like a little mini cultural UFO landing and the ripples that would happen in the micro system of high schools, just based on the sudden availability of this new cultural sort of representation of what people are doing in other places. It really creates these micro changes that are, that lead to big things. And yeah, so now we're getting that all the time. And now, but in what's happening is it's, there's fragmentation, wouldn't you say? There's some kind of like schisming that seems to be happening, which is we're getting these like cultures that are forming, uh, that are based in the, in cyberspace, but that are so vastly different from each other. And then those cultures are splitting and those are splitting and those are splitting. One of the things, so at the heart of last tag, right? Is this idea of poly tribes, right? Like, and it's a poly, the idea here is, and the first one I ever saw, it's on the first page of the book. I talk about the Pokemon subculture and you probably actually thought I was joking. You probably didn't realize this was a real thing. So the Pokemon subculture existed for a tiny little window in, uh, the early 2000s in chili and very conservative Southern Catholic, Catholic chili. And it was the first global mashup subculture. So what happened or at the internet made subculture visible. So suddenly, instead of like culture coming in through magazines and whatnot, every subculture was visible. So you started to get mix and match subcultures. So the Pokemon subculture blended Japanese guy room makeup with West coast hip hop gear, East coast emo style haircuts. They had these Brit punk sneer attitudes, crazy bisexual tendencies. And they rebelled by wet kissing strangers on the street. I thought you made that up. What? No, it's totally true. And the government freaked out and they basically stomped out this subculture very quickly. They sort of got like white supremacists pissed off at them and stomp them out. It's the one of the first times I've ever seen a government actually extinguish a subculture. They found it so threatening. They, like they buried it very, very quickly. That's not, but I was still, I was down there. I was doing a story. Uh, I was doing a magazine article. Uh, I wanted to see, you know, there's a lot of environmental stuff. And last time I obviously cared deeply about that stuff. And I wanted to see climate change for myself. So I want to see the icebergs melting, right? And the in Patagonia. And you found out the earth's flat and it's not really happening. You know, you could say a good flatter. I had a flat earth joke for you. Hold on, hold on. I got, I had it for a second. It was funny. Somebody told this to me last week. No, it's not coming to me. I got nothing. Sorry. I tried, you know, it'll, it'll pop up later in the conversation. I'll be, oh, that's the joke. So you went to see that. I'm sorry for interjecting a dumb flat earth joke. You went to see the, then I went to see, I wanted to go see what I wanted to actually go see what climate chains look like up close. I wanted to, I wanted to feel it. I'm going to see if I could feel it. But while I was down there in Koyake, this like town right at the edge of Patagonia, I was bumping into this Pokemon subculture. And I was like, oh my God, like remote Southern Chile, you're, you're, you're literally like as far down on the earth as you can possibly get. And you've got crazy mix and match subculture where they're pulling out of like all the major cities and they're, it's this mashup thing. And we're going to get more and more of that. And the reason it's interesting to me is if you, you know, historically. Innovation never happens in the center of the system, right? In nature, you call it niche creation. We move innovation to the edge. Um, a forest fire burns down, you know, a forest and then you can have, it's creates a new niche and then you'll get niche creation. Um, in culture, we call it subculture. In businesses, businesses don't innovate in the center of business. Okay. They innovate in skunk works, right? Because the center of anything is built for stability. You can't, it's really hard to innovate in the center of anything. It's built for stability and security. And right culture goes to the edges. So if you want to track where culture is going, right? Even though, as I said earlier, it's Darwinian, there's no way to make prediction. Sure. You can at least see where the trend lines are going and intersecting. And you want to look at subculture because that's where culture is innovating. That's what's happening. So you're seeing now in subculture, right? These crazy mashup cultures. And now we're talking me and you were talking about the Pokemon culture. And it's crazy. Yeah. It's this weird thing, right? But you got to start realizing that this is going to be the mainstream, right? These kinds of mashup subcultures are going to start becoming what happens in the mainstream. We're going to get globally mashed up mainstream culture for the very first time in history soon, right? Like we're moving in that direction. And that's interesting. Well, it's also, I'll tell you this, this is one, one of the things that's really interesting about it is that we know this is a field. Basically, you're talking about a field of data that is kind of difficult to collect. I've heard like big fashion companies will go into these subcultures on purpose to try to like figure out what the, what trends are happening so they can plan their next seasons or the season's coming. But, you know, when you consider the, I don't know if you listen to I don't know if you listen to Sebado. Do you ever listen to Sebado? You ever listen to any lo-fi, Daniel Johnston? Like this is what, this is my, that's like one of my great musical inspirations. But this movement happened in somebody's like mom's house, you know, as they were like, like slowly unraveling, but their music made its way out there. And like not, it's Sebado, Lou Barlow, this stuff was happening in front of four tracks in Boston, in like the shadows, you know, and you couldn't gather that data at the time, but now with the tracking that's happening, just by looking at people's searches, you have a deeper way into these subcultures than ever before, meaning that there is a way to harvest data and literally like theoretically, not literally, theoretically, with, you could harvest these, these fields of data and perhaps an AI could construct a fairly accurate prediction of how these various subcultures are going to mix together to form these poly tribes. And to me, that's wonderful, but also a little, a little spooky, right? Spooky, because what did you tell, what you just said happened to me, what sounds like pretty much, I mean, I don't want to get a wet kiss necessarily from, from somebody, but on the other hand, it's not going to be the worst day ever. It's a bit interesting, you got to, you got to give them, you give them, got to give them credit for creativity, right? Because every generation tries to out rebel the previous generation. And the bar's pretty high at this point. Like what do you, that you've gone from like long hair and weird clothes to tattoos, body modification, right? And now we're starting to see implants, technological implants in counterculture. So like the cyborg movement is starting to happen a little bit with that stuff. So like it's hard to rebel, wet kissing strangers on the streets. I give them proppers. I'm like, okay, that like, I can see how that would freak the fuck up. It's cool. It's cool. It's awful. It's cool. I'll tell you the, to me, the thing that is nerve wracking about it is not that. So what they, I don't, I don't care about being tracked. I've given up any sense of privacy. I'm mostly not any sense. I still shut the windows, but the, the fact that that subculture got snuffed out by the state or wherever the fuck they were, like that shows you one of the dangers, which is that if we could track these emergent forms, these potentially cultural, culturally shifting tides and we don't want one to show up because it's like, oh shit, look at that. That's, that's like, we've got it. So that's, that's an interesting, that's really interesting. It's called, there's a name. I just saw this New York time. I think it was the New York times. This lady got into one of these Russian troll farms because she was curious about how they work. So she's got into one where everyone's sitting at the computers making memes and shit. And one of the things they do is when there's an idea they don't like, they just like, they're named for a squelching or something where they would just go to these, whenever that idea pops up, they throw up memes that reflect the state's ideas, but cool, that made cool, made accessible. And then it's designed to sort of like snuff out a little, a fire that's about to start. And so that's a new kind of war that's happening, which is like, when these little forest fires start breaking out in various cultures that could potentially threaten the power structure of the culture, then infiltrators pretending to be the subculture that they're wanting to stop, go in and snuff it out or shit disturbed to shut it down. So this is like, it's crazy. That's, that's way more frightening than anything I wrote about it last time. Go baby. Wow. That's, uh, that's really creepy. Um, and it does, uh, where it's going to get interesting, right? Is this is just the first wave, right? You're seeing, right? The, this is the internet's allowed a new kind of rebellion and oh, they figured out how to control it from within. And it's just going to be another arms race, which is interesting, right? Cause it's a, the arms race that we have played out in culture, as you pointed out, it's been very slow moving. Now we're playing very, very quickly. I mean, like the ways that this is going to go wrong, or like it's just unfathomable. It's just good. Well, we, you know, this is the, um, this is the, I think one of the subcultures that is the most interesting to me is that maybe Jaren Lanier subculture, which is the folks who've turned their phones off and who are out in the, like who have, who have created these sort of technological technology free enclaves, these little vacuums of technology within which we don't know what they're doing, untrackable, un, unseedable, you know, because it's like, you know, one of the principles in psychology that corporations love is that people remember the fact, but forget where the fact came from. So if you're scanning through Twitter and you see a fact, you'll forget it. You got it from Twitter. And if it's stuck in your brain, so to speak, you might find yourself walking down the street, having a conversation and you'll sneeze that data bit out. And it got planted in your head by somebody who unintentionally wanted to create that, a spread of that data going out there, which is why we don't know what seeds are getting stuck in the furry little carapace of our brains. What little data seeds are stuck in there that we're planning in other people's brains. And some people are like, it's, we just don't know. So we're not going to go through the place where we risked being contaminated by bad data. Um, anyway, I always think about that. So I always, when I, when I, when I train writers, especially people who are writing books, everybody, you really want your book to be the ball. I wrote the book that changed the war. And I always tell people, I'm like, look, I've gone through that 10 times. You always, you think it's going to be the book and you want it to be. And it feels right. And don't listen to the dopamine, but my moral is I'm like, look, unless we're talking about your favorite three books, if I were to throw out a book, you've read chances are all you're going to remember are one to three facts and how it made you feel. That's all like in the end, right? Like in the end, even with somebody, if somebody, I always say, if somebody comes up to me and they're like, Steven, blah, blah, blah is my favorite book. Like what they're really saying to me is instead of remembering three facts from your book and how it made me feel, I remember seven or 12. Like that's really what they're saying, right? Which is right. I mean, if you think about it, like when you say, this is my favorite movie, what do you really mean? If you mean, I can tell you what it's about. Um, I can probably recite 12 to 15 lines and I know how it makes you feel. Yeah. That's what you're saying. Books, like it's this, it's it really like sort of bad. It's just to shrink your ego around. Like the impact your art is actually having. Oh, what a relief. Thank you for that liberation, man. What a relief. That's it's because it's a fucking prison. Like what like people who are trying to do that and your ego creeps in. And yeah, sure as shit, you're like, I want to write, you know, I don't know. When you start, for me, it's like it's it's it's like you would call it insanity, which is that I would, I'll sit down and try to write something and I'll look at it and I'll think, well, this is no Hemingway and then I'll give it up. It's like, what the fuck? My ego is like, wants me to be Hemingway. One of the great writers to ever live. It's like seriously, but I mean, I like that and you can't. I mean, you could give Hemingway a go. You just got to like, I don't know, you know, edit it 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 times and then we can start moving you in that general direction. Now, listen, I know you got to go. It's it's 12, 13 right now. I don't know what your schedule is like and I've kept you. I got I got it. I got it. I don't have anything for a little bit so we can keep talking. Okay, I'm with you. Okay. Wonderful. This is my very I was just talking to another friend of my friend, Mark Dwight, um, and I who also is a podcast and my two favorite podcasts are you and Mark because you're the only your guys who are kind of got the same kind of punk rock, weirdo backers. I get to just be totally me. Thank you. That means a lot to me. Thank you very much. I, uh, and, um, I want to, I do want to spend the last little bit of time, uh, using your brain to, if possible, to sort of, um, get into this, this world of writing, because, um, selfishly, you know, I do, I'm, we're, I'm constantly working on a book and I'm constantly quitting working. You're Los Angeles, right? Yes. Are you in town the second week in July? Yeah, I can already say that I am for sure. My next flow for writers is in LA in July. Okay. And it's a two day. It's a two day. You come as my guest. Oh my God. Thank you, man. My God. What is the date I'm putting it in right now? Tell me the date again, please. I got it. Second week of July. That is the second week. And hold on. Let me just get 13th and 14th. I got it. I'm putting it in right now. Great. Yeah. Okay. That's awesome. Well, then that, that I will definitely be there. So there's your problem. And by the way, send you the URL, uh, give all your, any of your listeners have writing aspirations. They want a two day deep dive. We'll give them 500 bucks off. Oh, awesome. I'll send you the link and you can put it out when you put this out. Cool, man. Let me just say this cause, um, I just, I want to put this out there. Not that you care, Steven, but that was not, this was spontaneous friends. It wasn't some pre-planned weird thing. Uh, that's awesome. Oh yeah. By the way, yeah, this was totally. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Secretly, we connived how I could sell more tickets to flow for writers. We were talking about this backstage and. No, man, this is badass. And thank you very much. That is a huge and beautiful gift. And I will definitely like, I mean, I, you know, we could, there's a discussion we could have after that class cause everything I'm going to tell you it's, you're going to get in two days. Um, uh, yeah, you'll like it. You'll have a lot of fun. The other funny thing that I think is that you had, you just said, like, you know, I tell students, don't get it out of your head that you're going to write the book or the big thing. And then you did it. Ha, you wrote it, man. You made a fucking great cyberpunk book. And I'll tell you, people try to imitate this style and they can't fucking do it. Because if you're going to write this kind of book, you can't just sit down and make up snazzy catchphrases. You know, you can't like pretend that you have your finger deep in the subcultures that are happening around the planet right now. You actually have to know what's happening in a creepy way so that the book feels almost like you're reading something you're not supposed to be reading. Like it's dead. That's the punk rock aspect of it, which is like, wait a minute. This shit is like real, real. So like, you know, for me, the fact that you didn't, one, I, I, when I was, when I was reading, when I was starting it, I thought, oh yeah, I know this was inspired in the airport because he travels a bunch and I know this must have just popped into his head in the airport. So I got that. But then when I got. Oh, actually, I'll tell you this. No, the story is funnier. I get it was airports when I told you that story where I was just like, oh, so there's an environmental message, right? And the year. So I wrote a book called a small furry prayer, but the relationship between humans and animals. And it had an environmental message at its heart, sort of. And, uh, it didn't, the book was, did very well, but I always felt like the only people who read it were already animal geeks and environmentalists. Like it's spread a little bit, but it was basically, I was preaching to the choir. So I was, I had said to myself, how do I solve this problem? How do I sort of get the same ideas out, but to a wide audience? And I had been thinking about that on and off for a couple of six months or whatever, true story. Peter, abundance comes out. Peter Diamandis, my co-author on abundance and I are doing radio tours. We're in New York. We're in, uh, Bob Hariri, one of the pioneers of stem cells. We're in his penthouse fricking apartment. Peters and one or a mom and the other, we've got phones and we're literally doing a radio interview every 15 minutes from like four o'clock in the morning till like eight o'clock at night, right? And like five o'clock, I am like losing my fucking mind. I can't take it. And I actually, I'm like, if I don't get outside and smoke a joint and get stoned, like I have to, like something, right? I got to like, I got to do, I can't know enough, enough sales and marketing Steven for one day ever. And so I run outside and it's, it's raining and I'm literally like smoking a joint, walking down the street, uh, in the rain. And I, an image pops into my head of a human head, a human head on mounted on a plaque of head, a mid animal heads, right? On a, on a taxidermy wall, right? And there's a human head amid all the animal heads. Now you'll know from reading the book that that's the opening scene in the book, that's essentially the opening scene in the book, right? That's the Paganist has that encounter. So literally I saw that. I knew it was the answer to my question. Like whatever the way to communicate the animal thing, this is the answer. I had no idea what the story was. It took me eight years to figure out how that goddamn head got on the wall. And the answer is last hang on cyberspace. This is the answer. Right. I had the question. I got the answer and I was like, okay, well, that's the answer. But like what, like, what do I do with it? It took eight years to figure out how did that head get on the wall? And the answer is what is the story? Wow, weird story. That is bad ass. And this is something, you know, I read a lot about the writing process. And that's sad. I wish I wrote as much as I read about the writing process. But, you know, Stephen King, he talks about like the dark tower, you know, how that came to him in an airplane and he sketched it out. And then you just looked at it. I was like, oh, put it in a drawer. And then down the line, it spawns this whole series. And I guess that's part of it, right? Is having the guts to write down that stuff. Because some people that, that I, that vision might bubble into their minds and they're like, wow, I must be going nuts. I think it's also that people are very impatient with that stuff, meaning like the vision, the idea, whatever it is comes to them and it comes and it feels really strong, right? The intuition, which is sort of like, I spent a lot of time working on intuition and looking at the neuroscience of it. And like, how does the goal directed system work over time, right? How do I get a glimpse of something as an artist that doesn't turn into a real thing 10 years out? And I think the current, the important thing is to know that like the thing that you got, the vision that you got, it's just, you've got to do the work. You have to keep feeding it over and you can't put a time frame on it. And we know this from lots of creativity, research and intuition, research that some of these things, you don't want to put a time frame around it. You just want to keep feeding it a little bit at a time and a little bit of time and you just sort of come back to it because the way the brain puzzle solves through those problems, you can't condense it and it doesn't work well if you put a time horizon. How do you sync that up with the concept of setting goals? Well, I have book projects lined up that go out five or six years, right? And five or six years out, I'm like, okay, I have, I may have a topic or I may have, oh, I want to write a book about intuition and neuroscience and whatever. And all I do is just, I'm just reading and researching. So every third book or fifth book is something that might fit in there. And I'm just feeding my pattern recognitions. This is going to be a little bit of information over time slowly because that's how the brain does this kind of puzzle solving. So there's a, this is really cool. There's a special, when your brain has a problem, it can't yet solve. It holds that problem in a special holding cells, unlike other memory. Other memory can get splintered off and you may not get access to it for years and years and years. But if it's an unsolved problem, the brain has it in a special holding cell where all the connections to all potential solutions are really right at the surface, which means if you'd ever discover anything that you've all had the experience where you're reading something and the information clicks in with something you learned a while ago and you're like, oh my God, it's the thing that answers the thing, right? That's because that stuff is held in a special holding cell in the brain. So you can do that, right? There's actual, there's an actual, I'm going to screw the name up. They have a, they have a specific name for that process. I'm going to screw up what it is, but the point is if you know that's how the brain works, you want to feed it. You want to feed your curiosities slowly and consistently over long periods of time and let them, you know what I mean? Give them the space to become real ideas. I think what the problem that most people have, especially creatives, is they, they want the big idea, but they're unwilling to do the actual research and have the patience, right? Last hangover in cyberspace. I knew I wanted to write another novel 20 years ago. I knew I wanted to write a book that solved this puzzle. That was 2011 when I saw that, right? When that, or 2000, yeah, 2012, excuse me, when I saw that, right? It's 2018. It was five and a half years that I was just sort of like feeding it little bits of information and saying, okay, let's take this a little bit farther and a little bit farther and a little bit farther and not trying to solve it all at once and not trying to rush it into existence. I mean, but also the advantage of having a long career, right? Like a lot of people, this is another thing that artists, like this is along with the, oh my God, this is the best book I've ever written. Anybody who's ever, right? That syndrome, right, is like, that's not, honestly, the goal. Like the goal isn't to write one book or do one comedy special or record one CD. Like it's to have a career, right? So one thing is going to have to lead to the next is going to have to lead to the next is going to, like you're going to need stuff at every bit of the way, right? The creative lives that impressed me now are guys like Stuart Brand or Brian Eno or guys who have reinvented themselves at a really high level, six, seven, eight, nine times, right? And they're still doing great work, incredibly powerful work. Um, and they've, you know, that's what it takes to have a full creative career. And that's what I'm really interested in. Wow. I don't like who the fuck wants to be a one hit runner? Nobody. I know back when I was a journalist, we always used to every now and again, especially, uh, some of the magazines, some of the magazines I was writing at an LA, we were always curious, we'd go back and hang out with rock stars who were no longer rock stars, like a lot of the hair band guys who like, they were like packing stadiums in the eighties. And by like the late nineties, they were like house painters, right? They like it at all. They lost everything and they were fucking house painters. And I was fascinated by like, what must it feel like to like, there's 25,000 people and women are throwing their panties at you to like, no, now you're like, you got an apartment and you're paying the houses for a living. And like that to me, um, and I'm not even talking about the like adulation, the fame part, that's ultimately uninteresting as, as you know, but like the not being able to be creative for a living, that like, that's got a really frickin heart, um, to me. How does that happen? I'm sorry to like, this is the thing though. To me, it's like, okay, this is, I've thought about this. I've thought about it. I've thought if the apocalypse comes and there's nothing but like, you know, shit, water and rubble everywhere, I'm still going to try to make stuff. You know, right? How do you stop? Like, I don't, that's the, to me, I don't know how to. Yeah. I don't know how to stop either. And I always like, you know, that to me, like I was talking to somebody else, asked me this question the other day and I explained, I was like, you got to understand that like, I'm a creative. So like what I care about is the next creative project. Like what happens when a book comes out, what, what people's reaction to it? Like I care in that I want it to be good because it allows me to do the next thing. It makes doing the next thing easier. Yeah. But honest to God, like once my editor is like, okay, you're good. We're done. We're going to, we're going to press like, okay. Now, like I've got a checklist that is PR that I have to put into place, but like I'm done. I'm already on to the next, like I don't care. Yeah. The thing I wanted to do, like people always come up to me and they're like, oh my God, your book changed my life. Thanks. And I'm like, shut up. I was like, you got to remember, I'm writing this book to save my life. The fact that it happened to save your life, that's totally incidental to me. That was not what I was like, that's not what I'm doing. It's great. And I appreciate it. And I'm glad. But like I write this stuff because I'm trying to save my life. That's whose life I'm trying to save with the art, not yours. Man, I love talking to you, Stephen. You are a really, really, really inspirational person. Whether you like it or not, and you are changing. You know, I don't like it. I know you don't. And I've been, you know, a lot of my favorite creators, they are like that. And it's, it could be a little frustrating until you realize why. Because like, you know, some people, some people who are like legendary musicians that I have been lucky enough to chat with. The moment I start doing that fucking thing of like, you're a musical, they, you just, they tune out. They don't want to hear it. They don't care. They literally don't care. They can't care. And that's, I like that. I honestly think it's the same thing that I just talked about. It's that, so I'll tell you a true story. The one time somebody came up to me, I'll never forget this. I was in Italy at a business conference at like the world business forum or something. And I was doing a book signing and it was one of those really weird, I didn't even know I had fans in Italy. Like I didn't even know anybody, like maybe my books have been translated. But like I'm doing a reading and they're like 500 people who have lined up for me to sign books. And I'm like, I don't need like, I, none of it's making any sense to me. My head's having a really hard time. And there's this girl like teenager at the back of the line. And I see it, she's crying. And I see her getting closer and she's crying and closer. And I'm like, oh God, like this is weird enough. And what the fuck? And she gets up to me and I'm like, all right, why are you crying? And she looks at me and she's 17, 18. And she was like, you got me through high school. And for the very first time, because writers got me through high school. So that's the first time anybody's come up and said something to me where I felt it, right? Where I was like, oh my, I know what that feels like. So normally when you come up to me and, you know, when you say anything like that, it's what, you know, like I'm, I'm really incredibly grateful that you got something out of the book. But like what you got out, you brought to the book. Like I wrote it, you did something else with it. And that's the thing you're reacting to. So the, we were a good combination and it helped you. And that's great. But like the thing you're talking about doesn't, it's not really my thing. I did my thing. It was to save my life. You took what I did. You added a whole bunch of your stuff into it and it saved your life. And that's cool. But it's not, I didn't do that. And don't give me credit for that. That was as much you as me. And if it wasn't my book, it would probably be some other book that did that thing. And I'm, I'm sure, I'm pretty sure of that. But this was a girl who said something to me where I was like, fuck, I know that feeling. So it resonated. And I think the problem is that if it doesn't resonate, like if you don't happen to hit that one chord, it, you know, the artist is already onto the next thing. And they don't want to, and it's a trap. As you know, like I remember West of Jesus, which my second book, I really, when I was done writing that book, I was like, Oh my God, this is the best book I've ever written. I'm never going to write anything this good. I had that problem. And you know what it created? Fucking writer's block. It took me like eight months to get my next book going. Yes. The last one was so good. How could I write it? Right. It's a fucking disaster. So Steven's rule is I start writing the next project the two weeks before the last project ends. So I will start, I'm working on a book right now with Peter Diamandis. I will start my next book two weeks before the one with Peter is done. Yes. So I can already be into the next thing by the time I finish this one and long before it comes out. Do you like Chogium Trump or Rinpoche? Do you read his work at all? Chogium type. Okay. You're going to love this guy, Chogium Trump. But he's amazing. And his whole theory is based on this and it infuriates some people because the guy who I study meditation with, I went to him and I was like, man, I had a transcended experience meditating. And he's like, really? Well, tell me about it. What was it? And then he, you know, it's this process of deconstructing the experience to the point where you realize, oh yeah, that was bullshit. That was nothing. But every time I've been sitting to meditate, that experience has been pulling me because I want to replicate it, duplicate it, make it happen again. And so the advice, yeah, and it's like, it's one of the traps. And so you see this with artists, which is that they're like, I could never redo that thing I did. And the reason that they're stuck is because they're subscribing to a concept of the continuity of self. They think they're the same person they were when they wrote that. All right, but that's the other problem, right? Yeah. That person's long gone. It's dead. That person's dead. Whoever you are now needs to be writing or creating from where you are now, not writing from the voice of a person who's been annihilated. That's why, by the way, Duncan, I've got two novels sitting in drawers. Like each of them needs an edit. But I don't even know who the dude was who wrote those books, let alone trying to find them. You know what I mean? Like at a certain point, you just, you got to walk. You're totally right. And that's the difference between it. There's nothing fixed about the self. And to me, that's the difference between a Jedi and a Sith. If you want to use Star Wars, like terminology, or you could Alistair Crowley called the Black Lodge, which is in magic, the people who turn into like dark sorcerers. And what that really looks like in the real world is just like people who use NLP to trick women into fucking them or whatever. Like that kind of like self-centered like use of like technology to like, you know, without it to dehumanize people. But hold on. Hold on. Are you saying that we're not supposed to use the NLP to fuck women? You got to tell them first. As long as you let them know you're using neurolinguistic. Do you know what the rules were? I've been married forever. I don't get to do this stuff anymore. But I just want to know where right and wrong is just in case. Okay. Okay. You got to hear you there. Do whatever you want. Do as thou wilt, as Crowley said. But there is a Black Lodge. I get your point on all those things. And you are not in that because I've noticed in my experience with comedians and artists that if you want to create an imaginary binary, you could say there is a group of artists who feel that they are responsible for what's coming out of them. They are what's coming out of them. And when people come to them and say, you changed my life, they go, yes, I know I did. I know I changed your life. That's right. And these people are the ones who become the cult leaders. They're the ones who become the center of some sad vortex of sycophants who are imagining that this is the conduit through which life and art flows. And the sorcerer in the middle of that is projecting that. And this produces centralization and lots of problems. So it's awesome to hear that you're not one of those. This is always, they're authors. They're going to go unnamed. But if their first book and their eighth book or fifth book sound the same, I know they're in it for something other than the craft. They found something that works and it's making them money. And maybe they're in it for the ideas. Maybe the craft itself doesn't matter. And they're actually just, the writing is a way to explore the ideas. That's, maybe that's fine. But as a general rule, I want to see a style evolve. Right? I want to see a comedian, a musician. Sometimes it's better. Sometimes it's worse. Neil Young had a shocking pink rockabilly phase in the middle of his career. It was okay. But you know what I mean? Like a lot of people do that stuff. But I want to see that the art is evolving, not because when you see it's like, when they're trying the same thing over and over and over again, they're listening to the dopamine. Those are the people are, yes, I changed your life. Right? Like, and I have to do that again and again. No, I'd rather roll the dice. I'd rather, right? This is written in a radically different style than anything I've ever written. Right? It's a new, it's a new thing. And I think like, I mean, who knows, maybe this style will particularly work. And I'm going to write the same book over and over and again, 10 times. And there are other authors. Yeah. No, that's not true. I think all of my favorite authors, even if like they're just thriller writers, John Samford, who's a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist who became a novelist, started out writing these like horrific slasher serial killer things because they sold a lot. But once he figured out what he was doing, he invented some of the most interesting characters in mystery. And, you know, and has flesh and has really grown. Those are careers I look at and go, that's interesting. Because you're continuing to grow as an artist and for and take chances and scare yourself and do something like that's really interesting. Because if you, if you, if you, where you get where I'm interested in seeing is like, there's so much wisdom that you get as you get older, right? Yes. But we lock people in and suddenly you've got Mick Jagger and he's trying to do Mick Jagger at age 75. And it just looks like a 75 year old dude in tight pants. And you're like, what's this? And you can't sing it. Do something different. Reinvent yourself. Right. Tom Leitz did. Right. His music got harder and more complicated and weirder the older. That's right. This is, I'm sorry to do this to you. You just changed my life. This is one of the most liberating chats I've had, man. And you accidentally just that the prison cell in my brain with the unsolved problem. It just opened up. So now I'm having to trust the dopamine. Thank you so much, Stephen for this. And I cannot wait for that, that workshop. And, and please tell my, tell the folks listening where they can, how they can connect with you now. Stephen Cautler.com is the easiest place. W, W, W, S, T, E, V, E, N, K, O, T, L, E, R. Dot com. You can get a last tango cyberspace comes out when in May, in May, and you can pre-order it anywhere and you should pre-order 17, 18, 19 copies really. Cause nothing says happy July 4th or Merry Christmas or happy Easter. Or what else do we, what's coming up? I need something. Ah, spring equinox just, oh, bicycle day, bicycle day when they discovered LSD. What LSD? Happy bicycle day. Nothing says happy bicycle day like last tango cyberspace. So, you know, she buy copies for everybody you know. That's right. In fact, strangers. She should buy copies for slaves. Let me be cheesy here though, for real. This is the, this is a very good book. And as you could tell, Stephen is an amazing person. And if you do these pre-orders, it actually, it makes a difference in the way the publishers treat the book I heard, right? It does make a big difference. Oh, it does. And by the way, we'll get you a link for this too. It hasn't launched yet. I don't know what, but we are doing a really kind of cool pre-order campaign where we're giving away nothing super fancy, but I did an hour long conversation with Peter Diamandis on future technology, all the future tech in last tango. We sort of went category by category and talked about what's real, where it's going. And you'll get that. You'll also get a three hour, two to three hour. I don't know how long we're going to do it podcast. So I've worked with the same editor for 25 years. Cool. And so we're going to just do it. We're going to have a two hour discussion about the writing of last tango and mostly about the writing process and the book writing process and all that stuff we were talking about. So um, pre-order the book, we'll get you a link so we can hook people up with that and they can get some free goodies as well. Thank you so much, Stephen. I really appreciate it. Brother, thank you. So fun. That was Stephen Kotler, everybody. All the links you need to find. Mr. Kotler are going to be at dugotrussel.com, including the links to get those awesome discounts he mentioned on the show.

Trussell, and you are listening to the Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour Podcast, being recorded from the Commander Burke, Mausoleum in Asheville, North Carolina. I just wanna say thank you to Asheville Forever Cemetery for hosting the podcast for the next few episodes while I try to find a place to live where I can have an actual home office. And you know, I gotta admit, it's not that bad here in this Mausoleum. And right now, if you're living in Asheville and looking for a great office space, go to Asheville Forever Cemetery and use offer code, Family Hour, and you're gonna get 15% off an office space in one of the many available Mausoleums. In this Mausoleum, I can finally be myself. I made friends with the spiders on the shelves by the candles and the lanterns. If flick flickers late at night, I don't mind laying here while my bones turn white. As long as I eat brains, I don't feel pain. It won't be long until no one remembers who you are. 500, 600 years, Max. Can you think of anyone from 600 years ago that wasn't a president or emperor or some shit? You will be forgotten. And even if you are some famous person, no one's gonna care. Do you care about many famous people from 500 years ago? Of course you don't. You will be forgotten. You will be forgotten. Cutting edge technology that detects when you're taking yourself too seriously and sends an alert to your phone, saying you will be forgotten. No one will remember or care who you are. You will be forgotten. Hey friends, do you like books? Do you like being around people who like books? Then I wanted to invite you to subscribe to patreon.com forward slash DTFH and sign up for our weekly DTFH book club. Shout out to my Dune book club fam. We have voted on a new book. And if you're feeling the fall blues, if you're somebody who maybe gets a little depressed when the light hangs low in the sky, if you're somebody who feels as though some darkness is inevitably going to devour you, then you should sign up for our next book, House of Leaves, which is like my Tuesdays with Maury meets the Blair Witch Project. It's a book by Mark Z Danieluski. And just to paraphrase, I'll read a tiny passage from the very beginning of the book. With a little luck, you'll dismiss this book. Then eventually, no matter where you are in a crowded restaurant or on some desolate street, or even in the comforts of your own home, you'll watch yourself dismantle every assurance you ever lived by. And then for better or for worse, you'll turn unable to resist, though try to resist, you still will. Fighting with everything you've got, not to face the thing you most dread. What is now, what will be, what has always come before, the creature you truly are, the creature we all are, buried in the nameless black of a name. And then the nightmares will begin. That's the very beginning of House of Leaves, voted on by the Dune book club. And we would love to invite you to come and join us. There's still time to order this book. It's available on Amazon or Kindle. Highly recommend the paperback copy. It's really beautiful.

Logan Murto, one of the creators of Black Rock City. One of the most overlooked delights of Burning Man is a period known as the build, which is the time before Burning Man officially starts when people from all over the world gather together to help build Black Rock City, which for a little while becomes the most populated city in Nevada. I've been to the build. I came there with my beautiful theme camp, the Enchanted Booty Forest. And one of my favorite memories of all time was digging trenches in the dirt of the desert to lay electrical wire so that my camp could have electricity for their DJ booth setup. It was like prison labor level work. You're covered with this acidic, sacred dust, but it was such a joy to do something out there that was hard, involved just physical labor and the only payment was the joy of building something with a group of friends. It was really a high point in my life. And during that particular Burning Man, I was lucky enough to meet today's guest, Logan Murto. Logan Murto, aka Cobra Commander, is the DPW personnel manager at Burning Man. That might not sound very exciting, but what it means is that every year he comes to Burning Man 100 days early and manages 700 people in the middle of an alien desert who help create Black Rock City. He's a badass. And so now everybody, please raise your hands and salute today's brilliant, philosophical angel of a guest, Logan Murto. Welcome to the DTFH, this is badass, man. Welcome, welcome on you, that you are with us, shake hands, no need to be moved, welcome to you. It's been Duncan Chassel, thank you. Logan, welcome to the DTFH. This is badass, man. We talked about on the Playa doing a podcast and it's been probably, it's been years since then, but I still remember how cool it was meeting you and like the kind of mystical significance you have out there on the Playa, because you are, I mean, it's not fair, I guess, to say that you have one of the hardest jobs out there, but holy shit, you're in charge of like somehow managing that whole, getting the whole Black Rock City built, right? It's true, I got a great team. I have, I'm on a council of eight people and between the eight of us, we run the Department of Public Works and the Department of Public Works is about 800 people in total and we spend anywhere from a couple of weeks to upwards of more than a hundred days on the Playa, putting this thing together and making sure that everything's ready to go for opening night. And then we stick around afterwards, like I'd still be out there until early October, helping everybody take it apart and managing the crew that is out there doing Playa restoration along with the rest of the members on the council and all that. Can you, for people who are only familiar with Burning Man from like cheesy Instagram pictures that they've seen, which I think is like for some people, given them the complete wrong idea of what the festival is, but they might not even know what the Playa means. Do you think you could describe those conditions to people? What's it like out there before any of that stuff goes up? I'll do my best. It's like a 1700 square mile alkali flat. It is like this powder, like baby powder thin dust that just stretches on into like the world's most infinite looking parking lot surrounded by this bowl of mountains, which is just gorgeous and serene and it is overwhelmingly beautiful. And then you spend a couple of hours out there and your body starts reminding you that it is also hostile and not friendly to life. And it is a place where you have to stay hydrated where you have to stay hyper vigilant about the sun, about exposure to the elements. It is the driest, most, yeah, very, not most, but one of the most hostile places I've ever been in my life for sure. Yeah. I remember posting something about the sand of Burning Man on the Burning Man subreddit and being immediately people being like, that's not sand, that's alkali. But you think you could talk about what alkali actually is? Oh, not well. Yeah, it is. No, that gets into a sciency place that I'm not gonna be able to hit you up. It is a fine, fine dust that gets into everything that you have, that gets in places you did not know you had that will disrupt your electronics, that will corrode your vehicles. It is an intense substance for sure. If you've got your phone out, you can expect it to be dead by the time you get out of the desert. If you've got your, you can't bring modular synthesizers there, you can't bring any of that stuff because it'll eat it alive. Well, you can, but you gotta keep it wrapped in plastic. For the last couple of years, I've actually been getting a band, some people I know, a band called Spindrift out of LA and I've been getting them to come out and play for the crew. And they bring all their equipment out and then they're just like, I'm sure that they're home just ringing the dust out of it for days. I mean, I just, it's the most wild thing because it's got a certain smell to it too. What's that smell? You know, the alkali, like any of my stuff from the burn to this day, I get shivers when I pull out like my backpack that has the clothes I was wearing because you smell that specific scent. Sure. Yeah, and your body's got a sense memory to all of that, right? And it's interesting because I, you know, I've spent a tremendous amount of time out there like a hundred days plus for, you know, decade and a half every year. And so I think of that place as being largely scentless because it really does, it's so dry that nothing really carries out there to your scent in the normal way. But playa itself, yeah, you smell it off the playa itself. You get out of there and you back in the real world and you smell that dust and it's, it is haunting and familiar and your body just knows it. It's like, it's like nothing else. It's like nothing else. But maybe you could talk about the temperatures out there because go, I mean, I went in for the build with my camp. It was the best time I ever had working, but holy shit. Can you talk a little bit about, just briefly, what is it exactly y'all are doing out there? What is required in setting up a city in the middle of this alien environment? Absolutely, a tremendous amount is required. And, you know, there's a lot of teams that put a lot of work into putting Black Rock City together. And I wanna acknowledge that right up front. What my team, the Department of Public Works is responsible for is physical infrastructure for the most part. And then running a couple of services that kind of provide service to people in Black Rock City. But to sum it up, like we're in there putting in the roads. We're in there building shade structures. We're, you know, we put our teams put together the center camp cafe. We build the man and the man pavilion. All of the arctic stations are physically constructed by us. So we're out there doing physical labor. We're out there doing physical construction. And that's not to mention the teams that are putting in the power grids, teams that are running our fuel department. You know, there's so much going on there. That is, that is all kind of coming together, not only to support the crew during their extended stay out there, but also to support staff as they roll in to do their part to make Black Rock City happen. Well, and also, what about the, to me, what was so striking or everything's striking about Burning Man, but one of the most striking things about it is how clean it is all the way through. That's the part where your mind gets blown. When, you know, a few days in, when you realize if you have seen a cigarette on the ground, you're picking it up. People just, you know, like people are, it's the cleanest festival. It's, it's cleaner than my backyard for sure. And Sherman Oaks with a toddler, it's clean. So what is that like trying to, you know, you know, you've got gas out there. You've got flammable shit out there. All kinds of pollutants. What is it like working in a place where if you spill anything, you're looking at hours and hours of extra work. You know, it's, it's kind of crazy, but it's, you know, that Black Rock City is so clean because of the participants. You know, we, we, of course, on staff do everything we can to do to make that happen. But if it wasn't for the cultural buy-in, you know, if it wasn't for us asking everyone who attends to do their part, you know, we wouldn't have that. And so, you know, it's, it's a massive group effort to make that the case. And I'm glad that that's your experience of it, 100%. You know, to work in an environment like that, it just becomes part of the deal. You know, you don't cut wood unless you put a tarp down. You know, you, if you think you're going to be working with something, you're going to spill. If you think there's some danger of it, like just becoming a mess, you're thinking about that beforehand. You're, you're planning for that, you know, as a part of the process. And it, it then that bleeds into the way that you do anything in life, you know, once you start actually thinking about leaving no trace, once you actually thinking about how can I make as little an impact on my environment as possible when I do what I want to do or what I need to do. You know, it just gets built into your, your psyche in terms of like how you approach a problem. Man, I gotta tell you, it lasted for me for about, and this is pretty good for me about a year after that burn. I would, if I stated an Airbnb after my second, but I would like clean the, you know, you don't have to, but you get in your head like, oh, I'm going to leave this place like nobody was here. It's a- And why wouldn't you want to leave something better than you found it? You know, so I'm curious, what made that fade out after a year? What made that not the case anymore? You know, laziness, like, you know, the world, you are getting, you, again, anything I say is clearly an excuse, but I think there is something about, and they talk, burners talk about this all the time, you hit default reality, and it is like you're entering into another dimension or something. You drop in to the world that you were born into, and you carry with it like a, I don't know, like a comet or something. You've got a little Burning Man trail that lasts for, but it burns off in the atmosphere, man. It like, I still think about it, but it's a little bit of a foggy memory for me now. You know, it's not foggy just because of the drugs, but foggy, but foggy. Because a distance over time has made it, yeah. Distance over time, you know. That's been my experience with, not just Burning Man, but spiritual retreats in general. And psychedelics, it's one of the problems is maintaining the vibe. You and I were talking about that a couple of days ago, and it's, I don't know if it's, I don't know if I would classify it as a problem, you know, it's that wobble, it's that forgetting and remembering, like that is the process, it's breathing in and breathing out those things that we want to hold on to, you know, and not trying to hold on to them desperately forever, but rather remembering how to recognize that you've dropped them and remembering how to pick them back up. Oh yeah, man. Thank you for, thank you. Yeah, you're right. And that was the, you know, to me, that's the, well, that's one of the great hopes that Burning Man has given me is, and I remember that was the first, that's when I was getting, when the first one I went to, when I was getting really like kind of choked up, is this sense of like, holy shit, this is the way human beings can be. This is the way human beings can be. And I've never seen this way that human beings can be before. And you see that, and like, we don't have to be the way that we are. Like we're in our cities, we're, you know, hunkered down. A lot of us, we're especially now, we're alienated from our community. You know, we don't, everyone says, oh, go check on your neighbors, but come on, who really does that? Who really does- Not many people. Not enough people. Not enough people. And then you go to this other place, which is an alien environment, where you shouldn't be able to even survive for a few hours. And it's heaven on earth for a second. And I remember getting choked up, and because that, I just kept thinking like, oh my God, how crazy is it that we chose this other way? The name, you know, the way we're doing it in default reality. But what do you, what do you think about that? I mean, what's the take among the people who are creating this incredible temporary city? Are they so utopian as I am about it, or is there a more realistic view of things? I can't speak for it. You know, I can only speak for my own perspective, you know, and my own take on it. But I'll do my best to, I mean, I feel like the reason I worked for Burning Man, ultimately, is because I wanted to work for something that I thought was improving the human experience. You know, my priority as a human is that I am doing everything I can to help my species evolve, and to help myself grow, and to help people around me grow, and just learn how to be the best person I can be, and to help others do that same. And not only for myself, but for my community, and for the world, and for the species at large. And so, when I think about what we're accomplishing out there, you know, I never use the word utopian, because I have seen plenty of people go out there and have a horrible time, and never want to come back. You know, I've seen people on their worst day out there. I've seen people, I've known people out there that have died, and have died out there. And that is, you know, utopia is loaded as a term, and is loaded as a concept. I don't go there with it, but at first glance, I think that Burning Man is that, you know, and Burning Man, because it provides this very digestible, and comprehensible, or at least clear alternative to what you're used to. So no matter what culture you come from, in the world, you show up at Burning Man, you're like, oh, this is clearly something different, and this is clearly something else. And something else isn't usually available. Like most cultures don't want you to really think about something else being available to you as a way of behaving, right? And so just by altering an alternative, you're already kind of shaking people up, and you're already letting people kind of consider things differently. And when you take them to a place, or when they go to a place of that kind of permissiveness, and that kind of acceptance, you know, they're able to do some of that work, and they're able to look inside themselves, and question things that they may not have questioned about themselves. And even if they come out of that experience with all the same answers that they went in with, at least they took a moment to look, and at least then they leave more affirmed with who they are, you know? I don't know if I personally feel like we're creating a utopia, but I know that we're offering people a chance to consider things, and consider things maybe differently than they have before. And that goes from everything to like, how they treat their garbage, how they treat their cigarette butts when they're walking around, to, you know, how they treat each other, to what they think is possible, to what they think they personally can accomplish with the time they have on the earth. And so just offering that up as a space, as a perspective check, and as a permission to explore, to me, is one of the most important things. Yeah. What about, what's your theory on work? You think you can talk about work a little bit? I can talk about work. Hit me a little more specifically. What would you like to know about work? Well, that was another of my favorite experiences as a human being, is coming in for the build, and helping my camp, you know, like helping build the camp. And, but realizing like this, we're all just doing this for love. Like we're doing this because we liking it out with each other, we're doing this because people are gonna enjoy what we're offering, the playa, and suddenly the encumbrance of getting paid, if that makes any sense at all. Or the encumbrance of hourly, working for something other than what most people are taught is the reason you work, was one of the most righteous, beautiful experiences that I've had, and I just, all I could think is like, oh, is this like what the, this must be what people and tribes feel, or this must have been an indigenous, this must have been the experience of people before there was even such a thing as money, you know? And also the addition, and again, I'm not, I don't know what the rules are for Burning Man, so I'm sorry if this is like saying something I'm not supposed to, but drinking, drinking and drinking being a little high while you dig trenches and listening to music, you know what I mean? The way work suddenly becomes the celebration, it becomes its own joy as opposed to like, oh, clockin' in, and I'm gonna get away with just a bare minimum that I need to get away with, and I'm gonna go home and get fuckin' hammered and go to sleep, you know what I'm saying? That's what I mean. I do, I'd love to speak to that. First off, I would like to clear up the fact that my crew works sober, we have an ocean-safe work environment, like we do not allow for any sort of substance abuse while people are working. Of course. Right, so that's a thing. And I think the perception of that is that we're partying all day and drinking all day and whatever, but no, we're not, we're operating heavy equipment, we're keeping each other safe. Real quick, maybe it would be good to distinguish the difference between what you do and the individual camps. Absolutely, and so my role with the DPW and with Burning Man primarily is the manager, the personnel manager for the Department of Public Works. And that means I'm recruiting and then ultimately overseeing the experience of almost everybody under, almost everybody on the DPW, so about 800 people. And so for a great many of those people, I'm their introduction to the experience, I'm bringing them in, I'm kind of orienting them to the experience and checking on them throughout it, so to make sure that they're getting out of it, what they wanna get out of it. And I have thought a lot about the relationship to labor that we have, and especially for the people that come out there, to do a stint with us is at minimum is a couple of weeks, but we get people out there for the long haul. And a lot of the people that can spend three months of their year going to build Burning Man is, they're on the younger side, they're in a place in their life where they've got a lot more fluidity, right? Yeah. And so when you have someone in their 20s who's going out there to spend their summer doing that, their relationship with work is still pretty, it's still pretty raw, and it's what society has served up for them. And one of my favorite quotes, in fact, when someone's like, hey, what's your dream job? And the answer being, well, I don't dream of labor, because that notion of labor being something toxic, that labor is something inherently bad, is kind of fused into us because most of us grow up being bribed to do things we wouldn't normally do so that we can, first, maybe get a little extra because we're living with our parents, but then just so we can survive so that we can pay our rent, so that we can pay our bills. And so, I don't know what the percentage is if you go into the world and we're able to poll and ask people if they're doing what they want to do for money, but I don't think everybody is, of course. A lot of people are doing what they need to do to get by or what they feel like they need to do to thrive. Out there, you get someone who for the first time has the opportunity to work very hard and to put in a tremendous amount of effort to do something that they want to do and to give them an immediate reward of the fruits of their labor manifested, just for them to be able to go out there, bust ass, and at the end of it have BlackRock City as an end result and to be able to look at them and be like, hey, you see this thing? You did that, you know? That is, I know for me, that was unprecedented when I went out there for the first time in 1998 and worked on the labor crew. That was unprecedented for me to have BlackRock City as the reward for me just like working an insane amount and working harder than I'd ever worked in my life. And that in turn, the experience of working in DPW for the first time and in the years that followed helped me redefine what labor is for myself. And I hope very much that it does that for anybody that comes across and gets to be on our crew. And I hope that it does anybody who just goes out there and bust ass for a theme camp, you know? Because labor isn't about bribery and it shouldn't be about doing something you don't wanna do so that you can get some shiny reward at the end. It should be about effort is directed towards what you love is the best thing you can do for yourself and for your life, you know? So if we're helping people remember that or recognize that for the first time, then that's fantastic. And I don't just mean DPW, if Burning Man at large gives people an opportunity to go out there and be like, holy shit, I'm gonna counten but now I'm like hammering stakes into the circus tent and I feel better than I've ever felt in my life. There's a lesson there that they can pick up and take home with them if they want, you know? There's something there for them to remember and to internalize if they can't, you know?

That bit of wisdom that you get digging a trench and you've applied your whole damn ego to something. You know what I mean? Like your ego gets stuck in like, I'm a comedian and I blah, blah, blah. And then you're out there digging a trench to run cables so that there could be music and you're happier than you've ever been and you're digging a fucking trench. And it's, you know what I mean? Like, isn't that a little subversive if our whole system is based on this hierarchical centralization of duties? Well, there's something subversive in there. I'm not sure if it's this part. I mean, I'm pretty upfront about it. It certainly will catch you by surprise, but I'm definitely upfront about the fact that labor towards what you love is what you should be doing in this life. That said, I will also tell you that if you'd come to me as a teenager and told me that the happiest times of my life would be picking up garbage and sunflower seeds and cigarette, but two weeks after Burning Man was over in the most hostile place on earth exhausted, I would have been really offended and probably not believed a word you said. And yet that's been some of the best experiences of my life because it is, they say labor of love and that sort of thing, but it's putting effort towards this thing that I deeply care about. It's putting effort towards this thing that I believe in my heart does people good. And that is required. And make no mistake, I get paid. I have a job here, this is my career. And a lot of people in the DPW are paid and there's a lot of volunteers work. So that we're not completely detached from the notion of commerce and of the reality that people have bills to pay in the real world and stuff like that. We can't decouple from a civilization that we're embedded in and entrenched in. But at the same time, there are lessons there for us. And those lessons, you don't have to never get paid again for work to internalize the fact that, oh no, my effort towards something I love has this positive feedback loop for me that I should try to remember and that I should try to internalize and that I should cash in on every chance I get. Yeah, yeah. And I think the other piece of the puzzle there is this is not happening in a vacuum. This is happening among other people who are also not just laboring for love, but also there's a sense of initiation or something, testing, a sense of the healthy forms of that, a sense of like, hey, I wanna prove to y'all that I will work hard for you, because you're my friends and I wanna make sure you know I love you. And so I'm working hard for you just so you see how much I respect you. Absolutely. That kind of primordial sort of like, not ego stuff, but just like, hey, how can I help you? Let me help you. Or like, you know, our camp leader I remember is I'm like, my ego is getting into it on the last day. So I'm like, I'm gonna, I'm working too hard. It's blazingly hot. And I don't know why I'm deciding to be in a hurry, but I remember he like puts his hand on my shoulder, he's like, Duncan, we're all gonna do this together. Why don't you rest for a little while? You're getting really hot. And it was the coolest thing because he knew what I was doing. He'd seen it before, you know, that other. That sort of like, I don't know, that sort of flow of communication that's happening with the game of work or labor happening. Whoa, it's so magical. And that's human nature too, you know? You should always check yourself to make sure that you're getting out of something what you feel is fair compared to what you're putting in, you know, and you were doing that in that moment, right? You were tired and you were cranking, you probably hadn't had any water. And you're looking around being like, wait a minute, I'm supposed to be doing what? Isn't my life something radically different from this? But maybe not, maybe not in that moment. Maybe in that moment, you were just the guy who needed to move some heavy bins and that's just what needed to happen, you know? Yes, that's it, right, right. And that's- And that is ego and it's identity, right? And it's like, who am I in this moment that I'm picking up sunflower seeds from some camp that was like, yeah, it's just nuts, but who you are in that moment is the guy who sees the sunflower seeds and they need picking up. Yeah. And that, in that moment, it dissolves your whole game, it dissolves your identity through work, through labor. And I think that when, you know, and opening up as a cheesy Instagram Burning Man pictures and what I meant by that is if you were to, have never been to the burn and you just see the pictures of the cute girls with fire sticks or whatever, you might get this idea that it's pure hedonism. And it would be easy to think that, but without realizing that actually it's, that's a, you're looking at, that's a work colony there. That's a call, it's like a work, I don't work camp, a labor camp. I mean, it's a city, you know, Black Rock City is a city, cities take effort, you know, there's so much effort that goes into things. And, you know, my role in it and my team's role in it, we just set the stage, the amount of work that comes into it, once the doors open and once 80,000 people show up and do everything they do to make Black Rock City this incredible magic thing, like there's a tremendous amount of effort happening there. And, you know, and it's not the traditional job, it's not the traditional, you know, you're getting a paycheck for this, for thousands and thousands of them, they're out there making art, they're out there creating, and they're out there specifically creating experiences for others and building outward for a community and trying to share and connect and explore with all that. Yeah, I've been thinking about all of that a lot, especially with this year being what it is, you know, we're not in Black, we did get to build Black Rock City this year, the COVID has us all in a really different place. And I've spent this last week, which has been Burn Week traditionally for me, exploring the multiverse and exploring the virtual spaces that people created. I don't know if you've got to do any of that, I meant to ask you that the other day. But, you know, I have been playing around in all of these spaces and you're seeing the exact same thing, what you're seeing there is people who've put in a ton of labor to build virtual environments or to build interactive systems for people that are just like browser-based, right? You don't need a VR headset, you just go and click this clickable map and find your way into Twitch streams and Zoom rooms. And it's all just people, and it's a great reminder that like, you know, everything from that to Black Rock City to just running into somebody on the street and taking a moment to connect with them, like those are all just containers for what we want to do, which is connect with each other, which is, you know, share with each other. And the fact that we, you know, in lieu of Black Rock City, seeing so much effort going into, you know, we had eight recognized universes of the multiverse, right? We had these eight distinct different experiences that were available to people online, some of which still are, so that they could go and explore and connect and not lose some of that feeling of what Black Rock City is, which is a space to explore and connect and discover. Yeah. And so the feeling that that is persistent, whether Black Rock City is happening or not, because this community is so committed to it as an ideal and as a concept, is so inspiring to me. It's really incredible. That's true. Did you get to play around with that at all, man? Well, you know, this is where I'm like, I think this is where I'm a little bit of a weakling in the sense that I saw the virtual Burning Man stuff. I'm like, I just can't do it. I can't do it. It's just, I don't, and you know, maybe just because I saw one quick video of like a SIM DJ waving his hands in front of digitized people and I just thought, oh, no, no. I, it was a moment of weakness, you know, because I was reading some stuff about it that was actually saying that it was one of the most in alt space, this is like a VR journalist. And he was saying it was like one of the most impressive feats of VR that he's ever seen. So now I kind of regret not popping in there, but I just felt, you know, it's so selfish and dumb of me, man, but this year I was going to go back. It was the multiverse, which is one of my favorite concepts. I'm like, oh yeah. My wife was like, go this year to the burn. We just had a baby. I was like, this is going to be a, ah, fuck, really? Really, you want me to go to the Sims burn? I can't do it, man. That is funny, man, and I don't want to call you out, but I mean, the theme was multiverse and given one alternative to Black Rock City, you passed. I know. You didn't do it. I say it was. You're like, oh, here's an alternate version of something I love. No thanks. I don't think so, not today. I know, man, it's such a policy. And we were like, how about eight different versions of that? You were like, nah, I'm good. I like the multiverse, but I want to be in this universe. Damn it. That's great. I'll tell you, I don't know if you were more skeptical than me, I was pretty skeptical. This would have been 23 years in a row on Playa for me. I've been doing this forever. And there are people that I've worked with that have been doing it longer, but I've been doing it for a good stretch. And the idea of, also for some context, I play video games. I spend a lot of time in virtual environments. I love exploring games because of what they represent in terms of experiences someone's trying to get me to have or connections that people are trying to get me to explore. And so I love virtual environments for what they offer. And so I was already halfway on board with the idea. And yet I was like, Burning Man's not going to translate to that. And it was just not into it. But I have been working on the Burning Man Live podcast, as you know. And I got to interview a couple of people that had put together some multiverse, some of the universes in the multiverse. And their enthusiasm for the projects that they were building totally won me over and got me to go and actually bought an Oculus Quest headset. I went and got myself into BRCVR and looked around and had a really good time doing it. I was running around with and just exploring just the art and the people I made. And of course, it's not Black Rock City. And of course, it's not what I'm used to doing with this time. But it was really fascinating. And then that was BRCVR. After that, I went and spent a lot of time in a thing called the Sparkleverse. And the Sparkleverse was this map that sort of functioned like a what, where, when. It was like a map of Black Rock City with all these clickable camps on it. And you would click through on these spaces. And sometimes there would be people in there. And you'd suddenly find yourself in a Zoom room with people. Sometimes you would just click through. And it would be a YouTube video that someone put together about some galactic shrimp trying to find love. And there was all of just this weirdness that was accessible to me. And I explored that for a couple of nights. And then that's ended up being where I wanted to spend my burn night. And so I spent my burn night. I watched the man burn through BurningMan.org and watched it live. And then we went straight to the Sparkleverse. And we were just in this room where someone was DJing and being ridiculous. And we had maybe 100 people in this one Zoom call. All of them just sharing the camera, all of them just dancing and in costume and celebrating that connectivity, celebrating the moment and just reveling. And that was as close to an experience as Black Rock City has brought me. That's as close to something as I was going to get without being able to go even to a club because of COVID, without being able to go into the world and see my friends. Like I was able to sit here in my room and connect with people all over the world. And that was fantastic. Yeah, you know, yeah, I am 100% wrong. I feel like a madder snob, right? I think as VR becomes increasingly realistic, as musk's neural mesh becomes more. Yeah, the neural link. Yeah, that's exciting and weird. Yeah, very exciting. And yeah, there are going to be people who are considered like matterlings or something. It'll be looked down upon. It's like, oh, really? You need to actually be in stuff for it to be real? OK, you've brute. But you know what I mean? Yeah, who likes concepts, right? Who likes using their imagination? Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah, exactly. Like, oh, really? You want that? You want density, I guess, is what you're looking for? Weight? Is that what you're looking for? Weight? You want to be stuck in a gravity well? Fine. But that's where I'm at right now. Interestingly enough, there is a parallel to the conceptualization of beings in alternate dimensions in the god realms in Buddhism or Hinduism or even angelic beings. They're lighter than us. They're not stuck in matter. They're not entrenched in this goop as much as we are. And I think that's what virtual reality is, an example of us technologically lifting ourselves a little out transcending matter. I mean, we are stuck in the goop. And that's why so many people refer to that and refer to like hallucinogenic experiences as they're only comparable kind of touchstone for that as the dream space, right? Where you're not bound to matter, where it's just your consciousness and an endless field of what your mind wants to produce and reflect upon. And so, yeah, I'm fascinated by what virtual spaces have to offer and what we are going to be able to discover the more that ramps up and the more we are dipping ourselves into that. Especially virtual reality is one thing and I've watched it and its limitations shift and grow over time. Augmented reality is gonna change the whole landscape too. The moment that I can have an overlay and make any room I go into look the way I want to. You'd make every experience filled with data that I'd like out of that experience. That's gonna change the game too. And so, we're on a cusp and we're perpetually on a cusp, but we're on a cusp of something really incredible with what that is going to unlock in terms of the way that we all experience reality, all of us that choose to engage with it in that way. This is what I love about Burning Man, is that it gives you a chance to go into this bubble and not be whatever the thing was that you walked in there as. And very quickly it lets you become unencumbered by the whatever the moral, ethical, whatever your own like hangups. It was like two days and I was wearing my friend's blouse and I remember thinking, God, this is perfect. This is perfect for the deserts. I mean, why have I been wearing jeans? This is not fair. This is not fair. Like, you know what I mean? We've been scammed as men that we don't get to wear this. This is so comfortable. But I look back on that level of freedom. And now we see, it's one of the craziest things when you see how triggered straight dudes are about trans people. It's the weirdest thing. It's like, you know, you don't run into, how often are you even running into trans people? I'm talking about like, you hear these like dudes who are just doing rants about how unhappy they are about whatever the particular trans right situation is. I find it to be flabbergasting. Flabbergasted? I'm flabbergasted by it. Whatever the fucking word is, I'm confused by it. But I think what we're looking at there is the very beginning of an earthquake of like true identity tyranny. Because what you're talking about and what augmented reality is gonna offer us, and not just augmented reality, but I think probably is CRISPR technology gets better. We are looking at a time where we do not have to adhere to the form we were born into anymore. Not just gender, but ethnicity, everything, size, everything. It's gonna become more and more malleable either through some digital overlay or even at some atomic reconfiguration. And I think that's one of the cool things about Burning Man is it produces a place where you can play around with identity itself and how fucking just manacled we are to ourself. Absolutely. And that's why, when I talk about this stuff, I tend to talk about Burning Man being a place of exploration and acceptance because those things, while not being a part of our principles directly, they're kind of woven into the culture in this big way for the individual experience, in my opinion and from my perspective. And you're absolutely right about that earthquake coming in culture. That earthquake's already happening in my opinion and started when the internet was able to connect us all. And I remember being in the group of extremely naive and optimistic people that was like, yeah, we'll just connect each to each other. And it'll be incredible because that'll allow some isolated weirdo that thinks that they're just the strangest thing on earth to understand that there are not only dozens if not hundreds of people just like him, but probably also a magazine dedicated to whatever his weird things are. And it's gonna allow us to not feel so alone, because we're gonna be able to stare at the vastness of humanity, everyone who can connect. And we're gonna be able to recognize each other in each other. But what I underestimated vastly was how how xenophobic and how hard-baked into culture the preservation of the normal or whatever normal is from an individual's perspective is. And so seeing how many people looked into that vastness of humanity and could not handle what they saw or just rejected what they saw or were terrified or were filled with hatred. I was not expecting that at all. And I recognized my own optimism in that. I recognize exactly where my failing was. And it was because I was in this, my own bubble of being very technocentric and being very interested in watching us connect and evolve as a species. A lot of people are not thinking about that. And what they're thinking about is their own identity. And when they see something that is not comfortable to them, they see their whole way of life threatened. And in some cases, they're correct because there are disruptors. And there are things not necessarily negative, but there are things out there that are gonna disrupt your worldview. There are things out there that are gonna make it so that your sense of what the world is can't remain the same because you've seen these things. But that's a positive thing, man.

If your identity is a matter fascist, if that's based on where you're like, because think how much work people have put into being muscular. You know how much work somebody puts into getting abs. And if anything comes out, anything comes out that gets you insta-abs, insta-ripped, any kind of genetic technology, that is going to be so scorned by muscular people who spent their whole damn lives getting biceps. Now all of a sudden everybody's ripped. What? This is not fair. You can't just do that. Sure, they are going to be scorned. And then that scorn is going to completely get crushed under the gattaca-like wave of suddenly everybody having what they want in terms of physicality. And then suddenly there's going to be this entire class system of people who have augmented and are now stronger, faster, smarter and more capable and a bunch of people that are purists for whatever reason they choose to be that are getting outranked and outclassed and outmatched by people who have chosen to level up. And I'm not saying that's any utopian scenario either. There's going to be disaster inherent at every turn on that path. But that is going to happen because that's almost what almost always happens when something new comes along. You have people who reject it. And then if that thing is really something designed to or by proxy, it embedders people, that's something that is going to help people have better lives, then the people that reject it get left behind. And that's just how it's always going to play. That is the nature of evolution. That's the nature of growth. If you don't grow, you get crushed under the wheel. That's right. And do you think that's why, one of my favorite things to read every year when Burning Man happens is the Drudge Report because it's a matter of time before an article pops up on the Drudge Report about Burning Man being like a satanic, hedonistic, pagan festival. Some people have even on Twitter, I remember someone sending me this sinister tweet saying congratulations for participating in a human sacrifice ritual. And they meant it. And they were really like, disturbed by Burning Man. People are disturbed by it. They do see it as a threat to Protestant fundamentalist concepts. And I mean, not just like basic homophobic people, but just all matter of people who want things to stay the way they are. They see Burning Man as being a failure. They see Burning Man as being a mark of the beginning of a forest fire, occultism, satanism, sex, drugs. Like, yeah. And so do you think this is why y'all have been hitting so many roadblocks recently when it comes to the festival proceeding? It seems like every year, but they're making it a little bit more difficult for it to happen. I think there are a number of reasons for that. I don't necessarily think that they're bound to the sort of core tenets of the philosophy of the thing. I don't think that the people, I would not say that the things that make it difficult for us to throw Burning Man and the challenges that we face on the regular are from, they're coming from a mindset where people think that we're an existential threat to them. I think that that narrative of that Burning Man is this thing that is going to upset the fabric of society or reality. And that's been around since, I think there was like a 700 Club episode on us forever ago. And that narrative has always been there, but we're just one target in a long string of things that we're going to end the world or upset society because if your worldview is based around the idea that what we do is right and what everyone else does that's different not only is wrong, but can't exist and can't be tolerated, you're going to run into constant opposition and you're going to constantly be threatened and challenged by anything else in the world. And so I just see us being on that list of things that have come along and that people are threatened by because they are afraid that we're going to upset reality or society or that their children are going to run off and join whatever we're doing. And I'm not saying that there aren't people out there who don't think that we're some sort of cult, but I can't speak to that worldview because I don't sit in it. I know that, I know that, I know why I do what I do and I know what Burning Man does is really positive for people. And I see that happening again and again. Not for everyone, nothing is inherently positive for every person. And I've definitely, like I said earlier, seen people go out there and have awful experiences, but ultimately, if our existence is threatening, I don't think we're the problem. Wow, yeah, well said. Well, I mean, is sugar threatening to a glass of water? You know, no, it's just going to make it sweeter. But there is a, I have felt when I've been out there, oh shit, this is one of the things. Like, you know, they synthesize LSD. They, Hoffman synthesizes LSD. This simple chemical react, well, not simple, it's actually very difficult to make based on my like late night examination on YouTube. We're like, maybe I'll make some LSD. No, I won't. I don't know what those tubes are. What the fuck is that thing? Where do you get that? But, you know, if you think about that, chemical reaction takes place at Sando's laboratories and you look at what that chemical reaction then did to the brain chemistry of our entire species and continues to do. And all the subsequent artistic creations that came from it and all the bad trips that came from it and all the rough things you hear about it. But if you consider that one initial synthesis and the ingestion of the chemical created a neurological wildfire that swept through humanity and completely shifted our consciousness, this is what I'm talking about when I think in terms of like, and I think threat is probably the wrong word. Talking about like things that have the potential of a sort of conversion, a cultural conversion or something. You know what I'm saying? Sure, and that is an ontological threat for some people, you know, the idea that conversion will shake up their belief system and I get that. But, you know, change is inherent to life. Change is a part of existence and how you react to change, how you react to growth, how you react to the things in the world that are different, like that speaks to not only your character but the character of the world view that you have, you know? Man, you are the perfect leader for getting people out there organized to work because I would have, I bet you, I would have a million meltdowns, man. I don't know how. We're gonna find out when you come to DPW, you know, you're gonna come do a couple of weeks on my crew and you're gonna understand it from a visceral level and you're gonna be able to speak to it in a different way because you're gonna see it from the inside and it's not gonna kill you and it's not gonna break you like you're thinking right now. It's gonna change the way that you see the whole affair. So just you wait, man, you're gonna do fine. And thank you for saying so. You know, I try to lead from a perspective of, you know, I started off in DPW as a volunteer. I started off just like doing whatever jobs there were and then I was on a couple of specific crews as a volunteer. So I didn't get hired on to just manage a bunch of people. Yeah. I came up from the volunteer ranks because I believe in this thing and because that I've been a part of it for as long as I have. Well, you're also a legend out there. I don't mean to flatter you, friend, but you're kind of, you are a legend. I mean, like, and I'm sorry if this, like people working in the org or whatever, like, come on, man, don't do that to him. But you kind of are, you know what, there, you, like I remember when I met you, there was like a lot of like, you know, that is, you probably are aware of that, right? That's really kind of you to say. One of the functions of my job is that every morning at 7.30 sharp, I stand on a podium and I deliver a morning meetings, I host a morning meeting, but really what I'm up there doing is orating and kind of rallying the crew to get everything done, right? And it's, everybody comes down to our place, our depot where we kind of stage out for the morning and I shout, good morning, DPW to hundreds of people. And then I just start talking and I tell them about what's on the docket for the day and they all know their jobs, they know what they're doing, they don't need me to do that, but I'm there just kind of given them the lay of the land and I'm telling them how the day is gonna be. And what I have found in doing that for more than a decade is that when you are the person on stage in the morning, people start to associate you with the thing, very strong. And so for a lot of people, you know, I am the voice of the organization. For a lot of people, I'm the voice of DPW because that's the role that I've been able to play here. And so yeah, I get recognized for that and for the role I play with DPW very specifically, pretty regularly. And it's very flattering to be associated with something so amazing that I really, truly do believe in. And to be able to represent the hard work of so many people who I love and respect, it's a true honor to be able to represent that. May I ask now, definitely say no if you need, if you can't, we've got about, let's see here, eight more minutes, something like that. Oh man, I could talk to you all day, what a shame. Okay, beautiful, but I wonder if I could get you to give a good morning DPW to the planet right now, as though you- Oh man, I don't know if I couldn't, here's why. It's because I have my speaking voice that you hear right now and then I have this growling shout of, that's my orating voice. And I don't know if I could do a growling shout in my room without, like, I don't know how that's gonna play. Plus I'm not in the dust, I'm not in care. You gotta be there. You have to be, you become a reservoir for, you become a reflector of the group, I get it. Look, you're a matter snob. See, you gotta be in that, you gotta, we still are matter. We're still in matter, I understand man. But like, can you speak a little bit though to the, you know, another thing I took away from Burning Man is a real sense of the dangers of centralization, the dangers of charismatic leaders. The, you know, what I, maybe this is different in different camps, but what I loved about my camp is that obviously someone's gotta facilitate and organize and be in charge. Like you can't just, it's not gonna happen like a coral reef or some bullshit like that. Someone's gotta be like, put a tarp under the generator or we, you know, you've gotta get that fixed or, but can you talk a little bit about like dealing with simultaneously being a leader, but in a society that seems to promote, I don't wanna say leaderlessness, but definitely the idea is it's more of a team than a... Sure, and if you wanna meet a group of people who are not interested in being led or in authority, I can't wait for you to meet the rest of the DPW because managing people who have less than zero interest being managed has been a fantastic and fascinating journey. And I'm honestly, I come to it from a place of, I have a tremendous amount of personal disdain for authority. And so being in authority myself, you know, I get it. When I see some kid that's like, who the fuck are you trying to tell me what to do? I'm like, well, you know, that's a fair point, man. And honestly, I'm the person who is responsible for trying to get you to do the thing. And it's gonna help us both have a good experience if you do, and if you don't, I get it, but also you're gonna have to go, you know? So it's like, I don't resent anybody who's not interested in leadership. And I can't, it was not interested in being led, I should say, it was not interested in being managed. She's not interested in just falling under the mechanisms of authority. But, you know, and anarchy, you know, I don't want to speak to it in a critical way. Anarchy is a philosophical concept is something that's incredible because self-determination is incredible. But at the end of the day, you know, if you want to get complex things done on a large scale, some sort of organization is necessary. And hierarchical organization is something that we are familiar with and used to and that we understand internally at a base reptile brain level and tribal level, wherever you want to place that in our evolutionary history. And so it is easy to apply hierarchical leadership to things and have everyone just get it. And if you want to accomplish things that are complex, if you want to accomplish things that are large over time, you know, you do need some sort of structure and this structure works. And I've had that conversation with people many times too, when they're just like, I thought this was just like a, you get to just feel however you want and do, which is like, no, no, this is a job. It's not just an adventure, it's a job. And you, and this is a thing that needs doing because you're a piece of the puzzle here. And then this other department is an intrinsic piece of the puzzle here. And all of these things have to come together in order for us to do this amazing large scale thing. And so it's easy in my experience to give people to buy into that once they understand that, and again, this ties back to what we were talking about earlier with them, their whole relationship with labor and my whole relationship with labor when I was young, being tied to being bribed to do stuff I don't want to do. You know, and that's where part of the disdain for authority comes from. It's because authority in most of our lives has come along to us and made us do a bunch of stuff that we weren't interested in doing or punished us for doing what we wanted to do in the first place. And so to help people contextualize it in a different way and start to internalize it in a different way and understand that structure can be used for good or can be used for something that they want to see accomplished and that it is there to help them understand how they can be a part of it most effectively. You know, I feel like that's really valid in something that I encounter really regularly. Wow, thank you for that. That's a very, it's nice to hear that. I feel to say, I mean, as much as I love the, well, I can't say I even understand anarchism, but from what I've read, it's a beautiful humanist. It's an idea that we're all humans are amazing. Humans are amazing. We tend to do good things together, but yeah, it's like, there's a saying that emerged, I believe, from before Ram Dass became Ram Dass when he's Richard Alper hanging out with Tim Leary. There's a story of someone going up to Millbrook that incredible mansion where they're all tripping out at. I think it was there. They're all doing acid. They were like painting weird shit on the side of the mansion and like Tim Leary's riding a horse around and stuff. And they were like, you know what, they'd be drinking vials of LSD, but there's a story of someone going in there after like, you know, I guess it'd been some time that they'd been sort of, they really were trying to, they were scientists who were sort of trying to push it to the furthest boundary they could, you know, and it's a beautiful thing they were doing. But I remember the story is someone went in there and like the dishes, no one had been doing the dishes. It was like the flies in the kitchen and piles of food everywhere. And that's where the saying, someone's gotta do the dishes came from, which is somebody's gotta do the damn dishes while all y'all are like melting your DNA and traveling back in time to your protoplasmic identity. Somebody's gotta get you some food. Someone's gotta cook for you. And that to me is the one of the, I keep saying things I love about burning. That's another cool thing about it is those rolls switch. Do you know what it's like? It's a place where, yeah, sometimes you could be traveling backwards in time to check out your protoplasmic identity, but sometimes look, it's your turn to fucking do the dishes, man, you don't need to travel back in time right now and be a protoplasm, because everyone else has been doing dishes for you or cooking for you. That's exactly it, man, that's exactly it. And that's when I talk about the baggage of utopia as a term, it's like, I always picture all these philosophers dreaming of some world where they don't have to shop, wouldn't carry water, but shopping wouldn't carry water is the thing, you do it before enlightenment, you do it after enlightenment, it is the thing, it's the work that you have to do to get by in this life. And yeah, you look at any communal living situation and I feel constantly in danger of that if they don't have structure in place, of everyone suddenly opting out of the thing, because the work has to be done, right? That's the nature of the reality that we're in, is that there's work that has to get done. And if you don't commit yourself to contributing to the work, you're never gonna find yourself in a happy situation. And if you try to design a system where no one has to do the work, you are gonna find failure again and again because that work has to get done. And in the system where no one has to do work, which I honestly, I think that is one of the things we can look forward to, unfortunately, is full automation. I would say there is a real possibility of full automation. I'm not saying in our lifetimes probably, but who the fuck knows? But at some point, swarms of nanobots that can make themselves into any tool and listen to you like you're Alexa. You know, and then at that point, that's where things get really interesting because so much of our identity is attached to work and to not just work, but the heroics of work. You know, how wonderful is it when somebody gets up and washes the dishes when you don't want to? You know, they feel good, you're happy, so much of like how we express love is through work. Would it, would fall? You hear those arguments come up a lot, especially, you know, in these last few years around things like universal basic income, right? If you take away people's labor, you take away their identity. And I do think that that is true for a minute, you know? But the scary part of that is that, to society as it stands at the moment, is that that won't last. People will find out what else they like doing besides identifying as, you know, an electrician or whatever it is that they have done. Not to say, you know, that any profession that you choose can't be wonderful and fulfilling. But if you take away people's ability to identify as what they have identified now, I truly believe, what they have identified as now, I truly believe that they will find the next thing and they will find their identity in other pursuits. And I hope that those other pursuits are things that they are passionate about rather than the things that they found themselves skilled at enough to get by or that they had access to and fell into but were never thrilled by, you know? And there will always be people that love doing things, whether money's involved or not. And I believe that we all have those things in us. And, you know, I don't see an absence of those things in people, I see an absence of the luxury of exploring themselves to find out what those things are. And so. Do you worry though that with Burning Man itself, do you ever, you know, I'm just gonna ask it straight out. Do it, man. Do you think it'll go on forever? Nothing lasts forever, Duncan. I mean, it's not even happening now, man. But that's Black Rock City, right? So when you say Burning Man, I know you mean Black Rock City. Yeah. But Burning Man's not just Black Rock City. You know, Burning Man is you and me meeting four years ago and then making time to talk over the internet, you know, right now and spend an hour together connecting with each other and sharing ideas. Like, you know, all of that stuff, like I said earlier, that's just a container for what humans wanna do. And that's grow and learn and connect. And that's again, that's me being an optimist. That's me being who I am and bringing my perspective to the table. You ask the next person sitting next to me at work what Burning Man is, they'll give you an entirely different take. Yeah, that's, I know it, right. And I'm glad that you keep saying that over and over because that's another beautiful thing about it is like, you know, everyone has a different conceptualization of this beautiful event that happens once a year. And for me though, you really do embody it, what the utopian qualities of it. And it really is a thrill to get to chat with you. And I really appreciate your time, man, because you have made my day and your invite to come work for a couple of weeks out there has made my year. And I will take you up on that.

Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Hello friends. It is I, Dee Trussell, and you are listening to the Ducatrussell Family Hour podcast. Today is Wednesday, November 9th. The day after the American presidential election. And it looks like Donald J. Trump, host of the Apprentice, host of Celebrity Apprentice, is going to be the next president of the United States of America. And many of you are a little upset about this. So I've got a clip I'm going to play to you that could be the antidote to your fear. This is a clip from a fantastic audio book called Experiments in Truth. And this is Ram Dass talking about righteousness and love. At one point I was studying with a very beautiful man named Anagorica Menindra. He was a Theravadan Buddhist teacher. Lovely, lovely man. And I came to him one time and I said to him, Menindraji, I am so angry because I had so much anger in me for so many years and keeping grudges. And he said, Ram Dass, don't hold on to what is just old karma running off. Your anger is just old karma running off. And one of the traps that I saw that I was caught in was the trap of righteousness that I used to justify my anger. But I saw that love freed me back into the ocean and that anger didn't. And that I would rather be free than right. And that's a scary and big one. And that if somebody does an abhorrent action, I have to cultivate the capacity to, as Kabir said and Maharaj used to quote, Kabir said, do what you do with another being, but never put them out of your heart. Do what you do with another being, but never put them out of your heart. That is a total prescription for social activists. Oppose, stand up, defy, confront, do what you do with another person. You stop their action. You may have to imprison that person so that they don't hurt other people. You do what you must do, but you do it without closing your heart. And I don't mean the fraudulent, oh, I didn't close my heart. I mean, really, the quality of do what you do, but do it always in the presence of the beloved. There is an incredible poem by Thich Nhat Hanh, very beautiful Vietnamese monk. Do not say that I'll depart tomorrow because even today I still arrive. Look at me. I arrive in every second to be a bud on a spring branch, to be a tiny bird whose wings are still fragile, to be a caterpillar in the heart of a flower, to be a jewel hiding itself in a stone. I still arrive in order to laugh and to cry, in order to fear and to hope. The rhythm of my heart is the birth and death of all that are alive. I am the mayfly metamorphizing on the surface of the river. I am also the bird which, when spring comes, arrives in time to eat the mayfly. I am a frog swimming happily in the clear water of a pond. I am also the grass snake who, approaching in silence, feeds itself on the frog. I am the child in Uganda, all skin and bones. My legs as thin as bamboo sticks. I am also the merchant of arms selling deadly weapons to Uganda. I am the twelve-year-old girl refugee on a small boat who throws herself into the ocean after being raped by a sea pirate. I am also the pirate, my heart not yet capable of seeing and loving. I am a member of the Politburo with plenty of power in my hands. I am also the man who has to pay his debt of blood to my people, dying slowly in a forced labor camp. My joy is like spring, so warm it makes flowers bloom in all walks of life. My pain is like a river of tears, so full it fills up all the four oceans. Please call me by my correct names so that I can hear at the same time all my cries and my laughs so that I could see that my joy and my pain are but one. Please call me by my correct names so that I could become awake so that the door of my heart be left open, the door of compassion. Open the door of compassion, sweeties. Don't slam it in Trump's face just because he's the creator of Trump's stakes and a self-proclaimed pussy grabber. This is a fantastic opportunity for you to continue to practice your ability to find compassion for all people. If you're a Trump supporter, this is a chance for you to find compassion for people who found in Hillary Clinton some representation of a humanistic ideal. And for those of you who are followers of Hillary Clinton, this is a chance for you to find compassion for the hundreds of thousands of people who felt completely left out by a bought and sold shitty political system. This is a chance for everybody to practice compassion. And it doesn't matter if you fail in the attempt. It doesn't matter if you do a belly flop as you jump off of this spiritual high dive into the waters of compassion. It's the attempt. That's all that matters. What you don't want to do is slam that door shut and sit in the corner of your room and rock back and forth in the fetal position as you tweet angry shit to white people, white women, white males, or whoever you feel is to blame for Donald J. Trump being president of the United States. Open the door and invite them in. Make them some tea and see if maybe they have something to teach you. You might be surprised. All right. That's all I got to say about that. Well, I'm sure there'll be other stuff that I say later on. This particular podcast with Danielle Bilelli happened yesterday prior to the election. So we didn't know who the president was going to be. But it's not just about the presidential election. It actually gets into some very heavy duty territory about what it is to exist and what it is to be filled with emptiness and what is our true identity. This is a real blazer, friends. I hope you'll stick around. We're going to jump right into it. But first, some quick business. This episode of the DTFH is brought to you by meundies.com.

This is a fantastic podcast with one of my favorite people on earth, Danielli Bollelli, who is the host of two amazing podcasts, The Drunken Doughist and History on Fire. I will have links to these podcasts in the comments section of this episode at DuncanTrustle.com. Now everybody, please welcome to the DuncanTrustle Family Hour podcast, the brilliant Danielli Bollelli. Welcome, welcome on you, that you are with us. Shake hands, don't be too blue. Welcome to you. Mr. Bollelli, we got to start this off with the most important question, what everybody wants to know. Let's go. Did you vote? I did, I did. Yeah? It's painful, man. It's painful? Yeah, I mean this whole thing is just, politics has never been, you know, when in the history of the world you find awesome candidates, very rarely, if ever. Really? But there's a difference between not having the greatest candidates and having the shit show that we're looking at now, that's painful, that's really. Is there a historical corollary for this election that you can think of? I mean, again, to me, most elections are the lesser of the evil. They're rarely ever, I can think of a case where I can think, oh, if only that person got in office, but still, lesser of the evil, even like a few years ago, by comparison, look awesome from far to now. I mean, I look at Clinton, I look at Trump, I have just projectile vomiting. The only satisfaction of this election is that one of them has to lose. Of course, that satisfaction will be overshadowed by the fact that one of them has to win. And that's where it's at. Oh, my God, you're right, because I do keep thinking, like, God, the look on Hillary Clinton's face, if she lost to Trump, will be so funny, and the look on Trump's face, if he loses to Clinton, will be glorious. You guys listening, you know who won, we don't know who won, but you're right, no matter what, no matter who wins. We're fucked anyway. But are we fucked? I keep thinking of Ebola, I keep thinking of any other thing they try to terrify us with. Yeah, no, we're not fucked at the end of the day. We still get to do what we do. The problem is, I don't think that the President of the United States is really the most powerful person on earth. Fuck that, you know, they can barely get Congress to do anything they want, let alone. But at the same time, it's true that it does give a push in a certain direction of the affairs that not only in the US, but also worldwide. Again, I don't want to overstate it like super important, but at the same time, it's not completely unimportant either. I remember when I hated Bill Clinton, I just could not stand the dude, and when Bush came into office about six months into it, after my whole thing was like, oh, they are all equally shit, doesn't matter, then I started looking at George W. Bush. I was like, Bill, where are you? Please come back. And again, and I hated Clinton. So there are unfortunately different degrees of shit that do have a bit of an impact. There seems to be a growing distrust of the entire system. I have never seen it at this level before. I agree. And it seems like the one thing that everyone agrees is that the system is corrupt and the truth that's coming in from the media is not the truth. Sure. So it's a fascinating thing in that the entire country, it feels as though the entire country or the majority of people in the country all agree that we don't know what the truth is. But the problem is half of us think that the truth is going in one direction, and the other half think that whatever that truth is is in the other direction. And so this is the incredible division. The division isn't some people are for Trump and some people are for Clinton. It feels like the division is more like some people think we're being lied to one way, some people think we're being lied to another way, but the majority of us, it feels like we all feel like we're being lied to. Right. And I mean, it's one of those things like just because you're, what is it? Just because you're paranoid, it doesn't mean they are not really watching you. Right. The classic thing is like, there are of course 7000 bullshit conspiracy theories out there. But at the same time, there are 7000 bullshit conspiracy theories because we have seen enough of real bad shit that gets done. That of course makes you think if this is true, then it's entirely possible that these other 20 things can be true. Yeah. And it's, yeah, I mean, it's, I don't think it's different. I think back, back in the day, you know, 1940s, 1930s, people were just blind to the games that were being played behind, you know, underneath the table. The games have always been played. I don't think it's any more corrupt today than it was a hundred years ago. I just think that we know more about it and it's more in your face. So you think people, so back in the 40s and the 30s, people really did trust the government. I think more so for sure. I mean, even if you look at the wars that the United States have been involved in, you know, you did not see that degree of mass protest on that scale for World War One or World War Two, or you start seeing it with Vietnam in a way that you have never seen before, you know. And after that, there really aren't too many wars after that, that many people are all gung-go-about. You know, you do have this sense of cynicism toward government. Again, only because the veil has been pulled back and you see what really goes on behind the curtains. Right. But that shit was going on all along. It's just that I think people knew less about it. You know, you had less sources of information. You had less stuff to bring it out in the open. That's it. What do you think was the, historically, the least corrupt government that ever existed? Off the top of your head. I know this might be something you need to research. Yeah, because I mean, even if you go back, before even corporations were a big deal, right? You feel, okay, then before corporations, that's when things were cooler. Look at the whole political machines of the 1800s when, you know, you walk into somebody's office and say, I can get you 10,000 Irish votes. What, how many jobs in the police department, in the fire department can you get? And then you go into the next one and you say, I can get you 10,000 votes. How many, what can you give me? You know, people openly sold votes, both and sold. Often was a long ethnic line. You know, you have a community like Irish community, German community, something where you had immigrants who lived together in the neighborhood, who had zero power. The only power they had was to band together and try to sell their votes to the highest bidder and get a good deal that way. Sell for currency or sell for favors? Sell for favors. Job, if you get elected, you has 50 jobs as police officer. You has 100 jobs in the fire department. You was, you know, that kind of stuff. And that was not considered outside the norm. No, that was just how it was done. You couldn't go past a certain point, but it was pretty blatant. You know, it wasn't, the corruption was major. So people even then were bought. Totally. So, okay, outside of the United States, can you think, even an indigenous people, can you think of a political system that wasn't corrupt? I think my personal preference, things tend to work great as long as people know each other and they have the option to live. What works great? When people know each other. We are talking about a face-to-face community. Yeah. And where people have the option to live. Right. Because, you know, if you have a tribe, if you have 600 people where everybody know each other, there's a certain degree of flexibility involved. There's a certain degree of, you know, you're not just going on campaign promises. You're going on, you know, you've known this person all your life. You know everything about them. So it's a little, and then the option to get out also is important so you don't end up like the branch Davidians or something, this cultish tiny thing. But I like face-to-face community. And particularly today, I think that's where, to me, is really interesting, is how can we get the best of the old model of the tribes without all the limitations that go with being stuck with 400 people. And that's all the people you know and you're cut off from the rest of the world. How do we combine kind of a global consciousness with a tribal one? Because the reality is that there are great things in both. You know, I don't believe that it's all, let's go back to the past in tribes and then everything will be great because first, it's not possible. Second, it's not even desirable. There are certain things that the modern world has brought that are awesome that you wouldn't want to give up. By the same token, there are things in the modern world that kind of sucks and that we could use. So to me, it's like finding the best of both worlds and figure out how we can combine it. Didn't Stalin have some system called the... like weren't there little clusters of... Do you remember that? Yeah. Of course, in that case, he's running a super totalitarian regime. So even to the idea... What were they called? I don't remember right now. They're called... God damn it, it's alright, let's have my time. But it was like even Stalin recognized this concept of like let's have these small little groups of people who are... I guess that's what... Is that what the electoral college is supposed to represent? Or is that the... Yeah, but even then, even a state. A state is not a community. Even a city is not a community. There are way too many people. To me, a face-to-face community is one where you can sit around the fire with people and talk things out. Right. And it only works in small numbers. Yeah. It only works at most when you're talking about a few hundreds. Above that is too big, you know, it's... And a few hundred is massive. Yeah, it's already huge. And even a few hundred, it starts spinning out. Yeah, two hundred or something. It's probably about the limit of what you can keep track to on... More than that is insane. But yeah, when we think of the human family. Even within families, there's deception. Oh yeah. Deep deception. Right. And so it's like when you look at the... You know, I keep thinking that, you know, Trump's statement. Make America great again. And then I think, God, man, what if he was saying, make yourself great again? Instead of make America great again. Like someone was running a presidency on the concept of... Let's see if we can make our individual selves fantastic. Yep. Our country naturally will be great. That would be such a more exciting platform to run on. Big time, human development, their individual self-perfection, as opposed to your bunch of promises that are bullshit anyway. Yeah. And if the president was maybe saying, like, look, I know that I am a piece of shit. Like I've been looking at these videos of the terrible things I said, I was on blow. You know, like I lied about not being on blow. Guys, I was on blow. Right. And I'm not using that as an excuse. Clearly inside of me, there is some awful lack of harmony between my masculine and feminine side. I'm scared of women. They've got this power. Let's face it, guys. You want to know what happened? My fucking mom used to beat me with a comb while she was jerking me off. And like it fucked with my head, man. And then I got all this money. And you know, and if Hillary Clinton is like, God, you know, guys, I like, when I was younger, I really wanted things to be good. But then I got in a political system and like I married this fucking asshole. You guys have no idea what he did to me. Like you, you have no idea. He emotionally abused me in the most horrific ways. I'm not saying I'm going to, I'm a victim because I fucking abused him too. And God damn it. I, we got money and then I wanted more and I don't know what I was doing. This presidency is going to be based on me working on myself because I suck. I need your help and we can all work on ourselves together because your shitheads too. Let's face it, your shitheads too. Probably that's a cool president, man. My only hope is Duncan for president in 2020. God, you know, it'd be fun, man. I, you know, that you and me and like a group of, and that would be super fun to like, you know, have to deal because you could do things like the moment you have like Alex Jones, who starts bugling that you're in the Illuminati, you invite him to the White House. You're like, Hey, we're going to give you a tour. We're just going to let you go. Right. Check it out. Here's the secret door. Yeah. The door is in the chamber. It's George Washington. Like, I don't know. He like when that's where Kennedy fucked some models, you know, but look, just check it out, man. I don't think we're in the Illuminati. Have him meet like the wealthiest people. Like this is Dan Williams. You don't even know who he is, but he's a multi-billion. Williams is like, Alex, I'm a fan. I don't think I'm in the Illuminati. I just ended up with a lot of money. Right. You know, like just like we could do that. We could let people in. Yeah. Like, look, I don't know. Are we in the, are you in the, I don't think there is an Illuminati. And then just diffuse the insanity by complete inclusivity and openness and see what happens. You know, bring the most vile racists over the most vile. You know, did you hear that story, man, about how there was like a black dude who started making friends with the KKK in his city. He started just intentionally getting around them and making friends with them. And eventually he led to that, that branch of the KKK disbanding. Seriously? Yeah. Cause they were like, oh yeah. We were wrong. We were just wrong. That's fucking genius. No, I did not. You already started. Yeah. Awesome. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know what I'm saying though, man. This whole fucking anytime the election cycle happens and, and we all get fixated on this garish insanity. Yeah. It feels like our attention gets taken away from what is truly within our control. Totally. Cause none of this shit ultimately is, none of this is under our control and none of these are under our control. So that's a, I realize I spend way too much fucking time on social media sometime and it's good to, you know, there are great things that pop out of it. But sometime I get too, and the election is a perfect example, but it's not the only one, getting wrapped into all these arguments of people going one way, going the other. And it's all fucking wasted time at the end of the day because none of these really makes a difference in my life, in somebody else's life. And by difference, I mean a positive difference. Right. It's more of just this background noise of tossing things back and forth, which really nobody wants to listen to the other side anyway. Yeah. There's kind of the I'm right fuck you all. Yeah. So it's like, why are we even doing this? You know, it's like, so to me, my approach has been, and my life has improved considerably as a result. I do like Facebook, check it twice in a day. Well, just take a look, same thing, Twitter or something. Take a look. Okay. Done. Okay. Let's check it again at night. I'm not saying discard it all because there are useful things with it. I'm done with, there are benefits, but at the same time, there's so much clutter, just noise. God, your discipline. Yeah. The discipline to do that. My beady little eyes are fixated on that fucking flow of Twitter, like a rat on cheese, man. Me too. I'm just like bulge my eyes bulging for no reason. Just like, I went to, you know, went to the gym today, again, trying to resurrect my health. Like, you know, like the zombie is trying to clamber out of the fucking grave made out of cake. You know, when you're like, God, I'm going to go back to the gym, but even to the gym, I'm, you know, what, you know, it's been getting me back on the treadmill as fucking the news because I don't have cable. So like, I'm like, God, I want to go watch these idiots about the election. But the, the, the, even there, I'm still fucking staring at my phone. I know, man. That's why that's, I'm not saying it because I mastered this in any way, shape, or form. I just started like three weeks ago and I'm seeing, and I suck at it because I say twice a day and that's been five times or something. But it's not this 24 seven that if I'm awake every other second, I'm distracted, I'm turned, I keep doing this shit because I realize I wasted months. Even when I don't think I do, when I'm managing my time well, I'm really not. Right. I'm getting constantly distracted by all this shit. And you know, for every good thing that come out of it, there are about hours that go by with just me having wasted time that I could have used in something else. Can you name a good thing that's come out of it? I mean, occasionally, like since I see that then I can use either in podcast or writing or something like, Oh, that's an awesome story. I found out about it or something like that, you know, or occasionally you get into conversation with people, maybe not posting, but you message each other where you only think of them because you see them on Facebook type of thing. And then you're like, Oh, fuck, this is an awesome person. Why didn't I touch base and you do that? So a little that's good is there. But then there's this, you know, the wake up call was actually from my daughter because it was like maybe three weeks ago or so when she was talking and she was talking about how she was looking forward to her grandpa visiting because she said, Oh, she's he's the only one who plays with me. And I'm like, what the fuck are you talking about? I play with you all the time. And she's like, Yeah, you do, but you're also looking at your computer too. And you're playing with me. And then you look at your computer and you're playing with me. And I'm like, I am an asshole. And you're right. You know, you're completely right. But he was a perfect blow because he woke me up to the realization of, Oh, shit. She's completely right. One hundred percent. And I'm not giving my attention to one thing at a time ever. I'm constantly doing six things at once. And it's bullshit because I'm not really any more productive or especially fucking checking Facebook. That's not exactly helping me. So why the fuck don't I just turn it off? Yeah, check it later in three hours. But for the time being, I'm just gonna play with my damn kid. And that's it. Nothing else. When you turn your attention away from technology and focus on the natural world, how do you feel? I think there's something really relaxing about it because the pace is low down. Yeah. There isn't this constant, oh, this new article popped up or there's, you have a new notification message, things, there's all this shit popping up, like blinking lights go off everywhere. Suddenly everything is like, ah, okay, we're here. There's a sky above me. There's an earth below me. You feel things more. You start in a way. It's like everything they say about mindfulness happens kind of naturally to some degree. Once you slow down this constant flow of external shit, then there's also the internal one that you could still be running a train of thoughts in your head. Yeah. That's another layer. You're feeding the beast with this constant external stimuli at least. Now, this makes me think I was out in the desert at this wonderful party hanging out with some friends and one of them said something to me. I don't know if he knew how profound it was, but he does kind of remind me of like a, he lives in the desert. He reminds me of a, like a, like getting to really hang out with a true Zen monk. I don't think he knows that he's like putting out such powerful info. Maybe he does. I don't know. But he was talking to me about the fear of boredom and how, and I can't remember the exact way you put it, but it was along the lines of, you know, think about that. Think about your fear of boredom and how we're afraid of not doing anything. That has stuck with me. My mind has just been gnawing on it and thinking and turning it over and over and over, thinking about that. And when I put the phone down and I'm, you know, I don't have a genius daughter, but even with my dogs, I've thought, God, half the time I'm playing with the dogs, I'm looking at my phone, I'm petting them while I, so I put the phone down and I just start giving them attention and I'm petting them. They can tell, man, the difference, but then as it's happening, I, I start feeling a little bored. Like, you know what I mean? Like, I mean, this is cool and everything, but what's going on on the phone? What's on Twitter? What's on CNN? What's on treasure port? What's on Huffington? What's on New York Times? It's hard. It is. That's why to me, in fact, my goal of twice a day is regularly broken. I mean, I never live up to it. But even if I regularly break it, it's still way better than the 24-7 I was doing before. So even if I end up going back there six, seven times in a day, it's way better than this constant fucking, I'm here, but I'm not here. I'm here, but I'm not here. That happens when I keep looking at it back and forth. So I think, and ultimately I feel better. You know, there's an element there where I, I feel more, a little more relaxed. I feel a little, and the bottom thing to me is you can give, you don't have to stay there petting your dog for 30 hours. You know, he's like, I'm going to really fully be here. And if it's five minutes and then I feel like I need to do something else, that's fine. I had five good minutes. Now let's see what I want to do next. You know, I, the other day went out to the hammock, lay in the hammock, I'm looking up the trees and I've been thinking about only because I read it in this very sinister book that I ordered, which is an occult book, a German occult book, annotated by guess who Hitler. Oh Jesus. So they found in Hitler's library, this book of the occult that, and this all, this all started as a terrible rabbit hole. I went down about occultism in the Nazis. And then you, you go down that rabbit hole, that's a deep rabbit hole. You find out about the organization Thule. And then you find out about, you know, the fact that Hitler was like fascinated with the occult. We know it from Indiana Jones, but I don't think people realize how, how deep the, the occult roots of the Nazi party are. So I find out, oh, there's a book that they found in Adolf Hitler's private library. An occult book. It's called magic history, theory and practice. And he underlined through the whole fucking thing. So in this book, they've put in bold everything Hitler underlined. It's awesome because the book has some pretty good information, but you see what a dick Hitler is by what he decided to underline. But anyway, in this book, it talks about the concept of where do you stop and where does the world start? And of course the truth is there's no place that you stop and there's no place the world starts. And if there is a place, it's a very fuzzy border that just is like not your skin, but that's what we think of as like our skin. So anyway, laying in the hammock, contemplating this idea of like, where do I stop? And where does the rest of this start entering into that expansive state of like just like at the precipice of a very expansive moment. And then it's like, God, fuck this. I'm not going to fucking sit in the hammock all day. I got to do something. And it feels decadent to not do anything. It feels hedonistic to not do anything. It feels irresponsible to not do anything. It feels lazy to not do anything. It feels blasphemous, wrong. It feels this to me is sick when you're looking up at a tree, the source of oxygen on the planet. And that mother, I mean, I don't know. Maybe trees are also like, I got to make more fucking branches, man. I can't just sit here and not grow. I got to get more pine needles out of me. But I don't think so. Right. So when you gaze on a tree supplying life to the planet through what appears, I'm not saying trees aren't in action. There's a beautiful chemical dance happening within them. But you know what I'm saying though, right? Yeah. Behold the lilies of the field. They toil, nor do they, whatever Jesus said. Yep, yep, yep. So, Danielli, what the fuck, man? What the fuck is correct? We act for the sake of scratching some sick infected itch that comes from a wound administered to us through a lifetime of living in a society where our identities are based on our work, or do we rebel against it, move up to Big Bear, lay in the hammock, sit around and do nothing, go to the desert, you know, and just sit and stare at the sand. In perfect Taoist fashion, I think it's always both. Anytime you are in front of a binary choice, it's never these or that. There's these and that, the best of both sides. Because the reality is that, yeah, the scenario you paint of the overactivity that I can't fucking stand still because I constantly need to do, do, do, that is sick. And it's, and again, I do the exact same thing. So I know it to a T, right? Because I'm running, I'm with you 100% on that. I was listening the other day to a podcast with Joe Rogan, and he was talking, he was kind of opening up about more personal stuff than usual. And he was talking about how he's constantly doing shit. If he's not running one thing, he has to do another. So I think there's something good about it. And I don't mean just in terms of what you produce, in terms even of like, it's awful to be there and not appreciate anything because you are bored and you're looking for some, it's an awful feeling. So the sense that you are excited enough about life where you always have something that you want to go to. There's something very healthy about that up to a point. But when you take it, when it becomes a mania, when it becomes that you can't stand still, that is not just, oh, if I have nothing to do, I have plenty of choices because there are 10,000 things that catch my interest. I have to chase these 10,000 things or otherwise I feel incomplete or wrong or a failure or whatever the fuck. That's become the obsession of that. So I'm a big fan of take your fucking time, relax, stay at the dem tree. And when you want to, no, but now I should, no, no fucking should, just shut up for an hour. I'm not asking for the moon, just one hour, just relax, go for a walk, do something. And that cool it, if it makes you feel better, cool it, mental health practice where you're just, I'm not doing anything. No, no, you are working on your mental health. You can feel good about that, you know, you can say, I put an hour in mental health training. So then you have a justification for it. But really, that's what it does because it clearly off so much shit. It ultimately really make you enjoy stuff more when you actually are involved in it because you are not involved in it out of compulsion. You are involved in it because you want it because suddenly you are really physically, mentally, spiritually there and you want to be in that moment. And then, you know, we need both. We need the action because without it, you know, you can be, it becomes too easy to be all the way stores and where the reality become a good excuse to be in a fuck up who does nothing all day. But at the same time, you also, you know, really, there's a benefit in both and there's obsession in both. I want to talk about the fuck up who's not doing anything all day. By all means. So, okay. Now, I get the hour on the hammock and nature walk. But I can remember listening to like Alan Watts give a lecture on Zen monks. And he's like, these are crazy people. Like they're these are like, this is not an hour. This is like, okay, so if you let's imagine that you made the decision that you're going to just sit on the couch all day. You put the phone away. You just sit there. You're doing nothing. Just sitting on the couch. Your family and friends would get worried. They would get worried about you. Of course. Like around hour five, they'd be like, Hey, man, what is good? What are you doing? Yeah, of course. What are you doing? Yeah. If you put on robes. Yeah, then it's cool. Then it's spiritual practice, right? Yeah. What the fuck? Right. You know, and it's amazing. Yeah. If you put on robes and you spend your entire life mostly sitting, doing nothing. People are like, that is a cool motherfucker. Did you hear about Leonard Cohen? He went up to the mountain and became a Zen monk and did nothing. Did you hear about Lenny Cohen? What a loser. He sits on his fucking couch and does nothing. What do you mean? He watches TV right now. He just sits there. Does nothing. It's rice every eight hours or whatever. Right. Do you know what I mean? Totally. Culturally, if you put on the right outfit, doing nothing is impressive. Yep. So I wonder if part of the trick of the mind is to make you think that by sitting for an hour and doing nothing, you have fulfilled a spiritual obligation. Right. When in fact, maybe doing nothing isn't an excuse for laziness. Maybe it's, that is the, you know what I'm saying, man, it's like there could be a party happening that we're not walking in the door of. No, and I agree. And I think that's, nobody can say it about somebody else that way. It's like, you know it. Are you insanely happy doing what you do? Sitting at the wall all day and you tell me that, yes, I'm, I could not be happier than who the fuck am I to tell you otherwise? You know, right? It's ultimately everybody's different. Everybody can tap into different things. So I can say, oh shit, I tried after two hours. I wanted to shoot myself. It's not really working for me that well. And I tried another time and I got the same result and another time. So I really don't get what you see in this. I don't know what you get out of it. But if you get out of it, good for you. Right. I mean, I know, I know, man. I like the, do you ever suspect that you might just be having a seizure that you call your life that like you're like somebody who is just having a kind of involuntary series of muscle spasms and somewhere along the way. You're like, oh, I'm, I'm the one doing this. I'm making these decisions. When really you've just the thing you call your career is just the clittering of your, the clattering of your foot on the fucking floor as you go through a lifelong seizure of action that you're pretending that you are in control of. Great. Now I have, I just needed an extra existential anxiety. I think I just got a new one. Yes. There's a speaking of going back to the idea of harvesting. Twitter for good things. I follow an account on Twitter and it's a Zen account. And the guy tweets some great quotes from famous Zen masters. I get mad at him because he quotes, he will tweet from time to time. How you can't, something along the lines of how intoxication and Buddhism don't mix. He, and that always upsets me, but I don't care. But he tweeted a quote from a Zen master saying, and I want to know what you think about this. If you truly look into yourself underneath the emotions underneath the actions underneath the thoughts, you will find that there is nothing there. What do you think of that? That's the thing with a lot of, I mean, I'm obviously like you. I'm very intrigued with Zen Taoism. A lot of Eastern thinking is something that clicks with me in a lot of ways. And at the same time, some of these escape me. And I'm not saying escape me because it's bullshit. Maybe it is. Maybe it isn't. I'm not sure. There are some elements where I feel the direction where Zen is going. I find it. It goes from being this really intriguing different way of looking at the world. That adds something to my life to being kind of complete bullshit from my way of seeing. And again, maybe it's because I'm in, maybe it's me. See if it is bullshit. Some of it to me strikes me. Like I was having a conversation and I do it with super nice guy, right? Very nice person. I like him as a person. The vibe was great. Zen monk. And he said something along the lines. You know, my family, and he was talking about his wife and daughter, they are no more real than the paper illusion. That's the money in my, in my pockets. And I was like, this is the moment where if I was playing Zen master, I would slap you really hard. No, no, that's the moment where if you were playing Zen master, you slap his wife really hard. Right. Exactly. See what he does. I have a feeling he's not going to like be like, Oh, you just slapped an illusion. It's an illusion that doesn't. Yeah. That's where to me is like we're taking it too far. You know, we're going from a, and again, maybe some of it may be limitations of my understanding or some of it may be that there's nothing to understand. And there's some of it is just full of shit. But, but really though, I want to know under your emotions. Yeah. So do you have a primary emotional state throughout the day? Or do your emotions fluctuate and fluctuate a lot. And so they fluctuate from in some spectrum of what anxiety and then pleasure or, you know, so it's a pendulum of like, like a kind of weather systems of emotion. Yeah. Okay. So underneath that emotion, what is there? That's a good one. I had an interesting one on that because a few days ago, I never take anything, right? Medicine. I mean, I took some fucking Benadryl because I had some allergies. Yeah. And I strongly suggest for people who have a delicate system, the psychedelic benefits of Benadryl, because I was in this state that was like taking is the way people describe anti-depressants. It's like, I felt nothing. Yeah. There was this dead quiet inside of me. I had no emotions to speak of. Yeah. And I was going through my day and I was like, huh, look at that. It didn't even bother me. There was no, and it was a strange feeling to be me without these waves of emotions sweeping through me back and forth. I couldn't quite understand, you know, what is, is there something? Am I really just the product of all these waves of emotion that sweep through me day and day out? Or is there something else that's sent outside of them? I often feel both ways at the same time, which obviously is impossible because it's a contradiction. It's either one or the other, at least according to the logical mind. I don't think it's, yeah. But the, but that's the feeling, you know, there are times where I'm like, this is as real as it gets. This is, these emotions are the most real thing on earth. And other moments where I feel like this is a game that's being played, but there's something else to me that exists outside of this little, and I don't know how to reconcile it because they're obviously completely different. I don't even can call them feelings, understandings, whatever they are, but they are both equally strong. Yeah. So it's confusing. Well, it is. And, and, and you sort of, I keep thinking alike, God, a gas giant, which is the planet we can't see through the cloud layer. Is that Saturn or is it Jupiter? Or is it both? Uh, the one with the hexagonal, beautiful hexa, it's, I think it's, I believe it's Saturn. It's got that hexagon at the top from the weather systems. It's got this amazing spinning like hexagon at the top. It's trippy. It's a trippy planet. The one with a ring. Yeah. Yeah. But this is a, we can't see through the cloud layer. So I don't know what's down there, but in the same way, it feels like the human psyche is this gas giant where on the exterior we have these swirling systems of emotional energy. And then we get so blinded by that that you can't see what's underneath that layer. And then when you do see what's underneath the layer, it's so perplexing because there's nothing there. And then you think, oh, fuck, I'm a gobs stopper, but I'm a, I'm a shell. I'm a shell of emotions that has within it a nothingness. And not only am I a shell of emotions as within a kind of nothingness, but then external internally around me is an infinite universe, which has mostly nothingness inside of it. And so then it becomes a really curious predicament that you get in there because you think, if I am this binary system of nothingness and somethingness, who do I decide to be? Do I react from the nothing or do I react from the something? Well, if both are there, you have a choice, which is interesting, because you can choose to go one way or another. And that in itself would be a, that would add, because otherwise you would be almost a deterministic model, right? Use the fucking decided, right? Is there something that's free will that exists outside of this game or right? No, of course, and it's, I think it was Tom Robbins who said that the nature of reality is just completely paradoxical. Like if you can't appreciate paradox, you really didn't understand anything about the way the universe work, because everything around of his paradoxical, many times, such as in discussing these, I would have to come to the conclusion that them right, it's paradoxical. It's more often than not, even in front of two statements that seem mutually contradictory, there's these and that, and they are both true, and they can't be because the logical mind tells us only they are opposite who only one can be truly can't both be true at the same time. And somehow more often than not, I run into the feeling that way, I feel this very strongly and I also feel the opposite very strongly. What the hell do I make of that mystery of living in this flesh body? Is it a mystery? I mean, this is when this is, I'm sorry, I've said this on the podcast a few times, because it really was like chug him Trump, but Trump, but when I read this thing, he is like he gave me he's he was fucking smacking me in the face, because he said, no, no, no, we don't stop at mystery. We don't say, oh, it's a mystery. Done. Right. We say, we go deeper, because it's like, all right, okay, this is a mystery, because I've he says, what he said is something along the lines of that just is putting your insanity on an altar and lighting candles in front of sure. So no, let's say it's not a mystery. I want to know what I am. But my exploration into that inevitably comes to a point that is basically a void. And yet when I'm angry, I'll slam a fucking door. But when I'm the void, I don't slam doors. You know what I mean? Like that when I'm the nothingness thing, and I come into contact with just about anything at all, it doesn't really seem to have much of an impact. And then I start thinking, am I a fucking sociopath? That's the other. And I think that's also where the difference between, I think it was Joseph Campbell, this is another beautiful one that he argued that the schizophrenic drowns in the same ocean in which the mystic swims. I think there's something to that because the experience is not that different, except that one is fucked up by it and one is happy about it. And I think that's the fundamental issue is, does your understanding of reality lead to a state that makes you enjoy life or does it throw you in this existential crisis of fucking nothing is real nihilism feeling like crap and whatever? You know what I mean? It's like, because that to me is the only thing that there's going back to the election and since that we have power on, that's probably the only thing that we have a tiny degree of power on is figuring out which way we stir the sheep. Is it going to lead to a direction where you're ultimately satisfied with this experience that maybe illusion, maybe reality, maybe whatever the fuck it is. But does it leave you with a feeling of satisfaction and enjoyment? Does it leave you with a feeling of that to me is real? That interests me. Well, okay, let's talk about the feeling of satisfaction and enjoyment. So the, which is one, you know, the, if there were like a primary feeling that we're all supposed to want, satisfaction and enjoyment, that's it. Books on happiness everywhere you look, fucking can't turn a corner without finding some book laying around on how to be happy. So is it a bad trip or is it the best trip? Well, that's again, that gets back to the idea of like, you know, is it, you know, is it drowned or swim, you, I mean, look, you get to pick, but I don't know, man, I, you know, I keep a, it's like this thing that you discover and then once you've discovered it, you can't really undiscover it and, and, and, and, and so you're just sort of faced with like, well, at some point I have to either pretend to be my emotional states and like, you know, identify with that as myself or what becomes some kind of like universal blankness that has within it temporary disruptions that we call emotions that don't ever last and that inevitably change and return to some other emotion. I think it's the former for me. I tend to, regardless of whether it's an illusion or not, I feel like this is where I'm at. I'm in this state right now, which is a highly emotional one with my sense of personal identity as Daniela Bollelli being X amount of years having lived in this and that place. It could be some cosmic illusion. It could be the 14 year old God out there was playing a video game of being me. It could be all of those things. And I actually would put my money that there's a very decent chance that it may be something like that going on. And at the same time, here I am right now. So why don't I just play the game at the best of my abilities and let's just go through the ride and worry about the cosmic significance of it all once I actually have the instruments to look at the cosmic significance of it all, which I don't feel I gather right now. Like I feel I do a lot of mind bending exercises, which ultimately lead me still to the place where I started. And so I'm like, okay, fuck it, let's just go like it could very well be all illusion. It could all be we live in the matrix. It could all be. And at the same time, this is the only like the way I'm going to step out of these doors. The only thing I have power on is how do I choose to be if I do have any choice? How can I, how can I step out in the way that will feel the best possible here and now? It's very basic. It's very primal. That way. But at the same time, it's the only thing that I feel I have any control over. I mean, you still have to act. Yeah, exactly. I mean, it doesn't matter if you think you're a big ball of fucking infinite nothingness or like just made up of like emotions or what thoughts or whatever. You still have to act. There's no way to not act. Even when you're, you know, staying still, it's a form of do like you said, you're this a, yeah. But you know, again, I'm not, I don't really like the problem is once you've like come into the Benadryl Zen state, I just don't understand. Even if you do like get lucky enough to drift into a dream state of selfness, you always know like, all right, you know, I'm still like, I'm saying I'm Duncan Trussell right now, but the very act of saying I'm Duncan Trussell is the negation of Duncan Trussell because the thing announcing itself as Duncan Trussell doesn't have a name. So it's like, it's not even that much of a, I mean, it's, I mean, you know, I mean, you get to a point where like, well, I guess I'll just fucking walk around like this Duncan Trussell fellow. Yeah, it's kind of like, you know, the Hindu metaphor about the universe as play, right? As God's play that you are, you, it's really all this one entity that take 10,000 shapes, 10,000 different identities or forget millions of identities and has to forget that you're really are this God that created the entire game. Otherwise the game is not fun anymore. And you, and so in that sense is if you are an actor on a stage, you cannot in the middle of the act think like, wait, I'm not really this character I'm playing. I'm actually Mr. So-and-So Samuel, you fuck up the play, you know, it's not going to work as well. It's going to. Sure. So to me is like. That's a play. Right. And as life, that may be what's going on. Maybe the healthiest thing I can do is just immerse myself in the role and really play to the fullest. Yeah. But what if some other actors in the play keep coming up to you and they're like, hey, man, we figured out this thing's a fucking play, you know, and then you're like, well, who's doing the right, you know, like, well, maybe part of the play is, is like. The discovery of. Yeah. And I think that's how it goes back to, do you feel like you want to discover it or do you feel like you want to keep playing the game too late? Right. It's like, you know, you're like, maybe. Oh, no. I'm a master of self-denial. Don't worry. It's like, look, I never heard it. That information just disappeared. It's like, you know, we're at a party and like we took some fantastic psychedelic and this very special psychedelic where you put these like little finger puppets on your hand and like you stare at the finger puppets and these finger puppets, you get so high, you start thinking that the finger puppets are you and then as people, then someone, some asshole is like, Hey guys, I think we're staring at finger puppets here. I don't think it's really us. No, trust me, I have, I grew up as an only child. Yeah. I grew up with a mountain of time on my own where the only games that would ever happen were the games that I play on my own and a lot of games, they require more than one person. Yeah. And so I would play all of the roles and I would be obviously unconscious that it's all me, but in order for the game to feel damn good, to feel satisfying, to feel I have to forget it. And I became pretty fucking good at it where I can play the game and I can play the asshole who's fighting me, the me I like versus the me I don't like. It's all me, really. But I like getting into those roles, the only way that I would not be bored to that would be if I really got into it, like they had to become real to me. And of course there's that layer of consciousness, like I know I'm fucking playing a game on my own and it's just me in a room, but at the same time is I can somehow I could manage to go blip, make that information disappear out of my brain so that I could really enjoy the game to the fullest. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean, it seems like enjoying the game to the fullest. It would be understanding that you're actually, I mean, I don't know what enjoying the I guess enjoying the game to the fullest is going to vary from person to person. And certainly there's, I mean, I know Ram Dass talks about if you're fucking playing Monopoly, don't act like it's a goddamn game. If you and me sit down to play Monopoly, I want you to be a dick. Yeah. I don't want you to be like, I don't know, let's just have a nice game Monopoly. That's what Ram Dass says, yet simultaneously on another level, we're just friends moving pieces around on a board doing something that doesn't really mean anything at all. Of course. And you get to pick what level you're going to be at. Exactly. But again, right there, who picks right, of course, I think I'm, I'm playing Monopoly too much as the, no, be the asshole, come on, let's play that way for me to snap out of it and get to that level. Are you winning? All the time. We want you to win. Yes. Yeah. You know, as a matter of fact, when you play on your own by yourself, it's surprising how many times you managed to win. It's, it's like hilarious if you lose. Yeah. When you, when you, oh, and the best part is when you cheat at the game that you're playing on your own, because you know, some of it goes up to chances and you're playing and suddenly like you score when you're playing the bad guy and you didn't really mean to. And suddenly when you take the shot as the good guy, you fuck up and so you have to cheat the game in order. So to make the one that you like, it's pretty intriguing. I'm cheating on myself with myself. Exactly. Exactly. No, that is the funny thing. The mind does though, because the moment you start having a, even the vaguest romance with nothingness, the mind will act like it's being cheated on. It's like, don't talk to that. I mean, in fact, think masturbation. Yeah. From a purely mechanical standpoint, it's bullshit. For it to be good, you have to get lost in this fantasy and suddenly it's not bullshit at all. It's fucking amazing. And it's, you have this all and it really boils down to fantasy, to imagination, to all of that. And that's what makes it, quote unquote, real. Now it's not anymore real, you know, the mechanical act is the exact same, but the state it creates when you get lost in a fantasy versus where you're there, it's me rubbing myself while staring at the wall. It's a very different kind of feeling. Depends on how kinky you are. I mean, like you can definitely get to a point where like that in it, you're just like such a freak. You're like, just this is fucking freaky. Yeah. I did not get to that point. I'm afraid. What am I? Some fucking hairy monkey to sit there rubbing its goddamn pleasure appended. That somehow does not lead to orgasms for me. It just doesn't do it again, but really though, yeah, I mean, like if you want to take it to the most carnal state and you're jerking yourself off, you're like, who's jerking you off? Right. Right. What is like, it's really if you are this, I actually, and I know you probably have to go. It's a little bit, but when you look at it from the perspective of like, okay, I know that I am not truly my body in the sense that I know that I'm not my identity. I know this is just a, a series of like feelings that have been chained together by my, I guess, I don't know, what is it responsible for short term memory going in the long term memory, but whatever that is, the amygdala, I don't remember, but whatever the fuck that is. I know that like, really, this is just a, so when you're jerking off from the Zen perspective and you realize you're the universe rubbing your penis, the, the, the entirety of the universe, the full extent of all things, whatever that is, has rippled in your direction in a way that has made your hand move upon your genitals, genitals and to make you come. That's pretty hot, man. That's pretty sexy to think a butterfly flapped its wings somewhere in Hawaii and that created a chain reaction that ended up with you jerking off. Thank you to that Hawaiian butterfly. Yeah. I mean, it really boils down to does that lead you to having an awesome orgasm or not? Because that's where there's a qualitative difference in that. How you get to it vary from person to person, but what doesn't vary, what to me feels pretty demobjective is that end result. Is that experience, does it lead to this just pure ecstasy where you're like, the universe is a fucking awesome place and I don't want to be anywhere but here and now, or does it not lead to that experience because that's fucking different. An ecstatic state. Yeah. The other thing that Terrence McKinnon said is that ecstasy encompasses all emotional states. Even the existential horror, if I finally do manage to get my brain, you know where you throw a bouncy ball as hard as you can on the floor with a low ceiling or you throw it under a table and the bouncy ball starts bouncing back and forth really fast and makes this wonderful like that kind of jittery like thing that happens when something is out of balance or that if I, when I get myself into that state where I have crucified myself between absolute nothingness and somethingness and it creates this horror, I find that to be quite pleasurable. Really? Absolutely. It's ecstatic. Look at that feeling of like, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, I'm nothing in something, I'm nothing in anything, I'm in something, I'm in something, I'm nothing. That is fucking so... That to you feels good. It's fun. Really? It's, yeah man, that's a really fun feel, like that feeling of like how often do you get to feel that kind of weird thing, it's like a kind of deja vu mixed in with, maybe it's what Sartre was called, nausea or whatever, it's a kind of vertigo. Yeah. No man, I think there's something even in that, I am, I'm not positive because I, those moments have become a little less than they used to be, but when they do happen, I mean I'll have to, the next time it happens, I'll really have to like see what I think, but I'm, I think that that feeling is actually secretly really good. Really? Huh. I never felt that then, because I mean, you described the situation and I think I know what you're talking about, but that to me, nothing about it feels even remotely good, so I'm like, maybe I don't know what you're talking about. What does it feel like? To me, it's a feeling of, you are an astronaut who got cut from the spaceship and you are floating in this endless space and there's nothing that you can, that recognizable that you can go back to feeling like, and I'm not a big fan of that feeling. It's not, yeah, I mean, I know you mean that it is a, it is a really like, it is a crazy feeling, but even the feeling, I mean, again, I love that because here's the thing, planet feeling. This is the planet that many people exist on. The gravitational field of planet feeling is as strong as your strongest emotion and so there you are. Your identity has been trapped in the gravity well of this planet and then something can happen sometimes where you just start floating away and you realize, oh, wow, that's not me at all. I'm looking down at a planet that I used to live on, but that's not me and the further way you get from it, the less important it becomes. And you know, it's like, that was just a little thing the universe did. Oh my God, I'm going to quote the Grateful Dead. It's just a box of rain. Great song, by the way. Great song. Those of you guys who have never listened to it, by all means, please check it out. Grateful Dead box of rain. And I think it kind of does our conversation. The answer to the problem is in the lyrics of that song because they say, believe it if you need it or leave it if you dare. That's perfect. I think that has been written, it has specifically been written for us to quote right now as the perfect jewel that come at the end of it all. I don't think the Grateful Dead song even existed until we had this conversation. And now there's a whole pass to it because it's too good. That's perfect. Mr. Bilelli, tell them where they can find you, your beautiful podcast. Unless the gods of Google hate you. My guess is that if you type my name in Google, they will, the Oracle will reply and they will tell you all about, you know, history on fire podcast, drunken Taoist, anything else I do, it's probably out there somewhere on the net.

Johnny Pemberton, welcome. Fuck man, you know what's so weird to me? I don't think a lot of people know this occurred to me when we agreed to do this podcast that I don't think people know. I don't think people are aware of the fact that you're able to make those sounds without any technology. I think people think you're using some kind of equipment to do that. Can you talk about like the training to be able to, first of all, can you make one of your, I guess now you could say like trademark sounds? Yeah, sure. I mean, it's something where it takes a lot of training, but also it's a lot of intuition because it's, everyone can do it. I'm not doing anything special. I don't know about that. If I do this, it's just I'm not doing anything special there. Okay, so then teach me how to do it and I'll try to do it. Okay, you know those people who hang themselves from their back skin and sort of like a, it's like a Sundance ritual. Yeah, oh yeah. It's a modernized version of it. You mean like kinky people? Kinky people are also, there's a lot of people who do it in the Far East, like in India. Oh, you mean penitents. Yeah, well, they also do it to prove Shaman's wrong. Like it's not like a special thing you can do. Anyone can do it. Yes. I love that. Same as that. Proving Shaman's wrong by Mark Conker. Yeah, Mark Conker, which is ironically the last name is Conker. He's a, he's a Conker. Yeah. Well, anyway, so, okay, so I'm sorry. This is somehow related to like causing yourself pain? No, I'm just sort of like relating it to that because that's the same sort of thing where it seems that you can't do it, but you actually can. It just takes courage and time. Okay, so teach me. I want to do it right now. I want to do some kind of cool sound. Okay, well, do you have, what kind of plants do you have access to? Do you have access to it? Do you have any Datura or Angel Trumpets available around there? No, I don't. I've got, here's what's around me. It doesn't count as a plant. I've got some Windex and a Cactus. Okay, the Ammonia, is it normal Windex, a classic Windex? Yeah. Yeah, the Ammonia in there might be able to do it. If you, if you can extract it, you have to heat it up to a perfect temperature to extract the Ammonia from the. All right, hang on. You want to have a double boiler with a, what's it called, an elven head on there? Yep, I've got that. An elven head moisture extractor. So once you let that sit for about 20 minutes at the perfect temperature, which I can't say, because if I say that perfect temperature, then I'll be liable. Okay. Uh, you know, if someone causes an accident. All right. So we saw that happen a few years ago. What do you mean, Mike? What's the danger? Well, the danger is that if I spell these instructions out, someone will do it wrong and I'll be liable. The same way that Beavis and Butthead got in trouble with, with the lighters. Oh, for lighting, for lighting farts. Okay, okay. Let's, let's, let's cut. Hold on, let's cut. And then we'll come back after I do this extraction method. Should I use a regular crystal valve stoppers or? If you have them, as long as they're custom fitted, otherwise you can use latex, as long as it's not touching the, the chemicals, as long as it's just a. Suspended latex? Any kind of latex, as long as it's been galvanized. Okay. I've got galvanized. Okay. We're going to cut and we'll be right back. Uh, do you want me to drink this stuff after I extract? You have to, you have to inhale the vapors, but you have to swallow the vapors. That's not, it's a weird technique. Okay, we're going to be right back. Big thanks to me, Undies, for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH. We all have to wear underwear. There's no way around it. Are you like me? The way I used to be when I had like old tattered bits of ragged, shitty underwear that looks like it was sewn together with bits of moldy, mummy fabric and old rotten bags. Well, then it's time for you to upgrade your underwear game. Get rid of that old stain, oily grotesqueness that you're wearing on your sweet, sweet, beautiful genitals. As though you were wearing the mask of the elephant man around the most sensitive part of your body. Your underwear shouldn't look like the elephant man's mask. Your underwear should be fun and it should feel good. The undies has got breathable, super soft fabric. This, this fabric is so soft. It feels like it was made with an Einsteinian quasar diode beam. You're never going to, it's just so wonderful. It's like someone wrapped a unicorn tongue around your pussy, your penis or whatever may be down there underneath your underwear. And you deserve to feel like that because it's summer and we made it through a pandemic. Me undies believes that comfort is about more than what's touching your skin. It's about feeling comfortable in your skin. Let me look at my underwear right now. Let's see what we're wearing. What do you know? It's me undies. Why am I wearing me undies? Because I actually wear them every day. Not the same pair, obviously. You want to change your life? There's a lot of ways to do it. You could implant prosthetic wings on your back or you could just order me undies. That's all you have to do. They will send you, they have so many, by the way, there's so many awesome choices. You don't have to worry about like spending too much time on it. But it's like, what are you wearing? Just like white underwear? I hope not. You're not in some kind of ward. You're not a prisoner of the state. That means you get to wear cool looking underwear. And me undies are energized by creativity and made for self expression. And they got every size. You got extra small to four extra large. Anything you want, they've probably got it. So those sweet, delicious buns of yours can have more fun.

Thank you. It worked. I think it worked perfectly. So give it a try. So just swallow the vapors. Yeah. You know how when you have the hiccups and you say to swallow three times, take a deep breath and swallow three times? No. Okay. Well, that's a classic. I'm surprised you don't know about that, but it's a classic hiccup removal technique where you go, you swallow air. You do three times, you swallow air. It's very difficult to do. Okay. You do that with the vapor. Is there any danger in this for me? Could this hurt you? Yeah, there is. It depends if you have an Aries moon rising, that it's extremely dangerous. I do not recommend anyone with Aries moon. I do have that. You know I have that. I forgot. Sorry. I guess I just, well, I'm glad you said something because I think it could be dangerous. I'm just going to try it. It could be dangerous for Aries moon rising. Yeah. One more. Yeah. Did it work? Yeah. It sounds like it's working a bit. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's not working. Yeah. I don't think I'd absorb properly. Do yours again. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Come here. Yeah. I'll take one more go. Yeah. Pretend you're Australian or South African. All right. Hey, we all might. Yeah. Yeah. You know what? I don't have to tell you, man. I don't have to tell you. It's not working. Yeah. You might want to listen to Apex. It's not working. I would say around sundown, take a drive, listen to Apex twin. That might help you out. That could. Sometimes that unlocks it. All right. Because it's got a long latency period. But yeah, you know, that's life, baby. Man, that sucks. That was a lot of time doing a lot of an extraction process with no fucking result, man. Okay. I guess that's kind of the thing, right? We need to learn in life that sometimes when you're extracting ammonia, you're not always going to get an echoed voice. Yeah. It sticks patience and it's all about the patience. You know what's cool about you among many, many, many things is that whenever I'm talking to you, you're always working on something. You're always working on scripts. You're always working on developing stuff. You're always, it seems like, am I wrong to think that recently you've started taking writing a little more seriously than you used to? Or you've started really focusing on like- Oh, hardcore, like significantly more than I have before. Because I realized like it's the only thing I can really do that actually is, I've been doing it for a long time, like casually, ever since I was a little kid. Even when I found some writings when I was back home, I was like, these are so old, but it's basically the same tone. The tone hasn't changed at all. But yeah, I guess I just like, I feel like, it just maybe took the pandemic to make me realize like, oh, you can do a lot of stuff with other people and you can wait for stuff to happen. But really, the only thing you can ever really do is write something because that's like a, it's something that actually like, kind of like fills up your, the activity of your brain enough to satisfy it. At least for me, I feel like that is the case. On top of that, what seems to be like a, I don't know, put it without sounding cheesy, like a deeper commitment to writing. Now when I'm talking to you, you're doing something called ruck sacking? Can you talk about that a little bit? Oh, rucking? Rucking. It's the dumb, rucking, yeah. I found this book on Kindle, like it was advertised to me, it was called Rucking Gaines, which sounds like something I'd make up, like a fake- That's it, sure as fuck does. Like a guy's name. Oh, I'm rucking Gaines here. Rucking Gaines. It's like this pretty cheesy book written by some, I don't know, I guess you'd call him like Jim Ratz. These guys who all they care about is, is it kind of people who go to those gyms, like, I don't know if it's like a gold gym, but the kind of gyms where they're not nice and not clean, but people who lift a lot of weights are like, oh, this is a good gym because they have this thing, they have this thing. I don't really lift weights really. I mean, I do like minor stuff, but that's who wrote this book. And I just was so, I only read like half of it because I feel like I got the gist right away, but they talk about how, I think it was, I think I told you this, how it caught me because it said, want to ditch the dad bod? Yeah, no, I thought about that more than a few times since. Everybody wants to do it, but at the same time, it's also like, you know, it's very, very difficult. You have to do a lot. You have to not eat a lot of stuff that's really fun to eat to ditch it. Imagine if like the book was about disposing of the bodies of murdered dads. It's like, the problem with like murdering dads is it's hard to get rid of their bodies. They just keep coming back. But yeah, they refused to rot. So this, yeah, so this is like some crazy shit you're doing where you're like filling backpacks with books or something. Yeah, I put a bunch of books and old laptop in the backpack about 20 pounds to 25 pounds. It's supposed to be, I think, about 20% of your body weight, which is, I weigh like 145 pounds, so it's not a whole lot of weight. But I feel like it sounds, to me, it sounds bad, it just sounds bad for your back. Yeah, I think a lot of people would think that, but I think carrying something on your back is not actually bad for your back, really. I think the most soreness I have after doing it is in my legs and in my, just basically my legs and my shoulders a bit. Are you just fast walking? Is it fast walking? Yeah, you're trying to keep at least four miles per hour, is the idea. And how far? How far? I think the most I've done is like six miles. Okay. And if you go uphill, though, I did an uphill one on Sunday. I didn't have my phone with me because I was doing a no phone day, so I'm not sure how much elevation I did or how the distance I went. I think I was going for about an hour and 15 minutes, and that was up a hiking trail, and that like seriously kicked my ass. I've been like really sore the past couple of days, like waking up and I haven't had to take talent over to get to sleep because of it. But that's because that like triggered something at the top of my ass, like the top of my glutes. It's like still sore right now because you have to keep this pace and also the weight. Like a strip above your glutes? Sort of like your lower back, the top of your butt. Like the top of your tranks, the glutes attached. Those are called tranks. Oh, the tranks. Yeah, the tranks, the tranksanomus ponalis. Yeah. So it's really hitting the tranksanomus ponalis. It forms the pyramid with the eye almost. Like a lot of people say that's where the. Right, that's a misnomer. The golden triangle is not in the forehead. It's in the cossacks. Yeah, exactly. And the reason they used to call it the golden triangle because in the ancient days of the Greeks, if you, especially if you were a Pythagorean, that was where you would, if you were pissing on one of your students, that's where you would aim. And like, so it was the where, because like if you can pee exactly on the right part of a person's trank strip, then apparently like their cognition gets improved by at least 30%, which is wild to think about. Yeah, it's like, it's when you, when you pet a cat that way on the cat's butt, it's the same thing. Yeah. When you see people paddling a cat's butt, you paddle the cat's butt and it just loves it. Yes. You know, it's, it's, it's a sexual thing. Well, it's a sexual, it's a, it's a sexual and an intellectual thing. It's sexual intelligence. Sexual, sexual. Yeah, I'm a sex. Are you sexual, sexual? I've been reading about it, but I haven't got there yet. Oh my God. Yeah. Sexual, sexual. Sex, sex, sex, sex, sexual. Creepy how much stuff with, with animals it is like, you know, you watch these videos, people doing stuff with their dog or a cat and it feels like, I think you're masturbating that animal. Like you're helping that animal masturbate. Oh dude, that's like one of the more disturbing things I've seen is when you're at someone's house and they've got a dog that humps their leg and they don't stop it. Oh, that's weird. That's super weird. You've seen that before. That's a thing. Like that's a vibe, as the kids say. I mean, I may or have may not have sold a video of our, our childhood dog Coco humping my brother's leg by the Christmas tree with a Santa hat on. Sold it to a, uh, like America's funniest home video as many years ago for like 500 bucks, 300 bucks. I did. What? It's an old, old video. Okay. The dog has since passed away many years ago, but it, this little dog used to hump. Did it get on the show? It might, it must have, they paid money for it. Okay. So now you got to walk me through the process of that from, so you, you, you filmed your brother getting humped by a dog. And then, and then where, at what point, you're like, you know what, I think I can make some money with this tape. Well, I put it on YouTube and I got a message from them saying, we'd love to license your video for our show America's craziest pet moments or some crap like that. Cause the dog has a Santa hat on and she's like, you know, a 14 pound dog, 14 pound little, little mutt, like a little, like a, just a little shit terrier, the kind that would, you'd see it, a red necks house, you know, running up underneath the porch, like 12 of them. So one of those dogs, we got her for free. She was, she used to piss when you looked at her, if you were a stranger, she was that kind of dog, you know, like, like shamy, like a shamy little dog, very sweet. And she would hump, she would hump sometimes and she was, my brother was laying on the ground in front of the Christmas tree, just in the background. And she's got this Santa hat on and she's, she's humping his leg. You can't see his face. You just see the dog with a Santa hat humping. And it's a nice little 14 second video. 14 seconds is too long. I haven't thought about this in a long time. I got to find, I want to find this video now again. It's one of those things where, you know, like there's so many things that were before, were from a different time that you like totally forgot about, because it was like, just like pre, pre, Instagram, pre, like all kinds of stuff. Back when like having a video, it was kind of difficult or you couldn't take a long video, because it was too, you didn't have that much space. I mean, might as well be past life memories. It's so, so such a different world. Starting to fill that way. Yeah, but a lot of stuff. So did your, did your brother let this humping proceed that long because the Santa hat and he knew you were taping? I don't know. It's Christmas. You're on the carpeted floor. It's the Midwest, so it's cold outside. So it's one of those things where there's probably had a, we probably had a couple of barley wines each at this point. So we used to say something. We would say something to the dog and he would go like, hump, hump, hump the hump leg, hump, hump, hump, hump, hump. It was like a little song we made up. They'd try to get the dog to go hump, because it was sometimes you could kind of influence her to hump a bit. Hump, hump, hump the hump leg, hump, hump, hump, hump, hump, hump. Because it's a little dog and it's also a girl dog. It wasn't a boy dog. So it wasn't like, it wasn't going to, going to spray anything on your leg. It's just some weird dominance shit that they, I don't even know. Because it's weird because she's not very dominant dog. So I don't know why she would hump, but I guess. I know why. I don't think it's, first of all, I think the whole dominant thing. I think that's something people just have decided that's the reason. Because like you were mentioning earlier, they can't endure the reality that the dog is horny, the dog wants to come, and the dog has decided to use you as the thing to come. It's not like I'm going to establish dominance. It's like, I'm getting that feeling again. That's what I'm going to start saying now when I want to have sex. I'm going to say, can we establish some dominance tonight? Yeah, I, you know, I don't really feel like having sex, but would love to, you know, place my established little dominance. I just think it's going to establish dominance with you tonight. Hey, I was thinking maybe you want to go out and have dinner and then maybe establish dominance afterwards. You know, I'm somebody who just loves to establish dominance on the first date. I love long walks on the beach, candlelit dinners, and then just a little slow establishing of dominance on a bear skin rug in front of the fire. I knew when he established dominance that night that I would marry him. Ah, the way he established dominance was so loving. Yeah, you're, you know, one thing I can say about your father is just, he was really good at establishing dominance. Right away, he established dominance. He, he got his scent all over me. It was difficult to get off. Here's a few things. This is something that I really find annoying these days is like, and I think it's probably gone away, but at some point, like, I remember when dudes would like really talk about alpha and beta males. And like, there's this whole thing in like where dudes would, would like get really into comparing themselves with wolves. Uh huh. I mean, I don't think it's like gone anywhere. But yeah, it's the moment it first started. It was a big, yeah, when it first started. And then like, and I'm a look, we're all, we're all guilty. We all got sucked in a little bit by it. But like, you know, it's just, I, I can remember at some point just being around a bunch of dudes that hadn't hung out with a lot. And all of a sudden I realized like they're seriously talking about being alpha males. You know what I mean? Like they're seriously, they're, they mean it. Like they think they're thinking of themselves as like, they're each individually thinking about themselves as leaders of some kind of wolf pack. Yeah. Except the wolves aren't hunting animals. They're, they're trying to fuck. And so, you know, they're trying to fuck and they're trying to like have a really good job and go to a really nice gym. Yeah. Yeah. And you're like listening to, you're like, you're the farthest thing from a fucking wolf. There's, first of all, wolves aren't alcoholics. Oh my God. Wolves aren't, wolves aren't like in some fucking weird corner of the, of the forest like getting hammered on cheap fucking beer and talking about how they're alpha males. I just finished that news. I just finished that new Sebastian Younger book, Freedom. And he talks about how all these frontier places where it was like mostly men, like when the railroad camps were set up and where it was like some of these towns, it was almost a hundred percent men. Yeah. And how the, the murder rate is astronomical. You are more likely to get this one town in Montana or something where you're more likely to get murdered than you were to get like killed working because there's, because all these men are just so fucking pissed that they're getting fights and they kill each other all the goddamn time. I love Sebastian Younger. That's the, that's the great thing about being alpha is you get to, you get to get murdered because you won't back down from something. Yeah. You're being challenged by another alpha and like you have to like stick up for yourself and try, try to, try to like maintain whatever that's superiority. It's like any time anybody's been reduced, when, if you ever find yourself reducing yourself to a category that is mostly used in like male pickup artists groups, you got, you got to watch out because you're, you're probably cruising for like or something awful is going to happen to you. It's like so oversimplified too. I'm an alpha, you know, and it's like when you're, you got to make sure you establish dominance with these women right away. Look, if you smile in the first 20 seconds, it's over. You won't, you won't make her come. Tell them their tits suck. Just tell them their tits suck within the first five minutes and they'll, they'll, you will be establishing dominance. Here's what I do. We go out to eat, right before we go in the restaurant. I say, hold on a second. I got a piss. I just piss on the sidewalk right before we go in. Great one. They fucking love that shit. Great nag. That's a great nag. That's really, really good. You know what I do? I bring, what do you do? I bring ladies deodorant and then like, you know, 10 minutes into the dinner, I'll pull it out and be like, would you mind putting some of this on in the restroom? You smell like shit. Wow, that's good. You know what I do a lot of times now? Is I just put a little bit of pig blood on my forehead right before we go out. And I act like I don't even notice it's there. And she's like, oh, you have blood on your face. And I'm like, oh yeah, because I was probably just fucking hunting. Okay. That's good. That's good. Yeah, that's really good. Yeah, that's really, really good. Yeah. Sometimes I'll bring just a Tupperware filled with raw meat to a meal. Make them eat it. Yeah. Show them your paleo. Yeah. That's one of the ways I do it for sure. Yeah. It's nuts, man. It's, it's really fucking nuts. Like when you look at like, you know, you ever do, you ever think about this, like when it comes to like fucking and fuck culture, like the, the, what the thing leads to, which is children is so the opposite of the, the, what gets you into that place generally. You know what I mean? Like all of the, all of the energy that gets expended to get to the moment where you're, you're, you're fucking somebody. You know, and it's the, that kind of energy, like, you know, you're going to do all your tail feathers and it's romantic and you're going to get in a thing. The other side of that is like you being on the trampoline with a two year old. You know what I mean? Like, like, like on a trampoline with a two year old. Like, you know, just like thinking like, this is the coolest fucking kid I've ever seen. It's just funny that that, that that's the, I would not expect that to be the doorway that leads to that place. I know a lot of people are thinking, yeah, but you don't have to make a fucking baby. You dumb shit. You can just like the grossest thing leads to the sweetest thing. Yes. Yeah. It's ironic. It's ironic, I guess, but maybe it's also just, it's just so primitive. It doesn't even matter at some point. You're just like, it's all like an impulsive reactions that you can't even, you can't deny it. After I deny it, it's, you have to work to deny it. Otherwise you're just, because you want, you want to do that even though you don't want to do it. Like, it doesn't make sense to do that. You mean you want to fuck? Yeah. Everyone wants to because, because they have that desire to feel something. And you also like, there's that part of your brain. It's like, you have to make more of this. That's how you survive. Yeah. But yeah, plants do it all the time. The make more part of your brain is that, like, that's not what's, you know, happening when you're like, you know, in a hump phase, you know, like, which I, you know, I'm, I'm married now. So I used to, you know, I'm sure you've, before you got married, before you were in a monogamous relationship, you were, you would go through hump phases, I'm sure, you know, where you're just humping all the time. I mean, maybe not a ton, but definitely, yeah, there was, there was periods where I was like, it was wild. Wild. And, and, and some people, they never go out of the hump phase. Yeah. That seems like a thing where that's like, probably like a denial of something, you know, like, you're like, you're doing that because you don't want to do something else. It's like, it's easy. It's an easy thing to say you're doing because no one's really going to be like, hey, you shouldn't do that. No one's going to tell you it's like a bad thing or it's wrong because it's not really, but at the same time, it's also how much energy do you want to spend on this thing with diminishing returns? Yeah. Yeah. Well, you just have to, you know, I heard once, this could be not true at all. I don't know, but I heard that like some Yakuza crime boss actually had in his mansion, a wall that had holes in it. Like, you know, the, like the, the thing where you put your head into the, like drawing and not, you know, your body looks like a monkey or whatever. Oh yeah. He had that, but for butts and like he would just hire prostitutes all day long and to stick their butts out of this butt wall. So like he just had a wall of butts. He had a wall. Sounds awesome. Dude, I think about it all the time. That's like, that's the end game, right? That's the all you ever, once you get that, like, where do you go from there? I don't know. You have to die a few days later. You enjoy it for, you enjoy it for two weeks. And then you're just like, well, this is maybe on a boat. Maybe we can put this on a boat. Take it to Burning Man, maybe. But you know, I'm just saying, like, if you do go into that level of a hump phase, you know, and you're, you're, you, and you're deciding like, this is what I'm going to do for the rest of my life. I'm just going to hump as much as I can on and on and on and on. Then yeah, you're going to have to go for the wall of butts. I mean, it's going to become expensive. You're going to have to become a crime boss and, you know, it's going to become like, and also you're going to have to like, have the gut. To me, what's, what's beautiful about the wall of butts, aside from like the obvious, how awesome that would just be to have a wall, a recreational wall of butts for your, not just for you, for your friends too. Like if your friends are like, if your friends are like, you know, tense, you could be like, just go and go spend some time in the wall of butts. In the wall of butts, go in the, the butthole. Go down the hall of butts. The wall of butts is way better than the wall of butts. I keep thinking about that, like a Disneyland ride where it's like, right before you get on the haunted mansion, you walk down all these, see all this cool stuff. It's basically just that. It's like having a Disneyland, like sexual Disneyland at home in the mountains. That's coming. I want to thank Squarespace for supporting this episode of the DTFH.

That's going to change a lot of things in our society. Because don't they say that already about a lot of millennials and people who are younger than millennials? What is the Z? I always forget what it is. Gen Z. But they are much less interested in sex. But I wonder if it's because of the... I think they're much less interested in casual sex, but I wonder if it's because they have such limited financial prospects to where... If the end game of having sex with someone is establishing relationships so you can have kids and have a life, if that's a foregone conclusion because you can't afford it, that's part of the reason why they're not interested in it. Because it's like, well, I will never retire. I can't buy a home. It's like, why would I want to do this stuff? That's trending towards that. And also because of all the online stuff too, you have all this stuff that's so... I had this happen recently where I've seen people I haven't seen like a year and a half, but we've been on Zooms a bunch of times. And when I see them, I'm like, you know what? I feel like I have... It's hard for me to remember that I haven't seen them in person. Because as much as I talk shit about Zoom and how much I hate doing it, it still does approximate something pretty... Just surprisingly good job of approximating, like being around a person. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, also, yeah, we... I mean, I don't know, I'm sure there's been other time... I think you know that when the pilgrims came to the United States, you could say that's probably not what you would call a sexual time. You know what I mean? Like fucking pilgrims, you're on a boat, just eating like, you know, curds and like, if you can, salted fish. So like everyone's just smells so bad and they're all constipated and just... They're also like, you know, fundamentalist so they're like kind of sex-negative anyway. So I don't think the pilgrims are like sexual... What you would call sexual adventurers, you know? Maybe it's the opposite though. Maybe all that... As people say about Catholics, right? All that repressed energy creates a lot of... A nice dynamic as opposed to just the freewheeling, like do whatever you want. Right. It's less interesting than the stuff where it's like, we shouldn't be here, Mary Ann. Yeah, that's the... We shouldn't be doing this. You shouldn't be showing me the bottom side of your wrist like that. How dare you? Oh my God, cover your wrist. What if the Lord... What if the Lord Bancroft arrives? Did you show your wrist to the magistrate? It's like so spicy, like Victorian culture too. It's just so... So like, I don't know. To me, that's more interesting than the opposite. I saw her ankle. Yeah. Oh my God, I see her ankle. Is she doing that on purpose? Oh God. Well, you know, I just think like with the pandemic, that it has to be the least sexual period in global history in the last century. Right? Like, how are you gonna fuck a lot? I mean, maybe there's people out there listening like, Doug, and you're obviously married because we were all just sneaking around fucking. Yeah, I think there's a lot of stuff where it was people doing stuff where like, oh, we just can't post about this. We can't share this. Okay. People doing stuff like in the shadows because it's like that Jurassic Park shit, you know, where they're gonna find a way, life will find a way. I know, you know what? Two of my friends got freaking COVID because one of them gave it to the other one for making out. No joke. Really? Yeah, they gave themselves COVID from like, I don't think, I don't know if they were like, humping necessarily, but they definitely... But let's get back to the main, to the juice of the thing here, man. Sex robots. That... Yes. This is going to like really be, well, because, you know, obviously right now, you can't have a fucking sexual Disneyland. There's human beings involved in this, you know? But like, once we've got like, Blade Runner level, like sex androids. Oh my God, that's going to be weird. It's going to be super disruptive. It's going to be so problematic. Disruptive technology, right? Because, you know, the like, arguments are going to be really like, well, you know, like, you're cheating on, it's the same as cheating. Fucking a robot is cheating. What do you think? Yeah, I suppose. I mean, I don't know, I think that's up to the people who decide about that. But God, I wonder, I suppose at some point it has to be, right? Because if it approximates it perfectly, what's the difference? Well, because like, when you find out someone has cheated on you, you're not just mad because they were like sucking someone's dick or licking someone's pussy. It's the emotional aspect. It's the lead up. Yeah. You know what I mean? It's that's what's that's what's the upsetting part of it. It's not like, it's not like, you know, they just suddenly were at the grocery store and then we're like fucking this person that they ran into. Probably it's more like, you know, there were like texts and then there were emails and there was conversations and they were, they probably talked about you a little bit, you know, and they were like, suddenly they were like sharing like relationship issues that they were having with and then the person's like, you know what, why don't we just go out to eat and like, you know, I think you need a drink. You know, I need, I need, oh, you know, I need one too. I need, let's have a couple of these. Oh God, I've had such a rough day. You know, hey, do you want to like go listen to this new album? I, you know, I can't because it'll be fine. And then that's the part that was always the most infuriating part when I was getting cheated on it with the fucking part was like, you know, a little, not that that was any better. It's just, you just really start calculating the, the many, the levels of deception involved. Right. They took, they got to that point. That's interesting. I never thought about that before, but yeah. So you're saying though, the robots take that away. Yeah. Cause with the robot, it's just like porn. It's like, you, you know, you, you go to a place, there's a, you pick the robot. It's not like you're, you're having to like, it's not like the robot is telling you what music it likes, you know, then, then you're fucking this robot and then you come home and like, yeah, I fucked a robot and, you know, maybe it's an eye roll or like, all right, well, great, but it's not cheating. It's not, it's definitely not the same, but I mean, you could also make the same argument about how porn is destructive because it's like this thing where it's almost like a, it's a thing where it's so easy to access that it's, there's something about that that's weird about it, where it's this thing where it feels like you're cheating, not on, it feels like you're cheating in the game of life almost, where you're like accessing this thing that's so, that's for thousands and thousands forever was unavailable to you. Unless you're like a Roman emperor or something. Yeah. And even those, those guys always died young because of like indulgence. They were, you know, eating, you can only only eat so many ducks covered in their own fat a day before you get liver, your liver explodes, you know, it's like, this is so good. And you keep eating it. So you know, this duck fat and you die because you're just, you're like, you know, you're drinking at morning till, till night every single day. You're like having sex with all these different courtesans and stuff and destroys your, destroys your body. But so it's like, you pay the price for it. But it's like, it's like, almost like we're, we've found a workaround for it. But there's, it's that saying, what's that saying in nature, there's no such thing as a free lunch. Yes. I, sometimes I feel like that's the same case with stuff like that, with like pornography, where this is basically, it seems like it's a free lunch and it's easy and it's nothing, it doesn't matter, but it has, it has to be some sort of downstream effect that's, that's causing because it doesn't, it seems like it's a, it's just, it shouldn't be that easy to access something as, it's, as primitive as that. I mean, you know, it's like, especially with virtual reality porn. Yeah. It is like that. I was, I was looking at virtual reality porn a couple of months ago and it'd been a long time since I'd seen it. Cause I got the new Oculus and like, that was definitely one of my go-tos. It's like, I gotta see what this porn is looking like now, especially cause you can, you can go online and just like, before you had to like kind of dig around to find it and use like, you had to get extra apps to run VR porn. Now you could just go on the normal, you know, down the normal like places you go to get your porn and they have a VR section. And so it's like way more accessible, but I was looking at one of them and it starts off and you're at like a breakfast table with this woman and, but she's looking at you like she knows you. She was like a, like a surprisingly good actor and she's like, you know what I mean? You get this feeling of like your brain is like trying to understand, like, did I just spend the night with this person? And like, yeah, that's weird. I've never done that before. I haven't, I've never tried that, but I imagine it's like, gotta be pretty, um, what's this say, immersive, right? Yeah. It's literally immersive. And then I put it on Aaron. I was like, oh, when we first out, I was like, where are the, where are the, where are the goggles? And then like, I'll go down on you and it'll be like someone else is going down on you. And she, she didn't like it. She's like, I really feel like I'm cheating on you right now. I bet. Yeah. Yeah. Which was kind of hot, you know, like in the sense that's like, oh, wow, this is cool. Well, you're not, but you think you are, but yeah, she didn't like it. But yeah, I do think it's this kind of technology is going to be really challenging for humans because we, you have to ask yourself how much of that idea that this is breaking some rule or that by doing this, I'm, I'm short changing myself or I'm like, or there needs a price needs to be paid for that. How much of that is true? And how much of that is just because we're like survivors of this insanely sex negative, sex terrified, Protestant alcoholic series of centuries that have left us like with epigenetic markers that make us terrified of fucking. Yeah, I suppose maybe you can't really know what, because it's got to be different every person and it's got to be, I think it's interwoven. There's no like, there's no truth about it, right? Cause it's something where everyone's different, but there has to be, I don't know, I guess it's the thing I always go to the opposite way where I think like stuff like that just seems, it seems so unnatural to me that it feels like it can't have a good outcome. But at the same time, there's also that idea where like some quote that you told me years ago, I think about a lot is the idea of a, there's some Buddhist teacher who was saying, he told his master, he was like, I'm going to swim across this, across the sound, I'm going to teach myself to swim across the sound, and he spent years or however amount of time practicing and learning to swim across the sound of this large body of water. And the teacher, he tells the teacher about this proudly and the teacher is like, well, why would you just do all that time to do that when the ferry only costs a dime? Yeah. Take the ferry. And I think that the idea was taught himself to walk on water. And then his teacher is like the ferry cost a nickel. Yeah. Well, you could have just done that. Is that and the idea was like, that's why psychedelics are good. It's cause it's like a, it's almost like a cheat for, for putting your throttling your brain to a place that you can like experience something that normally you would have to have like a, you'd have to almost maybe die or you have to experience something that would be super taxing or take a long time to do. But psychedelics allow you to like sort of, yeah, it's like a, it's like a cheat almost. It's a shortcut. It's like a wormhole. Yeah. But so is this stuff we're talking about, is that the same thing? I mean, it could be in a way, you think about it. Cause if you want to like, let's say, I was thinking about this today, you know that was it Edison or was it Tesla or maybe it was both of them who wanted to like, they basically were like, God, I wish I could just, you know, cut off all sexual desire in my brain. So I could work on the inventions. And if you think about that, like, God, it makes a lot of sense. Cause you're just like so encumbered by this primitive drive to, to reproduce it. It's, and if you really want to build a fucking rocket ship, it's hard because you're like, God, I have this like thing. It's the opposite direction. It's bothering me all the time. It's like being hungry. Yeah. Which is, I think that's kind of insane. The people who like came up with that stuff, the what's it called a silent, I mean, I tried it years ago, but I was like, this is not, this isn't good for me. I don't like the way it makes me feel. And also my time is not that precious. And so, I mean, I guess it's that it's always those two things are fighting where is this thing, this is this technology a good thing? Cause it allows you to sort of hijack those desires and maybe like get that, get it over with or like, I don't know, fulfill this thing that's difficult and can be messy to fulfill. Or is it the opposite where it's this thing where it's because it's Matt, because it's like a, it's like a wolf in sheep's clothing kind of thing, where it's going to cause all these downstream problems because it's simulating something that wasn't meant to be simulated. Yeah. I mean, this is I think an emerging conversation that's happening. Uh, in, in the conversation is a fear that technology is going to, uh, disrupt normal human patterns in the same way that, you know, building a, a, a skyscraper next to some bird sanctuary is going to fuck the birds up or introducing some like invasive species into any ecosystem. It's going to fuck up the species. The conversation is similar, I think, and it's not just suddenly we have this technologically enhanced access to, uh, sex. And, uh, that's only going to amplify because of obvious market pressures out there to the point where we have sex robots and then but it's not just that it's like, you know, Musk's neural lace. It's the augmented reality goggles that are, are, are glasses that are, were on the precipice of, uh, everyone wearing instead of phones. It's the phones, but like the, the, the, the conversation seems to be centered. One facet of the conversation is is by shortening the divide between what we want and getting that thing, are we robbing ourselves of some necessary human experience that is, is what may gives a person character and personality and gives a person some kind of wisdom. If we start, you know, if that thing is shorter between what I want and what I have, do we, are we fucking up humanity? And the whole question seems to be based on the fact that humans have over time not had enough stuff. And, and we've so, we've, we've been so hungry for so many different things for so long over time that we've begun to equate humanness with lack or humanness with the, with austerity and the tasks involved in getting some particularly special thing. And, and when, when maybe that's not really humanness at all, that's just what happens when many, many, many generations have existed in a place where they haven't had access to resources in the way that is natural because it's like, okay, who's wrong here? Are my desires wrong? Is the, is the thing that's malfunctioning here that I want to, why is my body sending me signals that it wants to do this thing or that thing, whether it's fucking or living in a mansion or flying in a plane or eating, eating. Yeah, where, what, yeah, what, what's wrong? Is that wrong? Is my body malfunctioning? And is this is satiating those desires wrong? Or is it actually satiating those desires, me fulfilling my destiny as a human being? I mean, these, these conversations come up in different ways across the board. I guess it's like a thing where, I mean, you can think about a couple ways, but I always think to some extent it's where it's the cat's out of the bag at this point. It doesn't matter. Humanity has already been altered severely through, through all this technology. It hasn't happened, hasn't been that long yet, comparatively. So we don't really know what's going to happen, but it's kind of like too late, really, to stop any of this stuff, unless there's some sort of a major collapse, like a major collapse. Yeah, yeah. But you can't, but that's, that's something where no one's going to make that happen. But also it's in, it's also in the humans, the human genome's best interest to not allow any type of a major collapse to happen. This is the same reason we've talked about this before, about how I, I don't think there's going to be nuclear fallout ever, because I think that the human genome, even though we work to our own self-interest significantly, there's also, there's that, there's that thing that we don't understand where the human genome is, it preserves itself, and it's not going to let one human destroy all other humans, because that would destroy the genome, which is like the driving thing. But I guess in terms of like the, you know, like, oh, if you just, if you can have access to everything pleasurable, you know, I guess we're kind of talking about the singularity here in a way, like the basis of it, like before it happens. And the thing that people always say about that is that if you take away the stakes of things that are superhuman, you have like this, there's like an emptiness to it. And so if, yeah, maybe, maybe you could eat all the food you want, you can have everything you want, but there's, if it's just because you can, there's, I don't, there's not like really any, you don't get anything out of it. It's an empty, it's not, it's not a success. It's sort of just like a, you just got it. It's a question of value too. It's like, it's a, like the value of an expert in anything, like an expert dancer, comedian, athlete, the reason that there's so much value, the reason like people who are like masters at whatever their particular craft or skill set is, get paid so much is just simple supply and demand. You know, there's one Shaquille O'Neal, you know, and, and he makes a lot of fucking money. There's one, Mike Tyson, there's one Dave Chappelle, Dave Chappelle. And they, if all of a sudden, via some technological mechanism, we can instantaneously gain those skill sets. There's no value in what they can do. It completely fucks up that value set. And so, and that's one of the real challenging things is that it's very disruptive to people who've spent their entire lives perfecting this thing or that thing, especially if those people, you know, are now completely like just like everybody else all of a sudden, if they've been identifying as the great violinist and it's like, you know what I mean? It's like, Oh yeah, you know, I downloaded it last night. I mean, I know you spent your whole life doing that, but yeah, you want to play? I mean, it's like, fuck you. You know, not my fingers. Yeah, it cheapens it. But it's always that same thing where it goes back to everything always goes back to the same thing where at what point do you do you value something? And if, if you do like, it's like a conundrum. It's like this thing. It's like a, it's almost like a logical cone of sorts where you can't solve it. It doesn't matter. I think what you said earlier is like really the key point. You can't stop it. Like it doesn't matter. It's over. It's over. When it, when soon as people are asking, like, should we be doing this? It's like, that's, if you have, if you can ask if we should, it's already too late to stop it because it's like that thing where it's just, you can't, you can't stop these things because they're going. I mean, I've been reading this, this book trilogy lately. I think I told you about it's called Three Body Problem. Yes. This Chinese author. I'm almost finished with the third book, but this, these books are insane man because they talk so much about like futurism. His ideas of futurism are so interesting because they seem like they're actually maybe correct. Just the ideas of how things will be in the future with humanity and what it means to be a human because it's all about also encountering aliens. But a big thing that they talk about a lot is just well, it talks about so much stuff, but I think it's like this thing where what we think as normal, maybe 200 years from now is it would just be become so outmoded that people don't even recognize it. Like this idea of masculinity maybe will become so unnecessary. It's so unnecessary to be masculine or feminine for that matter. It's so unnecessary that it just becomes, it's like when an animal through evolution has this weird vestigial thing where you're like, what is that therefore? It's like, oh, it's, it doesn't use it anymore. It used to use it thousands and thousands and thousands years ago, but because things have changed, it's evolved to not use this thing it used to have. And so we have these in the future, it's possible like this guy postulates that people will all look kind of the same, same sort of like sleek, feminine looking way, even though there are still men and still women, it's just these differences in the sexes will start to become, they won't be physically observable. At least they'll be super subtle because those things are from a bygone era. They're from an era where we're like living in caves and trying to survive droughts on like a savannah and stuff like that. Man, did you read that? It was like, it became clickbait for a little bit, but it's a real study they did. The prosthetic robotic thumb that they like, I can't remember this universe. I think it was a university. They designed an extra thumb that you would wear. You could control the thumb. It was an extra finger, maybe not a thumb. I think it was an extra thumb. You could like right around at your wrist, there was another thumb and you could control it with your toes. And they were basically that they wanted to see what happens to a person's brain over time if they have an extra appendage that's useful. And so, you know, they had to learn how to use it, but eventually people started doing things with it that you can't do without an extra thumb. And they did brain scans and their brains changed to just accept, oh yeah, I guess I have a new thumb. And so, I think you're, what's the author's name? It's Chinese. I think it's C-I-X-I-N-L-I-U or something like that. He should try instead of, he should just call himself Six Naloo instead of spelling it out. But he, that's just so many letters to be named. But the, you know, people who are predicting a human form over the next century are, I think that is, it's not going to be like that. I think that- No, not that fast. No, not that fast for sure. No, I mean, I don't know that we're going to look human in 100 years. I mean, I don't know if like already they're like, oh yeah, here's like a technology where you could just have an extra thumb. You don't have to get an operation. You're just going to put it on. You're going to control it with this neural mesh or whatever or some wireless technology. And once you get this extra thumb, you're now going to be able to play music on the piano that's never been heard before. You're going to be able to do a million things that humans have never been able to do before. It's $55 and it comes from Apple. You know what I mean? How many people are not going to have that fucking thumb? And then when that turns into the extra arm, and then when it turns into the extra eye, and then when it turns into the extra dick, and then when it turns into all the extra things, suddenly, you know, looking like a base level human is just going to be the same as being naked. And, you know, I mean, it's not- Totally. And that is the future. There is a science thing about that. There is a certain science thing about that. I have to- I'm not correct you, but I mean, there's this thing that I only learned recently about how there's a difference between evolutionary responses and the difference between your brain accommodating. So the brain that accommodates for the extra thumb, how it changes the pathways, that is not a heritable characteristic. So that person's kids won't have that- There have to be a very, very long time of having the extra thumb for it to change sort of evolution of the species. It's like the idea that we could inherit the ability to drive a car. You know, inherit the ability to like use a typewriter, inherit the ability to not use a cell phone. Yeah, I know. It's not like tool use is not going to be genetically expressed. It's going to be a learned factor. I wish I knew the technical way to say that. It's like such a cool way that evolutionary biologists will talk about that. There's some like word for it. It's called triturization. That's like we want to fight the term. You know, one of my friends was saying you could just make it. You don't have to use the word. You could just make it up. It's so much more fun. Oh yeah, you mean triturization. It's also like when people name a plant or an insect they found, it's always like, oh, this is the, this is a Duncan trusselus apexus. That's the funniest thing when they name it after themselves. You got it. You have to name it. The first thing you discover, you're always supposed to name it after yourself or like your, yeah, you're supposed to name it after yourself or like your mentor. Are you fucking kidding me? That's crazy. That's so limiting. It's a tradition. There's all kinds of super weird name rules. You know, came up with that rule of selfish piece of shit came up with that rule. What a selfish dig. It's like, if you discover a thing, name it after yourself or your teacher. No. Yeah. I want to name it whatever. I discovered the motherfucker. Wait, who gets to make that rule? Who made that rule? It's not a rule. It's not a rule. It's just, it's sort of like a, like a tradition. How about that? Like only naming boats, like feminine names. Yeah, which is definitely, if you name your boat a male, it's going to fucking sink. So you can't play with fire like that. It's a fucking boat, man. It's not like it's a house. Dude, I, you know what? I want, I'm going to name my boat Frank Williams of the sea. Yeah. I might as well just buy, just buy some spackle. Buy like a, you better get a bunch of buckets and a, and a nice, uh, bailing motor, nice sump pump. I'm going to call my boat Mr. Sump Pump and it's going to sink the second you take it off the dock. It can't even float. Like it's mysterious. It just goes right down. It turns into bricks. The second it leaves the docks. And now we will christen the Gary Plants. Break the bottle and it just drops down into the sea. You can send a diver down there to paint the word Ms. Gary Plants and it'll just all of a sudden start to float back up again. The Ms. Gary Plants. Gary, Gary can be a woman's name. Hey, did I do it? You try it. Try it. Try it. Try it going from the middle. Say this. Say come here. Say come here. Come here. Can't do it. Johnny, thank you so much for being on the show, man. I love, I love you and it's great talking to you anytime. I love you. I do. I love you. Isn't it weird how you can say it? You can say if you say something in a certain way it sounds like, why are you making fun of me? I do love you. That's another thing we could have talked about too is how like, isn't it weird how that shit is like so real? What? Just like this subtlest thing you can just basically like through language you can just be you can communicate so much just the way you say something. Yeah. Yeah. I love you. I love you. I love you. Yeah, I do though. You know, I really do. I really love you. I really do find you. Hi, welcome to my art studio. It's in my home. Drop off your child and we'll have him here for nine hours and they give a snack break and they take a bath in my house because we have cats. Wow. Thank you for having me in my child in your art studio. Don't worry. Just drop your child off. No problem. Welcome. We're a state accredited organization. Hi. You're in line to experience sexual Disneyland. That's going to be the weird thing is being in line at sexual Disneyland. I'm not waiting in line. That's for sure. I don't want to wait in line for anything, let alone that. You're in line with a bunch of horny dudes. I don't want to wait in lines. No lines. You're in line. They've got like paintings of the robot. You're going to fuck all over the wall and you're in line just waiting and everybody's got to wait for the guy to finish in front of them. That sounds like an old school porn theater. What's the difference? Nothing changes. Yeah, because you know the lines long enough eventually they're just going to everyone's just going to start fucking in the line. No one's going to wait for the robot. Yeah, it's going to be something like once you like, well, I'm already here. I'm already going to do this thing. Might as well just do it in line. Johnny Pemberton, where can people find you? You've got Johnny Pemberton.dog. It'll direct you from there. What happened with your Twitch stream? I'm still waiting. You know, I think it's with Twitch, it's just a matter of getting my case in front of an actual human, because no human would be like, would deny this. I think it's what happened is the AI, because they're overwhelmed with cases and stuff. I think it's just getting it in front of a human. The reason why is because the name of your Twitch was just my nipples. Yeah, which is, which is, you know, I guess it's TOS terms of service, even though they allowed me to create it, I used it for almost a year. And also I was, there's all kinds of things that were, it should have come up earlier. And also I wasn't doing anything even remotely sexual with the channel. But it doesn't benefit them from cutting you out from the service. Like you draw traffic to the service. So I think there's a lot of sticky stuff with these companies now, because they are having to navigate that weird walk between being something where there's a lot of company, the idea of wokeness and like sexual acceptance versus having content that is explicit. And there's a real difficult line to walk if you're like a massive company that has to make everyone happy. It's you have a difficult time right now because there's so much this sex positive attitude when you can't possibly negate someone's sexuality. But you also don't want to have this become something where, oh, this is not, this isn't a porn site. This isn't a cam girl site. It's kind of like a lot of these people were saying, well, why can't I do this? Like, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's like loophole shit. It's just, it's really dumb. Well, but it's inevitable, I think. You got to let us know, man, when you're back online. Yeah. Oh, you'll know, you'll know. I'm going to get back on there. It's also been kind of nice in a way because I've been like, been a focus on other stuff because I haven't had that going on. God bless you, Pemberton. Follow Pemberton.
