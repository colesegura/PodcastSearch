Welcome! My name is Duncan Trussell and you have made the sacred decision to cross through a kind of portal into an alternate multiverse where you are now listening to the DTFH, the podcast that has received over five stallion of light awards from the Schringender Peace Association. I welcome you. Today's guest is one of the most requested guests on this podcast. If you, like me, have some inexplicable inner threat of puritanical guilt because you desire things like PlayStation 5s and polyamorous foot jobs instead of longing for some austere mountain hut where you're eating bowls of tasteless oatmeal and chicken broth, then you're going to love today's episode because Mitch Horowitz teaches a powerful philosophy that invites us to examine our desires not as though they were some kind of crusty hell barnacle growing in the coral reefs of our souls but rather the actual bridge that can connect us to who we truly are. I love it. It's okay to want a PlayStation 5. It's okay to want a nice car. It's okay to dream of one day laying on your back in some beautiful exotic location while your many lovers rub oil on your moobs and make you suck their feet.

everyone please welcome back to the Duncan Trestle family our podcast the brilliant author lecturer and philosopher Mitch Horowitz it's Duncan Trestle Mitch welcome back to the DTFH it is so nice to get a chance to talk with you because i got a lot of questions for you today all right thank you my man great to be here your book the miracle habits uh it's fills me with a little bit of envy only just because like what you just randomly put out a book like when i the last time i chatted with you you just put out a book but suddenly there's just another book tell me about how this came about uh i i sit in front of the keyboard a lot and um i don't know it's funny i'm at a stage in my life i'm turning 55 this month congrats November 23rd yes so it's i don't know if that's quite as much of a milestone as turning 50 but one does feel it uh in some way yeah and i've reached this point in my life where there seems to be this weird sort of tipping point where i sit down to write something and if i'm being honest and if i'm being sincere a lot of accumulated material comes pouring out of me i don't know that'll continue forever you and i might talk in another year and i'll say oh my god you know i feel this crisis of of content of material i feel like i'm i'm faking it or something i hope that day won't come but at this point when i sit down to write something particularly in the area of self-development a lot a lot comes pouring out of me and so that's how the miracle habits was born and since habits rule our lives and since habits can direct us into catastrophe my contention is that habits can also direct us to extraordinary things and so the book consists of 13 habits that i think can can can prove helpful and what's beautiful about a prolific author giving a prescription like this is that the proof is in the pudding you clearly whatever you're doing is working because you're you're i don't you're shotgunning out books and they're good that's the other they're they're good they're concise they're smart i was um reading the miracle habits and i wanted to tell you about a weird secrecy that happened so and and also i want to engage you for some free self-development help if you don't mind i know it will make me seem like a greedy pig but hey what am i gonna do what else are we gonna talk about uh i'll take it out of your skin later all right okay so okay here's my here's something that has been happening to me and it's driving it's driving me crazy i keep losing my keys i keep losing my wallet i don't know what's going on it's like really like annoying me and so i lost my the most reason thing i lost was my wallet and i stopped for a moment and i really was thinking of neville goddard i really was thinking of like okay this whatever this is is it's gotta stop like we've got to turn a corner i'm a dad i've got another son coming i can't be losing my shit all the time you know so i thought all right we're gonna use this ridiculous irresponsible moment of absent mindedness as a catalyst to enter into a new dimension where i no longer lose my keys or my wallet and i know that's not a big deal it's not asking for a mansion it's not you know all the other stuff i would like an infinity infinity pool looking out over the mountains i want it and i love how in your book you teach us don't be afraid of wanting those things it's okay but oh absolutely before i get to that i gotta be able to keep track of my keys you know i'm not like a nine-year-old so that's when i found in your book moments into miracles and i wonder if you could talk a little bit about that and how i might be able to use this ridiculous embarrassing moment of absent mindedness to get into my future mountain palace with an infinity pool yes there's so much unpack there it's interesting you know i i mean i want to say three different things okay the first is i it as much as i've entered a deeply prolific stage in my life and as much as i can point to extraordinary things in my life that i feel give me perspective from which to write about the miraculous i also try to be really transparent in the book about the failings weaknesses that i feel in my life and not just in some sing song bullshit way like today i lost my temper in traffic but you know i will lay awake at four o'clock in the morning staring at the ceiling because uh i don't know the right way to talk to the you know energy company about switching my gas service or right bullshit thing that you know to another person sounds like some very minor silly little detail of life but for me for various reasons is loaded with emotional triggers we all have them and none of them have to be rational they're just ours yeah and so i i try to be really transparent about the weaknesses that that that i also have because when people who write in the space of new age or alternative spirituality or self-development aren't naked in front of the reader they're they're liars in two realms you know they're liars in their own lives and they're liars and what they're telling the readers so i try to be really transparent about that too um the other thing is i do believe the small things in life like finding lost keys are very important it's to add to your synchronicity i actually lost my keys this morning and i found them in the bathroom where everybody should leave their keys just go right now and put your keys right by the toilet where they belong so they can get flushed um you know i i do believe small things are important because what we and i i i try to make this point throughout the miracle habits what you could do in a macro fashion what you could do in a micro fashion you could do in a macro fashion what you could do on a small scale can be repeated on a large one as above so below and so if you use some methodology to straighten something out that might seem modestly important you're getting a cent trail you're getting a hint and you can use that same methodology i think on a larger scale so it's it's actually in a certain sense if i had to wax philosophical i could even venture the argument that maybe you're training yourself we're all training ourselves that when lost keys or lost wallet which do need finding i mean it's not so minor i mean you do need those things it's it's it's important yeah when those things are lost and found and when there seems to be a certain method behind the the the the finding behind the success it begs the question can i now use that method on some larger scale which the person the individual must experiment with and then as far as your your mountain fortress and your infinity pool and that kind of thing i i feel that it's profoundly important for all of us to be very frank with ourselves about what we really want and not to get put off the trail of that by by someone else's decision by someone else telling us that superficial yeah there's a story i tell in the book where i had a shrink a good man and i must say you know a really positive good shrink who asked me what i wanted in life and i started to talk about all these kind of markers of success that i want and i was very frank with him about it and he said to me but that's superficial and i said to him now look you've known me for a long time and you know that if i bring something to the table it's something i've thought about i've wrestled with if i am telling you that these markers of success are things that i really feel having considered the matter from different angles are vital to my sense of happiness accomplishment selfhood how can that by any definition be called superficial i mean we're calling it superficial because there's a book of quotations somewhere where there's a set of translations of translations of translations of ancient spiritual literature somewhere that says we're supposed to do that but that's someone else's decision that's not my decision that's not even your decision it's you know by which i mean my peer group that's a decision that really is just hollowed by repetition and so i would say to the individual and this is why i sort of push back against the people who complain about spiritual materialism and so forth which i think is another one of these tropes that needs to be tested in each individual experience rather than just applied in a general way if someone comes along and says i want a beautiful new car whatever it may be that person may have profound reasons for wanting that car and if you speak to that person about it it's like un unrolling a ball of twine and you find that you're you that ball of twine is attached to something very very very important and i think we've got we as a spiritual culture have got to get off of this trip of judging things as material or superficial or inner or outer everything functions as part of one whole the way that the you know constituent particles of an element ultimately function as one whole and i really think as neville teaches desires are sacred and i think that's more than just a pretty expression i think that there's something very deep from within a person that that bespeaks itself as desire and that we make a very big mistake and we generalize when we classify a desire as being good or bad based on some ethic that is actually the product of somebody else's decision oh i love it it's such a it it's such a bitter feeling to have a legitimate authentic desire for something and then to have whatever your particular you know whatever spiritual fascist lives in your head i don't think you do but some people do appear and shake their fucking finger at you like no no no no no no that's a trap and it's like yeah but that's what i want i want to get in the trap i i want that and so i love that's one of the many things i love about what you're teaching this glorious heartthumper of an episode of the d t f h has been sponsored by the cbd alchemists over at feels we're so lucky that feels exist in the universe because other

a little bit more detail about this holistic conceptualization of the self and specifically this is something i've been ruminating over which is where do i stop and where does the rest of everything start you know what i'm talking about the the what is totally okay great well dig this you know william blake wrote opposition is true friendship and i really take that principle seriously because sometimes it's when people insult us or fuck with us that we learn things and are open to things and years ago um there was an artist on facebook who called me uh outer looking he said you know i'm outer looking and i took it as an insult because in spiritual culture we all want to think in terms of essence and the higher and the numinous and the the inner journey you know and if we're called outer looking the implication is obviously that we're being superficial or we're getting attached to the ephemeral and i understand that and you know i got thinking you know okay is he right you know am i outer looking and i thought to myself well yeah you know he is right if you interpret what he's saying in the strictest terms but if you keep unraveling the onion it seems to me and this became a real opening for me this is all just artifice this idea of higher lower inner outer permanent temporal material numinous personality essence you know it's all part of one whole life it's all part of one whole existence if one takes seriously the maxim as above so below from hermetic literature or takes seriously the idea that the creator fashion the individual in its own image it stands to reason that there is a wholeness to life and when we create these these lines of demarcation it's artifice you know where would one begin in the other end you know where does the numinous begin and and and the temporal end you know where would i draw that line where does inner begin and outer end where does higher begin and lower you you know end you know a friend of mine used to joke vis-a-vis personality and essence if i do something or i say something and i like it you know i assume that must be essence and and if i don't like it i assume that must be personality these are all you know that i can't get my arms around any of this you know show me ego show me it show me super ego etc you know and i began to feel so this is all one thing this is all one thing now there are questions of am i behaving violently am i behaving with reciprocity there's there's there's a whole other you know issue there and and and i take very seriously the question of reciprocity for the same reason that i'm describing which is there's a wholeness to our existence there's a wholeness to our existence and and i mean this i want people to really feel i want people to really feel that they can take a break that they can really take a break from sweating the question of whether something that they desire is somehow in sync with spiritual principles you know whether that might be a job or a money or a mate or something sexual or a car or whatever it is because again you know how do these lines of demarcation get drawn and i can say from personal experience that i've met so many people within the alternative spiritual culture as well as the traditional mainstream culture however one defines it but i've met so many people who would just describe themselves very willingly as being on the spiritual or religious path and they are absolutely torn in two they're torn in two by people telling them you have to practice non-attachment you have to practice non-identification you know that's the answer yeah so they're telling themselves you know non-identification non-attachment or they're reprocessing their desires through some kind of perfumed language like well you know thy will be done if it's thy will may i get this job and i'll use this job to help people and it's like if you're going to help people whatever that means you know do so but don't reprocess your desire through that as if it's somehow tricking the cosmic we're tricking the higher mind or tricking god that it's like you know yeah i want that Mercedes so i can help drive poor children to the circus you know whatever i mean so and and and i really feel that we as a generation and we as individuals have to test and verify you know these principles because we wind up enforcing them self-enforcing them enforcing them out of the people i don't think they produce happiness in the individual i think that the individual is capable of defining happiness for him or herself i really do and should not have that that that definition taken away i i love i love it so much and that sort of i don't know contortion that twisted pretzel that can come from misunderstanding some of these spiritual teachings or correctly understanding them is it feels like a life-ruiner it feels like some of these philosophies are inviting people in a kind of a state of permanent disassociation you know like and and that seems that seems like the opposite of happiness it's you know it's like a it's like almost like a weird form of suicide or anesthesia or something where you're supposed to you know the whole concept of the ego you know and i i love that you suggest that there isn't a real difference between the ego and what some people call the soul is that what you're saying that there isn't like this metaphysical biology because that is like oh the the if you were to draw a diagram of one of the ways that some paths some spiritual paths break down the human being it's you've got your body and all your organs but then you've got your you know your aura you've got your chakras somewhere in there is the soul and the soul is a pure perfect you know moat of divine love and everything else is going to cause you suffering it's going to cause you pain it's a misunderstanding or kind of like you being in a dream state as you go and try to get the Mercedes to bring the kids to the circus because the soul only emanates love only emanates you know all the whatever Bhagavan all the various like the things we like to put into italics you know generosity yeah kindness discipline but the ego is this all consuming all devouring life destroying kind of black hole that needs to be somehow eradicated and this produces a kind of living contradiction that i think makes people like harm themselves i agree i agree i i think that that i personally speaking believe that division is just man made it's just artifice it's just something that we've we've we've written down you know albeit in various traditions which is why it deserves attention but you know we kind of write down this paradigm determine that this paradigm is is absolutely true that it's a topographical uh uh yeah diagram that cannot be changed challenged and doesn't require re-verification and and and so we wind up with this sense of of divide you know so there's right there's the ego who grasps who gobbles up things there's the soul that's loving and giving i don't know that any of this is true i mean all i mean when i say spiritual is extra physical you know what do we do we as individuals have an extra physical existence and i believe that the answer to that is is absolutely and self-evidently yes i base that on many factors one of them being esp research for example academic esp research has statistically demonstrated the anomalous transfer of information in laboratory settings one can one can embrace it one can dam it one can use different terms but in as much as statistics are useful for determining reality we have seen in repeatable experiments the critics always say you know none of this has been repeated and it's like i know they believe that no matter how many you know uh citations i give them they will no more believe these experiments have been repeated than hardcore trump supporters will believe that you know an act a reasonably accurate vote has been certified right totally emotional can't be can't that chasm can't be crossed but in any case we have statistical evidence of anomalous transfer of information in lab settings and have had this for decades so you know marry that to a whole variety of other things including neuroplasticity for example where thoughts alter brain matter and you have evidence of the extra physical where that evidence takes us this is a whole other questions does that mean when i die i'm going to cross the river sticks and you know do this that the other thing i have no idea but it certainly suggests that that you the individual have an extra physical existence which to me is what the spiritual is and given that i have an extra physical existence i don't necessarily know that that means you know i have what a 19th century writer might have called a soul uh i don't know that that means that i'm going to be reincarnated i don't know that that means that that i pass through concentric circles of of life as as as we're taught in hermetic tradition but i also do believe that the people who who set these things down have profound insights they're they're on the path with us albeit as historical eminences in our distant past and it it requires exploration by the individual in the here and now but i wouldn't be strict i wouldn't be strict about assigning meaning to uh or assigning a kind of a slot or category to different facets of behavior the the me that wants to lend a hand to somebody taking out their garbage versus the me that wants to have some shiny new object is one better than the other i have no idea does one emanate from a different place i have no idea uh all i'm certain of is that we have an extra physical existence and i i am certain based on my own experience and based on being in community with other people that we are here to be generative we are here to be productive that's not contradicted in any of our religious literature and in many cases it's it's affirmed and i do not believe that the 21st century person can truly be happy unless he or she is moving in the direction of some sense of attainment productivity generativity when those things are absent the individual withers and feels terrible desperation can you talk a little okay so i think something to that to consider when we are looking at this kind of holistic idea of the self which is like one thing i love that you just said is like i you need to check it out yourself just because there's a topographical map created by someone who maybe was awakened showing a kind of landscape that has within it like an area called the soul an area called the ego or an superego if you want to go Freudian or whatever the model is you still need to investigate it but this brings to mind something that we were kind of talking about before i started recording which is that you were talking about how you know one of the things that people who are going to write do is the the cabin fantasy you go off into the cabin some sanctuary in the hopes that you will be more productive and when you were telling me about that i was thinking yeah also aside from the fact that that's probably not going to work it's another way to procrastinate if i'm going to so if i'm heading to a cabin to write then now i've got to find the cabin get to the cabin get the time off to get there to the cabin make the arrangements and probably if i produce enough in between me and getting that cabin i'll never get to the cabin and will not be thrust against the problem of having to write but what is what do you think that force in the universe is that keeps us from procrastinating from being creative from being progenitive because if we're going to like sort of throw away the map where there's this distinction between the ego and the soul then that would obviously indicate that torpor slothfulness laziness fear cowardice all the stuff that keeps us from being progenitive is also part of ourselves and that's what to finish this question uh which is what is that is that part of ourselves is that a sacred part of ourselves what i love about the way you teach and what you teach is anytime i get into your writing i feel confronted i feel like you've ripped away all of the great tricks i use to keep me from manifesting the kind of life that i want in somewhere in there there's this sense of vertigo or like holy shit i can't jump Mitch you want me to jump off this crazy diving board i can't do it man and so maybe you could can you talk a little bit about you know i'm talking about that molasses quality of the psyche that slows us down that makes us not create that thing that where we can't get out of the comfort zone into the place where we do you know but you know start really working magic if magic is the you know whatever you want to call co-creation of the universe of the divine or the co-creation of the universe with yourself well i think there's a wish for safety and a lot of times safety comes in the form of a kind of physical equilibrium where we're well fed uh we are intoxicated to help with relaxation you know that means booze or weed or drugs or whatever um which i participate into uh zoning out in front of the the screen or whatever it may be zoning out in front of social media all of these things create a kind of physical equilibrium and safety and that has its place and and i practice it as well i practice avoidance of certain things because it gives me a feeling of safety and that's not always a bad thing you know i mean sometimes we avoid things that are really dangerous and problematic and other times we get so sucked into this need for physical equilibrium that we eat ourselves to death or you know we drink ourselves to death or whatever it may be but i think that within every person who has invested him or herself totally in this sense of equilibrium there's something that they yearn to do that they have left behind and that something is almost always going to mean giving up the potato chips at giving up whatever it is that you're binge watching at a given moment and and doing something and so it's funny in a certain way i've gotten so conditioned and i've gotten so wired to work that i actually have i have the opposite problem i mean i i seriously have difficulty relaxing and i need to zone out sometimes yeah it's like you know i'll i i i mean and i have to i have to trick myself in order to do it you know it might mean for example i've been watching orson welles movies and i really dig or welles he was a fucking maniac and just so brilliant and wonderful and so if i'm watching him i kind of get into him you know and i can kind of zone out a little bit or i'll like blast music that i really love um so you know we all get into groups and we all get into habits but i do think that when people are in a habit of seeking safety and equilibrium there's usually something there's usually a sorrow in my experience in there where they're not building the thing or or writing the thing or or going somewhere or seeing someone or doing something or making that phone call that they really may want want to do um but we get we get so conditioned by sameness that we do tend to seek it out okay that's cool it's just a so basically it's just it's another habituation it's it's uh it's not like it's not you know sometimes when i'm right now i'm not thank god in that place but anytime i've gotten really blocked uh you know and it's just more laziness i'll start thinking like well it's maybe it's a demon or spiritual curse or a force keeping me from it you know and but usually what it is is it's just i'm not putting my ass in the seat and typing you know it's nothing complex it's like yeah sometimes just assuming the act is all that's necessary you know william james made that observation uh you know he said look we always assume that our moods determine our our actions but he said you know what if the reverse is is actually true and it's funny i i know this professor clinical professor of psychiatry named norm rosenthal at georgetown and norm and a colleague of his several years ago did a a study based on botox and mood and they they they found that botox treatments seem to be uh lifting depression and they were able to institute you know various controls so that it was obvious that just the appearance changed alone if it was desirable wasn't the factor there was some other x factor coming on and norm hypothesized that and this is going to sound just ridiculous but it's it's actually amazing norm hypothesized that um one of the things that botox does is it actually freezes and effectively disables the muscles that you use to frown and he related that back to william james's observation and he wondered if the actual physical disabling of certain mood expressions might in and of itself have contributed to a lifting of depression that that was just a a hypothesis that he drew upon from the study but it does comport with what james wrote about and it's interesting um i don't have any final conclusions about it and nor does he but i i do think that one should take seriously that performing the task uh can actually bring with it courage for example instead of saying gee i have to screw up my courage so i can do something the actual task itself uh can at least be observed to engender the emotion well you know this this uh yeah to me it makes perfect it makes perfect sense i mean any it's just even if it's a really small act uh it's doing an experiment like that just holding your bar you know not slouching smiling simple things like that are kind of a declaration of autonomy over whatever those uh habits or forces are that keep us in a just frozen in a specific uh a dejected state i mean i i feel like that happens to people it certainly has happened to me where you get your heart broken you have some massive disappointment and you stay frozen like ambarized in that disappointment so you hold your body the way you're when your body slouched down and as you are crushed by life you just keep your body like that and simply lifting up and smiling it can have a powerful effect now i want to jump in to your awesome 30 day mental challenge and you know it's it is for me it's literally challenging in the sense that and again it's what i love about you man there's like things and it feels like you've been looking in my window as my wife and i are like making love to shawn hannity we had sex to shawn hannity the other night mitch do you know how fucked up that is like i had sex which is pregnant mental future will never leave me a pregnant third trimester sex in front of shawn hannity and i'm looking it's horrible i mean i really do think we might have like damaged the universe from that like we did some kind of horrific ritual that in the world maybe it'll never be the same but you go ahead what you're gonna say will never leave me or your listeners this is it sorry everyone but i'm sorry all they it's it was really a dark it was a dark moment but i'm looking here at your 30 day mental challenge and one of the um and and i don't know if this is part of it or if this is just part of your blog but one of the things you have here is reject comfort media is that part of the challenge or yes okay uh and i'm just gonna read a little bit of what you wrote uh we derive a visceral thrill and probably a dopamine rush from reading things that affirm what we already believe this is especially true of emotional subjects like religion and politics opinion porn if i may delivers the same kind of repetitive thrill as binge eating it provides the head nodding joe of seeing your imagined adversary's taken down and your team score another touchdown we don't agree with shawn hannity at all it's more the opposite hearing someone say things we don't agree with but it's the same pathetic kind of high and so you're saying yeah in this 30 day mental challenge that we've got to stop like turn it off quit doing that why why is that gonna help me like i know i got no obvious reasons like oh you'll feel better or it'll challenge you but tell me what how metaphysically this has some connection to me like jumping into the part of the multiverse where i'm a bit more actualized or connected yeah well it's yeah this it's a super simple program method that anybody can jump into at any time um it's linked up on my social media i have an article at medium on the 30 day mental challenge uh you just have to write down a vow to focus on on what is is forwarding and advancing and all ambitions that are reasonably within reach and and and attempt this for 30 days and there are various facets to it and i i i've been doing it with people and providing some commentary day to day but the basis of it is this i believe first of all i believe in very simple exercises i really believe that profundity is experienced only in application so if i say to somebody you know we shouldn't lie you know head start nodding yeah of course we shouldn't lie i know that well we all know that but we only experience the the depth of that statement when we actually attempt to do it and fail and then we're thrown in front of all kinds of other questions or maybe we succeed and then you know that exists on to all kinds of other questions but in any case the world is filled with literature about how to live well none of us follow it if they if we follow literature of how to live well you know all you need to do is just read marcus aurelius or read the beatitudes or read the dowdy ching or read the guida take your pick uh and and and we've been reading these things for centuries upon centuries and they haven't changed the world they haven't changed the world because we don't we don't test them we don't apply them we think we do and maybe we do for 15 minutes and then we get up out of the chair and we go up out into the traffic of human life and all of our intentions are immediately taken away yes the malady of human nature is the certainty that because we nod our heads and agree with something it somehow is applicable to my life so i believe in very very very simple exercises so simple that we're up to write them off we're up not to test them we're up not to even make an effort for a limited period of time to attempt to apply them the profundity is found only in the experience only in the application which may include failure but my contention is that if we assert a sense of self-determination if we assert a sense of self-selection if we assert a kind of positive fortitude in the face of circumstances that can be sorrowful depleting we will learn something we will discover something and we may discover extraordinary change in our lives because we so rarely test things we so rarely apply any of these ideas that we like to talk about and ideas grow more and more complex our language and our vocabulary grows more and more complex our range of cultural options expands and expands as as and yet what would that accomplish you know what would that accomplish it's like flying up in an airplane and looking down at the ground and saying wow what extraordinary perspective but then we get back down to the ground and everything is exactly the same so i like simple things because i feel that they at least go the individual towards applications that's what the 30 day mental challenge is about i suppose that's why i'm attached to all this literature from new thought you know all these kind of like supposedly simple books about the power of using your mind because they render into popular language steps that so few of us ever take ever attempt ever really try in terms of using our psyches in in different ways and they're completely uncharted territory and yet also you know completely available this episode of the DTFH has been brought to you by the sweet darling chefs over at hello fresh i love hello fresh if you haven't tried it yet you really should it makes me feel like i'm on the cooking channel because like you know when you're watching the cooking shows and they've got all the ingredients measured out

fresh what you're saying about these like very simple acts i've i've i saw this trainer talking about how look if i if yeah you can run you know whatever eight miles you know start once a week or whatever that you think you can do you're gonna be sore you're not gonna want to exercise or run half a mile and you can do that every day and you're in the end is gonna be so much better than you doing this thing which i am guilty of which is like you know finally i get i whip whatever the donkey of my soul enough so that it i'm extra you know it does whatever it is i'm wanting and then i overexert you know it's like i'll now it's like i'm gonna train for a fucking marathon or now i can't just run you know it's got to be like now it's gonna be uphill for as long as i can until i feel like i'm gonna die and then i don't do it anymore so i do love this very subtle simple um day to day uh activities that you're that you're laying out for us and um i wonder if you could talk a little bit about and i'm sorry this is kind of jumping back in time uh earlier you're mentioning hermetic conceptualization of human existence as concentric circles yes can you talk about that for a second sure hermetic literature which which grew out of the late stages of ancient egypt the generations immediately following christ it was kind of an amalgam of greek and egyptian thought written down in greek that's where the expression as above so below is derived from and one of the ideals in hermetic literature is that we occupy these concentric circles of existence and the absolute center of these concentric circles is what the greeks called news or mind this great higher mind or intelligence emerson called in an over soul uh and and and everything emanates from this ultimate sense of of of intellect and and emanates through these concentric circles and we beings that occupy these various circles of varying distances from news from the center are in our own sphere able to create in the way that that that this higher mind creates although we are also restricted by the physical limitations that we experience and i really love hermeticism because it helps me to it helps me to cope with some of the contradictions that i experience when i'm using the philosophy of of a neville goddard or of new thought this idea that mind is the ultimate creator because of course we experience physical decline we experience mortality yes never been an exception to that and so we do live within these material confines that will not prove permeable to mind in the here and now and when i mean the here and now i mean i mean i'm talking you know tuesday afternoon at two p.m you know i don't want to hear about an experience that somebody had when they were on vacation so to speak like you know we've all had higher moments of sensitivity and awareness but i'm talking about that which rules our lives in the here and now and and right now and hermeticism would say you know this is not a failure to grasp something this is just the nature of things you are able to create and your mind is able to generate it is however you do exist uh at some distance away from the center we don't know what but what distance but but these concentric circles that you dwell within all have their own laws and forces and you're gonna have to experience them over time you may through cycles of life through cycles of recurrence uh uh uh progress through these concentric circles but every one of them has its own laws and forces and you're gonna have to deal with that so to me that that was helpful in terms of my approach to to new thought this yeah this that i love models like that that produce a kind of map uh because yeah and yeah for me with new thought the part where my rational mind gets thwarted is the part where it's like well yeah but i don't understand how in a world where there appears to be limited resources you know you take it to the maximum everybody adopts this way of thinking and not only adopts this way of thinking but fully like adopts it like you know when you read Goddard you this isn't the secret man this it's like it's his it's the most psychedelic invitation to start remembering from the future basically and yes that's wild because it you know that i think that's the place where i don't know how many people can walk with him into that place because he's saying you know you're going to just this you really are gonna have to give up a lot to achieve this state of consciousness and if you do you essentially you do transcend you do get past the limitations there is no limitation other than you imposing it so for me yeah these kinds of maps the circle when i have not heard but these kinds of maps work really well because they point to a multiverse instead of a single universe they point to the possibility of leaping parallel timelines using your mind that the mind becomes the navigation unit through which we move through the multiverse do you know of anything that looks at the world in that way like i the hermetic conceptualization sounds like it but maybe i'm misunderstanding you when you talk about it the idea but essentially being and we've seen the pictures of the alchemist like lifting up the curtain of the universe you know and just walking out right you know yes how literally are we to take these ideas i mean they really do point to the possibility of like if you wanted to you could just pull the curtain up and say adios to this particular whatever you want to call it circle or sphere or whatever it may be uh how literally are we to take these ideas well it's interesting you know i think that neville and hermeticism for me those philosophies form the greatest mystical analog to quantum theory to the the illusion of of time and space and i speak that's why i speak in terms of selecting versus manifesting which is not a term that i use because in terms of selecting if perspective and i'm really sort of encapsulating this into a very tight little marble and there's so many other directions that can go in but if if through the measurement of the senses i'm experiencing something it would necessarily bring with it a past present future so that i don't have a sense of something changing i have a sense of it always being this way but i have selected it also in this and so it's not as if i experienced my selection as a before and after i experienced that as a complete naturalness including what i call the past including what i call the present including what i call my expectation of the future in the same way that if you make a determination to measure the locality of a particle in a lab based on the time of day you've taken that measurement based on the decision to measure or not measure you have effectively created a whole past present and future that would have been entirely different if you've taken a breath and and done it just a moment later which raises the question of serial universes and everything playing out at once and so it it totally tears us under this whole idea of a linearity to life but i want to touch on something you said i want to ask you a question because you use a beautiful beautiful phrase where we're remembering from the future you know if we're selecting an outcome we're remembering from the future one of the things i wrestle with in in terms of that approach and i think that's a beautiful way of encapsulating nevel um one of the questions that i run up against is this you know i was saying earlier i was quoting blake opposition is true friendship you know it's talking about experiences i've had that have been fractious that have been difficult but have brought me to new places have produced helped me to produce things that i never otherwise would have produced sometimes i'm not i'm not so sure i want to erase opposition as frustrating and as anger-inducing as it might be right now you know if i go into my if i try to enter into some hypnagogic feeling state in which i turn bitter into sweet let's say is that really what i'm after you know because if i eliminate bitter i've eliminated the very thing that may be refining me i've eliminated my ability to relate to another person who's also suffering you know so i i i feel temperamentally sometimes i'm not really sure that i want to i i know i want victory but i'm not sure i want to eliminate bitter oh i love that well i mean yeah i well i think from the way that you talk about challenges you it's not like you're it's just the way that you've conceptualized challenges odd it doesn't it doesn't make them unbitter but it produces a space within a life where these things aren't necessarily an indication that you're doing something wrong and anymore what comes to mind is like someone like complaining to an an attendant at a gym because all these exercise machines are making them sore you know get rid of them you know the point is they're there for you to to develop yourself to to grow yes uh yes and i so it makes me think of chogyeom trump orenpoche in his description of imagine a child licking a razor blade with honey on it that you know with the child in the in the full awareness of a child simultaneously feels the pain tastes the blood but also the honey they're all there together and you don't you know and so yeah i i i wouldn't want i know what you mean i i especially when it comes to friendships where i disagree with my friends i love that i have friends i vehemently disagree i have friends who call me like a blue-bellied commie you know like q and on friends who like you know what i mean they they i know they think i must be part of some like global conspiracy or something you know what i mean and i i i love it because i feel like my very existence ruins their conspiracy because i'm not you know i i just we just believe differently and i'm so happy what a sad what a sad universe it would be where there was no opposition where we get rid of that the joy of overcoming it's so great yes but yes you know simultaneously uh you do don't you kind of run you run into a problem which is you have to like make sure you're not getting addicted to the adversity you know what i mean for me it's like yeah yeah because my upbringing i was taught that pain means success you know what i mean that if you're not suffering to some degree then you can't really be successful and this produces like a workaholic attitude in me where i'll get up at four five a.m and start working not necessarily because i want to but because it will definitely produce a certain level of pain you know what i mean and i'm familiar with that uh so i don't know man i yeah i think goddard points in the direction of all the great mistakes and i think it's a little terrifying what he's pointing towards it is terrifying and you know the i mean what i love about neville is he issues such a radical thesis to us and he means it so literally you know he taught your mind is god and i don't mean that in some metaphorical way and i don't mean that in some symbolic way i mean that quite literally that you absolutely shape your circumstances everything you experience is your own emotionalized thought pattern out pictured and i sometimes challenge people and i think i read about this in miracle habits what if you don't believe that and what if it's not important that you believe that but what if you just use that as an ethical exercise how would it change your life how would it change your day if you really believed in neville's challenge as though as though without necessarily signing on to all the metaphysical assumptions that go around it or trying to rationalize it out how would it how would it change your day how would it how would it change the way you treat other people and would you be able to do it you know would you be able to do it that's the thing people want to opine about the experience absence the experience and so yeah i would say if it's intriguing to you try it for 45 minutes and and see what happens well don't you think the problem is it's it's like god it it's the strangest thing it's like if if mysticism or some kind of vessel it's the vessel where you have all these people lined up to get on carrying all these big backs and when they get to the wherever you enter it whoever's in charge of that gate is like oh no it's too much weight you can't bring that in this is going to take you to a place that you've always dreamed about but you can't bring your playstation or whatever the fucking is you're bringing and people like no i won't i don't want to let go of these things and i understand that i think it's somehow wrapped up in the in the fear of death you know it's like because free and maybe you have had this experience sometimes people like you i wonder if you're careful about talking about some of the things that you have experienced because you you don't want to confuse people but you know i think for some of us if we did adopt the methodologies of some of these people and i don't you know i don't think like the modern person reads the hermetic stuff or reads some of the magical literature reads neville goddard and thinks well he didn't really mean that he meant something more mundane they didn't you know what i mean i i know that sounds like he's saying we could instantaneously travel to essentially another dimension where we're essentially another person unencumbered by all the ridiculous foibles and bad habits and debt and karma that we currently are encumbered by but he didn't really mean that because if he really meant that he would be insane what he meant is that maybe in six months from now if i set up a nice savings routine i'll have an extra eight hundred dollars in the bank account you know because right because don't you think that that really the the reality of it is that we're kind of as much as we like to bitch and complain we're kind of happy in our little pod we're kind of happy in our little little gooey section of the multiverse where we're not quite happy but you know we're okay and and we don't want to rip open time and space we don't want to leap into that don't you think that that's the the reality of things isn't so much that people are being thwarted by reality but more that they have somehow connected this kind of transformation that you teach with death it's interesting i i think that sometimes being driven to your knees is the best thing that can happen to you because it it it breaks us out of or or or at least compels us on an experimental level to invite in some other possibility and these possibilities in my experience are very real and in as much as i talk about basic things simple things i do very much believe in applying the basic because i think we neglect it all the time we have no experience of it we only think we do however i also do believe that and i i would issue this to everybody listening you know extraordinary things do happen in life and in as much as our behaviors can direct us towards catastrophes so can they direct us towards the extraordinary and if you're feeling desperate and if you're feeling needful and if there's some situation in your life that has you absolutely feeling stripped of all resources and and and of all ability to feel at ease and at home with yourself you're very realization and and admission of that your your willingness to do something to break yourself out of that whether it means just a 30 second visualization or it means a prayer to some deific energy that you seek a relationship to which i take very seriously something could happen something could happen and i implore people not to neglect that experiment because there can be changes that occur all of a sudden you know i had some really weird wonderful experience years ago where i was seated in a spiritual group that was dedicated to esoteric study and i asked a question and a senior member of the group was responding to the question he misheard my question and he spoke to something other than what i was talking about but in the course of miss hearing my question he said there are no shortcuts there are no shortcuts and we all think we're supposed to nod our head in unison to statements like that and i thought to myself at that moment you're probably correct but i don't know that and you don't know that how do i know there are no shortcuts how do i know you know there can be all kinds of things and possibilities that occur even if they're not necessarily repeatable that doesn't mean they didn't occur so i also want people to feel that extraordinary changes can occur and really may occur the miraculous by which i mean a a an unforeseen and fortuitous fortuitous departure from all expected circumstance that does occur or we wouldn't have the word within our within our language that does occur in as much as catastrophes occur and i i just want to say that when people are faced with circumstances that that that that have them feeling absolutely desperate i say without any sentimentality that could be the greatest moment in your life because the willingness to identify wish for pray for visualize affirm whatever you want to do whatever you want to call it meditate upon chant for a change could bring that change i've experienced that and i can't fathom that my life is exceptional none of our lives are exceptional in the sense that they're disconnected from one another so i i just want to encourage people to believe in the possibility of the extraordinary in the plainest sense oh mitz you are the best thank you so much you always we i don't know how it always lie i really like if anything gives me the eerie swooning slightly schizophrenic sense that maybe there is an Illuminati it's you man you know because like always just when i'm needing data we end up podcasting together and it just lines up perfectly i think a lot of people feel that way about you so on behalf of them i say thank you so much and on behalf of me thanks just for your time can you tell folks where they could connect with this 30 day challenge and uh and also maybe uh let them know that they don't have to like exactly be on the 30 days or just tell me where they can find you sure uh the best way to connect with it is on social media i'm on twitter at mitzvahro it's instagram at mitzvahro it's 23 in both bios there's a link which i'm just going to leave up there that goes directly to the 30 day challenge you can start it at any time don't sweat it i do issue commentary each day for this particular cycle but if you want to find the commentary i hashtag 30 day mental challenge that'll connect you to the commentary jump in anytime it's super super simple and you should be assured that there'll be other people doing it with you so whether you are directly in contact with them or not you're not doing it alone okay awesome you know i'm gonna start a section in our discord server where we the d t f h folks do this because i want i'm gonna start today i think our conversation was the beginning of it mich thank you so much uh i hopefully when this not hopefully but when i finally shoot up with this delightful vaccine hopefully we can see each other in person yes for sure that would be that would be amazing i look forward to it man thank you my friend thank you that was mitch horror wits everybody make sure you go to mitchhorowitz.com and dive into the beautiful rabbit hole that is the Horowitz connection also much thanks to our

399^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - 440: Erin Trussell Transcript and Discussion^2021-05-22^Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music, Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Greetings, sweet darlings. It's me, Duncan, and I'm in a business center at a condo in St. Simon's Island, Georgia, and I don't want to be here. I don't like business centers. They're always kind of fucked up in sad places. The surfaces are always like yellowed like teeth that I haven't been taking care of for a long time. There's a general stink in the air. We've got discarded forms. You know what goes along with a business center sadly is what I'm imagining are like, are senior citizens who don't recognize that you got to log out of your email when you log in to your email at a business center. I had to log someone out of their email. Can you imagine that? Can you imagine not logging out of your email at a business center that that's like leaving your dick at a glory hole and just going home and just coming back in a few days to get your dick. You don't want to do that. It's just to think that this person's email has just kind of been sitting here like some horrible data iceberg floating in the sick, depraved waters of this business center for anybody to come along and just sort of mush through all their stuff. I saw the emails, you know, the first page of emails and I got to admit I was tempted to dig around in there. I've been watching Dateline. So the evil part of me, you know, that tries to come up with reasons to do awful things was like, well, you know, maybe they murdered someone and you should do a quick key phrase search like murder, which is so ridiculous. Like no one no murderer is gonna like send an email. It's like, I murdered someone. I, you know, so I just, you know, send an email to all their contacts saying I'm not a murderer, logged them out and that's it. They're safe now. But you gotta, you can't, you can't, you can't trust a business center. I logged into my email already feel fucked. I feel like I'm ruined because I logged in but I have to because I have to send these audio files and already know like, probably some Portuguese pirate is like rifling through my email right now just looking at it, stroking his fucking bloated sunburn pirate nipples as long pirate tongue lapping against his greasy mustache. We've got a wonderful podcast for you today with someone who is incredibly special to me, my beloved. That's what the hippies will call their, their, their lovers, their beloved. I can't believe I just said it, but I mean it. I love her. She's one of the coolest people I've ever met in my life. And she managed to transform two of my cum blasts into the most incredible creatures I've ever seen in my life. She's inflated them with milk from her breasts. And that's one of the most incredible miracles I've ever seen from cum to baby, then baby to boy via milk from your nipples. Like, are we really supposed to believe that we're not in a simulation when that's how humans come into existence? It's going to be a wonderful, wonderful conversation. Aaron Trussell is here with us. We're going to jump right into that. But first, some quick business. Much thanks to Squarespace for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH. My loves, if you're thinking about creating a website, Squarespace is where you need to go. They've got everything you need. And I can go on and on and I will go on for a little bit about the incredible things they offer. But the best thing for you to do to see the glory and power of Squarespace is to go to the best website on the internet, dunkitrussell.com and soak your eyeballs in the crackling light of that incredible website. Squarespace, what do you want to do? You want to make a website fast because you're in the midst of some kind of awesome caffeine induced manic episode and you need a place to publish your manifesto. They've got what you need. You can get a website up in minutes. Or do you want to create a complex, beautiful thing like some kind of puzzle box, summoned up by a necromancer from another realm, a thing of spirals and dials and buttons and nodules and codes and cryptograms, then you can do that too. You can go as deep as you want with Squarespace. They've got everything you need, including if you want to do email campaigns, you can apply Squarespace's powerful web design engine to sending emails to your clients or friends or family or lovers. Maybe you have a mailing list just for your lovers, which brings me to an essential point when it comes to making a website. It doesn't have to be for business. It can just be to glorify yourself or your friends. I mean, I look up web domains all the time and I'm always amazed by what is available and I just look this up. I'm offering it to you. You can take it. I'm not going to buy it though. I would like to left my dick at gloryhold.com is available. Can you believe that? You would think that would have gotten scooped up in the web domain bubble of the 90s. But no, it's just there for you to use. And here's what I think it could be used for. It could be used for some kind of awesome, sexy, hyper erotic blog about your sexual escapades. It could be used as, you know, a thing for people who maybe did leave their dicks at glory holes and they want to get them back just to kind of, you know, like lost dog service, but for dicks or it could just be some kind of song and like a cool animation that makes the the viewer have to like pair the two together, like makes the person who lands on it think, what does this Bulgarian lullaby have to do with left my dick at a glory hole? Or you could use it as a meme page, a t shirt page, you wouldn't want to wear a shirt that says left my dick at a glory hole.com. I would and it's there for you via Squarespace. All you have to do is go to Squarespace.com forward slash Duncan and use offer code Duncan and you will get 10% off your first order of a website or a domain. Why not try out Squarespace? Just head over to Squarespace.com forward slash Duncan use offer code Duncan and you will get 10% off your first order of a website or a domain. Again, that's squarespace.com forward slash Duncan use offer code Duncan and you'll get 10% off your first order of a website or a domain Squarespace. I left my dick at a glory hole.com. Get it today. And we are back my sweet darlings. If you notice the sound of a leaf blow or some kind of gardening equipment outside, I'll tell you why it's there. It's because I've gone to a business center to record the intro for my podcast. And in the same way, if you splatter blood upon the ocean waves, you can expect sharks if you start recording a podcast or music or anything that requires some kind of silence, you will summon a leaf blower. If you're in danger, maybe you find yourself in a place where you need help. And your your phone isn't working to call 911. Just press voice memo and start recording a podcast. I don't care where the fuck you are if you're in the in the in on a glacier floating in the middle of the fucking sea, a leaf blower person will show up a scuba outfit will just or maybe on a distant, not so distant that you can't hear it, but a glacier blowing ice off of the glacier, they just come. It is an inevitability I could do the experiment and probably prove some what dark matter is maybe it's dark matter. Maybe that's what dark matter is dark matter is all of the as of yet manifested leaf blowing people in the universe existing in a kind of super position. And the moment you start recording, they pop into existence. And the moment you stop, they pop out. Listen, I want to invite you to join the DTF Patreon. It's more than a Patreon. It's a community. It's a coven. It's a cabal, an ever expanding circumference of brilliant, fascinating, artistic human beings who hang out together on our discord server. Don't go to the NSFW part of that server. It's really NSFW. And it's at patreon.com for DTF H you sign up, you'll get access to our discord server, you'll get commercial free episodes of this glorious podcast. And every week we gather together for our journey into boredom, which is our meditation group that's been going on through the entirety of the pandemic just about and our family gatherings, which it's just where we hang out and the app and they're super fun. You should try it out. If you don't like it, you can just cancel it. I think it's a patreon.com forward slash DTF H. Alright, let's do this podcast. Today's guest is someone I actually married and have had babies with. Can you believe that? I did that. I never thought I would do that. Then I met Erin, and she's here with us today. So everybody please welcome the sweet angel of my family, Aaron trestle to the DTF H. It's the Welcome back to my podcast. A sweet wife. How you doing? Pretty good. I meant to tell you I took forest to the playground today. Yeah. And you know, we're done doing that game like what does the crow say? And he's like, ah, what's Einstein's general theory of relativity equals mc square daddy. And then I said, what does mama say? And he goes, I love you. I know. Yeah. Really? And then I said, what does daddy say? And he said, very funny things, the most funny things anyone's ever said all the time. Yeah, that's great. Yeah. No, he said, I said, what is, what does daddy say? And he goes, I love you. Just like what you said, but like a little grasp here. Yes. Yes, he did. I swear. I swear. I love you. Yeah. It's like, that's how he hears me. You're this very sweet voice. Mine was as close as a toddler can get to a rasp. He thinks you're a monkey. Yeah, tell them this burn. My own child, this happened with my own child, burnt me yesterday. Because I always make the joke that you're a monkey. I mean, we both make that joke about each other. That's great. It's really dumb. But um, we, my mom was watching Forrest and a monkey came on the TV and he goes, that's daddy. And she's like, what? And he's like, that's daddy. He's great. It's the coolest. All those, you know, that can only make me proud. Like getting roasted by him only makes me proud of him, especially a distant roast to my mother-in-law. Of all people. It's really a great, perfect joke. I mean, it's a perfect joke. It's less funny around us than it is around his grandmother. I like that he adds in the ha ha ha ha ha. Yeah. You know what? Yeah, I like that. I've noticed sometimes he also is taking up mocking us. Like if we're having a serious conversation, what does he do? What's the thing he does? We're having like a serious chat. Oh, he goes, I know it's when we're correcting him or when we're like trying to discipline him. He did it once when we were just talking about like the mortgage or something. I don't, Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I remember that. But it'll also do it when we're like trying to discipline him. Yeah. And he goes, none, none, none, none, the disrespect. The disrespect. And the thing is like, you can't laugh. Like, you have to feign seriousness because you don't want to encourage like that, right? Like that's the idea. It's so hard not to laugh. It's so hard not. I mean, this and go ahead. No, you go. I'm just gonna say it's like the to me, you're like anytime you run into someone who's got like horrible manners. Yeah, it's just generally rotten to be around. What happened is they were super cute and their parents didn't have the ability to override how adorable they are. Yeah. And impose any kind of structure. You think of all the encounters you've had with just awful people in your life. And you feel that their parents all came to these crossroads where like, what do we do? I want to go to the beach with him. I want to go to the beach with him because it's fun. And I like watching him run around in the in the sand, but he just slapped his mother. Yeah. Across the face. Yeah. And is refusing to say I'm sorry. I don't think it was across the face this time, but it doesn't really matter. He still hit me. He hit you. Yeah. So you have to like, it's like one thing that like you never want them to know is how much you are then joy hanging out with them regardless of how they're behaving. So you run into someone who is like a complete dick. Yeah. And probably what happened is their parents just weren't wanted to be with them too much or didn't have the ability to it's it's a really tricky thing being a parent. Also like I was telling you watching someone like just disrespect you the worst you've ever been disrespected like just complete disrespect for you but with your own face. It's your face. It's just someone like yeah, just like yeah, disrespecting you with your face on their face. Yes, you do a good job. It's hilarious, but you do it. This is the you do a really good job because he's the right now it's getting better but I am not the preferred parent right now toddlers will pick a parent that they prefer and it's almost always the mom or is it? Yeah. Yeah. So this is like a rare case. Right. And then but then I because I was look I was feeling like legitimately bad about this like bad for you and I looked it up because I wasn't sure if it was an aberration. It's just normal. Yeah, they just do it. It doesn't even mean they prefer you. No, yeah. It's just they're they it's like a for toddlers. One of the things that they are looking for is some sense of autonomy, some kind of control because when you're a baby, you don't have any control. You're just getting carried around like a sandwich basically. Yeah. Why would I say like a sandwich? A sandwich. Like I never carry sandwiches around. Like it's not. We don't even carry food around. Why would I say that? People who carry food around. Why would I say that? Like a sandwich like it's some common thing you know you have a fucking baguette under your arm. Yeah, you know all the people you see when you walk around carrying sandwiches, you know, like a sandwich. You can all relate to that. It's not even the same size. So relatable. Anyway, the point is they don't have any control. Well, I think I just like broke his heart a little bit when I had the next baby. But it's like a necessary, you know, I wanted to break his heart in that way. Yeah, but I think it's been you didn't want to break his heart, but you didn't want him. I did know that it would in a way. At first, I didn't want to have the second one. Yeah. And but then you explained to me age differences and like what that means. You did. I think you did want a second one. Well, you had moments of like not being sure, but I think you wanted a second one. I think you weren't sure like when. Well, that's true. That exactly. I wanted a second one, but but I just hadn't thought out the time. I think you had moments where you didn't want a second one. Well, I don't know. I just hadn't thought out the time thing. Like you have to consider when you're having the second one, you're thinking about like at some point, the age difference becomes like it's going to be alienating a little bit to them. Like if you do like the two-year age difference, they're more likely hopefully to be pals. Well, that's why I prayed for another boy because I just wanted them to be thick as thieves. I wanted him to have like a best friend for life and you know, we'll see. Well, I'll tell you, this is one of the damnedest things you've ever seen. Dune, the youngest, he worships. Oh my god. It's like girls in the 60s when they like that footage when they like the Beatles would come. Yeah. It's like that. Yeah. The way he looks at him. Yeah. Like it's just the most amazing thing to see that just ah and the way he like just studies forest like eating cheese or like jumping around or like just anything rolling his truck around. It's like watching. It's the way I would look if like a actual UFO appeared. Yeah. It's really sweet. It's the sweetest.

I have been using CBD long enough that I used to have to smuggle it when I was going on tour and that means that I've tasted a lot of different types of CBD and some CBD tastes like some kind of freshly poisoned fairy is having projectile diarrhea all over your tongue. Just bitter and disgusting. Feels tastes great. It's amazing. It's like just goes right into you. You place a few drops of feels under your tongue and you feel the difference within minutes. For me, it's like seconds. That's anecdotal but whenever I take it, it's just like an instant effect. That's my own experience. They say you'll feel the difference within minutes.

I mean, I'm glad that you did give in to my procreation. Oh my god, I'm so glad I did. Urges. I'm so glad I did. This kid is just like for those of you who haven't held a baby in a while, they're just it's so good. It's so good. They smell so good and their energy. They're like it's god. It's like they have that god energy. That's what it's like. It's very like the portal. They're still like they're between the veil in a way or something like they're just sort of like they're here in there. You know what one of my friends said that I who I have a lot of respect for, she said to me, God gives us exactly what we need. God has a way of giving us the perfect gift. Yeah. And it sounds cheesy or whatever, but it's so true because like I've always loved like the stories of Krishna and as a child, but I never understood it. Now I understand what I understand that. I don't think I could have on baby Krishna, baby Krishna. I'm too dim to have been able to wrap my head around it. Yeah. As a as a non parent, but which is like, but that's why that that style of yoga is so brilliant because it it offers everyone a way to tune in and like for you know, parents, it's like, oh look, Krishna comes to you as a baby sometimes. Yeah. And also our guru is a family guru. Yes. Which was like perfect. Neem Karli Baba. Yeah. He would send you away if you were having. Send you to go reunite with your family and make up with your family. Or at least try. Yeah. Yeah. And he had kids. Yeah. Which is super cool. Yeah. That's another thing before. How many? Do we know? I think like 300. No. I don't know the exact amount. I think one of them passed away recently. The the um yeah. Well, but this is another thing where that was before I had kids. That was always something where that I scrutinized a little bit. What breeders? That he had kids. Oh. And now that I've had. I mean not anyone had kids, right? But him especially. Why? Because you just felt like gurus shouldn't be like have a family life. Yeah. Because like you you know what that's one of the first things when you start thinking about gurus. Because you're kind of supposed to like forsake your like worldly. Absolutely. Things and like ascend. Yeah. You I just. Away from. You set it up. I set up my own. That's what that's one of the one of the first blocks till you like meeting one of these beings is what you think they should be like because what you think they should be like is what is it based on? Like for me it's like a comic book, a character from Street Fighter. Uh you know what I mean? Like Bill Murray and the Razor's Edge. Yeah. Some brief encounter with a Buddhist monk. The Razor's Edge. Yeah. Yeah. The Somerset one. That's that. That movie we it was garbage. I know but I watched it when I was a kid and it got into my head. But when we rewatched it, what did you think? This is shit. It's guys everyone listening to this should go and like have a watch of that. Get stoned. Get some drinks. Watch that movie. It is the most self-important. Garbage. Hilarious. Direct. The first okay trigger warning on the first part of the film involves like child death. Oh yeah. It is like I don't even remember that. I just blocked that out. Yeah. I remember the girl her like husband and kid dies. I don't even remember that. So then so at first it's like and it's kind of serious. Don't remember. But then it just gets really dumb and self important from there. I start this is the part I remember. I remember him on a ship. All of a sudden Bill Murray goes from I think either being like like wealthy somehow or having inherited money to suddenly being on a ship and it's like a series of like shitty jobs and in each of these shitty jobs he's like he starts really finding himself and you know when you're a kid yeah finding himself but we're not really that's not really the way they portray him finding himself is like he just condescends everyone else. That's the problem. Like it's not like he does anything amazing. He's just sort of like looks down at everyone. I mean but it's a book right? I didn't read that book. I'm sure it's an amazing book. I don't know. I bet it is. Supposedly he made the the Razor's Edge. He wrote the Razor's Edge. It shows one thing it shows about him is he has a real spiritual side to him because that's a heavy movie to decide to make. Yeah. The movie didn't come out because he ran into the big problem I think when you make any movie like that which is like how are you gonna put spirituality in the real sense of the word into it into a movie that's about spirituality? Like I think I think it will it emits out of like certain movies just because they're so good like there will be blood. That's incredibly good movie that has a weird radiance to it but if you try to do it it you're probably it's hard to do and I think he had legitimately good intentions. It's hard to do. That's something for us. He said it's hard to do. I want to thank Zip Recruiter for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH. You know when I first got to LA I had about ten thousand bucks which I spent on acid and synthesizers in about three months and when it ran out I needed a job so I went in the paper and I applied for a telemarketing position. I called them up someone answered the phone which I thought was weird and they acted like they were incredibly interested in my completely weird description of what I could do. I washed dishes at Chili's and you know I like people. They invited me to come to an interview and I got there and realized I was in a cult recruitment center. There was a grease board. It had a weird pyramid drawn on it. There were lots of other people who had clearly also blown their money on acid and the synthesizers and so I left and on the way out somebody followed me out. He looked like Charles Manson in a suit and he was like look you could change your life here man. It was really creepy.

But you know what I think one of my favorite viewing experiences to have with you and in your age like the age that you are. Oh boy here we go. Okay just the age that you are like life alert commercial. No you've been alive like long enough to have seen films when you were like a completely different person or super super super young or like maybe you were high or like whatever. And so you have them like remembered in your head and like so Duncan will like prepare me for like a viewing experience and he'll be like okay like I remember the the razors and maybe I was even pregnant too because that's why I remember the child loss thing so well but anyway but he'll be like okay I just really I want to connect with you tonight like I want to watch this amazing film with you. It means so much to me. It means so much to me like I want to watch it with you and I'm like okay well yeah like this will be great. Hold on let me interject there's also a little bit I will admit of me being like and let me you know maybe show Erin a spiritual pair of be parable here. Because you're gonna learn me something. Yeah. Because we're 20 years apart. Yeah and that's a big age difference. It's a big age difference. So sometimes yeah Duncan's gonna learn me something and as we say down in the south but um and so what will happen is I'll be sitting there like it'll start the music will start and then I'll be like it's the worst feeling man. I'm sitting there and then you know we've had fights about stuff where I've been like too flipping about stuff you like so like I'll sit there and I'll be like like like Monty. Wait hold on just so I can just let me speak up for myself. You're disdain for Monty. It's terrible. Okay that's unforgivable. It's not funny. I'm so sorry. I will never forgive you for that. There's only one funny thing I liked from that. What? And it's like um bring out you're dead. That's funny. I'm not dead. Yeah that's funny. There's like one there's like one percent of funny. Are you a king? How do you know I'm a king? Because you're not covered in shit. No that's not funny. That's not funny at all. Okay let's skip over that get back to my rose with the razor's edge. So anyway not just the razor's edge like we have this experience. You lost a lot of fans just now. You're gonna get canceled for that. Okay I'm fine with that. But um so then so anyway I'll just sit there for a while and then. Nights at the round table. So anyway I'll just sit there for a while and I'll feel Duncan like I'll feel him go. That's just a rabbit. You didn't even get that far with a rabbit. I've seen like all of them. No you've like forced me. Okay anyway. All right I'm just gonna abandon my story. No go ahead I'm sorry go ahead. No I was just so I see you like cycle through the I see you like things starting to like I see the red flag starting to go off with you slowly and I will just kind of sit there quietly until like you're ready to start making fun of it with me. Okay but there's like these sad moments where you're like trying to like it. You just sit there quietly don't you? Oh sure that's such bullshit. Quiet as a mouse. You will you immediately start started flaying the razor's edge. You know what it was because the opening is like I think it's got like a weird long. Okay I don't like like yeah a 30 minute open it's just excessive and it's so as like a film it's such it's such a pretentious choice. Like I like it is like a 10 minute opening it's like fuck you I'm already pissed off. But it's also got it's doing like classic Hollywood symphony music. Yeah it's like The razor's edge and you're it's like a sunset over a grass. But I have to admit when I was young and I saw that I thought it was the ultimate depiction of what it must be like to be enlightened which is why that that shit is so dangerous you know because in light because people imitate you know people imitate it's easier you know what I just actually I just saw this great Shogun Trumpa quote which is it's easier to act like it it's easier to act like you're holy than it is to be sane and you know and so like that's the that's the for sure yeah it's a hundred percent love that quote yeah that's good am I the only person who doesn't want to be enlightened see I mean well I think I think anybody with any kind of like healthy a brain healthy attitude towards life when they hear about enlightenment or anything they just kind of like whatever yeah it just seems like another thing you know it doesn't if you're if you're if you're having a I think if your incarnation is sort of at a great place then why would you even and also anybody who like who I it would be someone who could even talk about enlightenment like Shogun Trumpa they just say things like it's just it's like the he says it's the final disappointment or he calls it yeah that's like the whole thing ordinary yeah so so it's not it seems like one big disappointment well I mean it's well I think the final disappointment is the cool part of that which is just it is but I do think there's there's something like the disappointment is the point well or just I think life is can be pretty disappointing I mean you don't usually you don't like I mean look we just saw a wonderful film which I think actually speaks to this it's called a feeling of home it's really really really good it's on the hallmark channel Aaron and I when I'm not trying to man view her with some kind of fucking movie that meant something to me when I was in college which I do like though like some you've shown me some really great thank you like I never saw fly you never saw Texas Chainsaw Massacre no so like I have introduced some good hard fly right one with the fly the fly yeah that's a damn good Cronenberg so good um and I never would have seen that or even heard of it Aaron actually has a very great taste when it comes to most things most things most things no one has great taste in everything but you have really maybe not our bathroom no we'll talk about that later I think you're being too hard on yourself with that but we don't know yet is a thing you just have to anyway how are you gonna learn to do that shit unless you yeah the only way to learn that stuff is by making mistakes we'll get to that later it's so boring later it's so dumb it's so boring but one one of the things that we like to do together is watch hallmark channel movies and I think it's fair to say Johnny Pemberton introduced me to this genre with this movie called Christmas Lodge yeah which is and honestly whenever we stop watching the hallmark movies like a little bit of light goes out of my life and when we start again I like feel so good and that makes me like genuinely feel connected to you and like super happy to watch them and you know it's because like I think Aaron and I have a spiritual part of us but I think there's a part of us that's like weirdly nihilistic or something like there's a really dark a shadowy dark aspect to us that's like this really really really like absurd or absurdist or something and then we get really dark but that dark we love hyper sincerity yes so the hallmark so there's you can't fake what the hallmark movies are doing like you can't like and I think will ferrell made an attempt you saw that will the attempt will ferrell and oh you haven't seen that yet what is it he tried to make one and they just made a sincere hallmark channel movie it wasn't funny they tried I love will ferrell he did not it didn't because you can't no you can't you can only do it if you're like authentically doing it and yes and yes that's it I think you probably have to get you can't do it in jest or in like ironic hipster shit no you have to there's no way in yeah it can only be made by the people who make it and the people who make it I mean I don't understand I was looking at some of the shots and just thinking like they're definitely puking in between takes like it's so so sentimental and so like and just to name your film a feeling of home to me is like what does that mean it sounds like a crazy person it sounds something someone out of their mind would say like I mean a feeling of home another thing we'll do is force people to watch the hallmark movies with us so like at Christmas like our family will be there like my mom her husband at the time like who's just a person who would not understand why we would watch these let it roll put it on yeah like my brother like we'll just subject our entire family to like a viewing of these movies and then Duncan and I are in the corner like cackling the whole time while that people are just like sitting there like trying to politely view it and we look like complete like psychos why are we why not just show like to me like there's a few go-to things I show guests I show them stuck in mud no stuck in mud's like the end of the night it starts with like what does it start with well you have to find stuck in mud so you have a way of finding ones before that you know you'll show yeah you'll show some other stuff maybe like warm them up with some UFO videos or something yeah and then finally it gets to like people in front of maybe a couple like dug pound videos pound house I'll go to and then warm them up warm them up and then it gets like someone in a gim suit with like suede spraying on their face yeah fetish mud videos which yeah but I placed these hallmark movies on the same level of disturb tapper dan I'll show tapper dan yeah now I by the way I do not show tapper dan cynically I like tapper dan tapper dan to me is like a really powerful lo-fi artists like he reminds me of an outsider artist I really do love tapper dan he's got daniel johnson vibes tapper dan's great he's like look him up he he's into wrestling but also he like he's learning how to dance and he films himself at malls doing this cool and he does it to the same song or at least a lot of them are to that yeah you know the song I'm talking about waiting for somebody to show anyway I like those they're they relax me I know I know I know but those are the that's your playlist that's my playlist but the hallmark channel movies usually we ended ending with the mud around 10 30 11 p.m at the latest yeah and then we go upstairs then we go upstairs and I'm gonna stop doing it and that's a party night but I've started realizing like people don't understand when I'm showing emo got me into the mud videos yeah the stuck in mud of course he showed those to me yeah but I realize now when I'm showing people that they're like are you in like you like this I was wondering that the last time you showed my friend gray was over saying with us and I wondered that in the back of my mind I was like it's some part of him like not outwardly but does some part of him like like this I was wondering it too you were yeah like I'm watching it and I'm thinking like I kind of like it but we could do some mud play if you want I don't never want to do mud play because I might like it if I did mud play no I don't want to do any mud play if you watched I don't want you in mud I did no babe I did what if I was with someone else in mud this is getting explicit like if I was a mudcock no like another girl no I'm like wrestling I don't want you in another mudcock hashtag mudcock I would no but I do I do wonder like I do feel like part the whole okay let me the you with another girl in mud that's cheesy to me because that's kind of like people are like let me whip cream off your boo yeah you've never been in you do not like food play I don't like I don't like play anything involving fucking I've never like that I don't like the term okay but you like play I don't like to call it play okay but I mean it just sounds creepy play play sounds like the same person what is like let me let me do but you've never liked food activities I like the word fetish at all okay food fetish let's do food play what's okay but you've never been in the food I'm gonna I'm gonna dull I want to I want to spray with cream into your tits I don't want to like play frizz you're not hungry you don't need a snack let's do a food play but you don't okay but you don't like for the record you do not like food fetish activities I tried it anyone out there who likes it I'm not bashing you which is not my thing it's like you did try it who hasn't tried it when I don't think I have oh yeah I have okay yeah it adds maybe I have one you know what not really I think at some point I was talking about it I think I was trying to get you to do it no I someone I think that someone just like in a very kind way I think we I've been I don't remember where it's from so just someone said like that's how you give your lover a yeast infection for sure because I just don't do it I mean it doesn't have to go in the pussy yeah but if it gets other places yeah but I mean it's probably you end up in your pussy I guess you know and somehow yeah but if the whole time you're just thinking like I hope I don't get a sugar in our vagina you want to eat some ice cream out of my ass yeah I don't like any form of that lump it in Jerry's I will eat ass but I don't know why we have to get ice cream in there like yummy I don't know you just like to keep your separation of church and state always feel fat kind of like I have a body problem so just like now I'm gonna add that to eating you're not so if I'm eating your ass and now I'm eating ice cream I'm thinking like what are the calories in this I'm thinking like you know I'm pre-diabetic you have guilt eating anyway I don't want to go into diabetics like when you're eating a treat it's already like a guilty exercise one of nice little baggages yeah well I don't by the way like my you're not fat I don't it's not you know anybody who has like that body problems it's not like they really like I'm really fat or not fat you're just like it doesn't matter we're not gonna get into that because a lot of it a lot of people out there feel you're a very very sexy man and I've had very sweet people try to like you know really smart way like can like connect to me at that level people who've also gone through that shit when they were a kid and like it's very sweet and I get the whole when they've gone through food play as it no as a kid no you got Jesus you demon no a lot of kids get bullied and shit and then you end up with some kind of body issues and it's hard for you to like feel good with your shirt off I'm a never nude you are never nude and it's funny because I'm a nude you are well yin yang yeah so it's like very I'm actually so much a nude it's gonna be a big problem because we have two boys so it's like I'm gonna have to get clothes oh my god I do not want to be that mom and I know someone who's had that for a mom and like they are super fucked let me tell you I had a friend whose mom was fucking hot and she would go around with almost nothing on in a robe when we were over and that was like at least 30% of the reason you would go to that guy's house yeah because he probably knew it how do you not know it like all the little all the boys are just 14 year old boys I know it was no I'm gonna be covered up I'm gonna be turtleneck burka because I'm gonna be a young mom yeah you can't I'm gonna be the young mom you're gonna be the young mom I'm gonna like come by like Lady Chatterley's lover I'll be in a wheelchair she's like no hands shaking where's my rash cream I'm gonna keep you young baby anyway here here's the point the the like in the razor's edge and a feeling of home yeah are both trying to convey a deep spiritual truth which was embodied in spoiler alert it was embodied in I think one of the last lines in a feeling of home which is I can't remember name the the star she has she's a blogger which they called a web what was it a web entrepreneur she's a vlogger is actually what she's a vlogger and they call on the hallmark description it says web entrepreneur now her job she makes these videos of like menus and stuff and I guess she's been living this lie because she says that she's from New England but really she's from Texas and so she's gone home to her dad who seems like maybe he's six years older than her the casting is so weird and speaking of casting maybe less of an age difference than what we have and he's in a I mean I could be your dad that's true I could easily have been in some ways you are I am your dad I mean I teach you about great films yeah like a good dad you are and when you're bad I you spank me like a good dad would daddy now every instant everyone just audio we was gonna be like well we don't understand like before this episode we were getting we were getting a lot of downloads after this episode we're getting like four downloads an episode anyway the point is a feeling of home ends with a brilliant line when the protagonist I can't remember name the vlogger has made the decision as generally happens in many hallmark movies which is a woman with a career who has gone to a city goes home meets some dude there no not meets reunites reunites with an old love yeah generally either abandons her career or finds a way to bring the career to the home generally abandoned generally abandons but in this case the woman like the final line she says to her old lover is do you remember the line in time maybe this could amount to something like that's the line leading up to their big kiss that's like like I think if I had said that to you when we were like getting to get like when we were in our big love story in the beginning I think you would have been like oh shit okay well maybe like I would just be like you're a fucking android who even know you'd be like I guess this isn't like the right time for this yeah I would think that in time maybe this will amount to something but that's supposed to be like the big line that's like the big like what's the line in Titanic when they have their arms stretched out I'm the king of the world yeah that's that I'm the king of the world of that is that line in a feeling of home is in time maybe this will amount to something but what it in a razor's edge have in common and as a lot of really great existential films have in common is there's it's not really an ending it doesn't wrap itself up no and they never really do that's the commentary it's so good yeah there's no it's not trying to like that's what's so weirdly sophisticated about a feeling of home is it it's not trying to to seal the envelope it leaves it wide open we don't know we'll kind of wrap a few things up but like the rest is open yeah and let's face it she's not gonna stay around that fucking Texas town she's gonna go back to wherever she is from like he's either talking like Tom waits or like he does like this this is a term I can't do in a southern accent it's like a he changes his accent like over 30 times yeah sometimes he does a job where he's doing one of these and he's and the really fucking like spooky thing about a lot of these home art movies is their daddy issue city like she keeps saying to her like you get I don't know if y'all have ever been to like a traditional wedding have you ever been to one course yeah where the dad gives away that has got to be the most but to be fair you did ask my dad for permission and your mom yeah and my mom but I'm just saying I know but I wasn't like we didn't yes we'd had a wedding we probably if we hadn't have eloped yeah and we didn't have a complete amazing hippie bonanza like we did we probably would have done that to be fair I don't my dad probably would have like walked me down the aisle I don't mind the walk down I just I think I got I was at a wedding once she's yours now that and the dad did a long speech and it was weirdly sexual you know it's like I've watched you grow with those knobby knees you went from knobby now you got bows on your hair now there's bows on your brazier yeah like exactly like that and the fucking dude who the and everyone just like oh they're crying and like but it's just like I always cry at a wedding some part of me wanted to fuck her but I couldn't and I guess you'll fuck her for me for the rest of her life it's so creepy and put up with her bullshit I hate that thing where the dads are like welcome to hell little that you might as well a tie to scorpion your dick if she's anything like her mother I fucking hate that bitch like okay I guess you had a choice between her and a spinning saw blade because I don't know why you'd marry this dumb bitch you I made it's literally like that anyway a feeling of home definitely watch it is it working oh yeah okay yeah a feeling of home is fantastic and but I you know any any hallmark I mean I think someone out there maybe one of your academic friends you gotta do like a you I think someone could do a thesis on it like because there's so many recurring themes in them that are implicitly misogynistic and implicitly capitalistic maybe not a thesis but maybe like a podcast you could do a easily a podcast an analysis thesis sounds boring well but I think it's worth I mean it's like because the like I think yeah there are they are boring make it digestible make it or you know it's also like a hot take article if you want to do a hot take article like a medium article yeah an assessment of phallic symbols and hallmark movies would be perfect because they all have like oh my god that was the other thing let's go through the phallic symbols and a feeling of home I can't right now I can I remember everyone I remember like stick shift the churning um something there was like something he was churning yeah well yeah it was like yeah he was sure you know it was yeah he was churning his fucking barbecue sauce yeah so in every like it's really a lot of phallic a lot of a lot of things that look like dicks and a lot of times the the thing that looks like a dick is being moved between the father and the future son so there's a lot of like here I give you my dick you know or my dick doesn't work anymore you will have the young dick that works and like a lot of the woman being like I don't know how to I don't know how to handle this dick you know what I mean like riding a tractor I can't I don't know it's hard to do he don't do our fucking son Jesus Christ anyway it's anyway if you're looking for wonderful nihilism hallmark movies are the way to go for sure yeah yeah and you know if you're looking for like an idea a depiction of you know an attempt at what what I think what a lot of people really do think spirituality looks like which is aloofness like being right but it's yeah no what do you see because you we both agree that when you're with a kid it's like being around god or a guru or something but if you had to describe it how would you describe it I think it is god like I really do think it's a window into into the other to heaven you think that's what happened yeah I really think that like you can see it shining through them yeah because how can I feel like I'm with I think it is I think god like stays with them for a while I think something and then eventually it's like see you later you're on your own motherfucker maybe no not like abandonment but just sort of like I don't know well you know that's something that just like I don't want to say wears off but it's just like and and it's not like bad like that like it's not like it wears you know but you know what I mean or yeah I don't know that sounds negative too like I don't think it's negative I think it's like this really beautiful process but yeah I don't know there's something something to it that was cool about Ram Dass to me is like he was he had that newborn glow yeah but he was old you want it so like because I've had babies now like that feeling when they like when each of my children have been put on my chest after I've given birth to them like like that's how I felt every time I was with Ram Dass yeah like were you that weeping feeling that's how I felt every time I would be with him which is hard it could be hard to be with him because of that yeah he loved you help me understand this Aaron this is something I always wonder because the last time we got to hang out with him at that table a few weeks before he died actually we were so so blessed to have I'm like movie is this gonna be no it's okay help me understand this this is something that I've been trying to decode in my mind and sometimes I get really neurotic about it and sometimes I think I get it but we're we're sitting at this table with Ram Dass and he's like at that point he's not we're not he's not like in a place where he's talking but he's there he was just as present as ever it's not like even though it was a few weeks before he died he wasn't like he had us for wear he had a phasia you know so it took him longer to speak yeah but remember that last time we saw him it's not as if he was like he didn't seem like oh no like he was like beaming beaming it was like yeah so he or he he's doing this thing where he's looking at Aaron and he's giving you this bright beat Ram Dass smile and then he's looking at me with a most stern expression and I'm that was like my last encounter well no it wasn't because he I got this it was the Mala ceremony you know it's very sweet with us there oh yeah oh yeah I forgot that yeah but what was he saying there he was saying something what was he saying probably like just give me all the babies and he's so nice to me forever and ever I think that is what he was saying I would get jealous probably just give me anything I want you think you're saying that yeah I think he was mocking you no you and him you were jealous I wanted him to beam at me too he beamed at you he adored you I adored him he loved you I loved him so it was more than that like he felt like you were doing a real service well the community I don't know about that at large he did remember when he stopped you and he said thank you for getting this message out to the young people don't you miss him so much it's gonna be weird to be at the retreat I know without him what can we even talk about I think so well we don't we heard we don't know if there were treats happening maybe we heard maybe it's gonna if it happens maybe I don't think look I miss him so much yeah and I felt like I was like hit I'm still hit by like grief waves me too with that our community just like reeled from that and it was even though it's like the most expected death yeah ever you know like every retreat we did have or like the sprawl last one but it was still like we just all we just it was intense but it's I love the story talking to Lakshman now on instead of like you know talking to people who are with him and it's just hearing the stories and like we all are trading stories and yeah we haven't been with our the satsang our satsang and along since the last retreat man we're gonna when we like all come together again I think he will be like very much present in all of that I do too yeah I do really happy we're gonna be slipping on tears of that oh god I mean we're already like a weeping mess in just normally yeah but now that's gonna be like full of all these like synchronicities and all these things that are just over the top and annoying to like even talk about like at the mala ceremony someone gave Duncan an extra mala bead and we're like we don't need one we have one and they're like it's for the baby yeah and we had been like arguing at that point if we were gonna like do another one right then and yeah yeah just all these things yeah and then tell tell the vision of and you got a vision there once well I yeah I had you saw our family I had a moment there where I mean this I don't know I mean again like I think these miracle stories are are great and I but I know what people can take them or leave them who cares so I don't know I just had this like you know I've had a few like things I don't know any other way to put them yeah a vision and I know why I understand that word because the word sounds a little lofty but it really is just like it's something you see it's a vision it's a thing that appears in front of you one of them was during um Krishnadas singing kirtan when I lost my mom yeah and I was singing and going into that like trance you get into with the kirtan and it's a psychedelic and it's yeah it's beautiful you just and like I was like I had my eyes closed maybe I was stoned I don't remember I was seeing fractals and like but all of a sudden I was just back with my mom in st. simon's we're at right now and I heard her say we had fun didn't we yeah and now having kids I know exactly what she meant yeah and that is what if you're if you're get a chance to say something to someone on this side of the veil that's a great thing to say and I think we have fun well yeah we have fun with our kids it's the most fun I've ever had but the other one which was wild for me was that it was like I was looking at this beautiful picture of neem crawlybaba they have there and it was like he was showing me like I want to give you this mm-hmm and it was me at the beach with like someone and kids and I remember at the time I was like I don't know with so many kids three Duncan is like a reluctant breeder and I'm like the ultimate breeder I'm like I would have literally like five kids that's not which we're not I know I know but it's good we balance each other out it would be like it's good but like he's getting upset well no it's not I'm getting it's a but it was a cool thing because at the time I was I wasn't in a place where that made any sense at all yeah and it and also I don't think I was in a place necessarily where I would have thought of that as any kind of gift but I didn't think I wanted to like have kids like this I definitely didn't think I would want like more than two kids like I just you just inspired that in me well it's not when you get around all like you know I just I just think I understand coming from a family where a lot of people had a lot of challenging karma and if you're born into that kind of place it's easy to model that's what families are and so when you hear people talk about family you're not like getting all warm and fuzzy you're like oh you mean like the time I had to like like numb out for a decade to not go insane right thing like that you know so when you heat so naturally you're like fuck that I'm gonna do everything in my power yeah to never have to go through that again I think for a lot of people that has a very healthy healthy reaction because yeah it could be that if you decide to start a family and we've kicked out patterns and we know I was just gonna say that's not to say that we don't struggle because like being married is very difficult and having a like parenting's young children is very difficult so demons just maintaining your marriage in parenting is extremely difficult and if you don't have a model for that which we really didn't know we didn't at all but we have this satsang and you have like a support network that is there for you in a different way yeah so you can do it maybe but like but you know I like so it's like uh I do now that I'm getting to experience the warm glow of it and like now I now it's like another it's like another book opens up we're like oh shit that's I mean that's what they're talking about I think at the end of the day like it's it has been really hard but with us like we got married really fast and we just did it all we just went like balls to the wall and we just really ball ball to the wall for me we just yeah one ball but um and sometimes it's like really really hard but thinking about like having fun like we had fun didn't we I mean I really couldn't do it with anyone else no way not a million years it definitely had to be you yeah you couldn't even though we drive each other crazy you couldn't do it with anyone else you could no way not you you couldn't do it with anyone I mean I could do it with many many you could no I'm making a bad joke you know what I think this is the other thing you think about God everyone's just like Jesus Christ well do you think people are vomiting now I was just gonna say we're for sure soulmate it's just to make it worse even more vomiting but that doesn't make it easy no god no you know what I was thinking earlier because I'm like just like I've got serious fucking dad pride right out it's so wonderful to watch and so great but I was thinking to myself like god imagine like if you had the bad luck of going back in time and and or waking up as yourself before you meet the person and before like I was just thinking like you would have to try to remember every time you jerked off what I'm good at well because you would meet the person in other words like yeah but I'm just saying like say I went back two years before or a year before meeting you even six months yeah even three days yeah I would have to try to remember every time I came why because I would want to be able to come in you at the exact same time with the exact same calm to make a forest I think it's a little more than that too we've got some eggs in the mix here yeah well I mean I don't have a control of your eggs I'm saying is like I was just thinking like my god if you were you just needed it to go exactly the way it did even though it would have been easier if we had like had a longer courtship and like gotten to know each other better and like yeah and like all of that but you couldn't yeah but you look when you when you are experiencing it you just think my god like that's how you understand what when they talk about grace that's how you understand it because you realize there's no way I could make this happen I couldn't ask for it because I didn't know I wanted there was no way it could not it was going to happen like everything right in that was going to happen I mean Duncan we like we're just it was like we just like laid eyes on each other on each other and it was just that was it it was very magnetic done but yeah she like when she met me for the first time she didn't even look me in the eyes she looked down at my crotch and said please please let me suck your dick please I just want to suck that the night I met Duncan all of my friends were there and like two of my ex-boyfriends were there which was but anywhere it was almost like they got fuck you anywhere we went you always had an ex-boyfriend around I mean that may be true you can't walk five feet through Silver Lake without what are your ex-boyfriends how fucking dare you that's actually not true however that's not true when we were in the house you'd have to drive her ex-boyfriends out from under the house we did we we ran we had a small group of friends is what it was yeah I mean yeah we had a yeah but what happened on the night we met I I asked to walk you outside to your uber in front of all our friends yes you did it was a big power move was that a power move I'm not a pretty big power move like there was no reason to walk a grown ass 44 year old man to his fucking age well that was your age you could say there's no need to walk a gentleman to his car or 43 at the time I guess young a sparkling lack there's no need to walk a gentleman a comedic and no crust oh thank you you're welcome to his car to his uber glad you did very unnecessary glad you did it as a hit on you it worked but then I didn't even get your number yeah but you asked to kiss me I did and that was the cool thing none of neither of us asked for each other's number I had to find you wasn't that hard it's not I heard a private detective and I was like I met this girl she walked me we had like 16 mutual friends I had a private detective I said I met this girl she walked me to what was it oh you mean Erin she does that with every like hipster comedian

400^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - LIZZIE VELASQUEZ Transcript and Discussion^2014-05-05^Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Hello friends, it is I, Duncan Trussell, and you are listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast. And I think I've finally done it. I have discovered the secret of happiness. And it isn't what I thought it was. All this time I thought it was for meditating, discipline, maybe falling in love, selfless service, opening yourself up to the universal consciousness, allowing the angels to move through your thought patterns and out of your mouth giving gifts to children and homeless people or planting trees, spreading love everywhere you go or eating kale all the time. All of these things are great, but they pale in comparison to what I have discovered, which is riding a bike. I can't believe it. I know it sounds ridiculous, and I'm only being 10%. I'm only exaggerating 10%. It's amazing. All this time I've been climbing into my damn car, a steel coffin, encapsulated in this metal prison surrounded by other people separated from nature, going from point A to point B, not even thinking about anything except getting to point B. A bike eliminates all of that. When you get on a bike, all of a sudden you're outside, you're connected to nature, you hear birds, you smell people cooking from their houses, you figure out little side streets to go down so you don't get plowed over by some drunk LA garbage truck driver who just found his wife humping his brother, which can happen. There's dangers out there. It's true, but wow. All I want to do is ride my bike. I woke up this morning at 7 a.m. and went bike riding. I couldn't sleep. I was so excited about the idea of getting on my bike and driving up to a Griffith Park near my house, which I did. I almost had a heart attack going up a hill. I'm badly out of shape. I go jogging every once in a while, but trying to get a bike up a big hill in a park when you just turn 40 and your heart is basically covered in Crisco and old crisps of marijuana edibles that you haven't quite digested and have been pushed out of some tube to spray all over your heart. When you're like that going up a hill, you forget. But somewhere halfway up this hill, I had to stop and I almost threw up gasping for air. One of those Lycra bicycle people went shooting by and I couldn't look at him because I was so embarrassed. I know he must have. He probably thought I was getting what I deserved. He saw that I wasn't in the Lycra. I wasn't wearing the uniform. And let me tell you, friends, I'm going to end up in Lycra. I can already tell it's going to happen. I'm going to put on the uniform. I'm going to squeeze into some of those tight bicycling pants and put on a ridiculously colored Lycra top, strap my helmet on and go shooting down the bike trail with that weird intense gaze that you've probably seen that bikers have. I never understood that gaze is I went plotting up the bike trail, jogging like some reanimated hamburger man. Just plotting up the trail, gasping for breath, moving so slowly. Those bikers, they shoot by and you can almost feel the disdain radiating off of them, but it's not disdain. That's what I thought. I thought it was disdain. They don't even see you. They're basically flying. That's what it's like. Bicycles are as close as you're going to get to riding a broomstick in this incarnation unless you're a witch with access to baby fat and ginseng and what's that other man drake that you could rub all over your body. Don't do that. I don't even know where you would get baby fat these days, but what you can do instead of rubbing baby fat all over your body is you can squeeze into lycra. I know I use this example a lot, but it's like you go to listen to house music and you're not on ecstasy and it sounds like the chirping of a dying ET. It sounds like an awful mixture of hammers beating against the side of a crashed UFO. It sounds cheesy too, like elf trumpets or something. It's awful, but the moment you take MDMA and listen to house music, not all of it's good, but you listen to the good stuff and it just makes sense. In the same way you now lycra makes sense to me. This is an insider club. Fuck the Freemasons in the Illuminati. They have nothing on bicyclists. It's like a secret hidden thing that the, I don't know, maybe the oil industry doesn't want people to know that riding a bike will simultaneously, will throw you into some kind of nirvanic bliss trance while getting all that fat off your body that slowly developed as you were driving your car to wherever you were going, shoving Doritos into your mouth and listening to Elliott Smith and weeping over whatever girl recently broke your heart. Let me tell you, none of that. You're not thinking about that when you're on your bike. I've only been doing this. I've had a bike for less than 24 hours. We'll see how I feel in a couple of days. I'll probably be sick of the damn thing. There'll be cobwebs all over it and it'll be moldering behind my house. But right now, I, if you're going to do, if you're going to give yourself a gift, if you really want to do something that's going to change your life in the most intense way for under a thousand bucks, there's a few things you could do. Some of them are outside your control. For example, you can meet some incredible person and start falling in love with them. Well, good luck with that. You can't control that. That just happens. God slings those throwing stars down a few times in your life and if you're lucky, one of them will smash right into your poor, lonely heart and send you into that incredible, oxytocin-induced seizure of joy and bliss that lasts for, if you're lucky, a lifetime, but more than likely a year. And then that ends with you laying in the classic smoldering hell crater that we all fall into once we're cast out of the sweet heaven that love allows us to exist within for such a temporary time. Another way is if you're lucky, you'll find some very clean, some kind of clean LSD or MDMA or some kind of nice psychedelic and you'll do it in the right way in a responsible way, in a safe way with some intention behind it and that will point you in the direction of this sort of samsaric state that is accessible to all human beings. That can happen too. But, you know, there's some drawbacks to that. You can end up thinking that you're with a cool person and the next thing you know, you're living inside of a scene from Jacob's Ladder as your friend starts having a neurotic episode where he thinks that you're his mother or something. That can happen too if you're not careful. And who knows? Maybe you got this stuff from the wrong person and you ended up taking some of that toad oil that makes your soul vanish for 4,000 years, subjective years. It'll only last like six minutes, but you feel like you're gone for 4,000 years. You're falling into a swampy world of toads with spiral eyes that breathe fire that incinerates everyone you've ever loved over and over again. That can happen too. So you got to be careful with psychedelics. You can meditate, but you know, that's like trying to get a cat in a bathtub and it's great. Meditation is fantastic and that's super cheap. Or you can buy a bike. Just buy a bicycle. Go buy a bicycle and a helmet and find some nice areas around your house to bike. And I'm telling you, you will quickly realize that you have been hoodwinked by yourself into thinking that it's better to drive. All my friends who got rabid about biking, they got calls from my friends and they would say the most horrifying thing I'd ever heard, which is that they would ride their bike to meet me at the restaurant or bar. Their bike? Like what do you think you're in fucking Paris, Lance Armstrong? Who do you think you are? Tooling around on your bike with your well-developed calf muscles? You out of your mind getting your car? How about that with dead dinosaur juice and meet me at the bar and let's get fat together? Pedaling around on your damn bike like an eight-year-old after his big birthday party. You creepy, weird, healthy person actually experiencing wind blowing in your face and connecting to humans and going down strange paths that you never would go down in your car. What do you do? Well, you're out of your mind. I thought my friends were sick or having some form of healthy midlife crisis. But now I see the truth. Bikes are the answer. It really does make you see out just how very satanic the roads are filled with cars. When you're pedaling down a bicycle path and you start imagining what the planet would be like if there were more bicycle paths than roads, if for whatever reason we decided to go in that direction and bikes were the primary transportation device, we'd all be in great shape. We'd all be in great shape with sore asses because it hurts your ass. Do you get used to that? That's a question I have for the bicyclists out there. When you play guitar and you get calluses on your finger, am I going to get a nice thick callus on my ass? A biking callus? Does that happen or is my seat the wrong way? That kind of hurts. Also, another question for you bicyclists and then we'll move on. Is it considered embarrassing if you have to stand up to pedal to get up a hill? Is that an embarrassment because I feel like when I'm doing that I'm somehow like, you're supposed to stay down in the seat and pedal your way up a hill, but I can't do it. Also, is it when you, for the lycra cyclists out there, when you zing by some hipster almost vomiting into the grass of the park in the morning, do you laugh at him? These are the questions I have for you. Let me know. You can email me through the contact form located at DuncanTrussell.com. Holy Kamoli, we have got a seriously good podcast for you. But first, some quick business. We have a new sponsor each Hulu Plus. We did it. We got a big time badass sponsor. Hulu Plus is now sponsoring the DuncanTrussell Family Hour podcast. Anybody that I plug on this show, it's a company that I use and I use Hulu Plus. Weirdly, the reason I use Hulu Plus is not for the greatest thing about Hulu Plus, which is that they have episodes of current TV shows. They have a ton of great TV shows, The Colbert Report, The Daily Show. They've got also the entire collection of certain TV shows like Doctor Who or Lost. So what's the best thing? Not life in life. Sometimes you're not always in the midst of some beautiful romantic love affair. Sometimes some weekends you find yourself stoned in your boxer shorts, bored. And what do you want to do? What are you going to do in that situation? Sure, you could go jogging, you could go for a nice hike, or you can climb into bed with your dog, put on Hulu Plus, and binge watch every episode of Lost. And that's a lot better than doing what a lot of people do, which is taking their dog to the local bar or jerk off massage parlor and getting involved in some terrible activities. Getting drunk and frying their liver, or getting some kind of awful venereal disease from a sex slave. You don't want to do that. Hulu Plus will keep you from being possessed by Satan. How many people, when they're standing there in court, looking at the judge and watching his lips move as he tells them that they will spend the next 50 years of their life in prison? How many of those people have responded by screaming to the sky, if only I had been binge watching Lost that weekend? How many? How many people feeling the burn of the lethal injection drug flowing through their veins, frying their livers, and slowly destroying them in Utah were thinking through the incredible list of TV shows that they could have watched that Hulu Plus provides? Instead of doing that massacre at the deli, they could have watched every single episode of Grey's Anatomy. Instead of tying their enemy to the back of their truck and dragging his twitching body down gravel roads for several hours, they could have enjoyed a season of Kitchen Nightmare, or Frasier, or my name is Earl. But that's not all that Hulu Plus has to offer. They also have the entire Criterion Collection, and that's what I like about it. If you want to impress your girlfriend or boyfriend and not just watch some, I don't know, basic movie, you can watch the Criterion Collection, which if you don't know what the Criterion Collection is, it's every great, great movie on Earth. These are the movies that change your life. So instead of going and taking part in that massacre or going down to Tijuana for the weekend and waking up seven years later as the star of a donkey show, you can go sign up for Hulu Plus by going to HuluPlus.com. If you sign up, you will get two free weeks of Hulu Plus. That means for the next two weeks, you can binge watch TV shows, and if for some insane reason you realize that even though Hulu Plus is trying to save you for spending the rest of your life in solitary confinement or in Guantanamo Bay being electrocuted by secret service agents, you can cancel. But you're going to realize this is a great service and it's a great way for you to watch TV wherever you are. So because you can stream it, it's on nearly every device. As far as I'm aware, it's every device. I know it's on iPads, it's on Xbox One, PlayStation, tons of other devices, Apple TV, it's there for you. Sign up for Hulu Plus. Not only that, but it'll help the podcast and it will help you avoid those waspy demons of lust that can come flying into your mind when you find yourself alone during the weekend and you want to distract yourself from that terrible cauldron of misery that exists in your heart. You can open your heart. Sure. You can get enlightenment. You can find Nirvana. Right around and experience the absolute joyful bliss of being a free bearded hipster rolling through Los Angeles, grinning ear to ear as you recognize how beautiful it is to be outside. But not everybody's ready for that. You can instead of doing that or even in the midst of doing that, you could get Hulu Plus. Think about that. You could not only buy a bike and enjoy riding around in nature, but you could take Hulu Plus to a picnic. And if you have a device that streams the Internet, you can actually watch your favorite episode of Frasier while enjoying a nice glass of wine and some grapes with your beautiful, lovely mannequin that you carry with you wherever you go because you've given up on finding true love from human beings because they always fail you. HuluPlus.com Please sign up. You get two free weeks. Impress my new sweet darling sponsors. Make them feel like they did the right thing by linking up with the Dugga Trussell Family Hour podcast. It's a great service. I love it. I use it. It's wonderful. HuluPlus.com What's better than binge watching shows? What's better than that moment when a show sinks its meat hook fingers deep into your brain and drags you through 20 hours of pure bliss? It's a blast. I'm not saying do it all the time, but every once in a while it feels good to climb into that stinky cocoon of your bed and fade out from the apocalypse. Every once in a while, we don't have to always have our faces turned towards the maelstrom, do we? We don't always have to have our heads stuck in the fiery furnace of hell. Every once in a while, technology will allow us to pull out of that terrible, terrible-ness and binge-watch a show. Lost. Remember Lost? That show's freaky. I think I'm going to revisit it. I actually hadn't taken a look at the list of shows that Hulu had until they sent me the list of shows that they have. And there's some on here that I definitely have been wanting to watch, but just haven't taken the time to deal with it. For example, Sleepy Hollow. I want to watch that. I don't know how that is. They have the current season of Sleepy Hollow, but they have full seasons of My Name Is Earl. Full seasons of Sabrina the Teenage Witch. Full seasons of The Cosby Show. If you really want to go back and reminisce to those glorious high school days when you watch The Cosby Show, it's there. South Park. But here's the De Numa. We all know that there is nothing better than when you find yourself in a hotel room and what comes on TV. Law and Order Special Victims Unit. What's better than that? Well, now you can have every single episode of Law and Order Special Victims Unit just by signing up for Hulu's Plus. That means that if you sign up by going to HuluPlus.com, you can spend the next two weeks watching Law and Order Special Victims Unit. And that's going to be the best two weeks of your life. I guarantee it. We're also brought to you by Amazon.com. There's no need to go outside anymore, friends. You don't need to do it. You should spend your time. If you're going outside, it should be on your bike, which you've ordered from the Amazon portal located at DuncanTrussell.com. Amazon.com has literally every single item on Earth. You want to order the Holy Grail? It's there. You want to order a bag of purified child's blood to drink because they discovered that by drinking or injecting blood into your body, it can actually reverse the aging process? It's probably there. Go check. You want to have a big laugh? Go to Amazon.com and look up Momosa Hostilus, which I'm not really sure what it's supposed to be used for, but apparently, Momosa Hostilus is one of the precursors for dimethyltryptamine. If you go look up Momosa Hostilus on Amazon.com, look at what people also bought. It's hilarious. Go through our portal located at DuncanTrussell.com the next time you're shopping on Amazon. Amazon will give us a very small percentage of whatever it is that you buy. It costs you nothing and it's a way for you to support this podcast. Go to DuncanTrussell.com and you will find an Amazon portal there. Just click on that portal and buy yourself a bicycle. Also, sweet darlings, we have located at DuncanTrussell.com a lot of really cool t-shirts and posters and stickers. We're still waiting to get the new logo t-shirts. It's taken a couple of months because in Thailand, there's some kind of holiday happening, which is where our shirts come from. But we've got new shirts coming from Ron Regi. The design is incredible. I don't know when you're listening to this podcast, but go back and check the shop. Keep checking the shop. Eventually, we'll get the logo t-shirts replaced. I'm sorry that I sold out on those things. I need to come up with a better system for keeping merchandise in stock there because it does sell out. Go visit the shop. Buy some stickers. Put them on your local churches or statues or bus station benches or on your children. Don't put them on your children. I don't know. They might be allergic, but put them near your children. That would be very sweet. A big thanks to those of you who have been donating to the podcast. That never fails to blow my mind when people do that. Much thanks to you. Oh, shit. Finally, May 24th, not May 27th, May 24th at the Hollywood Improv, we will be recording the first live Duncan Tressel, at least the first one we did in Los Angeles, Duncan Tressel Family Hour podcast. The guests are going to be Emil, who's been on this, you guys know who Emil is. He's been on the show like three times. Also, Dan Harmon is going to be on the show. Get your tickets now. It's probably going to sell out. You can get the tickets by going to DuncanTressel.com. Woo! We did it. Okay. This is a very special podcast. Our guest is Lizzie Velazquez. Lizzie, you probably already know who she is because the odds are that you've seen her amazing TED Talk. But if you don't know who she is, she is one of three people on planet Earth with a rare syndrome that makes it so that she, no matter how much she eats, she can't gain weight. She's 25 years old, weighs 58 pounds and had some turbulent times growing up because she was bullied a bunch in school and someone actually made a video calling her the ugliest woman in the world. She didn't let any of this crap stop her. She's a motivational speaker. She's a happy, radiant person. And right now, she's got a Kickstarter going to help raise some money to make a documentary about her life. If you want to find out more about that, you can visit her website at thelizzieproject.com. So, everyone, please open up your heart chakras. Send pure love in the direction of this incredible, saint-like being who has managed to not only overcome what would have probably sent a lot of people down a dark road, but has transformed her life challenge into something incredibly beautiful. And she really does have what I would consider to be, if everybody adopted her method of dealing with bullies, because what's a bully really? I mean, bully is a new word for a very old thing. This is somebody who's trying to overpower you, subdue you, destroy you, diminish you. And usually our reaction to bullies is to fight back. We want to get revenge. But Lizzie has got a way of handling bullies that is so beautiful and simple that if we all adopted it, I think we'd be living on some kind of paradise planet. And the angels would finally come down from the moon where they've been hiding for all these millions of years and give us all sweet, wet kisses right on our greasy old lips. So now, please, everybody, open your heart chakras and send as much love as you possibly can in the direction of the wonderful Lizzie Velazquez. Welcome, welcome on you, that you are with us. Shake hands, no need to be blue. Welcome to you. Wow, wow, wow. It's been so contrasting. It's so cool that you're here. I watched your Ted talk and like everyone else who saw that, I was immensely inspired. And then Tamar called and said that you would come by and do the podcast. So thank you so much for being here. Thank you for having me. I really appreciate it. How's LA treating you? It always treats me very well. The comparison from Texas weather to LA weather is always very welcome in my book. So it's good. Where in Texas? Austin. Oh, Austin is the best. I know it's the best, but it's really hot. And you can have every season in one week. Yeah, it's true. And it's so, yeah, it's blazingly hot there and it's just weird how Austin is this liberal bastion in the middle of this state that is generally like pretty Republican. I can't picture myself living anywhere else, but Austin. Yeah, it's amazing. You should have, how often do you come to LA? Kind of often. Not like not that much, but pretty often. And were you doing these speaking tours prior to or to the TED Talk? Oh, yeah, I've been speaking since I was in high school, actually. It's been a long, long ride. I think I'm going on eight years. Wow. Well, let's, before we get into that, can you tell me a little bit about sort of how you opened up the TED Talk so people who are listening can become familiar with your story? Oh, yeah. I was actually born with the very rare syndrome that only two other people in the world, including myself, that we know of have. It doesn't have a name. We have no clue how I got it, why I got it. But basically what it causes is that I can't gain weight. That's the only really cause or thing that it affects. I can pretty much eat whatever I want whenever I want and not continue to gain weight. I've never weighed over 60 pounds my whole life and just turned 25 years old. Wow. If you look at it one way, it can be the best diet in the world. Yeah. But on the other hand. Yeah. What is the other hand? Tell me about the other hand. The other hand is the girliest problem to have. Is that it can be hard to find clothes? But other than that, I mean, I've said it before, but it is kind of as great as it sounds. Yeah. That is an incredible, that is an incredible thing. But there is a price and the price, you talk about the price on your TED Talk, which is that you've got to deal with people judging you based on the way you look. That's one of the difficulties that you experienced when you were in elementary school. Yeah, definitely. One of the biggest things that I had to deal with was kind of the downside of looking different. But at the same time, I realized it's one of those issues that even if you don't have this syndrome, it's something that kind of comes with life of having to deal with people who bully you or if you look different or if you feel different, anything like that. You still kind of have to deal with that negative part. So I don't think that I'm the only one or upset that I had to deal with it because it's one of those things where I feel like everyone has dealt with it at some point in their life. You're using the past tense. I deal with it every day. Oh, I still do. I still deal with it every day, no matter because of the fact that I'm human and I have this syndrome. Every day I have good days. I have bad days. And it's kind of one of those things where you have to make the choice. It's going to be with you all the time. So you have to decide, am I going to let this affect my day or am I not? Right. It's a decision. It's a decision. It's definitely a decision. But how do you do that? Like let's say you're, you know, I think every human being that I know is fixated on the way their body looks. They're generally in some way or another obsessed with some flaw that they see in themselves. No matter how minor the thing is, it drives them insane. I have a friend, comedian Brody Stevens, he has a, you can't even see it. There's some kind of like scar that he thinks he has on his face. You can't even see it. It was like, he went in to get some kind of, I don't know what he's getting. He's getting something taken out. I don't know exactly what it is. If he hears that, he might get mad at me. I don't remember the exact thing, but sometimes it'll come up to me like, can you see my scar? Do you see it? It's like, I don't see it, man. But it grabs his attention. Or like when you get a shitty haircut, you know, one shitty haircut can send me into a depressed spiral for weeks. It's all perspective. It's perspective. It's one of those things where if you don't know it's there, you'll never pay attention to it. But if you know that it's there, of course you're going to feel self-conscious about it. And someone can think you're being ridiculous, but you know it's there. So it's going to bother you until you have to ask other people. Right. So you're saying that we could just make a choice, that I can wake up in the morning, look at my rapidly receding hairline, consider what I'm going to look like when I'm bald, just look at myself in the mirror and just make a decision and say, you know what? I'm fine. Yeah. Yeah. It sounds simple yet complicated, but it really is kind of that easy. That easy. Wow. That's an incredible thing. You know, I kind of believe you too. I do kind of. Do you? I think people need to hear about that a lot because it seems like one of the great delusions facing people these days is that we think that we're our body. Yeah. Do you think you're your body? No. What do you think you are? I think I'm my personality. I think I'm my values. I think I'm my, I don't know what the word is, but not my body. I think I'm just inside my body. My body is what kind of carries me every single day. But my mind and my spirit is what makes me me. Are you a, are you religious? Yes. What religion? In Catholic. So that must have been a huge help for you. Yeah. Yeah. One of the three things that I kind of credit my life to is my faith, my family, my friends. Can you talk a little bit about your faith? Like, just describe that. What's your spiritual practice? Yeah. I mean, I think to kind of just sum it up, I was born and raised in the Catholic church and born with knowing that God kind of made me the way I am for a reason. And growing up in the church and having my church family and really kind of having a strong faith based foundation at a young age and having it carry me throughout my life and seeing it without my family. It's one of those things that it's all I knew growing up and it's been a roller coaster. I've been on a very crazy faith journey that has gone from highs and lows and it's something I'll be walking on the rest of my life. But it, I don't know, I'm just, I've always been very rooted in my faith. Since you, since you, when you say lows, what do you mean? Lows of the times where it kind of coincides of age because I go through the middle school phase of not only having the awkward 13 year old time, but also kind of thinking, who do I blame? Who made me look like this? Because when you're 13, 14 years old, you look awkward. You're figuring out who am I and all this kind of thing. Now throw on a syndrome that nobody knows what it is on top of being a girl and hormonal. It's like, it was a mess. It was a mess of things. And so I didn't know who to blame. Couldn't blame my parents. Couldn't blame my teachers. Couldn't blame my siblings. Who did I blame? God. And I kind of looked at it as my syndrome was like a big curse and I hated it because at the time I was only focused on the negative. And so that's when it kind of affected my faith journey. And as I got older, I started realizing that that giant curse sign turned into a giant sign that said blessing. Wow. Yeah, that's really cool. There's a term in Buddha. Have you ever heard that there's a term in Buddhism? They call it poison into medicine. And also an alchemy, you know, and there's the idea of transforming lead into gold. And it's all kind of exactly what you're saying, which is this, it seems like a lot of the things people were running from are the greatest gifts that they have strangely. Yeah. Yeah, definitely. I think it's also, I think it's a process that can be very worthy to people because you have, if you look at it like a giant box and in this box, you have all these bad things, negative things, things you don't like about yourself, things that you're complaining about. But as you get older and you kind of take each one out at a time and kind of mold it and shape it into something that's positive by the time you go down a few months, a few weeks, a few years, you'll have a giant box of gifts and things that like you love and you cherish and you take them along with you and having, being able to look back at the journey that you had at the struggle that you had at the transformation, the time and effort you put into making that transition makes those gifts a hundred times better. Wow. That is so cool. And it's what this is not common knowledge. What you're talking about is I don't think it really is common knowledge. People don't realize that people think I'm going to change. They think I will change what's wrong with me into the way I think it should be. They don't think I'm going to surrender to the way that I am. They think, if only I can make this adjustment, six pack, if I get a six pack, wow, everything gets better. The moment I have a washboard abs, I am in heaven. And then if they get it, then nothing changes. They're the exact same way. Yeah. I feel like if you look at the bigger picture and you look at it and you think, okay, this is what I want. I want the six pack abs. Now tell yourself, okay, I'm going to get it. Now what? What is that going to lead to? People who are attracted to me, but will I like them? Are they only liking me for my six pack? There's just so much to look at and consider that I think people are just so focused on the instant gratification. And it's not just what you look like. I mean, look at social media. People post things because they're ready. They're waiting for the likes. They're waiting for the good comments. They're waiting for the shares. They're waiting for the viral video. Not gratification, but what does that lead to? And I think one of the biggest things that I really want to focus on is being able to the fact that I was given this opportunity to have a viral, whatever, and I'm have this platform now. Now I'm ready to say, what's next? What can I take this into? I feel like I am in this little tiny car and I'm getting people's attention and now I want to say, come in my car and come with me so I can show you the next big thing that there is out there. What is that? This is my thing. I've had such a passion and drive to kind of help people because I see the platform that I have. I see this once in a lifetime opportunity to be able to be this little person that's on this huge stage that I can say, okay, let's make a difference together. Come in with me and let's take this journey together. I don't take the opportunities that I have very lightly at all. I take the fact that I was born one of three people. I take the fact that I look different. I take all of these things and instead of just helping me, I want to take them to help the world. I want to take them to say, you know what, I'm different, I've had a hard life. So have you. Now let's make this thing better together and I really kind of want to make the online community a more positive place. I mean, I've had a lot of struggles and trials with the internet and I think again with social media being so big right now, a lot of people are kind of losing faith in it and I don't want to lose faith in social media because I've been able to connect with people around the world through social media and instead of it going down a bad path, let's change it and make an effort together to make it a more positive place and turn it around. How do you do that? How do you do that? How do you control these? How do you stop the trolls? There's no way that. There's no way. There's no, it's not. And turn on the lights, which problem solver. It's a lot of steps that are going to be involved and do I know what those steps are? No. Nobody does because if we did, somebody would have done it already. But I'm excited to take that ride and see what they are. Let's figure them out together. It is an incredible thing because what you're talking about when you're talking about social media is you're talking about one of the many new environments that technology is offering humanity and one of technology's functions, maybe one of its primary functions is it's an amplifier. It amplifies everything, it amplifies, it digitizes and then amplifies. That's what it does. Right now, we're digitizing this conversation and then we're going to amplify it. It's going to get shot out into, who knows, 80,000, 160,000 years, but 80,000 people depending on how many years they have. But it's going to get sprayed out there. It's amplifying this conversation and it's a very potent and powerful tool. And I think that what you're talking about is one thing is to understand when somebody goes online with the intention of causing pain to other people, they clearly don't quite understand what they're doing. They think they don't realize that when you send these, in the 1800s, you were very limited if you wanted to hurt people's feelings. You had the people in your village or you could, I don't know, the amount of time it would take to insult somebody in China would be a long time. If you wanted to say something shitty to somebody in China, we're talking, how long would that take? A year? You would have to scrape it on a rock. You would have to scrape it on a rock, you got to get the rock to China. You got to get it on a boat, it might get attacked by pirates. But now, if you want to hurt someone's feelings in China, you can do it in a millisecond. If you do it in the right way, then you might actually get 20,000, 30,000 or 40,000 other people to gang up on this person in China that you've decided to attack. You can do it in an instant. Every human today, one thing that I think is happening is that people don't recognize their value. They don't recognize how potent a human being existing today with this new technology rising around them is. The power of a keyboard, dangerous thing, but yet a very powerful thing. Very powerful. Now, I'm sure that you've had some pretty interesting encounters in social media with the probably you've experienced. I bet you've come in contact with the king of assholes. I bet you've come in contact with some real beasts out there. Let me just say my favorite insults are the ones with the most spelling errors. I mean, honestly, if you're going to take the time to tell me something mean, let's use spell check before you do it. No shit. Or just not say it at all. Well, it's weird, isn't it? Because it's almost like their ugliness comes out in the grammar. It's almost like what's so awful about them is actually manifesting in the way that they're right. Well, it's also, come on, let's face it, we're dealing with 12 year olds here, right? That's my point. I'm really happy that you said that. One of the things that I've realized is that on my social media, there can be a million people who are supporting me and so nice. And then there's that one person that kind of says something awful. And all of a sudden, all of those people who are so nice and supportive and we like you what you do because you don't bully other people in a millisecond, they're turning around and they're being the bully to the bully. They're being, they're hating on that person. And you click on their profile and it's a 12 year old kid who I feel so, at this point, I don't let the negative comments affect me. I have the opposite reaction now. If I see it, I get sad, not for me, but for them because I don't know what their story is. I can't get upset because the people who hurt other people are the people that are hurting the most. And I feel like you just have to, I want to hug them and honestly, like there's rare occasions where I can see things that people say really bad stuff to me and I'll reply to them and I'll say, you know what, I'm sorry, you feel that way, but I, I just want you to know that you're appreciated and you have a purpose in this life. And that's it. And just save it because maybe they're not being told that. Maybe that's why they're hating on other people who are succeeding or doing well. So why not be the Isle of Branch that's kind of helping them out? You're the cure. What you're talking about is the cure. That is the answer. That's the only thing you could do. There's not, there won't be a cure. There'll be a remedy. I'll be the remedy. There's no cure, huh? No. Well, because the people are numb. Yeah. I think I, there's never going to be a fixed online bullying. There's never going to be a fixed two judgment, but why not help it out to kind of steer it in a better way? Okay. Let's, let's talk about the reality of this that you're talking about here, which is that some people out. You are, you are such a great example for me and for so many people. Thank you. Because you're not letting, it's anything that I'm about to say to try to rationalize being an asshole to someone online who I think is an asshole. It won't work. It won't work because you've made a decision that you're not going to do that. And what do I have to be, I mean, you know, let me give you an example. Okay. So my, my, my mother passed away last year and she has a memorial webpage. Okay. Somebody posted on my mom's memorial webpage, you Jew cunt, I hope you burn in hell. Now, I know this is a podcast and people can't see my reaction, but my mouth is open right now. I can't believe that. Well, you know, it was, okay, for one, um, my mom wasn't Jewish. Uh, I mean, I have to say, I'm not, I'm just, I'm not surprised as sad as that is. I'm not surprised that they would just make up some random thing. Well, it was, it's, it's, so it's, you know, let me give you another example. This is some weird thing I heard once from someone. I think she was schizophrenic, but it really, it really like sometimes schizophrenics accidentally say the truth or they tune into something bigger and then she said to me once, there are people who dump gasoline in our rivers just to kill the rivers. There's people who pollute the world not by accident, but because they want to kill the earth. And I remember hearing that and it really gave me goosebumps because I thought, Oh God, what if that's true? What if there's an extreme, extreme version of this stuff that usually is accidental selfishness that is an accidental selfishness, that there are people in the world who want to inject venom and poison into life? How do we forgive them? How do we deal with them? What do you do about that? That attitude? Yeah. It's, it's a choice. That's the only worth that keeps coming to mind hearing that. That's all you can do is as long as you do it for yourself, somehow it's going to come out down the line and other people are going to see that you don't have to do this grand gesture or commenting them to start with yourself and then it'll kind of blossom out organically. What does that mean? Organically? It's very L.A. word. Yeah, they laughed when Lizzie's here with her friends and I, we have gluten free chocolate chip cookies. I had one a few weeks, the last time I was here actually, I went to my first organic restaurant. Wow. It was an experience. Did you like it? It was good. I did. I had pancakes. Oh. Gluten free? No, no, they were. How are you still alive? They were organic, but I had my first, the waitress was like, oh, let me get you a cookie. And I was like, what's the healthy part? You're not going to trick me. And she said it was gluten free, but I ate it. It was good. It was good. It just tastes like there was something missing. Yeah. Well, I guess when you're able to eat anything that you want all day long, health food doesn't really seem as important anymore. Well, breaking news on your podcast right now. I'm on a healthy kick because I'm 25 and I need to stop eating like a five year old. Really. I still order off the kids menu. I'm not going to lie. I mean, good for my wallet, not good for my health. It makes you feel better to eat healthy food. Yesterday was my first full day of a healthy misc, air quotes, but I felt good. We flew in yesterday, yesterday morning. I was up at one to sleep, went to bed, two, 30, woke up four a.m. had a full day and I ate like really actually good stuff and not junk. Only had half a cup of coffee and my body just felt better. Is that incredible when you realize how much food and I slept really well? Who knew? Power of eating and sleeping. Who would have thought? Who would have thought? Who would have thought the food you put in your body has any effect on what you feel? In my mind, I think I just always have the idea that if I could, I can eat whatever I want, so I'm going to do it. But the reality of the situation is you kind of just have to take care of your body and feed it the right things. Well, that's the thing because that's the weird paradox, isn't it? Here we are in a world where there's a sense, a feeling that you aren't your body. There's a feeling that we're so much more than our body and every religion points in this direction. They all have different ways of saying it, but they all point in the direction that what you are is not this temporary shell that you happen to be riding around in, yet you still have to take care of this thing. You need the shell that you have to take with you. You need the shell. You need the shell. And it's easy to forget. It doesn't matter what the shell looks like, doesn't matter how big or small it is as long as it's healthy. It'll take you from point A to point B, hopefully. What's point B? You decide what point B is. There's also point C, D, E. There's so many different points. Nothing stops. There's just so many things out there. So as a Christian, you believe that there is a Creator and the Creator put you on this planet for a reason. You might me believe that, too. By the way, that Creator is a wonderful being in a certain way, but simultaneously there's this sense of like, why is it that the great teachers of the world are the ones who have to endure so much? Why do you guys always have to endure so much shit? What is that? Who is this Creator? Isn't there a way to not have that aspect of the thorn that brings you wisdom? Why do you guys always have to deal with this? Ram Dass, my teacher, he had a stroke. He's having to deal with that. So many other great teachers out there having to deal with these problems. What is that? You don't have... Wait. So are you saying like, look, why do people who are kind of being the voice of change, why do they have to go through struggles? So much struggle. You don't have to... That's the thing, though. You don't have to be the voice of change to make the difference. You don't have to have struggles to make a difference. You can lead a great life and make a difference. You can lead a great life and not be a public figure. You can be an everyday person and make, like, okay, pretend I never had the syndrome, pretend I never was bullied. If I still had a little tiny passion to help someone or help make a difference when there's always issues out there, always. If I wanted to go out there and change it, I don't have to have struggles. You can do it. The only reason that we know that people who are kind of being the voice of change has struggles is because you're the voice of change and you're talking about it. If you didn't talk about it and make it put it out there, how would you know if we went through something or not? You know what I'm saying? So I don't know. Like, you don't have to have... I don't know. You're saying there's not a... The price of admission, is it necessarily a rare syndrome or some kind of... Right. Or struggles or not having money. Like, no, no, no. You can't. Yeah, right. Because somebody listening could think, well, I don't really need to do anything because I'm basically okay. So what am I going to do? Listen, I started doing all of this with Google. I Googled how to be a motivational speaker and I taught myself how to do everything and I did all of that stuff. I wasn't this girl with a ton of money who's doing all these things and now I'm here. No, you can start from a little tiny foundation and build it to kind of like a mansion of things. Wow. Yeah, that is the big message that seems to be going out to so many different people and I want to go back to what you said. You said work on yourself. Start there. If you work on yourself then everything else will emerge from that. Can you tell me, what do you mean work on yourself? What does that involve? Figure out who you are. Put the pieces of your own puzzle together because we're all kind of made up of a million different things. What are those things that are different to every single person? To me, my puzzle pieces were my personality, the things that I value, the things that I believe, the goals that I have, the things I like to do when I'm not working. Putting those all together and kind of really deciding, okay, you have two choices. You can decide to put your puzzle together or you can decide to just kind of leave it at a big mess and not do anything with it. Or you can do the whole putting the corners together, the outside, the main things, working in with the details and figuring it all out. Once you have it, it's like, wow, I put this puzzle together. Let's do another one. What is this puzzle going to be? You can be my next puzzle. This project will be my next puzzle and then just keep going. Wow. So you're saying start with the first puzzle to fix is the... Yourself. Yeah, the weird puzzle that is yourself, all the various strange, misshapen bits. It's one of those things where you can't love someone else until you love yourself. That's like that, kind of. How do you do it? How do you love yourself? You know, I was laying in bed last night, God, really mad. What was I mad about? I don't remember what it was. I was mad. I was thinking like, I was comparing myself to somebody. There you go. You just said my answer to your question. Which is? You asked how do you do that? Don't compare yourself. First rule of thumb. Don't compare yourself to other people. That's what my answer is going to be. That is the, isn't that the, that is the fangs of the adder, isn't it? Comparing yourself to other people. I had to train myself to stop because I, it was, it was instant. If I would see someone, I would think, oh, I, I wish my jeans fit like hers, or I wish I looked like that, or am I doing this? They're probably doing it better than me. Yes. What does I do? Instant negativity, instant doubt, instant, oh, they're better, whatever. Because you've got like a really self-destructive shitty friend, and then you can think about them and feel better about yourself in the most awful way. No. No. You can't do that. Look at that loser. No. He's going to die in a couple of weeks probably. No, that's awful. I know. I'm kidding. That's awful. No. No. Both sides, no matter what. All I'm saying is either you're going to feel bad about yourself, or you're going to feel the worst kind of happiness, which is the happiness that originates from the fact that your friend is dissolving it. That's not true happiness then. That is not true happiness. It's not real. It's artificial. See, what you're, here's what I love about what you're saying, it's because, I mean, I don't know for sure. I don't know. Have you come in contact with any like Eastern philosophies, any, because what you're talking about is exactly what a lot of things, a lot of various paths that I'm interested in talk about. And what they say, what Ram Dass says, what many Buddhist teachers say is all you can do is work on yourself. You can't change anybody else. You can't fix anyone else around you. And they say the very first thing to do is to love yourself. If you can love yourself and you can love every single aspect of yourself, then you'll be able to love all the people around you. And just that is going to lead to something great, but you got to figure out how to love yourself first. And how to break those barriers of judgment of other people. Because you have to accept the fact that, okay, I love myself. I love everything that I'm doing. I feel confident in myself. I'm going to go out there and make a difference. But at the same time, you're going to go out there and you're going to meet a ton of different people. Take religion, for example, to each their own. I don't go out and tell people my religion because I'm trying to convince them to be Catholic. I go out there to tell them, this is what I believe. Do you want to tell me what you believe? And I think that's awesome. I want to learn from other things. I don't want to go out there and say, if you don't believe what I believe, then I don't like you. I'm going to cut you off. I'm not going to believe anything that you say. You have to be open and committed to kind of just breaking down those walls. Whole world out there, my friend. Whole world out there. I want to get back to the idea of loving yourself. Can you define love for me? No. She's the queen of the greatest. Can you? No. No. But I can tell you this. I can tell you that every single great teacher that I've had on here, the way I always know that they're ... The way I always know someone's tuned in generally is when I ask them a question like that, that they will proudly say, I don't know. I don't know. Whereas my tendency, because I'm not so tuned in as you are, if someone asks me a question, I'm getting better. But if someone asks me whatever the question is, it doesn't have to be some metaphysical thing. It could be about quantum physics, and my mouth will start yapping some terrible explanation like I understand it at all. I mean mid-sentence, if someone asks me quantum physics, I'm like, I don't know. I don't know what you're talking about. That's a good one. So right away I'd be like, no, I wouldn't even take the pause of let me try to think of an answer. So you don't know what love is? No. What a paradox then, because how do you love yourself if you don't know what love is? Okay. This is what I think. I think that every single person has a different definition for everything. I can't tell you what I define love. I can tell you what I define love as, but that's not like, if I looked in the dictionary and looked in love, I don't think that that's just what it is. Does that make sense? Yes. I can tell you what I believe it is, but I can't tell you that I know what it is. I think there's a big difference between that. There's a lot of problematic words like God, love. There's so many problematic words out there because we're dealing with these little cubby holes that you're trying to shove the entire universe into. So it is a bit of a predicament, but I think there is something to be said for trying to define what love means, even if it's just for you. Because when I think of loving myself, what do you do with the anxiety? What do you do with the sense of guilt? What do you do with the feeling that you haven't done enough or you're not doing enough? What do you do with the feelings of those feelings, the lack of contentment, the loneliness? What do you do with all that stuff? How do you love that? I think it kind of goes along to what you just said, how you kind of put it into the little cubby hole or something. I don't like there to be limits. I don't like the fact that somebody could say, this is what love is. Because again, there's a whole big world out there with so many different things in it. So why wouldn't you want to include it? There's things that you don't know about that could be included. It could be the perfect fit for the love box. But because you don't know it, you're going to leave it out there. So why keep the limitations of a box when you can just take it out and continue to put things in it? Who doesn't want to have more love? No matter what it is. Right. I mean, as you get older, you explore that box and you see what's in it and that's the exciting thing. Change is constant. Everything's going to keep changing in the love box. But what about the happiness box? What about what's successful? There's so many different things that if you don't have these set definitions, if you don't have these set limitations, can you imagine? It's the best. It's the best. It's like digging and it's like getting Happy Meal toys for your whole life. Like isn't that exciting? Yes. What is it going to be this time? Right. So it's why limit yourself to, why limit yourself, why are you imposing these limitations on yourself? Don't let the language chain you. It's a tool to free you. Right, definitely. Pointing at the moon. Fingers pointing at the moon. You know about that? No. So it's like these teachings, the things that you're talking about, they're fingers, whatever it is, whether it's Islam, Catholicism, Buddhism, Sufism, any of the isms, they say that they're like fingers pointing at the moon. And if you stare at the fingers, you're missing the whole point. If you get caught up in the symbols of this. I love that. Isn't that cool? Yeah. Yeah, it's really beautiful. And that's what you're talking about. But still, I mean, I don't expect, I don't expect you to give me the answer to all my problems today. I was kind of hoping you were, but... I don't have answers. I have lots of questions and lots of curiosity. What are your questions? Give me a good question. I mean, I don't have like a specific question, but general questions like what is love? What is happiness? Everybody has those questions. Nobody has the answer. Let's explore what the answer could be. Well I think that there's something to be said for exploring and, you know, this is my, it's just so funny. I know, if you go back and listen to some of the podcasts that I've done with some of the, I mean, I've done podcasts with comedians and I've done podcasts with a lot of different people, but sometimes I get to do podcasts with great teachers. And I inevitably end up in this exact place with them where they won't give me an answer. Because they don't have them. They're in denial. They don't have, nobody has the answers without responses, not the answers. Right. And that's so frustrating isn't it? Hello and answer is a set thing and answer has limitations because you're saying this is what it is. Hello limitations. Right. No limitations. No limitations. Having a response, putting them all together. And you, so many people, they break out. Let's say their face breaks out one morning and they act like they're in the Holocaust or something. Like it's, that's, that's, you know what I mean? It's such an extreme comparison. It's true though. I've seen it happen. I believe you. I believe you. So many of us, and I do it too. So many of us have something like, I have things too. You have things too, but you don't let them stop you. You're not a limited person. You're someone who has overcome or is in the process of consistently overcoming limitations. Right. And not only are you doing that, but simultaneous, simultaneously you are broadcasting this out into the world to let people know that they don't have to be limited either. You're compelled to teach. Yes. Can you talk a little bit about bullying? I know, I know that that's, let's see. Oh, we've got some time. Can you talk a little bit about bullying? And I know that you have a movie coming out. I do. I do. Let's talk about that a little bit. Yes. The, I'm going to be doing my first documentary, which I'm super excited about. I will be playing myself. Of course. I know. Um, but what I really want to focus on is kind of my story, who I am for those who don't know who I am. And I've thought about initially what are people going to want to see it because I've done so much online. Do they know my whole story? No. I want people to see more than the 15 minute said talk that they see that was out there. I want them to get to know me as a person and what are the building blocks to me? What are the tools behind how I've gotten to this point? And again, I use the kind of car analogy. I want to show people this is how I came out of bullying. This is the possibility. This is how it can happen. Now let's explore that to see what that can lead to because people can say, Oh, Lizzie, it's so good for you. You're deciding to be positive. All right. That's it. What are you going to do with it? What I want to do is make the internet social media more positive. I don't want to say safer because it's the internet. Come on. Yeah, forget it. More positive because again, social media has a good and bad side. Let's kind of find the middle ground and make it a little bit better. Let's help. Let's find a way to stop bullying the bully. Let's find a way to when somebody, when all the nice people turn into the bully, let's find a way to turn that around without causing a huge scene on the comments of Instagram. Bullying the bully. There's a story. There's a great story. Tell me if you've heard it. This is a, I think it happened in Japan. There's, I wish I could remember his name. This isn't one of Ram Dass' books. He's an Akito teacher. No, he's studying Akito. He's studying a martial art and he'd been studying it there for years. The teacher told him, you know that you've learned this when you are never getting a fight again and you've truly learned what martial arts are. He's on a train and the train stops and this drunk guy comes in, drunk and big and loud and he shoves a woman. He just shoves this woman. He's belligerent and loud. This guy's sitting there like, all right, I get to use martial arts today. I've all these years of training. I get to finally, I have a justified reason for violence. Here is just, if there ever was justified violence, it's to stop a man who just shoved a woman, a drunk man who shoved a woman on train. So he stands up and the drunk guy sees him becoming aggressive and there's about to be a fight when an old man sitting there looks up at the guy and says, what have you been drinking? And the guy's like, socky. And the old man pats his chair for the guy to sit down next to him and he looks at the guy and says, I love socky. He says, the old man says, I love socky. You know, me and my wife, when the sun's going down, we sit and drink socky and the drunk guy starts crying and he says, my wife died two months ago. And then within a few moments, the drunk guy's head is in the old man's lap and the old man is just patting his head saying, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. And the guy watching this realized I just saw a true martial artist. I just witnessed. Oh, I got the chills. Isn't that cool? Wow. Isn't that cool? Yeah. The power of words. Yeah. The power of words. I've always said words can hurt more than actions or in this case, work more than actions. Yeah. And that's alchemy and there's lead into gold and there's this kind of magical transformation that's happened there and it goes against everything we've learned in the world. We've got Putin going into the Ukraine and we've got troops all over the place running training drills and planes flying over and it's the same old story that it doesn't work. What you're talking about is not just fixing the problem of bullying or online bullying. You're talking about fixing a problem that's been haunting this planet since humans have been wandering around and it doesn't work. Getting back in the normal way doesn't work. Yep. And how did I learn that? By figuring it out first, myself. When I found that video, I instantly wanted to bully the bully. I instantly wanted to sit there and comment back and... So justified. Yeah. Yeah. Just tell it. I didn't know what I was going to say, but I realized like I'm just going to be... And that video, I'm sorry. Can you describe that video because we haven't talked about it? Yeah. I'm sorry. It was a video called the world's ugliest woman video of myself, eight seconds long, no sound. Four million views when I found it. Thousands of comments ranging from just putting it under your head, killing yourself, why didn't your parents just support you if you're going to be so ugly, on and on and on, all the things, awful, awful, awful. Not one positive comment, not one. How do I know? I sat there and I read them all, cried my eyes out, quickly went from sadness to anger to where I wanted to bully the bully. Yes. To then the kind of instant that was going to be the catalyst to changing my entire life without knowing it. How did I know when I found that video wanting to listen to a Taylor Swift song that I would find the one thing that kind of would change literally the rest of my life? And I was, where were they going with this? Well, we're talking, we're talking about this, the reaction to the video. Oh yeah. Yeah. I wanted, I wanted to bully the bully back and again, it wasn't just my decision. It was the support system that I had around me. My parents, I had to tell them about it, didn't want to tell them because I was more hurt for them than I was for myself because I knew they were going to feel helpless. Like they couldn't do something to protect me from all of that. So I wanted to protect them by not telling them, of course I have to. Told my family, everyone knew about it. It was one of those things where they kind of just reassured me. It was going to be okay. They don't know who I am at the time. I was like, you're just saying that, you don't know what it's like, but I don't know what came over me. I don't know why I thought about this, but I just knew I didn't, I wanted to approve those people wrong. I've always been the type of person where if you tell me I'm not able to do something or if I can't do something and I know I can, I'm going to do it just to prove you wrong and hopefully do it better than you can. It's just always been my personality, like dare me to do it and I'm going to do it as long as it's something legal and good. But I didn't know how I was going to do it, don't know when I was going to do it, but I knew I was somehow going to make it happen and it came in the form of figuring out my goals, which was being motivational speaker and author graduating college and had no idea that I was going to accomplish all those things in the next years that I originally set those goals. Have you had any contact with a person who accidentally gave you this gift? No. The only contact that I had when we first found it, we tried to get it taken down and this was back when YouTube was still pretty new and didn't really know the rules of how to flag stuff and get it down. We tried, didn't really accomplish anything. Apparently the guy found out, posted it, sent me a message, said I don't care how many times you try, no matter what you do, I'm just going to keep reposting it. If you decide to put yourself on TV, you can put yourself on the internet. And that, like as awful as it was, it kind of was like, wow, that's true and I'm not giving him credit for anything. But I put that message away. It's kind of what lit my fire. Like I don't know who this person is, but he's making me so mad at thinking about it. Like how dare he do this to me and I did it and you know what, can I tell you what's the best part about all of this? Now I had zero supporters and thousands of comments to this one video. Now I don't have to do anything because if there's somebody who's talking bad about me, people don't fight back as much. Some of them say her name is Lizzie Velasquez. This is her website. This is her story. Maybe you shouldn't be that mean. And I never had to fight back in a negative way. I fought back with my accomplishments and people saw that. Oh man, that is so intense. It's the best feeling, the best feeling. And isn't that, that's, I mean, if anything to me exemplifies Christianity or what Jesus was talking about, it's that. Which is that if you just, if you just love, everything's going to work out fine. Right. If you just accept everything, if you just decide to go the right path no matter what it is, it's exciting to think where to lead you. Never in a million years would I think I would be sitting here talking to you saying I'm going to be doing my first documentary. Right. Right. That's incredible to think about that. And it just is so, it seems so counterintuitive to the way we've all been taught. Because the way we've all been taught is that it's all about winning, conquering, us and them, overcoming, destroying our enemies, ruining our enemies, dragging our enemies around. Honestly, Tamar had told me about your, that YouTube video and I swear to God, I thought for a second, you know what? I'm going to announce that we find the person who did this and attack them. No. I know that's not what you want and that's what you're teaching. But the impulse that we've all been taught is so based on vengeance. So how many movies are, how many movies? That's like the happy ending. Can you know what a lot of people have said? If you could take back all the bullying, if you could take back that video, if you could have cosmetic surgery, if you can do all these things, if you could take a magic pill to make you gain weight, would you do it? If you asked me when I was 13, I would say in a heartbeat. If you ask me now, I would say don't even tell me those words because I don't want to hear it. If I ever came face to face with the person that made that video, I would not be mad. I've forgiven him years ago. Years ago, I would thank him because he was a catalyst to help me make this change. I feel like I've always kind of had it in me to kind of want to make a difference, be positive. It's how I was raised. But without this little thing, I call it little kind of massive. But without that, I wouldn't be here. I would want to tell him that I forgive him. I would want to tell him. I would want to say come see this movie with me. We figuring out how to not bully other people would help you. And we can make this change together and you won't post bad videos about other people. I love you. You are the coolest person ever. It's true. Oh my God, this is, it's so good to hear this stuff, really. We're having this conversation at exactly the right time. It's so perfect. So many people need to hear this right now. Who knows what people are doing while they're listening to this? What's that? Who knows what people are doing while they're listening to this and sharing the message. If you're running right now, listening to it, keep running. Don't stop. If you're in the basement and you have your enemy tied to a chair and you're about to put a cigar on his eyeball, let them go, tell them you're sorry. Don't take the scandal route and use pliers, let them go, go have breakfast, get to know their story. Did you say use pliers? No, I said take one tooth. No, I said, do you watch the show Scandal? Oh no, I haven't seen that. Okay, I'm obsessed with that show and they use pliers to get information out of people to pull their teeth out. See what I'm saying? Why are we taking this bad route? Bad route? Because that's the world that we're in. We're in a world where everything in the media says use pliers. Everything in the media says wrench teeth out with pliers, set people on fire, shove people in front of trains. Have you ever read the Count of Monte Cristo? No. There's just so many stales of vengeance where the final thing, the glorious thing is the person who was persecuted standing over the decapitated body of the person who did it and that's it. They won. Well, lucky for us. I'm here to tell you about my documentary that's going to help change media and if you want to join us, go to thelissiproject.com. Yeah, I think a lot of people are going to do that and wow, cool. So yeah, lissiproject.com and you're on Twitter? Yes. What's your Twitter? Little Lizzy V. Little Lizzy V on Twitter and where else can people find you? My website at www.lissiproject.com, Instagram, Little Lizzy V. I'm all over the social medias. Thank you so much. Thank you very much. It's an honor to meet you and I really, really appreciate you giving me this time. Thank you. Thank you. You're the best. So are you. All right, you guys. That was Lizzy Velazquez. I'm going to have links to her Kickstarter, which I really hope you'll help out with.

401^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - 445: Chris Mansfield Transcript and Discussion^2021-06-12^Ghost Towns. Dirty Angel. Out. Now. You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns. Dirty Angel. Out. Now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Friday afternoon in the universe, no directions in and out. You got your men, women, dogs, children, horses, bones, ticks, perks, pots, pans, pools, palls, paunturiances, and petty thieverys that turn into heavenly Buddha. And oh boy, what's I talking about guys, I made the world and when I made it I know I had a pushing midnight from my name and concocted up a world, so nothing. You had forever there after me, believe it's real. But that's alright because now everything will be alright. We'll soothe the forever boys and girls and before we're through, we'll find a name for this darn golden eternity and tell a story too. And what you ever read, a story as fast as this that begins Friday afternoon with working men on scaffolds, painting white paint, and ants burling in the black dens, and microbes warring in your kidney, and miscellaneous microbing in the innards of mercury, and microbes deeming of the atomic microbe hood, which then automates outward to the eldest vast empty atom, which is this imaginary universe, ending nowhere, never even born as banque, well-posed when he ferried his mother over the rocks to plot UT and people visit his hut to inquire. What other planet features this? And he answers, what other planet? Well, the sounds of the entire world are not swimming through this window, from Mrs. Nucatiola's toando, an old folk's home drunk again, and of course you hear the cats wailing in the wild, wild, wild, wild, what fans will enlighten at night? Lucian, Dolfine, immensity visions of the Tantaga, the state of purity and womb. And so that here is all this infinity material, a matter like golden ash, swimming, swarming in our enlightened brains, in the silence, shh, pallying in our endless air, and still we're a few as naked and blank to hear. What the who? Who? To what you? We'll say the diamond boat in Percipine, Recipine, Miltown, Heroine, and the fact matches the silver gauges of a lasting swarm, swallowing in a simple broom, and at night you raise the square white light from your ghostly, the root-breaking tree in Coyote, won't hear ya, but you'll ward off the inexistent two devils. Just to pass the time away, and meanwhile it's timeless to the ends of the last light year, and getting late, finding afternoon where we start so-so sounds, and how the works are done, and drink his beer, and tweak his children's eyes. Welcome to the DTFH Pals. That, if you don't already know, is Jack Kerouac reading Lucian Midnight, one of my favorite Kerouac poems out there, and now that I'm halfway through my life, at least, I can actually, like, freely say I love Jack Kerouac. I went through a period where I was doing that thing, maybe you do it, where you're like, that's for college kids, and then I realized that, you know, I haven't read a book since college, so college kids are actually more advanced than I am, and that, you know, to say, like, that was when I was in college, and I like that, is like implying that, like, now I'm somehow sophisticated, now I'm sitting here, like, staring at, like, Twitter for two hours straight, oh yeah, that's for college kids, and now I look at Twitter, but anyway, now I'm old enough where it's like, I fucking love Kerouac, I don't know why, I was trying to be cool by expressing some kind of, like, pseudo-sophisticated attitude towards one of the great American poets, and recently I dived back in to the Kerouac vortex, vortices, I'm not sure which one, okay, both, it's a vortex and a vortices, and I love listening to him read his poetry, it's just so cool, and if you haven't taken a, if you haven't revisited the great Kerouac, I think you should, and the reason I'm playing it, by the way, is because today's guest and I started up a friendship, and somewhere along the lines, he invited me to actually read a never-before-heard Kerouac poem for this upcoming album he's doing at the Kerouac Estate, it was a huge honor for me, I mean, it's goose bump level, holy shit, are you kidding me? Of course I would do that, oh my god, but you know, we talk now, and I have great conversations with him, my favorite kinds of conversations that veer wildly between deep, like, heavy, metaphysical concepts, and death, and loss, and depression, to, like, hilarious, just ridiculous, you know, like, thinking about, like, you know, long conversations about potential, like, potential damage that could come from, like, standing up sex to, like, the older you get, how dangerous that becomes. Look, if you were there, you would have liked hearing us talk about that. But anyway, at some point, the thought sparkled in my dim mind that what am I doing, having these great conversations and not recording them, and so Chris Mansfield was kind enough to come on the podcast. You probably know Chris Mansfield from his awesome band, Fences, check it out, they've got an incredible catalog of really beautiful music, and I hope you'll give them a listen. I'd put it on here, but I don't want to, like, trigger some kind of thing. You know, the trigger a bot. But I hope you'll look up his music. We had a wonderful conversation, we're going to jump right into it. But first, this. In case you don't speak Spanish, that means may I suck your feet, my queen?

But when it does, it's like, oh, this is great. I did it. I guess that crusty, crispy, weird, sad, poor, crying part of myself that I thought was some kind of vestigial organ from elementary school didn't dry up like I thought it had. This episode is proof, everybody. Please welcome first time, but not the last time to the DTFH, Christopher Mansfield. Welcome to the DTFH. Chris is so cool that you agreed to do this, man. We've been having the best conversations on the phone. And I thought to myself, I can't have these conversations. I've got a family. I got to monetize these conversations. I invited you to do my podcast. You said yes. And here you are. God bless you. How are you on this wonderful day? I'm good. I'm good. But yesterday in LA, it was raining and that charged me up. Like finally, you know what I mean? Not to start a podcast with something as banal as weather, but it helped because the- Oh, weather is not- Yeah. No. It's everything kind of, you know what I mean? So I'm good, man. I feel good. You know, speaking of banal, once I remember I was in a, I was just, I just joined a sketch comedy group. And I, one of the lines that I had to read was banal. And I said banal. And I felt like the dumbest asshole on earth. Everyone's like, you said banal. Yeah. I mean, no, I meant banal. I've never known how banal is that word. I mean, the English language is so flawed and I have to look at it so much like writing and writing songs and writing, you know, poems if you want to call them that or whatever. And it is flawed. Like there's a lot of things that are, that are fucked up where it's like phonetically, like you weren't wrong. It's like you kind of did the right thing. Like you pronounced it correctly, like according to like the law of grammar, but it just was like, it was socially wrong. It's weird. I mean, it's a, it, because it is spelt like banal, like anal with a B. It's fine. I wouldn't worry. Do you- Thank you. I think about every once in a while cringe. I can't believe I didn't know how to say banal. Do you, now, do you make a distinction between poetry and songs? Like what is the distinction? I always, I think about it sometimes, like, you know, when I'm listening to music, your lyrics are amazing, by the way. What is the difference between a song and poetry outside of like music, but isn't it essentially the same thing? Man, that's a good question. There was actually a, the New York Times wrote, like, I can't remember who it was, and I apologize to him or her, whomever. There is an entire article about what's the difference between a poetry and a song, and I would just dilute it down to the simple fact of, like, you know, dead poet society when there's like the Pritchard's rhyming scheme, and there's like AB, AB format, so it'd be like, be like, there's a cat, there's a guy, there's a bat, and then we're in the sky. So it's like the last syllable, AB, AB, so there's like different rhyme schemes to follow. So there's like a mathematics to it. And with songs, you definitely have to follow that like pretty heavy. I mean, I definitely do. Like if I, like the song, Same Blues, even the title, Same Blues, so ooh, ooh, ooh, that's the whole theme is the ooh, is that vowel. So you're a mother of two, and I try to be a good father too. I lose my mind when talking to you. I don't know why. Yes, I do. Yes, I do. It's all ooh. So you, you, you hear that ooh, and that's kind of, and it's at the end, and you just kind of ride that down. But with a poetry, with a poem, it's sort of loose. I mean, if you listen to like, not listen to, I mean, I guess you could have someone read it to you, but you know, like Richard Brodigan, like he has a poem is just like, you know, I went to a house with a woman. She had a bike in the corner, and it's done. And you're like, fuck, it's so good. But it's like, right? But there, you know, there's nothing going on. I know. I know. Why is it so good? I don't know. And that is like sort of the fucking, it's, it like terrorizes me almost, I think. It does. A little bit. I mean, I love it so much. It terrorizes you because you want to, you want that, you want, you don't understand it, or because you want to do it, or a combination of all those. I mean, I feel the same way. I'm legitimately flabbergasted by the way that seemingly completely just mundane sentences put in the right order can be like a nuclear bomb. Exactly. You know, you put it perfectly. It's because it's, it's the transference of the most simplistic that is atomic. And that's, and that's frightening. I mean, it's, it's like weaponizing like language. And that's like, that can fucking move mountains and change the world. And it's weird. It's like, just put the, this word before this word, I don't really feel anything. Okay, flip it. All of a sudden, we all have fucking goosebumps. And it's like, now there's a revolution. And it's strange in that way. And I don't really know why. Yeah. I think it's probably what God is at work or something. I don't know. That Brogdon poem though, that's like every, it's so, it's so many things. It's so romantic somehow. It's like incredibly romantic and it's like exciting. You know, it reminds me of when you're just hanging out with a girl that you like and it's like that. It's somehow so many, it's a fractal. It's summoning up all these things that just shouldn't be able to do that. Exactly. Well, you want to know why it is. Well, I was going to say, if there's a bike in the corner, where's she taking that bike? Where does she go? You know what I mean? It opens up worlds. It implies everything. It's like, you can say, it's almost like the best poem ever. And if I could write it right now, I would say, one day you were born, right? Because now you're implying what happens after that so much. You don't have to write it. It's implied this entire world after it. And that's the thing. I mean, they did this thing where they said, I forget who wrote it. I don't know if it was Hemingway, but they said, right, the saddest, shortest poem. And it said, baby shoes for sale never worn. Like, ow, fuck. Oh, fuck. Yeah, I heard, oh, fuck that. You see? Oh, yeah. That's an ice pick right to the heart. That's just brutal. It is. But that took me, there's nothing. How many points, do you have a lot? Do you memorize a lot of poetry? God, man, not as much as I probably should. I got to go through them again, but I try. I mean, I have a few. I like Pablo Neruda. He talks about the entire poem, why he loves a woman. But he says, most of all, I love your feet because they walked to me. And it's like, damn, shit like that, that's what gets me going, man. It's a small little things, man. They really, it's, and that's the thing that you chase. You chase the simplicity and it is, it becomes rather Buddhist. It's almost like the best poem in the world is a poem not even spoken. It's like, it gets pretty weird. So you got to be careful, I think, in there. Do you think people are more afraid to say their poets than they are to say their musicians? Yeah, I think so. It's embarrassing. I mean, David Foster Wallace, I remember he was, he did that. I think he was on Charlie Rose or something, but he said the worst thing that he could ever say is, I'm a writer. And he was, to me, I think one of the greatest prose writers of all time. But he was ashamed to say it. I mean, I think exclaiming what you are is just inherently sort of bad. I don't, I don't know why that is. I think it's because maybe of jealousy of other people or something. But I mean, you have someone like Jacob Astorius, like, you know, jazz fusion bass player, he would go around and he'd tell people, I'm the greatest bass player in the world. And that insane candor, like kind of worked because people are like, what are you talking about? And then he, but he was. Yeah. And that's like, there's certain people that can say that, but like, you go around saying what you are, like, I mean, I don't know what you say you are to people. What do you say you are to people? Do you have like a, like a thing, like a little line of what you say you are? I wonder. It changes all the time. Like sometimes I'll say podcaster. Sometimes I'll say comedian. My wife says I should say comedian. I like saying podcaster because if you say comedian, then people are like, what kind of comedy do you do? And then the next thing you know, you're just the most excruciatingly awkward conversation you've ever had in your life is you're trying to like, and simultaneously, like, you know, your imposter syndrome is fled. You're like, I don't know. I don't know. Maybe you're right. Well, I don't know. Maybe I'm not a comedian. Why would you even say that? You're probably right. And then you go, you spiral. So it's easier to be like, I'm a podcaster. Everyone's got a podcast. It was like, oh yeah, okay. You're one of those. But I feel like you cast a spell on yourself with those kinds of statements if you feel like you have to like actually live up to whatever it is you're saying you are. For longer than a few seconds at a time. Yeah. It's it. Yeah. It's that it that's actually true and scary because it is. It's sort of like some guy at a bar who's, you know, puffing up like a rooster and he says he's tough. And then some guy is going to make him prove it one day. You know, and that's that's scary because yeah, it is scary. And then someone says, you know, oh yeah, I'm a poet. And it's like, well, what if you just like, you know, you walked up and you were talking to Walt Whitman and he's like, all right, prove it. And then you read him a poem and he's like, that sucks. You know, I'm a poet. Like it's like, you can be challenged and that's what is spooky. So I think you have to, I guess if you declare yourself as something somewhere down the line, someone is going to challenge you and make you prove it. And, you know, and how to prove things that's really, you know, subjective because, you know, what even is a good poem? That's, you know, so it's a, but it's a funny thing. But I just, I don't know. I mean, a lot of people, you know, sometimes they're like, well, what do you do? And I'm just, I don't know. I'm just, I just say, I just, uh, I love my girlfriend and, and like, I really like, uh, I like, you know, Bob Dylan and I'm just, I'm trying to be happy right now. I'll just like say something like really vague or something. Cause I want to go, I'm a musician. Yeah. That's, that's insane. That sounds fucking insane. Yeah. I'm a musician. I mean, I am, but like. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you are bad news for you. You are, there's no way out now. I know. Isn't that weird? At least you're a musician. The things that we want to come the greatest curse sometimes, you know, it's funny. Well, I mean, it's just, it's all this identity stuff. It's like these days, everyone, it's especially like rampant these days, this whole identity and having to say you're this thing or that. It's a mess, you know, because you get taught that from a young age, you're supposed to identify with some goal. Don't you're like when you're in school and they start, you, they start painting a picture of like options for what your life realistically could be in every possible. Uh, tributary that your life could flow into is the most boring, seemingly boring horrible shit to the point where you just think, oh, then I'll just, I'd rather just die. Then I guess then do that because I don't want to be that, that fucking person. You know, Doug Stanhope has one. He has some of my favorite jokes of all time. One of them being instead of locked up raw. Sorry, Doug. I'm sorry. I think it's okay to do this because this joke is on albums and as old, but the joke is instead of locked up raw, you know, where they take kids to get horrified by prisoners. Like you take kids to see like someone who's been working in an office for like 20 years straight and just sit the next year. I'm not going to fuck up the joke. Google it. I'm sure it's online. But it's like that is, I think these days, especially now that there appears to be the middle class is collapsing in on itself. And it's being sort of demonstrated that, you know, that that didn't even work out anyway for a lot of people that there's more of a sense of like, okay, well, then I'm going to identify with some something more romantic and artistic. I think it's fine. By the way, I'm, I say identify with whatever you feel like, like a kid, my kid identifies with a school bus some days. He'll just say, I'm Buster. I'm a school bus. Yeah. I love it. It's like, oh, great. That's you. That's great. I'm just like, cool. I Buster. I think it's more of, it's playful if you just, you know, if we all allow ourselves to be a poet, musician, podcast or comedian, you're funny as hell, man. You might as well be a comedian. Thanks. Yeah. And that is what's, that's what's weird is, uh, well, that's what I like talking to you. And I was trying to sort of explain this. I was like, I was like, well, when I talked to Duncan, it's like, I can be like this, the guy who can make people cry with a guitar, like the nihilist, like the, the, the person who, who loves God and, and then the person who's funny. But I'm like, they don't have to exist in little pockets where I have to switch. So I wasn't like, okay, if I go on this podcast, like now I have to be funny or now I have to be like, like real weird and we have to talk about aliens and, and fucking, you know, whatever. It's like, you can just be the entire thing. And it's, uh, it is funny because yeah, when I was a kid, I remember being like eight years old and I'm like, okay, I can either be like Jimi Hendrix or a fireman. And I'm like, that's a kind of a tough fucking binary choice. Like, like, I don't really know how to do either of those really. You know, it's like, I mean, what if you were both? What if you fucking Jimi Hendrix is putting fires out with this guitar? I mean, like you can do, you can just do everything. And um, you could try. You could try. I mean, this is the pirate tradition. Mm hmm. Have you heard this? This is like the American, America has its roots in piracy and pirates had to be good at everything. They weren't just some monolithic thing. They had, you had to be a statesman and you had to know how to sail a boat and you had to know how to cook and you had to know how to be a doctor and you had to know how to fight. And like, so, so that's like the roots of America are in that in piracy, you know, for better or for worse and pirates knew how to do a lot of stuff. And so, yeah. And it seems like that, that way of living, that was the people in the planes and the settlers and the, you know, you weren't just a poet. You were a farmer. You were, you know, I mean, you were, you, you know how to build a cabin and you know, you know, you knew how to do these things to survive. And over time, I guess we sort of got taught, you've got to learn one thing only. And then that ended up with a lot of human bonsai trees out there. Yeah. You know, that's very true. I know it's strange. You, um, well, what do they say? Like, you know, jack of all trades, master of none. I mean, there's all this sort of, you know, diatribe about that sort of being a negative, right? Like you are just kind of, you know, meandering around and good at all this stuff. But we like to have like, you know, mass like masters like Malcolm Gladwell, 10,000 hours. Like, you know, Mike Tyson is just a fucking boxer, but it's like Mike Tyson might be able to make a really beautiful steak. Like probably, you know, it's like, and I think that's, that's kind of, I don't know. I mean, I, I definitely struggle with that in my life lately is sort of almost like a morning. I almost mourn my life because I've just devoted it to one thing and because I can't drive a car. I don't, I don't have a license. You know what I mean? I don't fucking really my ideas expired. Yeah. I don't know how to drive. I mean, all I can do and I always tell people, I'm like, I'm like, I can't really probably do anything. I'm like, but I can sit down and write a really good song right now. And like, a lot of people can't do that. But all this other stuff that not simple stuff, but just, you know, other like kind of stuff that's societally the norm kind of escapes me. So I think that that's like a danger that if I were to go around to like high schools or something, you know what I mean? And like, tell the kids about the danger of being a creative, I would be like, make sure that you don't just focus on that because you'll end up a fucking weirdo. And you can only do the one thing and you'll be like a pariah and you better hope some girl loves you and that you could drive a car. I could drive a car really good, but not legally. That's the point. You know what I mean? I don't have. Yeah. But you just didn't go. Yeah. You don't want to go to the DMV. I'll never go there, dude. I'd rather die. That's what it is. Yeah. You're right. You would rather die is a temple of darkness and you don't want to go there and engage in the dark rituals of that. Fuck in place. Friends, I'm sorry. I'm going to be overly effusive with our sponsor today. So forgive me for being super excited about something like this. Much thanks to plunge for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH. If you're someone like me, then you've probably gotten a little bit into cold plunging, which is when you put your body in the coldest water you could possibly find. It's one of my favorite things when you go to a hotel and they've got a cold plunge to just dip down in that thing. It makes you feel so good when you get out. When you're in there, your mind goes crazy, which I kind of like because it's hilarious to listen to my thoughts telling me that I'm probably going to die from sitting in a pool of water. Because it's so cold, but then you kind of relax and then it's weirdly nice and then you get out and you get in a hot shower. If you're lucky, you got a hot tub, you jump in that thing and I call that the cycle of paradise. Anyway, I've been wanting a cold plunge for a long time and I had no idea how to do it. I've tried ice baths and I've even thought about getting a freezer and using that is like a cold dip, but it's such a pain in the ass to do that. Anyway, when plunge reached out to me to check to see if I would advertise, I told them I would trade for one of their plunges. And they agreed and they sent me this incredible thing that is now hanging out at my friend's place because they have a hot tub and a swimming pool and a never ending stream of guests. So I've been able to not just test this beautiful, beautiful device myself, but many, many, many people have been testing it and everyone loves it. This thing is awesome. You can use it for outdoor or indoor use. My friends have it next to their hot tub, which I would highly recommend. You can put it in your house. You can put it outside wherever you want to put it. It's safe for inside and outside. There's a lot of cool things about it. It's got filters, so you're going to get really cold, clean water whenever you want it. It's got amazing filtration and here's one of the coolest things about it. It's got swirling water. So you feel like you're in a creek in the forest in the Garden of Eden on some paradise planet. If you have felt the call of Wim Hof or you have been wondering how to go about getting something around you that is keeping water incredibly cold for you to cold plunge in, go no further than plunge. It's the top of the line. Check them out. It's awesome and it makes you feel so good. Go to thecoldplunge.com. That's thecoldplunge.com and use code DTFH to get $111 off of your brand new cold plunge. Again, that's thecoldplunge.com. Use code DTFH for $111 off. Please one of you, 10 of you, as many of you are interested in this, buy one of these things because they rolled the dice and sent me one of these things to trade for an advertisement. So I would feel devastated if that didn't work. You know that I'm not going to get all enthusiastic over something that sucks. It's awesome. That's thecoldplunge.com. Use offer code DTFH for $111 off. Thank you, cold plunge. It is. I'm telling you. Let it sound as crazy as it sounds. It's a secret religion. It's a religion of bureaucracy. If you go in those places, the energy is no different than any other ritual chamber. You've got priests. They all wear outfits. They're giving you permission to drive a car, giving you magic paper that says you can, you know, and look, is there a more dilapidated oppressive energy than that of a DMV? I mean, I'm sure there are other offices and areas like that, but my God, it's like you walk into one of those places, you feel like they've got a Nosferatu buried somewhere. You're right with the Nosferatu. It's like, because when you talk about Nosferatu and vampires and King and all these authors, it's like that stale air. It's like, I noticed when I go and do a DMV, I'm like, I'm like, what kind of fucking air is in here? It's like, I feel like the air, it's like they're not feeding air into the building. They're like kind of lightly pulling air out of you. It's like weird. And like, when I go and do a DMV, I'm like, I have about 30 minutes before I'm going to pass out. You know what I mean? Like, what the fuck? No, it scares me. And then when you go up to the person, you can say like the simplest thing to the person. And they don't know what you're talking about. You're like, oh, I want to try to do this. And they're like, what, what do you mean? And I'm like, well, I'm here for the, they're like, I don't know. It's like, what the fuck? And you're like, I'm about to faint because like the air in here feels like a fucking like, like King Tutts fucking tomb. It's like, and everyone that's in there is like staring. Like they look like they're like lamenting every problem they've ever done in like everything. And there's like, and then there's always like a kid just running around. Whose kid is that dude? Nobody's like Satan's kid. It's a fuck. I don't like it dude. No. Yeah, the kid. We should have done the podcast part of the manifestation of the place. The kid was born in the DMV dude. He was born there. You should record a song in a DMV and just see if you can capture it. Cause you know, when like, I noticed when I go into DMVs, like my body tries to do, it tries to fall asleep. Like suddenly I'll be more exhausted than I've ever been in my life. It's like a method to try to just escape. Cause it's like, you know, it's a, it's like the tip of this iceberg connected to so many horrible layers of government control and sort of, you know, relinquish power. And, you know, the people who were working there, it's not like they want to be there, you know, and so, and you, and just a general feeling, just a sense of like, there must be a better way to do a society than make these places incremental initiatory chambers if you want to proceed with a normal life. Right. You know, it's like, what? Yeah. Paint the, you could paint the fucking walls, put a mural up, play some nice music, do that thing they do at hotels where they like spray eucalyptus in the air. Like, why does it have to be some austere fuckhole? Okay. And so to me, the reason it's like that is the same reason a temple is a, it feels like you're inside some cosmic flower. It's because the DMV and that bureaucratic organization is some form of secret religion. And the feeling that you have is the feeling of whatever the fucking God is behind the whole thing. You know, God, DMV probably stands for like demonic malicious vision, dude. I think, yeah. And it's like the wall color is like a paint. You could never buy that. You couldn't go to Home Depot and buy that paint. Like, what is that color dude? It's the weirdest color. It's like, it's like gray, brown, white. It's like, it's no, it's just like this, the weirdest color you've ever seen. It's just like the color of like, of loss, dude. It's like, like when you die, like, Yes. But the last color you see is the wall, the wall color DMV. It's just the DMV wall. Oh my God. You just fall into that for eternity. Oh my God. You just spiral into that forever. Yeah. Yeah. You die. You're like, well, I'm trying to get my license for all time. That's it. I, that's, I hopefully that's not what happens. No, I'm all creeped out. I mean, I think it's, I think it, I think that, I think that's one of the possibilities is it's like, you, because, you know, it's like, you have some kind of like, and the people there have been imbued with this imaginary power. It's like, you know, the whole, the whole situation right now around the planet seems to be one in which like people are beginning to realize and maybe not for the better how much of a game, so much of the way that we run the show is and, and, and, and, and it sounds great. I mean, it is a fun thing. It's like the kind of, you know, when you're on LSD and you're looking at the, at money and you're realizing that, oh, it's just pay, it's just paper. It's like completely just, it's nothing. And then you're looking at like road signs and you're looking at traffic lights and you're looking at the whole entire hypnotic pulsation of society. And you have that moment of realizing like this, there, there's a billion other ways we could have run this, this thing than this. And, you know, and I think that people are collectively waking up to that and you would think that'd be a good thing, but I think it's blowing people's fuses. I think so too. And the thing that alarms me a bit, well, not it doesn't alarm me, but I feel like that everyone's kind of coming to this collective realization without the use of psychedelics. So how it's like, I mean, yeah, like, is there, are they putting something in the water? You know what I mean? I'm not trying to get like super weird, but like, why is everyone sort of kind of being like, oh, weird, like everyone I know that was like straight laced. Like two years ago, now that they're just like, yeah, man, this is probably a simulation like, I think like God lives in my closet and like, you know, my dead mom's like lives in like the bowels of my shower and like, I think maybe I'm God and like, it's cool. I'm ready to die. And I'm like, I'm like, aren't you at the bank? Like, what the fuck are you doing? Like, it's like, I think everyone's fucking going crazy, but I mean, I remember the last time that I did acid, when you're talking about how cartoonish and ridiculous and banal, I'll do that just to join you in solidarity. Banal. Banal, dude. That's the name of this podcast. Banal podcast is that. Banal sex. Sex. I only do banal, dude. Is that. I was standing outside a soda machine on acid, just like laughing at it. I was like, I put this in there and then you give me a soda. It was the funniest fucking thing to me. And like, that's not funny, but it really is though. It's like, I put in a piece of paper and then a little can of like fizzy sugar drink comes out, my hand grabs it, me, this like highly developed fucking primate and I sip it down and I get a little rush and I'm happy and I walk away. For some reason, I was like, there's nothing funnier than that. And that doesn't make sense to people probably ever, but I think you could understand why that's hilarious. Yeah. Well, you know, it's just, you get this, you realize like all the things on top of things on top of things on top of things that you have to believe and remember to make a soda machine work for you. And then also preference, you know, like you got to have, you're going to have some natural preference towards whatever the particular swill is that they're putting out into these machines. So when you, when you, when like you start realizing like there's all of these levels that have to be, you know, believed in for, for, for this shit to work and, and, and people are just starting to like, you know, we're like whatever, we're just starting to think like, well, you look at politicians, I mean, it's the most obvious trite thing to say. But you look at most politicians and you realize like, oh, that's, you know, that's just somebody playing a game. Like they're making money, doing a job. But do they really like, are their hearts like bleeding for America? Do they really like wake up in the morning and say the pledge and think of the glory of our country, even though that's what they say in their speeches, probably not, probably not maybe a few of them, but more than likely most of them are like, we're, we're in it for the money and the power. And so, and then you look at like the same is true for the police and the same is true for all the bureaucratic systems, you know, more than likely that the mythology of some noble government servant is just a myth, it's not real. They're just people who've got a job that they kind of don't like and they don't really believe in it that much. And at this point, we're starting not believe in them that much. And now we're getting to that awkward moment in any kind of like PDSM and any kind of like thing where you've been doing like, like weird authoritarian role play where it's like, you know, I, yeah, I think I'm gonna, I'm gonna have the country need to say, we're like, panel, panel, panel, we're done. Sorry, panel, panel, we're done. You can take the suits off, we're done, panel, you can take off the Supreme Court robes. We're gonna, we're gonna do a new one now. We're gonna come up with another role play. We're gonna do it again. We're gonna remember it's just a role play. That's what, well, that's the fucking difference is, is the self realization that it is a role play. And I think that that that's what would make it make more sense because I think we're starting to realize that it is one. But if we could be like, hey, this one's weird, banal, I'm done, that hurts. Stop it. Let's do a new one and all be self aware that this is just a thing. And we're going, okay, we're just like on this planet. We kind of don't really know what to do. Like we just want to have sex and probably like eat meat and like maybe some broccoli, sleep seven hours, you know, maybe, you know, read, play guitar, like whatever, just like, you know, just pleasures and, and, you know, sort of be creatives. But like, let's, let's rebuild it and let's, but let's be aware that this is just a thing we've all agreed upon. We need some kind of structure so there's not complete chaos and anarchy, right? But like, if we're all in the same bed, because we could be like, hey, Brad, like, you know, you're six, four, you know, you probably have a big dick. Like you can run this part of silver making LA. Like we like you. Like you can do that. We'll let you do it, Brad. Yeah. And like, and Brad, you should probably put on this weird giant cowboy hat because that makes me, it makes you look more assertive. And then we all like bow down to Brad when he rides his Vespa down the street or whatever the fuck he does. But if we, you know, if we were self aware, I don't want to bow to Brad. I don't either. You know what the thing is, if Brad comes into power, me and you, we're going to fight him, but it's fucking him. Fuck. Take him. Everyone, everyone named Brad. Fuck his Vespa. Dude, we need to steal his Vespa. Cowboy Brad on his fucking Vespa, fucking authoritarian Brad with his big dick and fucking cool cowboy hat. Fuck you, Brad. We're taking over, Brad. No, we're throwing Brad. No, I'm just imagining that there's a guy, because your podcast has a lot of listeners, there's a guy named Brad with a big dick and a cowboy hat. And he's just like, Oh man, I like, I really like Duncan Shrestle. And he's like, why are you attacking me, dude? I don't mean you, Brad. We're talking about a different Brad. We're talking about the Brad that's an amalgam of all corrupt power structures. They got some unlikely fucking, I don't know, vested authority. Now he's exploiting it in our fantasy, riding around in his Vespa. I love these Vespas that are like a tank or a military jeep. Oh God. Well, no, the Vespas, it's so much funnier. My dear loves, when you go swimming out into the internet, it's like somebody jumping into a hyper dimensional river infested with technological parasitic voyeuristic creatures. It's dangerous. You, yeah, we all like porn, but maybe some of you don't necessarily want 6,000 people from various weird apartments and underground bases all around the planet watching you watch porn. Everything's going on in the world. We've got increased surveillance everywhere and they use our devices to track our location movements and in many countries, even your internet activity.

To me, this is the problem. What happened? So you get these bubbles that pop up, you know, and like, for example, you get the branch dividends and this is a little bubble. And in that bubble, the authority, the role play with the rest of the world is stopped. And then they start doing a micro role play. And the micro role play is, you know, my name's not Vernon. It's David Koresh named after King David and another character in the Bible called Koresh. I'm opening up all these seals. I'm going to fuck your wives and get them pregnant. And we're just, we're going to get a bunch of guns. And because I am, he called himself like the, God, I was just watching this documentary. He called himself like the dirty messiah or some creepy name for himself. But basically like he ends, you do that long enough and the tanks come. The helicopters come because like the dominant authoritarian bureaucratic paradigm will not tolerate anything inside of it that is truly antithetical, you know, meaning like, you know, they're not paying taxes. They're not paying attention to gun laws. They're not paying attention to, you know, like age of consent laws. They're not paying attention. They're just doing their own thing out there. They're getting high and like, you know, God knows what. And so it just doesn't work. And boom, they just get smashed every single fucking time. You end up in a room with the gun to your head. The role play gets creepy. Exactly. Yeah, if you, if you want to fucking do that, you're not Jesus, you can't do that. I mean, it'd be fucking cool, man. It'd be rad, like wear some weird clothes, whatever. But it's like, if you got a bunch of fucking 17 year old like Manson looking chicks on your ranch and you're, it's like you end up like, hold up with the fucking gun to your head because choppers and you're gonna have to fucking kill yourself. I mean, that's the only way to get out. Like you're going to go out in the gunfight that every time that happens or the, I think the best cult death probably was like the source family, like Yohawa. He fucking got so high on mushrooms that he thought he could hang glide and he fucking hang glided had no idea how to do it and then, and then just crashed and died. So for me, if I start a cult before the choppers come, I'm just going to hang glide. I think that's, that's what you should do. But, but you're completely right. I mean, you just have a plan to hang glide to your death. Exactly. You have to have some sort of cool, like romantic escape route because, because all these cats, they all, I swear they all start in like, like the Hollywood Hills and they're like, we need more room for like the people. And then they go to like Hawaii or like somewhere fucked up. And then it's like, there's no toilets. It all gets fucked. And then all of a sudden here comes the brigade, dude. Like you guys are getting taken down. It happens every time. And I think, yeah, part of the thing is I think that these guys that run this shit, they're almost looking for that finality. Like they like that ending. That's part of the story. They're probably like, they're coming for us. Like it's probably part of the part of the romance. Because I don't think that they ever in their mind thought that this is going to go on forever. We're going to start a new society. They know, dude. It's almost like a slow play suicide. Yeah. Yeah. That's a good way to put it. Or some kind of progressive, like some horrible progressive form of like being a sociopath that just inevitably leads to you doing like suicide by the, you know, the ATF or whatever. Or, but here's the other thing that can happen. This is the other crazy thing. This is what's crazy about the United States is, and maybe this is why they storm in and get you. Because like, if you can walk the line long enough, you can fucking run for president. You know? And then, and then you, and if you can do just the act of running for president exposes you to so many people, but then once you get in there, and you know what I mean? Like, and start like actually like running the show and you have all of the like illusionary bullshit that goes along with like, you know, anyone who's born in any country has been conditioned to believe that the leaders of that country have some special quality that, you know, which is what gives them the right to have all the power they have. I mean, it's just, it's bullshit. It's not true. They're just like us. They're like everywhere. Everyone's like everyone else, but you born into a country where you learn that. And so if someone manages to, if like a cult leader manages to use the system itself to get into like high positions of power, then holy fuck, then you got a real problem because now they're the ones in charge of the helicopters, you know? And, and that's where that's what I think is like an interesting possibility for you, for, you know, any, any country. It happened with Scientology. I mean, they took over, they were like actively like getting into government positions and stuff. Because they wanted to take over the government. What did you fucking? I mean, Scientology basically was a, there was a cult called the children that spawned off Scientology. The children spawned to son of Sam, the son of Sam murderer was not one man. It was a bunch of no way. And yeah. And Charles Manson fucking used to check out original Scientology. Check it out. It's the weirdest thing. It's all, it all goes back, all goes back to Hubbard. Hubbard did a thing. He was in San Francisco. It's all LSD government. All the, like all of the fucking like allegedly, allegedly, you know what I mean? All the major serial killers were a part of this worldwide cult and they're all doing fucking LSD. They're all fucking worshiping the devil. It's probably, I wouldn't say it was like, you know, Masonic. I mean, but, but, you know, some serious stuff that they that they follow. And it's weird where it is like Manson went to Hubbard really early on kind of before it was, it was Scientology. And then there was another cult that spawned off called the children. And then that spawned off from the son of Sam. So they're saying the son of Sam murderer, he was just like, yeah, I mean, I, I was there, but I didn't do it. And like it was like tons of people were doing the murders and like, and it was all fucking. It's like, you know about that shit? Like, like Joe, like on the Joe Rogan, he was talking about that, like, there was a thing in San Francisco, they were fucking doing like LSD research and giving it to Manson. So he was giving it to his people. It's almost like a, you know, MK ultra shit. It's all fucked up. It's weird. So it's, it's very spooky to think about that stuff. And for me, I dig it. And I'm like, I don't mind. I mean, if you guys want to play around, it's kind of weird. I don't know why you're doing it, but the real question is why are you doing it? That's what creeps me out. Cause I mean, it doesn't bother me. I'm not like morally conflicted. I'm like, yeah, far out, whatever. Like you want to give some hippies some LSD and there's some murders. I mean, it's like life is insane. That can happen. But why? Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Well, that's the, that's the quote. That's where, yeah, it gets weird. Cause you have this, there's like one of, like it fits into our, like one of the ideas I like to think about is just the concept of like law itself. And, you know, it's at some point, like there's the front stage, which is what we're in, where you have to adhere to the law. You have to. And here comes the law. But in the backstage, there's the, I know, but yeah, someone near here is like, always getting into trouble. I think it's like a constant stream of cop cars near my studio. But the, the, uh, the backstage, you know, the back backstage, you know, which has been called the deep state long before that became associated with Q and Trump and got, you know, all the great conspiracy theories that got besmeared by that shit. But like the idea is like somewhere the laws don't exist anymore. It's just people who are, you know, privileged beyond privilege, not just like the elite, but people who've managed to become heads of organizations. And those people are the ones who say, yeah, well, see, we're going to go murder the, the messiah dude, even though it's illegal to murder people, we're going to do it because well, that's our, we do that. We're allowed to murder and we're allowed to take your money. We're allowed to like confiscate all your shit if you have the wrong thing in your house. And we're allowed to, you know, we're allowed to do anything we want because we run the show. And, but the problem is they've gotten better, better, better at hiding. So you don't really know, you know, who it is or where they are. That is where, and then when they start, you know, dripping LSD from behind that weird invisible MK ultra wall into society. And then it starts having all these bizarre effects. Yeah. You just got to ask yourself like how intentional was this that I don't think it was intentional. I think they just thought they had some kind of awesome truth serum. And then it, you know, it got into the hands of artists and, you know, transform the world. But, you know, if you're going to put out, if like you're going to, you know, send LSD out into the world, you can only expect that you're going to get some mansons. Yeah. Well, the one, the one thing that I would say is that they probably wouldn't want to, I mean, my only defense against my argument of saying, well, why is everyone waking up right now? It's like, if they were to give everybody LSD, they would know that then we would see them. You know what I mean? Like we would, we would break down all the shit and we would see them. So their, their intention for giving everybody LSD would not, it just, we'd all get too, too fucking smart. We would, we would know what they were up to. It's almost like they probably want to do what they're doing. Like if you get caught with a little bit of it, like you go to jail for like 90 years or some shit. So I think that they keep it pretty close to the vest. Five year mandatory minimum. Jesus, that doesn't start. But they're starting to legalize. I mean, everything's getting, everything's getting legalized. That's the crazy thing. And, and, and so, you know, I don't know, but I don't, don't you think phones are a psychedelic? Have you ever kicked around that idea? Oh yeah, dude. I mean, it's funny, like sometimes I'll look at my phone and I'll think it's been like 10 minutes and it's been like two hours. I'm like, this thing like sucks you in and just fucking like hypnotizes you. And it's like, it is psychedelic. Actually, it's funny you say that. I think that you might be kind of psychic because last night, I was driving home from an open mic with my girlfriend Maxine and I was looking at my phone and I was like, I was like, how the fuck does this thing work? I was like, how can I do this? How can I call someone? I'm like, because all of the fucking stuff that made this phone came from the earth. I'm like, how, how? And she was just like, I don't like to think about that kind of stuff. And I was like, yeah, me neither. And I just looked out the window. You know what I mean? But it's like, so yeah, that thing is, is like so scary, dude. It's so fucking scary. I don't even, I don't know what is. Yeah. It's weird. It's the weirdest thing ever. And I can't, it's like, I can like, you know, figure out okay, like, okay, I see like a little, the little chips in the back of the phone and like the wires and the, but I'm like, you made the chip. What the fuck is that chip? So if you pull that little green chip out of the back of your iPhone, you can't FaceTime in Japan. You put it back in, you can. What is that chip? What's it made out of? Green plastic and little wires. What is, what even is that? It can really get funny. And it, and possibly maybe I'm just like, not, you know, not that intelligent with like technology, but let's all be honest, man. I mean, I think, I think there's a lot of wood and rocks and water on this earth. So who made that? Let's be real. Like, you know, I think we just don't look at these things. Oh yeah. We're just happy to have them. That's something I read. Oh yeah. We don't think about too much more. I mean, it is the, you know, a wonderful, simple thing to point out, which is like, you know, it's not, these things aren't normal. Like they didn't exist that long ago. They're completely new to the planet. They are a fusion of insane technologies and philosophies and you know, the techniques of psychological manipulation developed by people over the last several hundred years mixed in with like, it's all of the insane, like just basic optic technology and the fucking things. I mean, it's, it's, it's just a reservoir of human, like cutting edge human advancement. And we fucking just, we love it and it makes our lives easier. But God damn it. You get like, at some point we have to start emitting that just because you're not putting it in your mouth or injecting it in your arm, doesn't mean it's not getting you high. Like it's a drug. I think that's the answer to what you know, why people are all freaked out and seemingly on acid all the time. It's because they are, it just isn't acid you put on your tongue. It's acid that is connected to microchips that are connected to such a weird array of revolutionary thinkers. You know what, when no matter what you think of Silicon Valley and like, you know, the people behind this shit, like those people are wizards and they are getting as high as a kite on this stuff. Like we're, we're completely, it's a hot, like when I'm playing a game on my phone or when I'm like looking at porn or when I'm looking at some horrible news, I'm getting high. Like it's most certainly a high, but I just don't, I think a lot of people aren't recognizing that they're blasted at that level. No, I mean, no, it is. It's like a, you're right. I actually, I think that you might have cracked the code right there. I think that it's fucking, that's the fucking high. That's the new acid. That's why everyone's like waking up or like, whoa, what's going on? Because if I even think about this morning, it was like, yeah, I was like on Instagram and like some guy was like, there's just like on the explore page making a really great sandwich. You know, and I was like, man, you know, I'm hungry, like beautiful sandwich. And I was like, well, I cruised over and then I was like, you know, and then I looked at pornographer just for a second, you know, because my girlfriend left the room and she was going to go and I just like, so it's like, I saw a sandwich. I saw a girl have sex and then you texted me and I was like, cool. Like, and my dopamine was just like fucking through the roof. I was like, yeah, I'm doing the podcast, porno sandwiches. Like just like, I was just like fucking joking shit into my fucking brain and I wasn't even aware of it. And dude, I didn't even wipe the sleep out of my eyes yet, but I was already like just so pumped full of fucking shit. It's like, all I was doing is holding that little thing. It's like, God, dude, I was, I'm, I feel safer with a sheet of acid than an iPhone, to be honest with you, man. It's crazy, man. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you're going to be more interesting with a sheet of acid. That's for sure. And, and you know, I think one of the, sometimes people like on Instagram will send me a message and be like, I'm tripping right now. And I'll always write back, turn your phone off. Don't do that. It's like you're playing the worst kind of the worst slot machine on earth, you know, because like, you don't know who's about to text you. You know, when you're, when you're high, turn it off. You want to hear the fucking worst thing is my buddy. I mean, I won't say his name, but my buddy the other night, he was doing cocaine and he had on an iPhone watch that's checked his heart rate. And he kept saying he had to go to the hospital because he kept looking at his thing. His heart rate was going up. And I was like, why are you wearing that? You do a line and you look and check. I'm like, is this torture? Are you torturing yourself? Like, imagine that. I'm like, take the fucking watch off. What kind of experiment are you doing? Exactly. That's what I said to him. I was like, is this a experiment? Why are you doing that? There's like Guantanamo Bay, dude. Like, what the fuck? I can't believe he even did that. But it was, it was just, what's the difference between you and a rat? Like you're doing a, yeah. No, he was. He's like, yeah, he's a self-proclaimed fucking rat, dude. I can't believe it. So yeah, I think sometimes I mean, like the rats who push the lever and get the cocaine. That's all I meant. I don't know. I don't think your friends are for doing cocaine. You know what I mean? The rats in the experiment where they get the cocaine. Well, they go, they keep hitting it. They want it. I know. That's what's weird. The rat keeps returning to get the coke. For sure. I've definitely read about that and I thought it was hilarious. And I sort of want to own a rat that's always high on blow and just runs around my house. I think that'd be funny. Oh my God. Well, I mean, this is the reason we have LSD is because they gave it to mice. And originally in the mice, like we're walking backwards. And so they thought, well, this is not what we, what I'm going to use for a drug that makes mice walk backwards. Yeah. So they shelved it for a little bit. But, but you know, like, I, like, I remember reading William Burroughs, you know, kind of romanticizing it like a lot of them, a lot of them, and that you could just go to the pharmacist, get this tincture, go back to your house, put the tincture in like a, you know, beautiful, like glass and just essentially drink morphine for the winter. And that was, we, in those days, like, you know, that was when they were putting cocaine and Coca-Cola and there were opium dins that were legal because they, they, they just thought this is normal. This is, well, people should be able to do this. It's normal. I really think that's what we're going to realize in a few years is, oh my fucking god, we're all on opium. It's, it's just looks like a foam and that nothing will change because these things have become incremental, you know, they've become essential aspects of our culture. Like there's no way they're going anywhere, but I guess we'll be high forever. I don't, yeah. I mean, in a weird way, I mean, I think that the technological dope high is, you know, not as romantic and sort of morally fucked, like you, because you feel manipulated because like you're not kind of as much in control. Like you're not going and buying it and deciding. It's like you've, it's, you know, it's like that ridge against the machine line. It's like, like you decide what the deciders have told you to do. It's like, it's like, that's a high that you can't even say, no, man, I don't do drugs. They're like, yeah, yeah, you fucking do. You have no choice. Otherwise you can't call your mother. You know what I mean? So it's like, that's when it gets spooky, but I think, uh, fuck, right. You know what I mean? But I think that's so creepy. It is, right? That's how smart they are is that they made a thing that you have to have. Right. You have to have it. Otherwise you can't, you can't contact your family. You can't have a career. Like, you know what I mean? Like imagine if you had to delete your Instagram. It's like, that would fuck things up for you a little bit. And for me too, it's like, if I deleted my Spotify, Instagram, everything digital, if that all went away, I don't exist anymore. And that's the drug. Yeah. So it's like, I have no fucking choice. That's the dream. Yeah, that's the dream. God damn. I, that's the fucking nightmare, man. But I promise you, it's, it's so funny because that is not you getting in a car, going to the dope dealer's house and choosing. It's been chosen for you and you can't not. No, that's, that's the new, that's the new, that's the new throw. That's the new transcendentalism. That's what it is that you want to end. Here's how you get in. Destroy all your social media and give up the dream of whatever the fuck we're all doing. And never, and, and, and not just like give it up as like, I'm going to write piece for the New Yorker any year. Give it up. But like, give it up. Like I'm done. I'm checking out of whatever the fuck this crazy, you know, synthetic communal digital universes for the rest of my life. You won't be hearing from me again. I'm gone. Not like the shit people do on Twitter, which is to me the dumbest thing. I'm taking a break. I'm leaving Twitter for Instagram. No, they're not even a break. They're like, I'm not going to hang out here anymore. You could find me on Instagram. You know what I mean? Like I'm going uptown, you know, but I'm saying this is my suspicion. Is there already are communities that aren't just monastic communities that have been around forever, actual new communities of kids probably who are completely off their phones. I know it must be. I don't know who they are, where they are. They're not going to listen to this shit. They're, they're like, they're, they're invisible and mysterious, but I think they're out there and they have all this extra power because they aren't getting mind fucked by this stuff anymore. Don't you get that sense? Like they're out there somewhere. They must be. Hello? That's a perfect, that's a perfect tone. Sorry about that. Hold on. I'm starting recording again. That was awesome. Are you kidding? Sorry about that. That was a perfect timing. I really thought, oh my God, that's the best way to end the podcast. You're just like, fuck this. I'm out. I'm hitting the road. I'm gone. I'm gone. Yeah, that kind of was like, yeah, spiritually, grammatically, like profound. That was good. I like it. Look, I think we have covered plenty of ground here and it's a perfect time to wrap it up. But, and I, you know, can you let people know where they can find you? I mean, it's obvious. I'll put all the links to his music. I'm sure you've already listened to it, but you are such an incredible musician and we're so lucky that you're making music for us. You make anything, you work on anything? Yeah, I'm doing July 4th. I'm going in an RV that's fully fitted with the recording studio and doing like a Jack Kerouac documentary and recording Jack Kerouac's songs. And it's with the estate. And I would like you to, you know, narrate one of the poems, obviously. Oh my God, I, it's such a, I'm so excited about it. These are poems that people haven't read some of them. Like these are never before seen Kerouac poems. I would like it. I would like to send you a poem that no one's ever read. And I just want you to read it, record it, and we're going to put in a fucking vinyl. And then my, the only thing that I've been thinking about is because we're having a Rolling Stone come with us on the tour and stuff like that to do it all. But I'm like, how do we get a, I want you in the documentary. So you might just have to fucking put your iPhone up. We'll work. Are you? We're coming out that way. No, we're, yeah, but you would just have to figure out the timing. I don't know when it is. I mean, I'm going to be out there, but it's closer to, it's probably too late. It's closer to November that I'm going to be out there. But I might be out sooner than that, but we'll figure it out. There's a way to do it. Yeah. Even if you didn't talk to my phone and then we'll just toss you in the, because I just wanted to get, you know, the people that are narrating in the documentary, like you just talking about, you know, what he means to you and, and just whatever, you can, you can talk about your lunch. It doesn't matter. But I think, um, no, but I think it's exciting and it's, uh, it's surreal. This was surreal. And, um, but this is all the simulation, right? I mean, everything, you just manifest what you want to do when you do it. It's beautiful. Yeah. I mean, yeah, I think it is some, it's clearly some kind of beautiful, beautiful maddening illusion for sure. But I'm so glad we're talking and that we're friends now. I mean, it's just, it's great to have you on the, uh, uh, it's great to have you in my satanic phone. And it's really nice to be able to like just the conversations we've been having are like, are really making me happy. So thanks for coming on the show. Yeah, man. Thank you.

402^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - 338: Tait Fletcher Transcript and Discussion^2019-05-28^Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Hey! It's the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast. It's time to surrender your own fallibilities admit that you like all beans and come before you are fragile bubbles of synthians temporarily foaming on the surface of time. Tear off that stinky, malarial blindfold you call your personality and join the DTFH crew for their commute salute. It's time to die to everything you think you are so that you can smell, feel, and see color again. It's the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast! Where the fuck am I? Where the fuck am I? What are those? Those fucking weasels? What the fuck? Help! Today we're giving a free coffin to our most cynical caller. Hi, hi, hello to all the new listeners listening to this episode of the DTFH. Wherever you may be, if you're deep in the thick of the thickest thicket if you're lost in the rotating gears of a massive cuckoo clock stuck in a maze inside a maze in a box inside a wizard's laboratory or if you're somewhere back in time picking this up on a cut that fucking music. Tesla Coil, you are welcome here. This is your home. Unfold your seven layers and pull your soul out of that beautiful copper edged ornate orb you've been storing it in and allow yourself a few moments of sweet relief the terrible burdensomeness of being a cork shoved into the pleasure node of time. And now to the traffic report with Jerry, the existentialist. First I just want to say that this traffic is a catastrophe today and every day it will not get better even if there are not back to back traffic in the city people will still be in the pursuit of a life of happiness which has been given to them implanted into dream by the media which they now worship because of the death of God and religion itself. Only 101 we have a traffic jam of the divers who are apparently unaware of their own mortality and so feel perfectly fine riding in their symbols of death in a bumper to bumper traffic to get to a place they don't want to be in some pursuit of a dream implanted into them. On year 134 traffic is backed up due to a hell on collision between an Uber driver and the realization that he is not an eternal being and thus completely meaningless and only five of the police are pursuing an outsider who has rejected the morality of society and is now on the run. Thank you so much for the weather report. Damn, sounds like you got some allergies or something. Spring allergies? Right, yes I got you. Wow, today's podcast is insanely inspirational. Tate Fletcher is here with us and we're going to jump right into that. But first some quick business. I fucking love Audible and I love them even more because now they are sponsoring the DTFH. I literally could rave about Audible for the entire podcast. It's like, I don't know how to put it, it's like one of the luxuries in my life because I can listen to books while I'm riding in an Uber, for example, or doing anything that normally couldn't read books doing. Also, if you sign up, Audible members get free access to the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and Washington Post deliver daily to the Audible app. I just found that out. I had no idea. I've been a member of Audible for years. With a convenient app, members can access Audible anytime at the gym while commuting on the go and on any device. It always picks up right where they left off. Audible also offers free and easy audiobook exchanges. Didn't know that. That's cool. Credits you can roll over for a year. Didn't know that. In a library, you keep forever even if you cancel. Didn't know that. This is great. I had no idea. I've been a member for Audible for years and I had no idea that I could exchange audiobooks. That is badass. Explore all the ways listening to Audible can help improve mind, body, and soul with entertainment, information, and inspiration. You can start listening with a 30-day Audible trial and your first audiobook plus two Audible originals are free. Visit audible.com slash DTFH or text DTFH to 500-500. Yeah, this is, I love Audible. I'll tell you what I'm listening to you right now. Let me pull up Audible right now. This is what I've been, this book I'm so into and it is truly blowing my mind. Maybe I'll start posting what I'm listening to on Audible, but I don't want to do that because then you'll be like, he just regurgitates whatever he's listening to on Audible. He has no original thoughts, which is sadly somewhat true. I like to think I have an original thought here and there, but a lot of stuff right now is just coming from things I read. I'm sorry. Yeah, I'm listening right now to, hold on, let me pause that. Chogyam Trumpa's wonderful audio book, which is called Shambhala, The Sacred Path of the Warrior. And the narrator is awesome. And it's just an incredible book. And it's not just about meditation. It's about magic. And because Tibetan Buddhism is connected to shamanism. So there's a lot of like magical stuff in there. It's amazing. Pick this book out when you use our URL and definitely sign up for Audible if for some crazy reason you haven't yet, especially if you're someone who's getting that weird feeling that your soul is decaying like some rotting, browning, yellowing tooth in the mouth of a sugar addict. I don't know if you've ever seen somebody you like eat sugar and then caught a glimpse of their just fragile, decaying, crypt-like teeth that are just crumbling in front of your very eyes. This is how I sometimes feel my soul must look when I haven't been reading a lot. And a lot of us, we're super busy. We've got our hands full and we don't have time to read. So Audible is the ultimate solution because you can clean your house while listening to amazing books. So give them a shot. Please try Audible. Audible.com-DTFH or text DTFH to 500-500. That's Audible.com-DTFH or text DTFH to 500-500 and you will get a 30-day Audible trial and your first audiobook plus two Audible originals for free. That's cool. That's cool. Some of these audiobooks are like 50 bucks if you want to buy them. So I highly recommend Shogun Trump. But very quickly, I'm sorry, this is a law commercial, but I love Audible. I'm going to list a few others that you should download. The fucking Dark Tower series is read by, I think, Frank Mueller. Or am I getting confused with the guy doing the investigation? Regardless, the Dark Tower series, particularly the first three are incredible. Moby Dick. Holy shit. Amazing. They have this old Bhagavad Gita on there. I'm not sure I would necessarily recommend it as the first one you get. That's like a few credits down the line, but it's an incredible Bhagavad Gita. And of course, path to God's living the Bhagavad Gita by Ram Dass and also experiments and truth by Ram Dass on Audible is fucking incredible. PS, they also have, I'm just going to give you a list. People are always like, what? What? Give us a book list. So here we go. I'm sorry. I know this is long, but I really do love Audible. And you get a free book. This gets you actually gets you one of these books for free. So here's a few others that are glorious. Usually when I'm picking an Audible book out, I look at how long it is because the shorter ones not to ruin that you guys Audible, but the shorter ones are usually like three bucks. So there's no point if you're using your credit. Use it on something that's like super long and it's going to keep you busy for a while. The new American standard Bible. I got the whole Bible on here. Dune. Yes. 21 hours of pure ecstasy, my friends. Definitely download that. I love that one. I'm scrolling through here for some other ones that I've really supremely enjoyed. Super intelligence. Paths, dangerous strategies by Nick Bostrom. Narrated by Napoleon Ryan is really good. If it's kind of dry, but if you want to get into how, how crazy, uh, what's coming is really specifically AI. Try that. Holy shit. A short history of nearly everything by Bill Bryson. Narrated by Richard Matthews is amazing. And this one has stuck with me for years. Genghis Khan and the making of the modern world is so fucking good. If you want to find out about the insanity of the Mongol horde, try them. And then, uh, cutting through spiritual materialism by Chogyeum Trumpa is there. I could go on and on. If you're looking for likes, I'm sorry, this is like a seven minute commercial. I just love audible. It's like a big part of my life. I listen to audiobooks a lot. Living from the overflow by Michael Beckwith is really great. If you're looking for like a nice inspirational, um, visual, I don't want to call it visualization, but it's a really great book. If you're a little on the stuck side and okay, this is the last one. Uh, I'm just scanning through to find, I don't want to keep reading. I don't want to read every single one of my library here. Um, okay. Here is, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. If audible folks are listening to this and you're like, oh, here it is. I was looking for in cold blood by Truman Capote, narrated by Scott Brick. That is another great fucking audiobook. It's amazing. It's dark because it's about murder and it gets in your head and it might darken you up a little bit. So I don't know if I, if you're looking for something, a beat that's definitely not the one shit. One last one, food of the gods, the search for the original, um, I don't know something. I've always just called it food of the gods. It's fantastic. These are all in my audible library along with a shit ton of other books. So definitely, definitely give this sponsor a shot because they are worth every penny. Yeah. My darlings, we have, uh, a shop located at dugoutrustle.com. PS, if you are sick of these freaking commercials, man, sign up at patreon.com. Ford slash D T F H. You will have instant access to hour long rambles that I put up there that are very embarrassing. And I'm sure in just a few months or even now, if I go back and listen to them, I might be mortified because I don't really spend a lot of time thinking about what I'm going to say, but they're all there for you. If you want to listen to me, go on and on about this and that. Also, you'll get early access to the podcast with no commercials and there is a discord server, which I have not visited in some time because I am slammed on a thing that I might not be able to talk about for years and years and fucking years. But I love you guys and man, today's guest. I don't, I mean, this is a cheesy thing to say and I don't even know what it means. But I think this pot like he's, this guy's changed my life. He is such a sweetheart. And he always has this like up. He's got this vibe that like, it reminds me of Ram Dass or like, he's just like, he's really sweet and you get around him. You feel inspired and it's like, sometimes, you know, you get around people who are like super athletic and you feel, I don't know what the word like, like accidentally shamed or something. But this guy, man, he really makes you feel like you could do it, whatever it is you want to do. And I've known him for so long and I've watched his evolution over these years and it's just a beautiful thing to be friends with Tate. Not, not just a spiritual evolution or whatever that means, but it's like evolution is an actor. I had one of the coolest moments watching Westworld and Tate appears. He's been on zillions, millions. It's been a millions, I don't know millions, but he's been in a shit ton of action movies. And I will bet that if there is a, like if they were to remake the old predator, maybe they're already doing that. I just know we're going to start seeing him as like the next big action star and he deserves it because he is an awesome human who also is an entrepreneur who runs an incredible coffee company called Caveman Coffee that makes delicious cold brew and a lot of other stuff too. So I don't know. He's like, you can't really put him in any one box. He's just going for it, I guess is what you would say. So now please everybody rip your chest cavities open, pull your heart out behind your heart. You'll find a folded up little packet with some love dust in it. Pick that up in your bloody hands dripping with the last bits of life blood gushing from your open chest cavity and blow that splattering mess into the etheric plane. So it drifts up into the air becomes clouds of blood and rains upon Tate wherever he may be. Welcome to the DTFH, the mythical Tate Fletcher. I like that because when they're in their sense of discovery, you know. Yes, man. That's it. And that thing, you know, the weird system that's in place where every single one of us has somebody that took us under their wing and helped us. And like when you get to a certain age, you have to become that person or you're a selfish person. Or it's and it's also chaos. I think about it in a weird way. I think about that like as far as helping later on in life. And I think about older, like I kind of gauge my life in a lot of ways off of what I see people 10 years down the road doing as an example. Like if you're bouncing and you're 25, what's a 35 year old bouncer look like? Is that a life that you'd like to adopt when you see it, right? Because if you're moving your feet in those steps, you're going to end up at a similar spot, probably not dissimilar. And just looking at my life in that way, it became a really interesting tool to kind of guide and grow my life and go, oh shit, you better start moving your feet in a different way or else you're going to get this result. And I started to really look at cause and effect like that. But it's like having the right leader would be invaluable, like to have somebody be like, hey man, here's a space, create this thing. And like, I mean, with guys at the gym, we've done that as far as, you know, you go, okay, let's create a little coffee shop and then somebody can run the coffee shop and then they can learn new skills. And it's like this whole thing of life as skills acquisition, I've been kind of digging on and going, yeah, the more I can have a problem today, surmount that problem tomorrow or figure out how to wear it better. I'm a stronger person on that third day. And how do I become more and more resilient for this life or more and more useful for the community, you know? I have a theory about that that is completely probable. It's, you know, I like to add woo-woo stuff to like sweeten up reality. Do you do stars? Not stars. Like the cosmos or no? I like the Ichin better than astrology. Only because it's like in the moment, like in the now, it's showing some kind of readout. But not that the stars aren't doing that, but they're sort of, it's like the Ichin is like this based on kind of what I've been thinking about relating to what you're talking about, which is goal setting, achievement. And the, so the idea is because we can only see time as past, present, future, because the way we're set up. What would be other ways we could see time? Some kind of totality or some kind of alternate timelines. So like, you can kind of look at somebody and think, oh, okay, that every single one of us is pretty much the same. We have varying genetics and a lot of memories. We have different code or operating systems based on culture, experience, epigenetics. But the computer itself is very, very similar, which is why we have brain surgery. That is universal in the sense that if someone's going to do an operation on your brain, they don't have to say, well, what kind of brain does he have? It's a human brain. We basically know how it works. So you can look at somebody like, all right, look at all the bouncers I've seen in their 40s or whatever the thing is in their 40s. Sometimes you'll see, oh, shit, it seems like that is a tough job and it has affected them in a negative way. So I've been thinking about this idea of like, what if goal setting is actually navigation and that when you set a goal and solve a problem, you literally move into like a different onion skin universe that is similar, almost identical to the one you're in, but now is a little different. And the more you keep doing that, you begin doing a weird way ascend. And because I've noticed that the more I study one thing, music, for example, and the more I get really good, not good in the sense of like concert pianist proficient, it seems like other stuff starts changing. Everything around me kind of starts changing. The more I meditate, it seems like the more the universe itself is shifting into like a better kind of place to the point where I start thinking like, wait, is this some kind of like weird navigation? Are we like literally jumping? It's like that idea that your whole navigation in that way, like you dispel chaos completely from your world. It's a personal responsibility. It's not like the state's job. We push a lot on the state or on government or on parents or on whatever your control system is to make life better. God damn it. This is untenable or whatever the thing is instead of going, no, I need ultimate responsibility and I can dispel my own cast. Like that's a huge superpower. Yeah. I feel like it's almost one that like people, you got to you got to hear it from the underbelly of the world because those people on the top positions, they don't want people thinking in those, because you're not useful if you're thinking in those ways to corporate endeavors really because you're not a useful cog in that way. Right. If you're self-directed in that way where it's like, no, I can, you know, find my autonomy right here. Yeah. If you're, yeah, there is a, what's it called? I heard this anarchist term called being de-skilled. So it's, you know, most people have this sense of like, you know, there's certain things where you think about it and you're like, I can't do that. And I can't so, I can't so much. Isn't that the danger of like welfare state kind of thinking in that way? I feel like that's the way like we've done a lot in reservations. We rob people of their ability for pride in a way by giving them such sustenance level. It's like, don't reach any higher than that. And then folks don't. And it's easy not to. And it's easy to succumb to that almost. Is that? It's not just what it's like every level of one certain reality tunnel that a lot of people are hanging out in from welfare state to the super wealthy. There's this idea that luxury is synonymous with having other people do your shit for you. So, you know, like I was just at the last Ram Dass retreat and Bob Thurman was talking about how delightful it is to wash dishes. How it's so cool. Like you're, you're getting the experience of like hot water on your hands. The soap smells good. You're cleaning the plates. You get this weird satisfaction from it, depending on where you're at. It's a great way to show someone you love them because you're like, no, I'll do the dishes. Also, depending on where you're at, it's a good way to get the fuck away from whatever's happening and be by yourself. But, but he was saying, you know, people take their dishes, shove them in the dishwasher, throw chemicals in there, turn the noisy thing on and completely lose the experience of washing dishes. But that's considered to be luxurious or that's like, I remember in my younger days, I'd go to someone's house and I'm like, fuck, they've got a. If you're in a wealthier person's house, they'd had different appliances than you got. That's right. Yeah. And so, so like similarly, there's like all kinds of things that people imagine. Well, I, there's just no way I could do that. Like some people don't even know about turning their fuses back on. Some people don't know. Like if they're toilet. You set your garbage disposal or something like that, right? That exact exact, I had that exact experience and where the garbage disposal clogged, my wife and I were like, well, we're going to call. Let's call the landlord and get a plumber or something. I'm like, wait, hold on, maybe. I didn't mean it in a condescending way. It just dawned on me like, wait, hold on, wait, there's maybe. And then Google found the thing about resetting your garbage disposal, went under it, garbage disposal reset. And it was like, whoa, I'm like Tim, I'm a hero for like six minutes, you know, it's cool. But these, but our go to is as someone else to do it. Right. And that is robbing you of these wonderful dopamine hits, serotonin hits, right? Like you're, if you get someone else to do the job for you that you could do. You've also become more able. Yeah. Like I was just having, before I came here, I met with one of my guys that we meet once a week and and he was, you know, he was going over all the stuff that he wants to do for himself. It's like, I want to, you know, I want to be bigger. A lot of these guys are like, I want to be bigger. I want bigger arms or whatever you can relate. Sure. And, and, and I go, well, do you want to be, how big is big enough? Like that's a huge, if that's a real thing and I'm to take this seriously, then let's be able to measure this. And, and I said, and what end is in that? Are we more useful for that? Or are we just assuaging our ego, which is okay. That's, but like it's important to know what we're doing and what the cost is. And if the cost is, is some years in time, if I could do something functional, like I could learn to wrestle or I could learn how to build houses and create my fitness that way. Or I could learn how to rock climb or something else. You'd also have this, you know, you put four years of intention into that, man, you'd be a motherfucker with a skill set at the end of it. Or you're just another dude with pretty moose and the right outfit on doing arm curls at the gym with these, this arm number that you're chasing. Right. So I'm looking, I always look at like that kind of thing. And I go, how do I get most the most juice for the action that I'm doing? Cause I'm generally lazy. I don't want to. I'd rather not is my, is the voice and my critic, you know. And so then I'm always like, well, like, I'm going to do this. Let's layer upon it so many things so that I have much more aptitude and usefulness in the coming selves that I'm going to manifest. Like, and I started thinking because I was thinking in my past, I was like, why do I eat? I'm not doing my future self any favors by behaving this way in this moment, whether it's eating something bad or, you know, hooking up with an ex-girlfriend or whatever the thing is. And then I started thinking really proactively about it. It's like, how do I make myself more suitable for the community by doing actions today that are going to layer on good experience so that I'm useful later? And that, and that's my highest place where I try to be. That is a struggle to stay there all the, but it's like, that's what I try to look towards, you know, like a white house. Because that's the, you can, it's weird how lifting weights can transform and denialism in this weird way where you're like, what, you're in some sort of weird, like existentialist predicament, like Sisyphus, where, you know, you're doing this absurd, repetitive task. And you do start thinking like, wait, what, what is this here? And within that, you can hit this very strange, absurdist place. I imagine, I mean, I've, the one time I did go to a trainer and started getting in shape. I didn't feel, I hadn't gotten to the absurdist point yet, just because I was like, holy shit, my body can get in shape. And there was this rush and realizing, oh shit, my body's changing. But I love what you're saying because it's moving it to a level beyond that of selfishness, which is the moment you have a reason to do something that isn't based on you. And is connected to everyone else, your community, your family. Then there's this, I don't know how to put it, but this fire, there's a fire in that that just doesn't exist. And like, I'm going to get muscles because I'm horny. Right. And I think girls like muscles. That's a very low level yet. It gets you in the game. It's like, I get it, but yeah. But maybe there's better uses of utility that we could get towards, right? Like that's, I think the thing is like every kid wants to have money and everything or a title or whatever. You know, working with like a lot of 20 year olds, it's like, it's like that. But, but you don't merit the position and you couldn't shoulder the burden. It's like a lot of that time is spent, you've got to sharpen your sword and you've got to go ahead and build yourself. This whole thing of self development, you know, and it's really interesting because right now people, people without the consequences, people without the consequence of like horrific drug addiction or cancer or something like that are now going, no, I'm interested in self development just cause I'd like to get. I'm not running from some horrific, you know, monster that's coming to get me, but I would just like to be better and more developed. And it's like, that's, I think the Ram Dassas that we get. It's like people are looking into that more and going, I'd like to get higher than this low vibration that we're all kind of living at too. Right. And that, and what's cool though is that in the Bhagavad Gita, when like Krishna is talking about the different type of people who end up like being drawn to God, whatever you want to call the transcendent. He says, the seekers of gold. And I remember a long time I read them and I'm like, what the fuck that's that doesn't seem like sacred or, but I think what that means is, everyone comes in to this specific temple of whatever you want to call it, awakening, self improvement, becoming a kinder person for different reasons. And because we are monkeys to some degree, most of the time those reasons are self interested. You know, it's like you get in there and you're like, but you don't come to the temple already. You don't come to the gym in shape. Right. People don't come to the gym ripped. You know, they come to the, at some point you don't come to the guitar to learn to play. Yet we want to pay off for having endeavored. Like I've tried and I want, it's like, you're going to have to stick with it and you're going to have to sit in pain and frustration for a while before you get the pay off. And then in that sitting in pain and frustration, something else starts happening. And that's what to me is so cool of having known you for so long is every time I run into you, you have become more in shape, but kinder. You know, every time I run into you seem a little sweeter. And it's like, and so to see those two things happening and then to hear your explanation for it, that you're, you know, it's, it all makes sense. Cause the moment you do shift over from like, all right, I'm going to get in shape for me. I'm going to get in shape to get the job, get the girl, get the respect. The moment it kind of shifts over to like shit. If I get in shape, then people who are out of shape, who knew me when I was out of shape are going to see that as possible. And then also, you know, other things for me, like, you know, I had a, I had to quit drinking. I had a baby. I had to quit drinking. Congratulations. Thank you. But quitting drinking before never worked, I couldn't attach myself to it because I really didn't give a fuck. I was like, what are you doing this for kind of? Yeah, what's, you know, are you just, you're like, there's what's what the dog's going to like, the dog's going to look at me weird or something. Cause the dog knows I've been drinking three beers every night. What have you been gaining from it? What have you been noticing that like, has there been a heightened clarity or what, what are the biggest differences that you're noticing? I wake up and feel normal. You know, and I, when, and it's, you know, my friend, Karen Kilgariff was saying on my podcast, she said, she's a murder girl. Yeah. Dude. She's the coolest ever. Dude, that pot. My favorite murder is amazing. Oh, I know. Like they're, they're like, they're goddesses. I've never heard their names before. And then I'm like, and now in two years, these girls, I mean, I am so impressed. They deserve every little bit of it too, man. They're so talented and the show is so good. Everyone loves it. So good. But she was saying, you know, when you don't drink, you know what's going to happen that night. You know what I mean? There's not some weird mystery about like, oh, am I going to like, am I going to be a dick or like it's something. It used to be. I love that too. It's like, I used to love that chaos that it bring. I'm like, I'm in chaos. Anyway, fuck it. Let's spin the bottle. Let's take some acid, get a fifth of Jack Daniels and fucking load up the pistols. You know, and it becomes like, yeah. And if they come home empty and we don't remember why it doesn't matter, it was exciting. We're going to go to jail or we're going to become gods. Let's do this. Yeah, that's right. And that's not healthy for a whole society. That's why we have armies. Those people at that age, they need to be somewhere. Well, yeah, man. Yeah. Yeah. And but it's, you know, it's all, it's alcohol is just such a nightmare for society itself. But like, yeah, so you, what happens at some point is you begin to realize that your selfishness is beginning to manifest shit beyond just a weird morning where you're like, oh man, that was dumb. Not have just been drinking. You're more aware of the cost. Yeah. And when you have a family, you can see the impact, you know? Like my dad struggled with alcoholism and, you know, just something clicked. I'm like, I'm not going to, my son is going to have to deal with the neurotic dad because I am, but he's not going to deal with, oh, how many beers did dad have tonight? Oh, is dad hungover? Or is dad making excuses due to his drink or tiptoe around dad because he's got a headache. He's been, or there's all of that stuff. I have to deal with a grown-ass adult that's supposed to take care of me that's denying the responsibilities to the truth of the world. That is it. Annie Lamont says something beautiful about growing up in those families. Did you go up in that kind of family? You are taught to not see the truth because if you see the truth, then, and speak it, then the person who's denying what's happening to their lives will get so mad at you because they do not want to deal with the fact that they're the ones who are throwing the Molotov cocktails into every corner of their family. And also, they can't understand. The alcoholic cannot see that their life is different than another life. The true and the false become interchangeable. They can't tell the difference of where the one begins and the other ends. And so it's almost like you're talking to a crazy person because they won't accept the truth as you're seeing it because they just can't comprehend it that way. I think about it often like when you're talking about crawling to the temple too for the seekers of gold. And I look at that and like what that could mean, you know? And because for a lot of people, they'll settle it silver also, you know? And there's those things, those offerings, right? That we get along the road. Would a little bit of copper take you off the road while you're seeking truth? Oh, how about some ladies? Would they take you off while you're seeking truth? Is your attraction really to the truth or the trappings of truth? What is it that you're after? And that's a really interesting conversation, you know? Am I after a result or am I after experience? Do I want to lay your experience upon myself or do I need a result? This is one of the people I study meditation with, he calls it sand traps. And it's like there's so many of them out there and everyone gets in them. Like there's no way to not get in them because you're like you're going to... If you start improving yourself. The obstacles will start to shoot up from everywhere. Inside yourself and your family everywhere. Everywhere. And then when you get over the obstacles, so to speak, or the first level of them, then all of a sudden you do have to deal with the fact that like now you have... You have to deal with the fact that now you're beginning to realize like, shit, I didn't have more clarity than I've ever had in my life. And then because you have a little more clarity, when you see earlier versions of you and other people who are still kind of like, you know, whatever the thing is, fuzzy or whatever, now there's an unfortunate power dynamic that emerges, which is if you're unscrupulous and you realize like, oh shit, this is a fuzzy person, you can like, this is... Somewhere in here, you start entering into like potential disaster, which is that you can become a guru, God forbid. And then, you know, and then that happens prematurely. So suddenly this is where we start running into people who begin to like, because they're magnetic, because what is more magnetic than a disciplined person? A baby and a disciplined person. You're not going to run into anything more magnetic than that. It's just something in people's DNA. It draws people. It's like, holy shit. Oh my God. And then, so that's a sand trap. And then of course all the other stuff that goes along with it too, which is probably somehow coinciding with your discipline, you start making a little bit more money, you start getting a little more success, and then it's like, oh shit, now I have access to that room, that room, that room, that room that I never had access to. You get, it's like someone starts giving you different passes to the incarnational festival of your life. And it's like, you are just a regular pass. Oh shit, here's another pass. Now you can kind of get into like the VIP sections. And then the next thing, you know, oh, here's the artist pass. We're going to get you backstage. And then it's like, wait, there's another pass. What? Oh yeah, there's a backstage to the backstage. Right. And every single one of those places has within it the ability to get completely. And the producer's pass. And all, and so there's all these different games in life, right? Like there's, I'm going to play the fatherhood game right now. And then I'm going to play the work game sometimes. And I'm going to play the sobriety game. And I'm going to play the hockey game. And there's all these, you know, different kinds of things that we can endeavor. And I think in the searching, like in all those different rooms, you know, so you talked about my discipline, my discipline, my practice brought me to the party. And now the party's unfolding. And say, I could never get into the fucking party because I didn't have any discipline. I'm just sloppy. Nobody's inviting me to the party. I get this discipline and practice. Now I'm being taken into these places. And so that very discipline and practice erodes, right? So the thing that took me to the party, I turned my back on because I'm like, now I'm at the party. And all I ever thought while I was in the grind was that all we need to do is get to the party and then things are going to be OK at the party. And then you find out, you're like, I hope I didn't degrade my practice too much because I fucking need that to breathe. And the party is superfluous. This is just lights. This is a distraction. And so it's like that thing about like my sobriety gets so good that it takes me away from the things that I need to do to maintain my sobriety, right? And so that therein is another trick. All of that stuff, you just got to, I think that practice is you just keep digging. You just have to keep digging and know that there's not an end. Well, that's so funny you said that. So that's on the wall there. That was one of the Dalai Lama's teachers. And I was watching, I got obsessed with him for a little bit, but somebody asked him, what's the difference between enlightenment and money? And he said, money ends. Enlightenment, it never ends. And what he meant is, you know, like money, you can run out of money, but enlightenment or awakening, it's not like suddenly you're like, oh, I'm there. It's like, it keeps... It's a resonance. You can maybe carry a resonance that you hope that you don't distort and fall out of enlightenment, right? Which is the threat all the time. The thing is, you can't fall out of enlightenment because every single person has, within them, this is like one of the things Bob Thurman said that blew my fucking mind. Joy, happiness, pleasure. These are considered mini-enlightenment. So like, whatever you're in a moment of like, whoa, that little thing, that's it. It's already in you. So you can't get away from it. So you parse up enlightenment into the specificity that comprises and that's beautiful. It's pretty cool, right? So then you realize you can't really escape from it. So that moment, basically the way it works is there's inevitably that moment where you're like, oh, shit. Oh, shit. I got so distracted by that thing that I forgot about the main practice. I forgot about my practice. That moment when you're like, oh, wait. Oh, shit. I was meditating. I was working out. I was eating, right? I was sober. So you first get interested in like self-reflection and awareness because you started this and when we're talking, you're like, you know, we all have basically the same operating system. When we come out and we have these brains and they get overlaid with information and all that. And as if it's a, you know, not software, but like this is the hard complex that we're born from that we have as an operating system, right? Yes. However, you can control how aware you'd like to be, right? By putting your interest and curiosity towards things. And not everybody does that. Right. And so in that way, we're very disadvantaged if we don't. And what was it that prompted you? I mean, so my thing is, are we all different people in a way? Why are some people so interested in looking at themselves and overcoming themselves and like, God damn it, please. I'm dying to get myself out of my own way type of thing. And I'll take all the responsibility. I'll do all the things. I'll do what? Yeah. That want to raise their awareness versus people are like, things are pretty good, man. And I just went to Chipotle and just played baseball and I'm going home to watch a family guy. Everything's great. Yeah. You know, I'm interested in what pushes people into seeking more or satiation. It's the biggest question. Because I've never had satiation ever. It's like if you were a cell, we could reframe your question to, hey, why does it seem like some cells are dividing in weird ways that is causing like some pretty severe malignancies all over the organism. And some cells just want to divide in a way that allows the organism to be the most healthy. And it's this like ignorance is what it is. Because if the idea is that everybody just wants to be happy, everybody wants to connect with their highest self. Everybody wants to feel love and everybody wants to just feel at peace. And I think that's mostly true outside of like some people who are, I think, sick. I mean, when I say like people are like, no, no, no, not everyone wants that. You can't apply some universal to humans. Everyone's different. There's like teen angst. There's stuff that you go, yeah, there's stages you go through and you get out of it though. And at the core, everybody would like to be useful and loved and what etc. I think you could sum it up like if you're looking at like in general, there's always outliers. If I had a bowl of diarrhea, fresh, hot diarrhea. I'm not talking about you. You're an outlier. No, okay. You can see the weary. But if I took this diarrhea and I went to 100 people and said, Hey, would you like a spoonful of this diarrhea or would you like some ice cream? I'm going to. My hypothesis is that 100% ice cream over diarrhea, 100%. And so this is because no one wants to eat shit. And a lot of people, they don't realize that they're eating shit. It's the good thing. It's because it's all they've ever, they were born and into a bowl of diarrhea. It's like if everybody beats you up in your house, you think that Johnny's getting beaten up to next door. You're like, this is how houses are. That's it. And it's like, it's like that Monty Python, the Holy Grail, that sketch where the got the prisoners in the dungeon. I don't know if you remember this. And he spits in the other guy's face. He's like, Oh, spit in your face. He must really like you. You know how lucky you are to get spit. It's like that where it's like people, the thing they're doing that to others might seem deplorable or so obviously. A microaggression. Yeah. Micro, all of it. It's just they, they're like, that's literally the best they could do. Right. Because they haven't seen that like, look, time is bigger than the five minutes surrounding you. And the events aren't that big a deal. Yes. And also all my heartbreaks, all my failures, all that stuff. It's like, none of that shit was real. That was all, that was all a manifestation of my mind. I would be the architect of a disaster in the future that would never occur. Right. This is going to be the end of it. And it's like, that was one of the big things is like, none of that stuff is true. Keep walking forward. Don't lose your fucking goal. You know, I mean, I just, those are the things that were distractions. I remember throwing a guy and fucking twisting and my knee went bam and the whole gym stopped. And I just, by the time we hit the ground, we're in motion. I thought everything is over. This fight's over. Everything is over right now. And like that, that shit wasn't true or, oh, this business deal is going to happen with caveman or something like that. And this is, this is going to be easy street. And it's like, no, man, it's the same as all my spiritual practices. Duncan, as it comes down to like, what, just keep turning the knob to the, and you can only turn the knob so far every day. There's only, there's a limit in what you can do. So you just go turn the knob every day. Don't leave a day without the knob not being turned, but go in there and just turn the knobs every day and fucking, and stay true to the thing that you're doing. And that's been the biggest lesson for me. A guy asked me last weekend and he goes, what do you do? What would be advice you would give your younger self, right? And I just thought, I thought about it for a while. I thought, well, here's some cheat codes, right? I'll know the Lotto ticket by the time you're 19 or whatever. But I just thought, what would I say? I would say something to lessen the hardship of my life. That wouldn't be doing me any favors right now because those hardships are what grew character. They were, they're what grew resiliency. Like and perspective, right? Like through that, like through me being abused ever or oppressed ever or lifted up ever, I know about those experiences. And then I can relate to, and I can go, ooh, they have it worse. And I have this nuance of discernment, which most people don't have. They look at judgment. They say, don't judge. And they go from there. They don't look any deeper into how useful judgment is, how we need that. We need this heightened sense of discernment. And so I look at that and I think, what would I tell a younger self? And I think I would just say to try harder and to don't be scared to start sooner. Like I used to think, well, at a certain place you're not an adult until a certain thing or you wouldn't be available to do. It's like, no, do all the fucking things and jump in, man. Cover yourself in experience, you know, drowning in experience, man. Because you can't, you like, yeah, I love what you're saying, man. Like my son, it's like, well, this boy is so beautiful and I love him so much that now when I think about the time machine idea, it's like, fuck that. I'm not doing anything. I wouldn't alter this. I'm not going back. I'm not going back to tell myself when I'm playing World of Warcraft not to put the fucking computer on my fucking lap that you're going to maybe get testicular cancer. Because anything that I change at all could potentially make it. So this being didn't come into the universe. That is the most amazing being I ever saw in my life. And so this is the, when, but when you're in, but now that doesn't have to be a baby. Right. It could be a, it's your business. It's your friendship. It's your community. It's where you're at. But when you're in the turbulent area before you get some manifestation of good karma, then it can seem as though everything's falling apart because you don't realize, oh no, you're getting sculpted right now. You're not getting destroyed. Something's breaking and chipping and like you're, you're the one who's like having to deal with the fact that as long as you've got that particular chip in your rudder, so to speak, your fucking boat's going to go in circles. And until you just admit it's not the ocean. It's not anybody else in any other boat. It's not the wind. Even though maybe that's part of it. First change the fucking rudder. You have a chip in your rudder. You have your rudders warped. So your boat is like always going to like to the 180 degrees is turning. It's, you're going in circles, 360 degrees. So that, that like first that, and then that starts. And then, but it's just by shifting over from victim to sculpture, you know, realizing, you know, you're not a victim. You're being sculpted. You're being taught. You signed up for this. Is this thing taking from me or is it making me stronger? That's a good question to ask. It's important to know that. Yeah. Am I becoming anti-fragile as like Nasim talks about, like, whereas like when I, when I take the tumble down the steps, am I not only unbroken, that wouldn't be anti-fragile, but am I stronger for the experience? Yeah, man. Right. And that's what life is built to make us. That's the right way. Yeah. But we shrink from that because that's the opposite of comfort, which we're kind of pushed in, I think through advertisements and corporatocracy really to seek comfort everywhere. And that is the same as seeking disaster for a life. Dude, you will never hear coming out of the TV on some public station. You're never going to hear like Sean Hannity or you're never going to hear like a reporter or the commercial say, you need water. You need a lot of water and outside the sun. And, and, and, you know, just try to try not to eat so much sugar. Right. And, you know, you're, if you do that long enough, you're going to feel so good. Bye. Nobody wants to hear that. Or like, go break yourself. Yeah. Yeah. You know, I mean, I'm, I'm walking with Harrison, right? Harrison's my friend. He just died, I don't know, a couple of months ago, 94 years old, beautiful dude. But I would go and I would take him out and I was like, well, fuck, we can be fitter than we are. And so we would go and we would squat and we'd move. I'd make him start on the floor and I would make him, I would go, okay. And I taught him a six simple step movement of how to roll to your side, draw your knees up, roll over onto all fours, get elevated. You grab a chair stand. I'm like, yeah. And we would go through a thing. Cause I go, you're going to fall down and nobody's going to be there, bro. And then we would go for walks with the dog park and there'd be little hill upright. And he would start, I mean, and he's here, 130 pound, 94 year old man start to like, this could be it right now. I could be carrying back a corpse and we pushed into that like that, but he, he would push into his own death that way and he would walk back after we would do whatever activity and he would be upright and he would be more alive. He would be more a man as opposed to this withering decay. And it just fortified him. And I thought, yeah, you push into your fucking death a little bit every day so you can push death off and say, maybe tomorrow, you know, and he did that for all those years until he's 94, like a G man. I didn't meet him until he was like 91. So I don't know him for a long time, but I know the kind of heart that that guy, I mean, coming out of World War II, coming out of Detroit in the twenties, like the whole, I mean, it's an amazing, amazing story, but it just shows me more and more throughout time. It's like, you build resiliency, man. You go in and take in the horrific thing, learn to get comfortable where other people say no, then you're useful, man, because other people won't, they won't work that hard. But that's also, you know, that's freedom. And that's freedom. Exactly. That's true freedom. Right. Because it's like, you know, people, people could have, we all, most of us, many of us have so much autonomy in the sense that you can like get up, you can leave where you're at, you can walk through the streets, I count on opening the faucet and the water comes out. I count, I count on the waters provided to me. All that. Autonom. That's, but, but a lot of people don't realize that they're not free at all. And the reason is, is because they have so many conditions that have to be met before they allow themselves to be happy. They need hot water in the shower. That's one man. They've got to have instantaneous access to water that's been heated before they're like happy. And by them, I mean, me, I've been like in a hotel where the, where I had a show and the like water wasn't getting hot. And I'm like, what the fuck, what the fuck, this is bullshit. What kind of. I've got a lot riding on this. Yeah. The history of the world up until I don't know when hot water became instantaneously accessible to most, to at least people in the West, but the history of the world is you had to find a river or a well. And it wasn't going to be warm. And if you wanted to heat it up, it's going to take a little bit of time and fire. You got to start a fire. There's all this shit. And so it's like, I'll just take a cold shower and you just did it. So, so that one, the moment you get to that point where you can look at the shower faucet and you could, you could, well, you could look and you turn the shower to ice cold, which I do. And I watch myself go from, okay, this is going to be it till like, you know what, maybe not today. You know what I mean? I'm like, okay. And you look at your hand and you've pushed through and then you're like, fuck it. Oh, it's so great. So great. And you know what else is great? You go deeper and you go, you know what, I'm just here facing this goddamn cold water torrent. I'm going to lift my arms up over my head and I'm going to get under my armpits and all that skin and your ribca, and it's like, that's colder than cold. And just to really give yourself to that, your asshole, I've been doing heat and cold therapy with this girl, Kimmy Moss, who works, she worked out a Laird's place and Laird Hamilton and they do a lot of that kind of stuff, but like 220 degrees sauna for 20 minutes and then like a 34 degree ice bath for three minutes. And then back and forth and woo, you got to come with me someday. I would love to. It's so fantastic. Let's do that. Okay. My experiments in just cold water and a lot of breath work. She'll teach us a lot of breath work on the beginning too. But can it kill you? Like cold water is there's no, everything life is going to kill us, but out of, but is there we're going to go there to live Duncan, I know to live, but this is my question for you because this really has crossed my mind. And I know it's bullshit, but I just want my mom's 72. She did it with me last week. I don't mean you're sought your hell sauna that I'm going to go to. I'm talking about, or heaven's sauna, I'm talking about my, this is how neurotic I am. My mind will tell me prior to turning the water all the way to ice cold. Yes. You could have a heart attack from this. You could. No. 100%. From cold water. I think when I go for a dog, I'm getting a cancer tumor in my back. I mean, the pussy inside of you is so strong, it will scream all kinds of lies to you about how this is going to be. No one's died from a cold shower. I don't know. I'm sure you can find a metric, right? There's outliers everywhere. Who knows? I'm going to get in there like a G and I'm going to come out stronger on the other side of it. And if it kills me, God bless them. God bless them for being able to kill me for all the efforts I put to that end. Or you're going to die. I guess the way to look at it is this. Okay, sure. You look into it and you go, I hope I die and then fucking dig in Duncan. God damn it. I mean, I don't want my son to grow up with his mom being like your father was so weak. If you rather think that my son, my, my father, he, he's so shrunk from life when it, when it encountered him that he's still safe and here with us. Or my father went out and fucking raged against life and he showed me how to stand up straight until the very day he died. I love that. Except he's four months. Maybe there's more. And honestly, like if so, like, I want, when someone's like, Hey, how did your dad pass? Yes. If you have to pick, I want to be like, Oh yeah, he was hiking, a bear came out and he basically like gotten this fucking. He killed the first bear. The second one he couldn't handle though, he's just diminished by that point. The secondary managed to gouge his eyes out, but he wasn't able to, he couldn't, he, he died in the, in the hospital. You mean the bear killed him. He's like, no, he died from over fucking because he fucked that bear so long. But what I'm saying is the thing I don't want my son to say is like, Oh yeah, my dad, he took a cold shower and it stopped his heart. We got to get you more resilient. If we're in danger of that right now, we're going to, we got to turn up the volume a little bit because I don't want that to happen either. But how interesting is it take that all of these things for, for example, we, this is nothing to be proud of, but we only have one car and I'm not getting my own car because I ride my bike to work and I love riding my bike to work. And when I ride my bike. What about in the wintertime though, Duncan? In LA. Oh, you're joking. Cold, kill me, one drop of cold water and I'm down. I understand. But isn't it interesting that all of the things that are not comfortable at first, not only do they help you physically, like if you start climbing, you're going to get in shape. If you start riding your bike to work, you're going to lose weight. If you stop drinking, you're going to lose weight. If you started taking cold showers, you're going to feel your immune system is going to get better. But also all these activities simultaneously help the planet. Right. If you stop driving, isn't that, there's a seems to be the way it happens, our biosphere on the inner, the outer biosphere is encouraged also. Yes. Isn't that weird? Like comfort is not only potentially like this. We're adaptable. Right. We're the most, I mean, maybe such rats or roaches or something where we're the biology with the most adaptation or to any organism alive. Yeah. Like we, we are, we are that walking evolution, living transformative evolution. So in that, I'm so arrogant also and self centered that I think that on a planet that varies a hundred degrees on any given day, anywhere geographically that I should be comfortable all the time. Right. Yes. We put, we put golf courses in the desert. Yeah. And then we cry about that. There's a drought there. Yeah. But what the fuck's going on Arizona? Yeah. Like what, why you got all the golf courses then? Cause I'm confused now. And so when, when, when looking at like all those kinds of things about like, here's what it is, my, my idea in my life and what I see to be helpful is that the more I push adaptation in my life, uh, whether it's muscle growth, spiritual growth, intellectual growth, like whatever, the more I push into adaptation of into unknown from what is known, the better off I am as an organism. Yes. And that's the same. You're talking about with cold water. The more I become accustomed to these things that are outside of my, I can adapt and I can overcome and achieve. And in that I get resilient and strength. We're all looking for like, I heard if you drink a gallon of water, it'll kill you. Well, like let's guzzle a gallon of water and let's see. I mean, because that sounds ridiculous, you know, and so like to push into those hard edges and, and to find that adaptation, it just makes me, you know, less fragile, which makes me more useful and more available for my people around me and less distracted about shit that doesn't matter. It's like, no, a bug bite is not going to kill you. Let's keep going. We got to get to water or whatever. More free. It's more free. It's real free. You are the happier you become. That's the other thing, Duncan, is the happiness I used to think all the time was a fucking thing. They're just happy. I had no idea how hard people worked for happiness. Yeah. I just had no idea. I was just so, I just thought less about it. Yeah. People fight for happiness. When you're, it's hard. It's like, if you take someone, I mean, just think how miserable, how easy it is to be miserable when you're sitting in the middle seat in the back of a plane and, you know, someone's shoulders are your. From New York to California. Yeah. You're getting blown with farts. 250 pounds. And two inches. You don't have farts in you to battle back. That's the worst. You can't do that. I don't mind if somebody farts, but if I got no farts in me. So you're compressed in this situation, but if you suddenly, all you need to do, it's so, you add six inches of leg room, two inches on the side, and suddenly it's the best flight of your life. So every time you, you realize like, wait, I don't need hot water to enjoy a shower. That's a permanent shift in your life. You are no longer compressed by that need because the need is painful. That's the main thing is like, for me, anytime I've. The need takes me out of the experience is what I heard is that it takes me out and I have pain because I'm looking to seek my comfort. When I take the conversation out about seeking comfort, like, cause it can change five degrees and I'm seeking a new comfort. If I take that chasing the comfort out of the conversation, now I'm here for the experience. It doesn't matter if the temperature varies a few degrees or if it drizzles. I'm here in the experience. I'm not trying to run from the, from, from my lack of comfort. My idea of comfort has changed. I, you're at this point, you're like, if you can get in an, in, in your Uber or you can get in your friend's car and they start playing some kind of music that drives you fucking up the wall and instead of being driven up the wall, you could just enjoy that music too. Free. That's freedom. Freedom is not being like, can you change that? Dude, I can't believe you're not paying back in black, dude. What the fuck's wrong with ACDC, bro? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. When you're hanging out with your, with your girl, we're hanging out with your boyfriend and they want to watch something and you don't want to watch it, but. It's so nice cause right now I literally don't care. I don't care where we eat or what we watch. If I'm with you, my goal is being with you. You know, it's like that. Yes. I get that from you, man. That to me is like the, what's one of the things that's so magnetic about you is like, you are such a yes person. It is amazing. It's amazing. And, and, and like, you don't just get to be a, you don't get to be that and I don't mean yes person is, and you just, I mean, yes, in the sense of like, you are not in a constant struggle trying to arrange the phenomena around you to suit what you think you need because you seem to have figured out a way to, to, to enjoy yourself most of the time. Now I don't know what you're like when you get home. I don't know what you, like what we all have the shadowy glitches for a while. I thought, well, if the external is not right, then I'm not right. And I thought, what a slave and a prisoner I am in that out, in that outlook. Right. And so then I thought, well, okay, so Tate, like the first time a guy told me, hey, look up the word serenity, you know, and, and, and I'm reading this book, search for serenity. I carry a 45 everywhere I go. And he's like, do you see that the, the problem here, Tate, you're looking for serenity and you're scared of everything so that you're armed. Like this is an insanity that you live in, right? And at that point I started looking at it and I go, just because there's chaos amongst, amidst my life, all, all, does that change the internal balance? And so how do I get my internal balance right so that I'm not, you know, tipped this way or that way by external pressures? And like that, that was one of the things that I, because I, because it is, it's like being a prisoner. And I just like, I just, it was the same with cigarettes for me. I'm like, I just don't want to be a slave to this thing. I don't want to be a prisoner. I'm not available when I'm a prisoner. And if I'm to fucking live, which I didn't want to live in, sometimes I still don't fucking I, sir, if I'm to live, I don't want to live as a fucking prisoner, man. I want to live as a free, expressed human because to not be expressed gives me cancer. And so like, what, what can I do to make sure that I hold the standard for myself like that? Because nobody else will. People will look to give you, to seek comfort everywhere. You have to kind of, you're in a war against society. And maybe even those parts don't, they're just in a natural, they're just sale. They're in a salesman's shit position. Yeah. Just trying to sell you comfort, bro. I don't mean nothing bad by it. But to me, it's almost like the Nazis are coming over the hill and I got to gun them down. It's like when I see salesmen like that, because I'm like, I don't want your comfort. Your comfort is fucking cancerous for me. And so I want to be very careful. Like, you know, it's like this dude told me a long time ago, he says, you can do whatever you want in life, Tate, as long as you pay the price. You got to be willing to pay the price and you better know what the fucking cost is. Because even if it looks awesome, there's a cost to that. Oh, did you fall in love and it's great? Good. The cost could be all your friends. The cost could be you going after your dream job and going, well, no, this is nice too like this. And I'll start. And so it becomes a real question like that. You know, I mean, in my partners in caveman, Lacey and Keith is the same that like we go through those questions. It's like, we've all chosen to lead our lives in certain ways and it's like, it changes relationships and the ideas of when you're going to start a family or any of those things because it's like, we have bigger fish to fry right now that we need to get after. And that could cost the whole thing that we've been trying to build right now. And so like, even though it's a beautiful thing, like, and not that that's a thing that's in the works or something. You're telling me that caveman coffee employees are not allowed to fall in love. Right. You can't fall in love. You can't have goodness in your life. How do you measure that? What do you have? Like, you have some kind of satanic meter when they come in. It's just a crystal on a string and you just, and the way it moves, you got to, you'd have to be trained. Guilty of love, guilty of love. Too many good times. No, but you know, it's like, to what I, what I allowed to distract me, I can't have everything. I can't be a greedy kid that's just like, I want that, I want that, I want that. Some of those things that I want cost the other thing. Now fucking tell me which one's more important. Which one do you have to take? Which one must you take care of? Because the other thing is, is I didn't want to create noise in the system and I see people do that with, I mean, fuck, they do it with kids for God's sakes, let alone whatever else they make. And it's like, What do you mean noise in the system? In the system, like, ah, did you, you created a coffee company or you created something and then it just went into dust and nothing ever came of it or you create, you created a podcast that you just say and it doesn't really go anywhere and you don't really care if it affects people in a positive way or, you know, it's like, did you write a beautiful piece of graffiti on the wall that like is real art that people can go fucking, they're kind of transformed by seeing that or did you just scribble your name and fucking cross out somebody else's like a dickhead? It's like, that's noise, that's art. It looks like writing on the wall, but it's different, right? I got you. And I think that it's like, you know, are you just here to create noise in the system? Because what is that? That's attention seeking. And that's really what, you know, I mean, you hear guys like Gary Vee who's got a lot of great things to say and he's like, content, content, content, push it out there, get it out there. If you're fucking 19, please don't do that. If you're 26, don't do that. Get some experiences before you push the content content out because you'll be embarrassed about what you did and who you're making yourself to be by pretending that these things are important. Yeah. You're going to go ahead and alter your character in a way that could disease your future self. It's fucking dangerous to have all this voice and not merit the fucking opinion. It's dangerous. My Freddie teaches me how to teach and says it's like, you don't want to start taking withdrawals. You don't want to start taking loans from your future self. Don't start borrowing from your future self. It's a bad practice to get it to, and that's how karma, you know, that's basically what happens when shitty things are happening to you that are definitely your fault. And you really look at like when karma is reaching its fruition. So suddenly you're like dealing with the fact that whatever, you know, you're like the doctor and I'm not, you know, I don't want to. Is karma not the end state of cause and effect? Is it not the effect part or in that system or is it outside of that system? It gets broken down to the most mind. It's gets broken down in the most like, um, what's the granular way? So it's like, there's different sorts of karma, right? So there's karma. Yeah. First of all, the number one thing is like, you cannot stop generating karma. Number one. So it's like in the same way that if you're, there's no retirement, there's no way to stop ripples in the water. If you're swimming, you can't swim without ripples. You might be able to like make it so that there's a way you swim where you're barely affected, but you, no matter what, you're going to make some kind of ripples. You any, any movement you make, anything you do, you're impacting the universe around you, no matter how little that move, even if you stop moving, you're going to impact the universe probably more than if you do move it because people are like, he's catatonic. What the fuck? Now we've got to like get him in a hospital. You're like, so basically karma is, works like there's the shit happening in the present moment to you right now. Like so because, um, uh, because I must have done something right in my interactions with you. I get to have you in my life and I get to have you sitting in front of me inspiring me and having this great conversation. So here is karma happening, which is like, I have a person I look up to who's my friend that I can like model things that I want to improve in my own self. I can model that by looking at you in the same way you looked at the bouncer. So that's karma happening. And then the place we're in that we can't talk about, unfortunately, because of NDAs. Similarly, I get to be here because, because of karma and also, you know, similarly, uh, my feet hurt because I didn't get orthopedics over the course of a long time. You know, I should, I have like flat feet or like, I got, I'm overweight, you know, I'm always at like six to eight pounds over. Thank you brother. And ride my bike with you. But still I'm always, I'm not, you know, I'm not, I'm not being myself, of course, but this is the effect of what your previous life has done. It brought me with this present just, you can look down at your body and like, you know, that's caught, you know, you know, I know what I was doing. I know I went through a period when my wife was pregnant, where I was buying these fucking ice cream sandwiches. That's what you should do. That's the right move. Drinking booze, you know, and like, it's not a myth. So that's, that's, that's, but also there's others, there's other karmas. So there's this like the things that are kind of like the meteorite that's far away from the subjective planet you are that's on a direct collision course with you. That's karma that's coming. So that's rising karma, right? And everyone, unfortunately, has that too. Is it soon? Well, it varies. It could be like that. Well that, so at that point, you become the alchemist, because the moment you start turning your meteorites into pull-up bars, so to speak, the moment your apocalypse has become gyms. Ooh, that's a great way to say that. Yeah. Yeah. Then, then now you've like become like something else than a, you're not a victim anymore because now it's more like. Now you're a god, you're in creation. Your universe has gone from being a minefield to being the most sophisticated advanced training facility in the known universe. You could almost say that you've been invited into a kind of. That's fucking beautiful. God training simulator and you're getting a chance to like. That's what it is. Is it not that? Is that not what we're doing? It's, yeah. I mean, this is one of the descriptions is it's a university. God, it's beautiful. That's neat, man. Thank you. Well, thank you. Well, because you think it's like we have the term universe. Yeah. And then you have university. We're in it. We're in it. Yeah. Earth school. Earth school. Yeah. And then in the moment that shift happens, I think you enter into a different dimension because for me, one thought experiment I like to do because when it rains, I take an Uber when I'm being fucking lazy, I take an Uber instead of riding my bike. But I liked when I take the Uber to do a thought experiment where I think the Uber driver is the Buddha. And I'm lucky enough that on this day, the Uber driver is coming to teach me as the Buddha pretending to be an Uber driver and sure as shit, man, when I just by that switch, man, I've had Uber drivers teach me like show me like music I've never heard of before. Talk to me about like Buddhism in a way I've never heard about it talked all this stuff gives me scope of the world. I can't not talk to cabbies and Uber drivers to the point where if Dardin gets in a cat, I didn't know what he was doing at first, but we spent like a few weeks in New York together and he'd start, he'd start his camera, he's fiddling and he's not a camera guy. He's not a phone guy. He starts fiddling with his phone every time we get in the cab and like second or third trip. I'm like, what are you doing? He goes, I'm just recording all these conversations you have with the cabbies because I'm just fucking I get so curious and interested and then I get to get a whole view of what Uganda is like, which I don't have any idea of, you know, and it's like these guys, they're the when you start out with where are you from, the kind of beautiful ideas when you're curious about somebody's life and those guys teach. I mean, it is like, I don't, it's not unlike the Buddha, every car I get in, it's beautiful like that. That's nice. I'm glad I'm not the only one having conversations like that. I think that is, that is the truth is they are the Buddha and then so this is when you start playing with that concept of like going from is that in how you're honoring them. So you're, you're allowing that because you're, you're, it's like when we treat people like they're highest selves, we don't allow them to act beneath themselves, right? And so in this way, we do a huge honoring when we honor somebody else's hires. It's really something I really try to be good at because I'm so shitty at like looking at somebody and going, they're doing it dog shit and that and to get that voice out of my, you know, is that this is such a nice alternative, which I need in order to supplant the more negative side. Well, and then when you add to it, that just doing that mind shift is a form of like hyper dimensional travel. I love that idea. You do that and you can say shit like hyper dimensional and I even knowing what it means just cause it sounds cool. But the moment you start like, okay, I'm literally going to enter into the Buddha field today and every single person I encounter is the Buddha and they're being so merciful to me because they have all agreed to act in these like to do the most incredible character acting of all time, which is some of them are going to act like my enemy. Some of them are going to act completely ambivalent and some of them are going to act like they love me. Some of them are going to act like my son. Some of them are going to act like my wife and they're all doing this to help raise me into awareness. And the moment you do that and you allow yourself the acting exercise of really living in that world, then suddenly magic starts happening. It's not like I'm going to pretend you're the Buddha, it's not I'm going to pretend you're awakened. I'm going to pretend you're advanced because I'm going to behave into this. It's like I'm seeing this, I know who you are. You are the Buddha, you're the Christ, you have come and you've incarnated around me in the form of a society and I'm sorry I'm a slow learner. Teach me please, please allow me to bow to you even though the bowing or my show of respect to you is going to be convoluted by my own neurosis and ego shit and I'm not able to fully bow to you because I still feel like I have a little superior in this way or that way. Once you start doing that, whoa man, the world, it's almost like for a second you will be in Shambhala. Well, it's like you ask people to step out of the material world. I've been pression enough to do something like that. It's an invitation into a spiritual realm where there's higher stakes that feel like ease and comfort in the way that we can express them and these ways that we wouldn't express them otherwise because we're like they'll think I'm weird or whatever we put on that. I think it's a fascinating, I like those kinds of things, it's like this thing of leave everybody with a gift that I like doing, this idea about leaving them with a thank you or with the actual gift or even if it's just walking by somebody like that was a nice hat he had on. Leaving something with a positive gift even if it's just echoed inside my own chest because a lot of times the voice is that fucking guy, I wonder what he's doing and I'll have that thing where I'm suspicious or where I'm trying to think of some, what could the threat be that this person might pose to try to be devoid of all that stuff and that's one of the beautiful things. I once spoke at this thing called Summer Strong last week and it's this thing this group Sornex puts on and it's fucking like 700 invited only people that come to this thing. It's like a big barbecue, weightlifting, this and that and I was like it's such a gift to be around super strong and able people in a way. It's the same way Jiu Jitsu gives me in that way is that when you are afforded strength, when you've built strength in a mass resiliency, there's no kinder people because there's no axe to grind. There's no, I'm not trying to posture or position or this or that. We're all here in the try and we've all found it better if we're loving and kind with one another. What a fucking great way to be and there's those societies that are right here, right next to the society when you're working at wherever that is like, no, the system managers are dickhead to me and the fucking, when you're working at Best Buy or whatever the thing is, there's that reality but there's a whole nother reality in your same city that's also operating by these different rules, by this different ethos kind of right and you can walk into cultures that have been built like that and that's one of the beautiful things about strength, about gyms, about meditation areas and all of these things, all of those places where we come to get beyond ourselves, we're looking for something, let us touch the gods in some kind of way, we're not looking for dissimilar things. That's right, yeah, that's right and those places, when you start looking at those places as outflow ducts for paradise that are like, people go into those places as one thing and they come out with a little bit of perfume on them from something that people are like, what's that smell? What's going on there? And the person is maybe unaware that they've transcended it a little bit. Well yeah, usually because it doesn't happen all at once, it can happen all at once, nothing happens all at once. And God, we have this wonderful experience of time right now which is limited unfortunately or fortunately, I don't know, but we get to experience time right now so things don't happen all at once, but when I had to reschedule the podcast with you a few times and this podcast because of this thing I'm doing and every time I did it, you're so open and so cool with it, right? And kind of just that really inspired me because I started taking that attitude and thinking like, what is that? This thing he's doing which is so sweet and so authentically giving and compassionate to my situation and I'm thinking, man, this makes me feel so good and it makes me love and more. And that's just a reflection of you, man. Well, but that's the impact that you start having on people where you like suddenly But I couldn't be that without you also. That's the impact you have on me. I mean, there's this synergy of that in that way because I couldn't like, yeah, but I also know you, your attention to discipline and all these things and like your hierarchy and what they are like, I respect you and your process to such a great degree and I've known you now, you know, for deck, you know, over decades, like we're looking at like time and and I see you, you know, so how else could I be but that in that way? That's cool, man. I mean, and this is where you end up. I think fine, you know, you end up experiencing a continuum with your friends or your life. And when you realize that that continuum is one where you look around, your friends are successful and are healthier. You realize like, oh, cool. There's some kind of ascent happening here and there's and there's something really beautiful in that. And then when you see that maybe one of your friends is something's there amiss, then there's a way to to like maybe help that help pull them into the dimension that you you're you're currently in. And that by that, I mean like the part of the multiverse where you're beginning to wake up a little bit, which you everyone is to some degree. So this is the spiritual community. This is the whatever it is that you're doing, you know, what's interesting to that I noticed and if somebody is listening like what I find, because a lot of people are looking for things, you know, we you and I are fortunate men in a thousand ways and we we don't have enough time to enumerate those things and I know you like I know that's true and that you feel that way. But in this too, I think I think about our group of of of friends in common that we have. And it's the same in groups in Jiu Jitsu or in MMA world to me or in CrossFit or in all these in different endeavors, whatever it is, writing. If you got a group of core people, you know, it's self selecting guys. And so the thing is, is to the degree that you're in the game of life, you're in the flow, well, then you're in that group. And the minute that I step out of that flow, and I go, you know what, I'd like to, I'd like to rest on my laurels, which I'd like to do a lot of the time, I'd like to sit idle. Yeah. I'm no longer in the conversation with with with with you or Rogan or Ari or Brian or anybody because I've chosen to be out of the flow. Yeah. And then I go, oh, and I'm lonely and I'm alone. And I'm the, I chose that. And so this ultimate responsibility of really fucking taking full accountability for my life is like, I choose my misery or my happiness by the kind of work in action that I'm willing to put out. And I love this phrase. This guy always would remind me, he says, you can't think your way into right action, but you can act your way into right thinking. And that kind of thing. It's like, you know, I, this is self selecting based upon my behaviors, you know, and, and so I think you can get in the stream anywhere. And if there doesn't seem to be a stream where you're at, fucking make a stream, you know, build one. Cause I, the one thing that really bums me out when I hear on the internet and I see a thing and like, I've got some friends that are the tempest free runners and these guys at tempest are the best free runners. They're the best parkour guys and trickers in the world. They're fantastic. And I posted a video of them once and somebody from my hometown is like, dude, where the fuck were guys like that when we were kids? How awesome would that have been? And instantly I'm fucking, where the fuck are you right now for the kids around you? You cocksucker. If you see this to be a valuable thing that was lacking for you and you don't try to create that for others, you're a certain type of motherfucker. You know? And so in this thing, it's like, you know, as we grow, right? I, I age out of youth, it just happens, you know, all these motherfuckers going, when are you going to grow up? Well, unfortunately it just occurs, uh, unfortunately, but then, then here you are, but like, how have you developed yourself up until that growth? And now, you know, what, what is it that people want? They, you know, connection and love and like, and, and, and it starts out as like, I want pussy or I want dick or I want, I want this sexual euphoria. I want bliss and you get all that stuff and then you're like, okay, where did, where does it all go? Or what is, what do I do with it? And, and to get more of that stuff, I want to be a better baseball player. I want to do the shop put better or be a good violinist and, and then I'll get more of the good stuff that you brings me bliss and all that kind of thing. And then as, as you get older and you're like, okay, I don't need to come 14 times a day in order to stay sane or whatever now and, and all my, my biology is, is getting calmer. Yeah. What choice is it to, to go out and drive? What is it then? If it's not this heightened, like conquering kind of energy, right? That's out there. Oh shit. I got to get my show to Netflix before this next guy does. Cause if he drops his first baby, they're not going to want one or whatever the scarcity comes in. All the evils come to the devil. The hell, hell starts to come into our lives unless what? Unless I become helpful. That's it. And so either I can become dominating and shitty to people around me and be like, yeah, you can't do it that way cause of whatever, or I can be a dude that's like, oh man, here's a way that I shave some time off of that. Or here's, I become helpful as a guidepost to somebody coming behind me because they're going to be better than me. That's how evolution works. But I can help them meet their goals in a better way and we can have synergy of time and distance and bring that temporal plane to a useful, uh, interaction between new and old. Right. And, and I, and I think maybe, maybe there's something in that that's like, maybe that's where our place is in life now a little bit. And that's why I've been more paying attention to the podcast and going, no, this is something that this is a discipline that you need to keep and that this is going to continue on because if, if nothing else, it's telling a story of hope to somebody else. And if you've fucking gone and you stood in the darkness, you got a responsibility to show people that it's way lighter on the other side, no matter how dark it is right now where you're at, that there's fucking light that's going to crack open any fucking moment and it's going to bring you an awareness that's way bigger and richer than you had previous to the darkness. And that's, and we need those stories to come back. That's it. And that, what you just said is actually how it gets described. Like, oh, one of the ways I've heard enlightenment described is like, it's literally like turning on a light, like turning on a light, you just turn on a light. There's no, it's not like the darkness is, is it, is like it as a fog or whatever. But when you turn on the light, it's like, oh, oh, this, oh shit, I could see for a second. Oh my God. Whoa. Oh, that's what that was. That thing I kept bumping into. Oh, I thought that was, oh, shit. That, that was a structure inside of me that I wasn't able to see. I thought that was in somebody else. And then you start realizing all the edges you've been banging your shins on that you thought were in something, it was you. And then somewhere in there, there's freedom. But the, what I want to go back to what you said, which is a binary. And it's is, I hate putting out like, when here's an easy solution, because there isn't an easy solution. You do have to unfortunately do repetitive things over time to experience change. Simple, but not easy. Simple, but not easy. But the simple binary is the moment you flip the switch from serving yourself to trying to help as clumsy and like unsuccessful as that attempt to help other people may be, the light turns on. That seems to be the light switch. When it's off, you're being selfish. When it's on, you're helping. It's as simple as that. And I, it seems like if this is some kind of trans dimensional university for fledgling gods, that the lesson that we're being taught or goddesses, the lesson we're being taught is don't be selfish. And the way we're being taught the lesson is the same way you teach any baby, the same way as you've got to let the baby figure out a role on their own. You can't push the, I like our son is learning how to roll and watching him. He hasn't figured out. He's got to get both his arms up and to roll. Cause otherwise the other arm, it sticks him. So it's like, you watch him and you watch how hard he's trying to be frustrating for you as a father to watch and not help. And like, you can't, you can't help. You know, and, and, and, you should have just named him struggle. Sorry, struggle, struggle, good luck, bud. But you know what I'm saying? That is pretty much a very simple predicament he's in, but one that he's got to figure out on his own or he's never going to be able to roll. And I think that as above so below, if that's the way it happens with a baby, it, that still continues now, which is that we are clearly being taught something here. And what we're being taught is if you're selfish, you're going to be in hell. And if you're selfless in the sense that you're getting out, you're, you're, you're letting yourself, a former idea of who you are, go bye-bye. It's like a blindfold comes off. It's almost like we are a freedom. Yeah, like what you've been saying, a freedom. And you, and, and, and that's, and so then now suddenly it's like you book. Yeah, you, it's your job. Then if you get your torch lit in the fucking dark cave of life, right? Cause you're born into fucking pain. I mean, we have a lot of platitudes about a universal spirit and soul. And that's a God shield around the world. And all of us are connected in that way and infinity. And for sure, that's all true. For sure, that's true, but also it's a war. And those same souls are trying to eat and leech you and because they're at a different place in earth school and at the beginning grades, man, shit's fucking rough and it's ugly. And that's one reason you got to become resilient and strong because there's a lot of fucking wolves out there that'll rip you apart. And, and as we're torn asunder, we're screaming, God, just take me. I'd rather be dead. And then we don't fucking die and we learn to be strong. And this is our life. You don't die. And so then we're in this cave and we've got this torch. And fucking the thing is, is like, now, how do I let other people light off of my torch and your torch has to be there and it has to be non-judgmental and allow anybody to light off of it? Yeah. Because the things I hate about you or about whomever isn't you. It's the things that you're hiding from me. You act in ways that are funny, that are on you, not you. And then I see that as bullshit. And like, why is he acting shady? And we get all these differences when really the truth is that we are as we started similar, similar to a degree that it's hard to comprehend even, you know, I mean, I've done things with, with groups of people before that are these submersive kind of experiences where you become telepathic almost. I mean, you can, and people talk about that. And I mean, I've heard of guys in wingsuits doing that, becoming telepathic. Like we're flying in wingsuits one behind one behind the third, behind the fourth. And as the first is making the turn, if you started turning, when you saw him turn, you're turning too late and you're going to be into the building, you know. And, and so there's this, this unified thought that has to happen for this synergy of four different people to work as they're turning the corner on a building, you know, and, and in that same way, I believe that we have that capacity. But it's kind of like, when I think about God, I think about like electricity. And I think a hundred years ago, I shine a flashlight at you. You burned me at the stake. Like that seems crazy, right? You know, but maybe God's like that. Now, when we understand God more, we'll get a clearer picture of that. When we understand telepathy more in our own souls and how we are connected and so dissimilar, maybe we get to communicate in a more loving, useful way. If we get to higher realms, if you will, or something, people think that, you know, everyone's like, well, you know, when the monkeys came out of the trees and started evolving and it's like, yeah, you know, it had to happen. An alien came and fucked a monkey. Well, before the alien came, the monkey had to get out of the fucking tree. Yeah, it's like the monkey had to do. There were monkeys who had to go to get out of the tree and some of the monkeys died because the snakes are down there. And that's what they had to do it for us to be these kinds of monkeys. And it's like people think you think we were with this. This process has stopped. You know what I love what you watch the sea turtles and they hatch on the beach, right? Yeah, you want to see a fucking rugged thing. I mean, you watch the Battle of the Bulge. You watch a lot of these battles, whatever that shit's horrible. D-Day fucking awful. My friend Harrison, I spoke of earlier, blown up on the shores of Italy and fucking left for dead by the fucking Nazis. Yes, like, I mean, tens of thousands of men died on storming shorefronts, right? And you look at these little turtles that get born in the birds that pick them off and they have to race to the water. And 60 percent of them, 70 percent of them are going to die. They're food and the fuck. And they still have to go, though. You have to go. You might be you, but you have to go. Your brother might win. You got to go. And then like this idea of like it's not different than that. Like you got to go and get to the water. Now, I don't know what the water is for a human. It's probably different for all of us, but the sense of like safety. But that's just getting in the game. It doesn't mean you're safe yet. That's just the place where, OK, I'm accessible. My fins work in this shit where they don't work on the sand. It's like now I'm in the game. There's still death all around me. But now at least I can take care of myself in a way that's better than I could before. And it's like there's that like that's not unlike all of us. You know, that struggle to live fucking powerful. And it ain't it ain't something that you're just owed. Think how good it feels to be a little sea turtle made for the ocean. Who's just come out of a weird shell. You're on sand. It's great, but it's not what you're made for. And the moment you hit the water, that sense of like, oh, right. Before the thing eats you. And you're in a new universe. Yeah, that's right. And this pattern is the pattern of awakening, which is that every single one of us is a baby sea turtle. And many of us have gotten frozen on the beach. And in that frozen state, we don't get picked off by seagulls. We're picking ourselves off. You're indecisive. You die. Yeah, yeah. And then there's that moment where suddenly like, whoa. Everything is different and everything feels so much better now. And the reason that is, is because now you're getting into the element that you're made for. And I love the analogy because in that, it still doesn't mean you're done. No, you're just starting. It's like that thing when guys told me, oh, you got into a black belt. Now the learning can begin. Now you know enough at black belt level to do base learning. Now you can start to learn. Right. That's a crazy thing to tell somebody. I interviewed Damien Eccles. He's this brilliant author. He was unfortunately like falsely confined to prison for a long time. But during that time, he got all this dis was brilliant. But one of the things he said that popped my brain was, oh, enlightenment in a lot of traditions is actually just the very first step. And then there's other stuff. So it's like, what are you what? I believe that it's crazy. But the and also when you add to it, that the idea that we were all sea turtles, that we've been incarnating here so much. Well, it's crazy. You think we're amphibious. Your son was breathing amniatic fluid that months ago. And then come out, boom, into a different universe. Yeah. And now also learn to breathe different now. Yeah, yeah, heavy. And if you add to that the concept of reincarnation, right, which is the idea of like, oh, man, you've been doing this so long. And and it's not like you were reincarnation has nothing to do with like, oh, you're going to be born in the future. You could be born in the past. You could be born in an alternate universe completely. You could be born on another planet. We don't know enough about time really to understand that. Yeah, you incarnate as a microbe. You might as well be on another planet because that place is completely different than this place. But the stories of the Buddha are so cool because they talk about the various incarnations leading up to the moment of realization. And at some point he's, he just started giving himself to the world. So there's this, did I tell you the story of him as the prince and the tigers? One of the stories is like he was on a hunting trip and he looked over and he saw a mother, a, a Tigris and she didn't have milk cause she was starving to feed her cubs. So he told like his services, like, go, go, I'll catch up. And then he go, he let the Tigris eat him so that she could give milk to her cubs, like she let himself be eaten by a tiger. And there's story after story after story where he began to realize that kind of what you're saying is like, fuck it. I'll just die. Yeah. And so he just started doing that in the most selfless way, which is like, oh, I'll just, you know, I'll, here I'll die. I'll just give myself. Here I'll die. Yeah, I'm, I'm more important. You're more important than your, your cubs are more important than me. I'm just a prince. You go ahead and eat me. And, and so that is when you start, you know, if this is a simulation, then that's when you start like hitting some kind of new pitch because you figured out, oh, I don't have to be afraid of death anymore. I keep doing this over and over, but every time I do it this time, I'm just going to give away everything. See what happens. This guy that helped me infinitely. I could never repay. Um, and I hadn't spoken to him before he died, but he'd been, he had Hep C and, and he was given a liver by the time he was like 70. I know when he's like 50, you know? And, uh, and he said, he thought about it. And he says, you know, I've had a great life. I'm 70 years old. You give that liver to somebody, the younger that can use it. And it's like, it's that reminds me of that kind of story. It's like, there's, there's those heroes all around us, man. You know, that's the Buddha. Yeah. Because if we change the idea of like we reincarnate only in the future, the Buddha could have reincarnated in 2040 in one of his incarnations. That was the Buddha. You were in the presence of that being and you witnessed one of the great miracles, which is the moment someone puts their entire existence behind someone else's and doesn't do, because you know what you have to gain from that in this world? Nothing there. You're not going to get any money for that. You're not going to get fame for that because you're going to die. And so, you know, that, that is the most that those are considered the highest incarnations. I know someone who died helping a dog get off a train track. These things, that's what we're, you know, hopefully you aren't going to die. You don't have to do these extreme things, by the way. But goddamn, if I do, let it be for something like that. Yeah, man. And PS, every time you do a thing that isn't selfish, that is for someone else, you do die in that moment because the self is gone. That's the one thing I, yeah. I think, I hashtag seek death on a lot of things. And I think that that's the idea of it is that, you know, you get, why would I undertake this if I'm not going to put my all into that, you know? And I think of that in retrospect. Now it puts a whole different, a whole different filter on my relationship with John, when you say that, like that he was the boot and he put his whole self because he did nothing short of that. He gave me his time. He gave me the most precious thing he had and he gave me his moments and his time and his consideration, you know? And that's an acknowledgement that I hadn't had in a long time, you know? Yeah. And goddamn, man, it makes a difference. And look at the ripples from, because we're all doing, we're all doing like the dive into the oblivion, so to speak. It's not oblivion actually. It's a never ending series of incarnations. But in, I feel like it's diving into the hand of God. It feels like you're diving into an abyss. Yeah, but you really ripples in the time, space continuum. And in this sense, the ripples from your friends, uh, diving into the hands of God, the abyss, the ripples, are you telling the story? And his, his particular, uh, moment of, uh, selflessness now ripples. As long as there are podcasts and they build, yeah, these are his ripples from the way he was swimming. These are the ripples from his boat that has temporarily gone beyond the veil, but still the ripples happen here. And that's the idea is like, we're just trying to make these ripples not be the kind of ripples that cause tsunamis and destruction. That's what Don used to say that he used to say, take every man, he's standing on the edge of the universe and he's thrown pebbles in and it causes ripples and that's our job. We just stand on the banks and we throw pebbles in and he says, and now the thing is that we don't know is that every time we throw, we're infusing each pebble with either destruction or growth. And so we're either upsetting other people's boats and waves and this and that, or we're looking for unisly unity and to be, to be deft and, and seamless in our integration into the universe so that we're not upsetting other people's and, uh, and that our impact would be only good. Make those be your ripples, Tate. He would be very proud of you because those are the ripples that you're making. Well, thanks man. How can people find you, sir? Just my name, Tate Fletcher. You can, uh, my company's caveman coffee. You can find me. I'm almost every action, uh, bad guy. Wait, man, I'll stop you for a moment. I just have to say this, man. When you were asking for my address, I didn't know it was four. I was excited though. I knew it'd be something cool, but I did not know that I was going to get a massive box of my favorite thing in the world. I love your, what would you call it? Cold brew. It's a nitro cold brew, the cans. I have been slurping that back nonstop. It is so good. Thank you so much, man. Do I have a fridge for what I wanted a hot one? And so I popped it, I shook it up, popped it, put it in a cup, threw it in the microwave because we've been messing with a hot tap. So we do cold brewed coffee, cold brewed over like 16 hours or whatever. And so the extraction is slow. So there's no bitterness. The taste is different, whatever, but then throw it on a, on a hot tap. So we'll tap it, tap a keg of cold brew, run it over a heat plate and heat it up. A nitrogenated cold brew and, uh, it's fucking fantastic. New, a whole new flavor. That works. Anyway, I can do it with the cans that I have. I just poured it in a cup and threw it in the microwave and heated it up. Anyway, all of it's awesome. I'm glad you, I'm glad you're enjoying it. Yeah, that's been a whole new, I mean, you know, and that's the, the coffee game. The, you know, we're going to play this game for a little while. And, and that's like being in a university, you know, the whole thing. You're doing a good job, man. It's still, and I'm not just saying this just because you just did my podcast or you gave me a box of, if I didn't like it, I would just want to mention it. But damn, thank you so much. Congrats for figuring out a way to make such a delicious. Thanks, man. Yeah, it's been years in the making and people are like, well, what'd you do? Like as an entrepreneur, whatever I go, I don't even know really, I guess that's what it is. I feel sheepish when I hear people say, oh, you're an entrepreneur. I'm like, I don't really think of it like that, you know, but like, uh, how do you stay, you know, cause we've been around for like five years or whatever. And, uh, we've been around so long and, and, uh, because we didn't know any better. We would have been bigger than we were, but, but so all you do is you pick something that you like and then you stay alive is what I found about a business. Right. It's like, you don't, you don't let it kill you and then you're still alive. And then you keep throwing yourself into the market and then the market keeps reflecting back like, no, you need your labels to be like this. No, this bag would need to be like this to be on the shelf. No, this would need to be, have this kind of stability. No, this would, and so then all the time you go in, you hear the no and the why. And that's a great, you know, obstacle. It's not a stopping point. It's great information for how do I now amend myself so that I can now be in the party that I want to be at. And that's kind of what we've done with the, with the whole thing. And, and we haven't sacrificed our sustainability or our approach with our farmers or any of that stuff. And, and it's been a real neat experience. I don't mean to prolong this and do some kind of weird, like old school telemark, like, you know, in the TV, telethon or whatever, but I do love Colbru and Jerry Lewis and Jerry Lewis. And I'm only, I'm not sponsored by you. I'm just saying this purely out of love for the, for it. But like the other thing you pulled off, which is really fascinating to me is, it looks cool, but then also it's got like this weird, perfect weight to it, which is weird. Do you know what I'm talking about? Where you want to hold? I'm a texture. What is the tech? Yeah. What is that? We're careful. That's so cool, man. Yeah. Cause I was noticing, like, how is this like ASMR? It's crazy. It's like, it's like, not, it's not, it is crazy. It's crazy. It's like, you're hitting, like when you, when you open it, it's an experience tactily. And then the first thing you notice when you bring it up is the odor of it. And you're like, there's chocolate. It smells different. And then the flavor in your mouth is first a nasal thing. And then the tech, I mean, it's like on a lot of different levels. We've bucked, we've been around for a minute. Yeah. Congratulations. Thanks brother. And Tay, I love you. I love you too. Thanks for having me, man. Hare Krishna. Cool. That was great. Thank you, man. Yeah, brother. Very inspiring.

Check out the latest in-store, and we're never short on options at jcp.com. All dressed up everywhere to go. JCPenney. Greetings to you, a beautiful human creature. Thanks for listening to the DTFH for tuning in again. If this is your first time, hello, wow. I can't believe I get to talk to you, to meet you in this way. What a weird way for us to meet. Hello, I love you. Your ears are looking good. Don't be afraid to clean them. It's going to increase your joy of music, and also there's something satisfying about pulling big clumps of greasy earwax out of your head from time to time. I've been getting my mind blown by an audio book I'm listening to called The Heart of Compassion by Dilgo Kinsey Rinpoche. Not Dildo, you depraved blasphemer. But Dilgo, like guh, it sounds like a hobbit. Dilgo Kinsey Rinpoche. How could you even think that sounds like Dildo? What is wrong? Are you kidding? Why would that even pop into your head? The book is fantastic, not just because it shines a light on a wild form of Buddhism, because there's so many different types of Buddhism. Like you look at the various forms of Buddhism, and many of them don't even seem like they're part of the same world or religion. But also because the narrator voice sounds like a sophisticated James Bond villain who seems to actually be chastising you from time to time by enunciating things like, human incarnation is a precious thing. So why are you wasting your time? It's really good. I like being chastised. Feels like I'm an X-man being scolded by Charles Xavier. But this book is great. The Heart of Compassion, Dilgo Kinsey Rinpoche. It's just the wildest stuff you've ever heard. It's so psychedelic. And they talk about various realms and Buddha fields. Just that term sounds cool, Buddha field, and humans that have dissolved their identity completely and have become emanations of Buddhas with beautiful sounding names like Avalokiteshvara, the Buddha of Compassion. But to me, the concept of being an emanation of something is worth thinking about, because if you can be an emanation of a Buddha, you can also be an emanation of other things. It's not guaranteed that you're just going to be an emanation of some enlightened thing. It troubles me to imagine some future where you can use an app to scan your psychological makeup, and it tells you how many ideas that you have that are actually original ideas, and how many have just been put there by corporations or countries, like little data eggs that hatch thoughts that you subconsciously associate with the corporation that put them there, and they intentionally did it, because they knew that was a thing that happened. Fuck, I'm an emanation of Starbucks. The majority of what I think is just endless iterations of things I'm mindlessly read on Starbucks cups. But also, if you're looking for a pick me up, the book is great, because it really emphasizes how incredible it is that we've taken on a human incarnation. So that's an automatic win. It's congratulating you on something that maybe you kind of wonder if you fucked up doing. Do you ever do everything like, man, maybe this? What were the other choices before I was born? Was this the right thing? Yes. According to this, it was not only the right thing, but it's the rarest of incarnations, rarer than being like a super luminous God, living a pleasure-ridden life in a celestial dimension. How fucking cool is that? Being human is the spiritual equivalent of being accepted into an Ivy League college. Most souls are in endless incarnational cycles that flip between being mollusks to maybe a trout. And every few million years maybe, just maybe a monkey, but never a human. That's rare. So the very fact that you have arms and legs and a nipple, I only have one nipple in the center of my chest. Maybe you have two. And that beautiful neocortex of yours means that you have been doing some kind of amazing work. And even if the current version of you feels like a rotten failure, you're not. You're a human. And the odds of being human are impossibly slim. And on top of that, you've incarnated in a realm where there have been Buddhas, which is also insane, because sometimes you can incarnate in a place where there aren't Buddhas and you don't, there isn't. The work hasn't already been done. Like they did the work for us. They went into the caves. They let lice feed on them to give them sustenance. They went out into the snow. We don't have to do that. We don't have to do it. We don't have to like get, we don't have to do that thing. We're like sitting on a cold fucking rock for 15 years straight, drinking stagnant water maybe eating your pubes. They did the work. We don't have to. So on top of being human, you get to incarnate in a place where thousands and thousands and thousands of years of meditation have already been put in to the technology of enlightenment. So that's pretty cool. Congratulations. It's like having a human incarnation and encountering these kinds of philosophies that you find in these books, it's like beyond rare. It would be like being alive when aliens visit the earth. It's like if suddenly ships of light descended from the sky and shared with all people the technology of hundreds of thousands of years. It's like that if you get lucky enough to stumble upon Buddhism. So if you're looking for a win, there you go. You're human, you did it. You're here and now all you have to do is sort of, well, I don't know, you know, I haven't finished the book but I'll figure it out. The main thing is that it invites you to get enlightened. Instead of it being like a kind of either one a thing you shouldn't talk about, what you hear sometimes weirdly in spiritual communities like, go get enlightened, whatever. But it's actually kind of a joyful thing, which is, yeah, get enlightened, do it. You should get enlightened because if you get enlightened, you're gonna benefit everybody. And that's the reason to get enlightened. Like it, you know, like also it sort of acknowledges the possibility that you can like get enlightened just cause you wanna feel good instead. Like you don't have to do the thing it's recommending, which is like get enlightened to benefit all sentient beings. You, if you want, you can just get enlightened because you wanna enjoy, you know, video games or you're just tired of being like constantly sort of eaten alive by the termites of anxiety that gnaw at your inner core whenever you're awake. That's okay too. But the idea is get enlightened to help yourself to start off but according to this book, when a being gets enlightened, people living nearby, like in the city, they start healing and crops grow and miracles happen. You might not even know why you're having such an incredible life, but it's because you moved in next to an enlightened person. It's that powerful. So that's pretty cool. I really love it. Highly recommend it. Delgo Kenci Rinpoche, the heart of compassion. Friends, got a great podcast for you. We're gonna jump right into it, but first this.

But not just that, there's a ton of additional content just waiting for you on the other side of hell. Patreon.com, forward slash DTFH. Today's guest is an extraordinary artist who makes some beautiful music. I got lucky enough to see him perform live at a Ram Dass retreat. And it was one of those moments where somehow I wasn't already high, which is somewhat rare. And I found myself tripping just by listening to East Forest's music. And I was looking around and there were all these hardcore hippies who were also like, what the fuck, this is intense, man. He's a wonderful being who I've become friends with over a few years of hanging out at these Ram Dass retreats. And he's made some really beautiful music that sort of wraps around some conversations he had with Ram Dass. All of these existed eastforest.org. So head over there after you listen to this wonderful conversation with the great East Forest. [""Welcome to the East Forest""] Welcome, welcome on you that you are with us shake hands, no need to be blue Welcome to you Welcome, welcome Welcome to the East Forest Welcome back to the DTFH God bless you, it's so good to see you Yeah, brother It's been too long, you know our association has been in the grace of those Ram Dass retreats which I don't know about you, but and maybe there's no way to enjoy a thing like that without kind of taking it for granted Oh dude, you know you're living large when the way we saw each other was in Maui Consistently multiple times It's like yeah, here we are in Maui again Yeah, with Ram Dass And it's vaguely work for us It's work related It's so funny, now that I think about it I don't think I've ever seen you outside of a resort in Maui It's so weird, we're lucky Well, you were asking before I started recording about these keyboards I don't know if you can see it We got a Mogue one right here That is a Juno one of six Classic A Mogue Voyager, a Mogue Sub 37 over there And you can't see it but maybe I can get it so you can see it, hold on Is this really why you moved to Asheville to be next to the Mogue? Yeah, so you could maybe intern there This is, I don't know, these are my models Yo, yo, yo, yeah, fun That's my Euro Rack there Yeah, basically I just love making music So this is what I do when I'm not doing podcasts But any great musician like yourself, and I mean that I know my real musician friends they've simplified I can see you've got a piano It looks like you've got a couple of keyboards back there I've got a couple of pianos which I have two and one's an old 102-year-old grand over here and then I've got this upright This is more like felted out kind of felt sound, very soft Wow But I've been getting into like analog, preamps and mics and I upgraded a lot of that stuff this year This is an old carport like for an RV or a sailboat and I just turned it into a studio in the back of Radha's house How cool is that? When I, when we were in Maui and I finally got to see you perform live It was so intense that it reminded me of any other time I'd taken a psychedelic without thinking about taking a psychedelic Without thinking How many times does that happen in your life? Probably a fair number You know, not that you don't know your Like when I smoked MEO-DMT for the first time You know, and everyone's telling you about MEO-DMT It takes you to the heart of the universe It eradicates you It's so powerful Be careful But I was younger then So I'm like, ah, come on You can't be stronger than us What's the universe? What's, come on What's the center of the universe? Come on, I can handle that But the difference between the type of psychedelic that you your art is and a psychedelic that you inhale or eat is that when you inhale or eat a psychedelic you have some sense of a timeline some idea of a process and it won't, even if it takes, the strength takes you by surprise the effect, unless you're completely nuts is should, should You should know you're going to get high But when I was watching you perform at this Ram Dass retreat and, you know, gradually getting increasingly high, having not taken anything and looking around at all the people who also, they're like, oh, it's a show He's forced it, maybe they haven't heard you before and then looking around at all these old hippies ripping out and everybody's looking at each other like, what the fuck is happening to us? Radha is going around spraying Macing people with essential oils yes, around the room and little bells This makes me miss performing It's, I mean, God, the last time was February, it's, you know, it's been a while my friend, like, I'm, I'm I'm legitimately worried that like I'll forget how all this shit works You know, it's like you get used to not traveling around and playing and part of that is nice Yeah, that's the I know it's both, it's a both end but I have to admit, like I feel way more grounded but I also miss that kind of wild connection of I mean, it's, it's crazy, as you know being like, I'm sure when you're doing stand-up it's a crazy feeling at moments like this sort of energetic conversation with other people yes, wild, it's a high it's a wild, wild feeling and it's a privilege to be able to sometimes get to those places Yeah, I wonder if you could help me understand what kind of thought goes into your performance or what kind and I don't mean like the planning out of the songs or the technical stuff I mean was there a time when your audience wasn't tripping out Oh hell yeah, dude oh man, I've had some horrible LA was one of the worst performances of my life, like when I was just trying to do first off I was trying to figure out who the hell I was and what my own voice was and I didn't really know so I was trying a lot of different things and so I remember doing a show in LA and it was like at some club I don't remember but I was in like the back room of the club and it was this like little triangle shaped room I was first on and there were like five people there who none of them were there to see me they were just sort of have a drink and one guy was super drunk standing right in front of me with his back to me like having a conversation with this lady and I'm doing my thing and it was heartbreaking and I just remember feeling like this will never work I feel like you guys took my soul and just like ate it and then shitted out and then gave it back to me and I remember sitting out in front of the door guy and he's just like yeah that was rough and I'm like yeah man I'm feeling it this is a low point in my life but I've had many of those but did something shift or was there a moment when you realized that your music was causing like powerful shifts in the consciousness of the audience and was that even your intention yeah you know what my friend it started because it started in the psychedelic space playing for people journeying and in those spaces it was overwhelming like oh we're in this really amazing incredible space I just never thought that would translate into a commercial space like where people pay tickets and they're just sitting there and I'm like they would I assumed they would be incredibly bored and they would they want to be entertained and I have to do this and that and so what shifted for me is when I stopped trying to do the thing I thought I needed to do and I actually just went back into the ceremony space and that's when it really started to light up because and it was it took I don't know eight years for me to really trust that where it's like look you can play the more heart felt it is the more you're imbibing it with that psychedelic openness actually the better and more engaging it is when before I thought the less engaging it was because two ambience or two whatever man like right and I feel like I've more room to go in that direction I just need to trust myself and to be honest I don't quite enough but to do it fully improvisation Lee like that and just just just be like I will just see what comes through and hopefully that's interesting to you and that to me would be the ultimate and I do that and that's what I do in ceremonies in these little private ceremonies and that to me is where it's not about me it's about it goes on these waves where sometimes it's tapped in sometimes it's not you just ride it and that's what I started doing in these virtual ceremonies during the pandemic quote-unquote publicly streaming it on YouTube I'd never done that before and I play for three or four hours I'm like well this is what we do in the ceremonies I just never done that publicly the ceremonies that you that you do for folks who are new to East Forest they involve still assignment is it okay to say that of course yeah and so when I release the music for mushrooms a soundtrack for the psychedelic practitioner album I was clearly putting a stamp on it be like this is what it is that's what it's for this is how it's made yeah you have an album designed for people you know these days imagine if I said if I'm like well actually it's not for that that's just that's just a clever title it is nothing to do with that please nothing to see here Jen my music was made to be like fine Jen the the the so um do you have a source where you're getting like the the chapters of the ceremony do you have a teacher that you learned how to conduct one of these ceremonies with or are you how did you learn how to do an acoustic mushroom ceremony well I'd have to say I learned the most from just the mushrooms themselves but my it's all sort of a direct shamanic lineage of learning from other ceremonies and so I would just participate in indigenous ceremonies that are like a Lakota sweat lodge if you do a traditional one traditionally that's the only way they are have been done that way for thousands of years exactly that way and so you know that this is a kind of technology they've developed over many many years and you can learn from that and if you go to a certain ayahuasca ceremonies Peruvian or uh the San Pedro in the mountains um you start to see some similarities in in like kind of what's working different personalities of traditional shamans you just learn like oh this guy is very playful and there's certain elements it's like I appreciate that as almost as a performer like that's an interesting thing he's doing or musically though the one shaman is just just a rattle which is intense but I learned a lot just about rhythm or one guy plays all these different instruments there's other traditional shaman and none of them are using any words it's just music all of these things pretty much is the music the central vehicle that not just guides a ceremony but maybe you've experienced this like it really becomes the space you're in like literally you're just in this musical architecture and that's like a room you're in and then when the song shifts now you're in a new space that like is the journey I've never experienced I've never done any ceremony with psychedelics are you kidding me oh my god I feel like now I just want to fly out and just play for you in the fam and just dive into that space it's so beautiful it could be something we do when this is over I think I'm ready to go somebody's taken psychedelics as many times as I have it's really weird how I feel blocked related to going into an actual formal ceremony I feel that I feel that completely I think that bravery encourages a really central element to stepping into a journey because otherwise if it was just a pill that you could take with not many downsides and everyone got enlightenment first off anyone could do it it's sort of like there'd be no point and that's the essence of the human journey itself is that if there wasn't grist for the mill if there wasn't friction there would be no point to being here like that is the point yeah right as shitty as it is the normal friction of everyday life is one thing but the stories that I've heard and you just the way you just described it are so profoundly weird which is this relationship between space and music that seems to be illuminated via plant medicine and also this seeming form of navigation that a group of people are sharing an experience that's another weird part of it which doesn't match current understandings of subjective consciousness it implies a form of group mind telepathy whatever you want to call it but that the shaman acts as this guide more than I'm guiding you through your own emotional escape but I'm taking you into this place that is so odd to me and I wonder if you could tell me what your theories are regarding what is that place where is that place I don't know and I don't see myself as a traditional shaman I see myself as like a guy who's got his hand on the wheel of the ship that we're all on and I'm not controlling the storms or what comes up on the seas but I'm definitely in charge of steering that ship and I'm steering it largely with music and there seems to be something about a group of people I mean we know this just there's whatever I don't know how to define it but we feel what a vibe of a room is there's sort of an energy to it and other people this is just a heightened sense of that and I've always told people like look this is a small event whatever we're doing but it's like an acupuncture needle imagine that it can be a very powerful event and yes we're doing this as a group so it is a group experience but clearly you're here as an individual having your experience and it can be both at the same time and your job is to every now and then sort of check in with the energy and just sort of say okay what am I feeling? Is there a role that I can play? Like sometimes I've had experiences where I feel I just need to breathe for someone else who's really I can hear and feel the challenge they're going through and I just like shoot myself over there in my mind and I just feel like I'm just breathing with them and holding them and like it feels so amplified in those experiences I feel like in a sense psychedelics are like these massive amplifiers like it takes the antenna of you and your consciousness and just turns it up to 11 and then another 11 and every other you'll fractal 11 beyond that if you want and what all that is I don't know but I'm really glad that it exists because even though it's not a huge part of my practice like taking a lot of psychedelics for some reason I can't stop talking about them and like it's influencing my music and I've had experiences that felt like realer than real in a way and that helped me understand what it just meant like what the hell is going on with this whole life thing like what the fuck is going on and for some reason that gives it more grounding and meaning even though it's more confounding I I want to thank feels for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH maybe you're somebody who's a

the psychedelic dark ages that western world went through with like pockets of you know underground pockets are not so underground pockets of people taking psychedelics for various reasons one things for certain we don't have the same maps that you know someone who has been born into a tradition where psychedelics are something that involve black lights are stereotypical every high schooler has about them or like staring at a lava lamp or all the stuff which really is a kind of hyper primitive way of you know stumbling upon a new technology like the there's a great YouTube video they put a mirror in the jungle because they wanted to see the way different animals reacted to very fun to watch like a leopard like going from trying to fight itself to like clearly liking itself to then performing for itself like jumping out of a tree having sex with the mirror yeah like you know like but I think that psychedelics in some way or in the west are like that they're like a mirror that came out of nowhere that we're just starting to understand what it may be and um we're still not at a point where you're allowed to say the things I want to say which is yeah it's like it's probably the beginning of some new way of traveling and which is why instinctually people knew that I called tripping but it's I want to this is something I was just curious that maybe you've experienced yourself or that you've experienced in ceremony uh regarding this idea of travel um do you have the sense that every time you go through one of these ceremonies you're entering into a new universe in other words like this ceremony that you did did it maybe potentially shift you out of one timeline into a completely different timeline I'm sorry if this seems way too weird or whatever but um it's just something I've been kicking around in my head and John Lily used to say that every time you got into the tank you got into the tank in one universe and when you open the sensory deprivation tank you got out you got out in a completely different universe that some people would go into the tank and walk through the tour very midnight gospel yeah yeah I'm curious what you think about in that regard regarding like the actual like dimensional navigation that goes on via psychedelics or psychedelic ceremony I think that the creative energy does that anyway so maybe I just feel like I'm really used to what it feels like to lose myself a bit from those flow states and music and it's just a very like you're kind of in it and you're out of it in such a way that I don't really even notice it and all I know is it provides some kind of flawless for me emotionally like it's like a vitamin I need to take to feel okay and to me it feels like that creative force that comes through in infinite different ways in this world you know not just music certainly in comedy and writing even a good conversation at times that force of creation is the substrate of life it is God creating it's you that is it and that is the blossoming forward in a sense and it is so important and sacred and delicious like that you're deficient if you don't have if you're not exercising that muscle and so inside playing a ceremony that involves any music that involves improvisation particularly it's like man you're going right to the mainline of it and if you've just if you've all you have to do in your work is exercising your own capabilities just to be able to play anything right so you know how much will have you put into just the technique in a sense and doesn't have to be virtuosistic it's just you have to have some technique to be able to do something right now you've created a doorway into this space of alternate universes but really to me it's all one universe it's just different wavelengths and channels like it's all inside the bubble of love the universe God that you can't escape I had a a ketamine experience because Rada is now a ketamine therapist here here in Boise and is really really powerful and surprised me like blew me away that it could be that strong and after I came out of it I was just trying to understand I was recording like these notes to myself and I ended up using a bit of that recording in a song that's coming out and there's this phrase in it that was like you can't fall out of love and what I meant to myself is like love being this thing you're in you can't not be in it and I like this this sort of poetic phrase of you can't even fall out of love you're always in love so those states we get in and out of I feel like well you're always there it's really more like taking the wool off your eyes to just experience what's there right yeah and that thereness I think we're still at a point where culturally that their place is still kind of considered a fantasy like a totally an imagine the other yeah and other and and when you sort of look at the history of navigation or you look at the great leaps for humans have taken in their ability to traverse various terrain mm-hmm each new leap forward in navigation also presents like a new way of seeing everything permanently like you could almost say that every time we move to a new form of navigation it's a weird form of apocalypse it's like whatever like the world before that is no more it's radically changed by you know that suddenly we can cross a desert in a plane and now we know what a desert looks like from the POV of a bird or now we can see the earth from the space station and each one of these shifts there's cultural shifts that happen that go along with it you know and not just technological are like like David Bowie doing like space Odyssey or you get you know what I mean you get like it transforms the whole planet so I don't know I really do get this feeling that as the prohibition ends with psychedelics that it's going to trigger a literal come to Jesus moment where people have to start recognizing this terrain is not just a function of the mind like it's a place and are you know like to me when I think about my crazy hubris as a kid when people would tell me about ayahuasca or they would say oh no it will heal you or these mushrooms will heal there's shamans who will heal who will get into your energetic system and heal you physically emotionally I would be like yeah whatever it's not a scalpel or chemo or it's not real and to me that's the the thing we're probably I'm probably not you because you seem to already know that but the thing I'm stumbling upon is like no there's an actual place I know we're all in one place I know we're in the great field of love but this place it's like the astral plane or something it's like a biome you know just right now beginning to understand is more than a subjective place or a result of taking drugs or a result of a mental illness or something yeah man I mean people often the way they change their minds is when they have the experiences themselves that's pretty much the only way and then they radically shift their perspectives on it so it's like I think what the prohibition ending will cause is just more people who wouldn't before step into some of these spaces and they'll change their own minds by their own volition it's as we know it's been around and there's been a certain subsect that I call myself the brotherhood that I see in you of people who have already experienced these things and they know right I think the real shift next will be the people who now it feels sanctioned it's okay you know that Michael Pollan gave them this license now it's like well okay I know a lot of people who never smoked weed until it was legal it just wasn't okay for them you know and now they're all about it and so I think that will really push this cultural wave much further and much faster in addition to the research because it's been happening for thousands of years and I think it did inform societies in probably massive ways perhaps a lot of thoughts about the Greeks and Soma to the Egyptians to the Mayans to the Aztecs it goes on and on and you could keep going back in time and hypothesize about how this was played a role so now it's sort of our turn it's like look we're standing on the giants of all that experience but we now have to bring it online with sort of our frontal cortex mind and science and that's what we're now allowing we're sort of saying we're going to allow that to occur and I think that could be amazing marriage because that's never happened before it's happened with music and it's happened with other things but never with the blade of science and I don't know if you can even quantify these things but we certainly can do a lot of fuckery to discover what's going on with the chemicals and synthesis and so I think it'll be great the fusion of disease floating through the air and now I think do I want to go to some nexus point of sickness no I didn't like it before the pandemic and I certainly don't like it now which is why I love Amazon

Amazon.com slash DuncanRx thank you Amazon Pharmacy well you know I could think of some of them that's so funny what happens when the blade of science makes its way into say the DMT realm and you know what happens it's like they're gonna try to catch them that'll be one of the things like they're gonna try to catch them in a way or something you know that will be one of the maybe the worst or best things that ever happened is finally we'll be like well the DMT elves they actually weigh 16 micrograms now we know they've been eating too much light then they're usually like 20 or 25 you know what I mean the blade of science it just wants to measure it wants to measure and and I think there's something to be said for that and this mapping you know Alex Gray it's one of the many beautiful things when he's talking about visionary art is it's a map and we're getting like visionary art functions as a map for this realm that the mystics live in know about it's the lifting of a type of blindfold from the conditioned eyes of anybody who was born into a world where that just wasn't a possibility I'm one of them when I was a kid there was a clear distinction between my imagination and reality you know what I mean if there were elves in a book no one would be like but actually they're elves they're like some kind of well you did believe that I'm sure at a certain age I'm sure you believed in all that stuff it just sort of one by one my step kid when he was 8 told me like look dragons, elves real Easter Bunny Santa Claus you know not real and I was like well why are dragons real and he's like because they're real man of course you know it's like there's no question in his mind but within a year later once those became not real because he said he heard people talking that's how he put it everything cascaded from there and God was now on the list, God's not real nothing's real he's 9 he sounds awesome he's like going through his nihilist yeah it's getting dark he's going through the crossing the abyss but you know the what's so exciting to me about what you and Rada do is you're very open about it you seem to have somehow shaken off the fear of the current legal situation you do mushroom ceremonies well not really I have a healthy dose of fear and skepticism and I don't do these public mushroom ceremonies I create music that's a tool for it and I have guided many ceremonies in the past that were private ceremonies but I'm not out there like flaunting anything in front of the face of like what's illegal I understand that you know what I mean and I don't necessarily agree with that but I'm not out there personally like dosing people and I get emails all the time that I either don't answer I have to clarify for people who are continual narks one of them I'm sure just being like hey where can I get the blink or can you give me this or how do I do this and like just you know little trap entrapments and I'm not interested in that and so I stay very clean about my involvement since I become such an advocate and speaking about my experiences so openly I get the nark emails once and while things like hey I'm a 16 year old boy and I'm interested in psychedelics particularly taking LSD you know where I could find LSD and would you recommend and I'm always like ask your parents don't talk to me ask your parents cop I've never touched it in my life yeah but also the sense that I've gotten from police that I've talked to is like you think that's what we're worried about y'all eating mushrooms I mean it's the meth that's fucking their lives up you know it's the coke it's the white powders and they're I think to them that's what's going to get you if you're a police officer and you're going to get shot that's one of the ways you're going to get shot is by some speed freak not by someone in the midst of a mushroom ceremony listening to Ease 4 I think the whole conversation in almost every level of course there's a few pockets of tyranny or fascism or whatever but I think the general conversation is shifting all the way across the board because you know you can't put the toothpaste back in the tube it's already out and because of that we're really about to there's so many things aligning right now getting back sorry for the technical error so to me you are a pioneer you represent what I think is we can look forward to and what they're calling the post-pandemic renaissance that we're all crossing our fingers for because all these things are coinciding a pandemic meeting the age of Aquarius that's right meeting the end of the prohibition of psychedelics and all these things are obviously not really separate like you were saying it's all mixed in together it's all one thing mixed together but these threads are to me becoming the most prominent now when I'm thinking about what art's going to look like over the next decade or what movies are going to be like or what we're going to be like or self-expression is going to be like and weirdly coinciding with all of this is the beginning revelation from the military of these alien ships in the new COVID bill there is a thing that in six months they have to disclose to senators everything that they know come on seriously because I've been talking a lot about this lately I didn't know that that was in the bill it's in the it was buried in there which is in six months they have to like give all data points regarding these ships that people are seeing Marco Rubio put it in weirdly because he's unbelievable yeah and so right now these events seem if you look at them you could think that they're unrelated just but I think actually it's the very it's when you're on a ship and you see something far on the horizon that's what this is it's like the ship of history is like approaching some really weird new terrain so would you mind talking a little bit about from that point of view your theories regarding what this new terrain is in particular your theories regarding some of the entities you encounter when you're on mushrooms or maybe have something to do with these ships that are zinging around well look I would also point the lens back at you and say that the creates the creativity you're putting out like with that show you did man because I want the listeners to know that you were gracious enough when was that I don't know a year and a half ago I stopped by Hollywood and you took me in the studio and you really only had episode one mostly done and that was it and even then I could just see talk about things coming together from disparate angles and mashing things together in ways they haven't been done before that to me is another perfect example of this sort of creative bravery of taking these disparate parts and making things that are very much of like your voice for each of us like that was so your voice I think as I remember saying this is so you and that's what's so wonderful about it and that I hope is what we're looking for and what we see manifest more in the future creatively because art has really always been the harbinger of our future and sort of reflection on our current and our past in a way and that's showing us like it's a shedding of skins in a way it's a letting go of expectations and it's a true openness to what the infinite possibility of our future is which is not just like a psychedelic idea it's like that's the reality it has infinite possibilities in front of us and we get to choose what we want to do and it feels like what's happening right now on this ship as you say we're on we're throwing a bunch of shit overboard to save weight and patching up some holes and everything that's not needed is either breaking or we're getting rid of it because there's no choice in order to stay afloat this is what has to happen and god damn it we're human beings we will do it we will adapt we will stay afloat bitter and we will do whatever is necessary we're going to make some mistakes you know maybe we threw over the wrong things or a few people we threw over we regret this this is horrible and now we have to grieve it we have to deal with this karma but nonetheless we are marching forward and none of us know what that future holds but I think in our hearts we know like we know in the sense that as Charles Eisenstein in his beautiful phrase our hearts tell us a more beautiful world that is possible quite literally we know a more beautiful world is possible now how that could be a reality or what steps that would take to form it that's where we get into all sorts of gyrations in our mind or like it's impossible or this or that yada yada yada but the fact that we hold that collective truth that's our lighthouse and I think we're actually moving towards it whether we like it or not that's what you sense in that psychedelic blossoming that I always see across different psychedelics it's sort of endless movement almost like that flower like the lotus blossomed just like ju ju ju ju ju ju that fractalness of it that is the creative source source that is us that is the returning to God that has no destination that is sort of the whole point maybe that none of our minds can tell you hey it's this and it's this that's the operating system we're in but it's a different octave right it's like the light spectrum it's infinite but we only can see this one bit and that's just the language we have to use right now we're not meant to be able to put our finger on it because it's not put your finger on a bowl it's the Lao Tzu it can't be spoken the truth and that's why music and art in many ways the only way to even start to dance around the edge of this mystery that has no edge and that's Eric Davis's phrase the mystery with no edge and I'm like there you go the mystic poetry that's why we have these things that's why music is trans-dimensional because it helps you feel it not understand it that's the only way is to feel it and that's why we're in those journeys you have these great understandings but let's be honest they're really feelings they're understandings of feeling and that's why when you put it on paper to remember it's just like a circle and you come back and you're like this is it this is the answer it's a triangle at this point in my in my psychedelic career at this point in my in my history of psychedelics I find myself writing something down there's always peace in me that's like come on man before you started you wrote down don't write anything down yeah I think this is finally after two decades of psychedelics this will be the sentence to this is the time this is it you finally figured it out yeah but you know to get back into the razor of science I want to bring up something that that was my first encounter with him and the thing that my first feeling towards that teacher was I was really I hated him I felt directly criticized by him because I had found this beautiful path now I see it as a beautiful passage where he said it if you take the ineffable if like you begin to say things like it's I can't there's no words for it and that's not what you're saying you're saying there is words it's just not words it's music but anytime you get into that point where we've all been if we've experienced something astounding as we go there's no I don't have words for it that's like taking your confusion and putting it on an altar and burning incense to your confusion burning candles to your confusion and though I do enjoy burning candles to my confusion and I think there's something to be said for confusion itself being well as Trump or Rinpoche said it's on the continuum of enlightenment I feel like also there's something to be said for thinking about things in a more technical sense from a scientific perspective and that it's a weird thing in the sense that the problem is the scientists themselves who most certainly if I had to bet on it are most certainly taking the psychedelics that they're studying I can't imagine being a scientist involved in an LSD study which is happening right now to treat ADHD or researchers studying psilocybin's effect in the treatment of depression or anxiety related to the end of life not at some point being like I think I'm going to take some of these on a camping trip and see what happens but they can't then say without losing all their funding well what happened was that I came into contact with what appears to be an intelligent praying mantis praying mantis that seemed pretty serious regarding its desire to bring peace to our planet and they are using these as a tool to convey some practical information to us they can't if they say that it's over their funding is gone I've met scientists I'm not going to name names who have been like yeah try saying that try putting that in your fucking paper say goodbye you better write like a book about astral projection or some shit because your science career is done nobody wants to hear it but and yet artists were lucky because we could say that and no one's going to be like I'm not listening to that podcast anymore he thinks that he can talk to praying mantis beings too shit well look two points on that one just about the UFOs you saw recently the guy who is Israeli he was 87 year olds and died that's a decent example of saying like I couldn't say this before but I can say it now we're part of a galactic federation Trump knew he was going to tell everybody but they convinced him not to you know it's parts of it are hard to believe but it gets in line with what you're saying about people it's easy to throw stuff out the people I've met in the psychedelic research field that I've talked to a lot of them just have a really it's a heartfelt connection they just like anybody else had some really powerful experiences personally that was so profound that it already shifted them to do something that's already challenging which is like I'm going to dedicate my professional work now to this in some way or the other so they're already like way out on a limb but they know that we need to sharpen the blade in the spiritual world and that has never been more important than it is today in the worlds of Facebook and misinformation and all the malarkey that's out there where it's just too easy to explain things with these little tropes that might be true but it's not enough and so now as you're saying we bring in maybe these ingredients of science or whatever it is we need to do that as a community because that's how we're going to create the bridge to other communities that aren't already in this spiritual world or psychedelic world and we're seeing the dangers of that now with a lot of conspiracy ideas and how it becomes like truly like a public health emergency in a sense yeah for sure I mean yeah it's the you know I've experienced the thing I experienced when I saw you perform which is getting blasted without taking a psychedelic a few times always around spiritual people always around people who have some kind of practice but it never fails to sort of it seems like the most obvious thing that you can get high on more than a substance you can get high on more than some configuration of molecules you can get high on music you can get high on sex you can get high on exercise and most certainly you can get fucked up from the internet and I think part of the public health emergency is you have legions of people consuming one of the most powerful psychedelics that has ever been on the planet every single day and then being wondering like why do I feel why do I feel crazy it's because you're like snorting big fat fucking rails of the internet all day long stop and you need to take a break like any other psychedelic totally did this in the way a shaman via music or prayer or some other method shapes the terrain of the group similarly you have these digital shamans who are shaping people's landscapes not out of some desire to heal like when you shifted your consciousness to embrace someone having a rough time but in shifting your consciousness to people who are having a rough time and attempting to amplify that rough time so that you gain control over them and inject them with whatever your particular shitty data set is and then this is why I'm on twitter and I made the terrible mistake of saying getting in an argument over why you should wear masks with someone all of a sudden the person I'm arguing with will stop even communicating by writing and just start posting shitty stupid news you know what I mean which is to me the equivalent of when something filled with parasites starts vomiting the parasites there's a meme of the mask seeing in on it there's a meme that the pandemic's not real and you're like but can you tell me what you know show me your fucking sources what's the data set you're drawing this from that it's not real blah blah blah or even worse the information's out there you're gonna have to fight it yourself no you're not ready you're not ready it's like Sasquatch you know if you haven't found Sasquatch you're just not ready yeah exactly and so to me you're absolutely right it's a public health emergency because people don't realize that not only are they tripping their trips are being guided by state entities and using like a psyops campaign designed to destabilize whatever it's the same shit we used to do or still do the CIA would do it in Iran or various places where you go in there cause all kinds of like just disturb the shit so that it causes everything to be so tumultuous that there's a possibility of installing a new government without even people realizing it's happening but to get back to the psychedelic phenomena in this regard I wonder I'm sorry I keep going after this I feel a little guilty for having an agenda here but you're one of the only people I've chatted with I've chatted with a few people who have been to ceremonies and know about leading ceremonies with psychedelics and so I just I'm so sorry what if you had to describe the biome that we encounter on mushrooms the entities the elves whatever you want to call them do you one do you think have you encountered them so what the fuck are they I'm only asking because I know that you surely if you haven't encountered them you've been around people who have encountered them via these ceremonies so I wonder if you could just talk about that a little bit my apology for trying to nudge the conversation in that direction no it's like on my podcast if someone knows anything about UFOs I keep like bringing it up and they're just like ugh and I'm just like but really tell me more about the UFOs look I have to be honest that I don't know and if anyone tells you they know red flag I don't understand any of it now after that disclaimer I'll tell you some things I think but I don't know I don't know my encounters feels like less with a physical hallucinatory being and more like an intelligent energy that I have communication with in my own mind through words and phrases and it's a very clear and strong just that's there and I'm here and I think something quote say something and it sort of has its response back and that intelligence to me I felt it on other substances too and I feel it also now it just bleeds into my life where I feel it with Maharajie and I didn't a couple years ago but I would say the reason I know you is because of the way I decided to just say I'll roll some dice hey Maharajie guy I'm listening let's see what happens and here we are and it goes on and on so the boundaries start to blur and it becomes more like who is the me in my head I often find myself in my head saying the word they or we, we should do who's we this is so crazy is there the witness and then there's the ego and we're just seeing ourselves as two separate things and when I'm in these journeys and I'm thinking things and I get rid of these response is that an other or is that just another fractal reflection of me is God slash the universe slash you I don't know but it has a very stern voice it has a very clear voice it has a voice of law not of decision it's like this is just how it is and there is no negotiation and that's not like I can now judge the thing for thinking this is it and that is the struggle in the psychedelic journey especially with ayahuasca from my experiences is that my pain is not yet being able to accept that and give into that thing whether it's some truth about my own self or the past or the universe or suffering whatever it is and when I finally give in and maybe there's a purge involved that's when there's the explosion of satori and now I'm back I'm like oh I've just plugged back into pure enlightenment consciousness it's about letting go acceptance it's about release it's about not blockading that flow of energy in sort of like a chi acupuncture kind of way so you know to me it seems more feasible that the spores shoot through the universe and they hit certain planets and billions of years go by and we know that fungi are some of the first things on this planet billions of years ago so I mean it's actually more logical to me that it's just an incredibly old let's call it a plant even though it's a fungus just a live thing and because of that we can't compare what consciousness even is and so the fact that it even has developed ways to communicate on such literal levels as like you put this in your body and everything explodes and you understand shows you what a gift man we talk about what is all these spaces but just how about why does this even exist and there's not even like one of these there's thousands and probably many more thousands we have yet to have discovered of ways of altering different flavors of psychedelic ice cream on this planet that just are they're just there it makes no sense other than I mean the only logic of that to me is that it's a tool it's just like lettuce is a tool and trees help me build things they're all intelligent they're all just different substrates and that means we're tools too but you happen to be like steering the ship you are the carpenter of your own tool and what do you want to build that's up to you boom there's the soul's journey and then you have your particular knots and your particular things you have to work with and that's perfect for your little journey and now it's your choice and so going back to the metaphor of the ship your job is where do you want to point the ship what do you see in the horizon that's your vision that's your bliss that's drawing you towards that beacon what is your North Star you choose it you don't control all that other stuff that happens around you but that choice is incredibly important and so when we get out of this internet maze this haze that we're in the hypnosis and recognize our own volition in all of this it's so important because we're being put to sleep in a way that's not just anesthetizing us it's destroying us on a personal level too I feel it when the weight I feel some of that I can't even use Facebook anymore because some of the comments get so they hurt people call me a fraud or it is like one person for using the word ceremony for doing a free ceremony on YouTube in the pandemic and they put up like we need to shut this guy down that kind of cancel culture and it's like I don't want any part of it I don't want to shut other people down I have some ideas there but that particular thing in the same way I know I love your description of this voice the law because our association with law in general maybe isn't the best for a lot of people maybe a better way for folks to think of it more in terms of laws of physics inarguable laws they just are and that voice is so amazing any time you are lucky enough to tune into it I think it's playing it's speaking all the time and every moment when finally you begin to hear it it's not scary because you've been listening to it since you were in the womb it's what babies are hearing but the counter to that is what you are talking about which is this strange web of repressive impulse that is showing up online it's that thing that I guess is like the collective grasping or the collective attachment or the zeitgeist a paradigm that we're all starting to realize it's not real we're all we're clinging to a way of looking at things that is potentially fundamentally wrong and shaped by various regimes that really depend on their being hierarchy and it transcends I think the material universe this is why I always feel connected to Gnosticism or at least parts of it that I understand which isn't much but this concept of the demiurge this sort of antithesis to the pure creative state you're talking about a thing that it's the thing in anybody you know as a comedian a feeling you become familiar with whether you like it or not has to be a weird kind of jealousy when you see someone a million times funny you know what I mean you can't do anything about your feelings they just show up it's a fire though too that jealousy in a way it's a form of inspiration yes that's the side that that's the ship pointing side some people never realize like oh well that thing that you're feeling that's your inspiration that's the ass of your inspiration you know what I mean right into the asshole of your inspiration by feeling jealous because it's showing you it's possible but what I'm saying is the demiurge is a thing forgive me my Gnostic friends out there if I'm fucking this whole thing up but the demiurge is the thing that had that very same feeling in relation to the creative outflow itself and so it had jealousy and didn't decide to like recognize that there was a potential for inspiration or novelty in that but rather just completely synthesized the creation into a synthetic version which is the matrix that we're all in right now that's the idea so we are literally living inside a synthetic echo of primary reality and because we're in that synthetic echo of primary reality it's very it's disastrous for the demiurge if people begin to realize oh I don't think this is quite as real as I thought it was because the moment you do that you see right through and now of course you're in the bubble that you're talking about in this weird shitty side show that was being put on by a the hope-style god suddenly just becomes like a you know what I mean like a bad opening act that doesn't want to get off stage that thing to me manifests in what you're talking about it manifests anytime you find yourself around a person a group of people a political system that is actively trying to suppress you to keep your brain and nervous system focused on fear terror horror the impossibility of anything all the various things that I think the internet is magnifying you know and it's never going to stop that's the other thing it's like a fundamental quality of reality it's like as long as there has been the ability for a human to observe there's been Mara there's been the thing that appears Satan in the desert it just appears and it's like hey look over here hey check this out you should worship me why don't you worship me who do you think you are if you worship me I'll give you everything but in this case the phones have become that for our entire species begging us to worship at the altar of fear begging us to bow down at the altar of terror and so to me I think what you're saying regarding the toxic quality of the internet it reminds me of that it's almost an initiation or something where humanity as a whole has to do the very same thing that Jesus did in the desert Buddha did under the Bodhi tree which is to like just look at the phone and say I see you Mara get me behind me Satan I know what you are but god damn I can't do it you're supposed to invite the phone in for tea I think or something like that what does nobody Buddha did but yeah Buddha said look at your phone when you're having tea with your friends yes yes look I think man it's so many amazing ideas I agree that the internet as an initiation now that is an amazing idea you once told me that what if the next messiah was a meme and something I've thought about a lot since you threw that out there and I'm like and it starts to just play around like what is a messiah and it's sort of a revelatory mechanism in a way and in some ways people have to look at the internet as a great amplifier it's sort of like a psychedelic it's sort of like by using internet you're dosing every day but you're not paying any attention to set and setting who gave you the drugs where are they from how long is it going to last does this interact with the other one does Facebook play along well with Snapchat you know drug interactions and so perhaps like the conspiracy stuff it's almost like a symptom of people trying to explain or just try to give meaning to something that I don't know it's like it's too literal it's too simplistic of something it's like it's too psychedelic you can't put your finger on it quit trying, quit saying oh it's a cabal it is just a group of men and they're in charge and they're white and they're evil it's like that would be nice because we could just bomb them they'll just die or you know so it's sort of a snake eating its own tail and but it's all like you said it's always been that way it's now super amplified and I think people's job now on a personal level is to just grab the reins of your own consciousness just to open your own goddamn eyes to see what it is that sometimes is enough you ever heard about people in chronic pain and they can it's psychosomatic pain but they think it's back pain or they think it's this kind of pain and they someone just explains to them how it could be part of their mind and their psyche and they can write a letter about it to themselves or just knowing that and it's enough for the pain to go away it's sort of like that the awareness of the fuckery going on with your own consciousness might be enough to turn that ship a couple degrees so that now years from now you're in a completely different hemisphere yeah I think so I think it really is just like imagine some weird world where people didn't know that whiskey was alcohol but that's one of the main things that everyone's drinking so everyone's throwing around fucking why do we feel like shit why do I smell so bad what's going on why are we all like this why can't I do math every day this is why we're acting like we're drunk and then you're like oh maybe we need to like change what we're drinking or stop drinking or whatever similarly with the internet just that the acknowledgement like come on you're getting high don't tell me you're fucking sober if you're on instagram all day long or do you really believe that you got a snore or shoot or like smoke something for that to count as a drug that's that to me is it and then also the other thing you're saying that I love is like in the same way like if you're gonna do a drug test that shit unless like the person giving it to you you've known forever they it's just test your shit so you don't get sick or worse and so you know I think that in particular with the internet is like doing a what you're saying makes you think of like oh yeah you need to do like a at the very least of the poshness scan of your social media body like check it out what's going on there because this is my dumb realization that I had a few days ago is like I'm like realizing like I'm fucking annoyed man all these QAnon people are there stupid they invaded the conspiracy world now it's like all of which it was my favorite world but they've like warped it into a ruined it yeah licking president worship which was never part of what was about but but uh then I realized like wait I'm following these accounts you know what I mean like I the reason I'm getting upset about it is not like a fucking raven is flying into my window being like trust the plan trust the plan Trump is gone because I'm on the internet and I've dialed it in you know what I'm saying so to me it's something like a purge so to speak like if you if you practice mindfulness when you look at your phone and when you put your phone down you're feeling disturbed because of some shitty information you get where did the information come from oh it came from that fucking account I've been following for no reason for the last three years it is strobing bad data into my brain so yeah I think that they're just you don't have to cancel your facebook just block everything on the facebook that's making you feel bad and then then suddenly it becomes like there's a few if you're on instagram and you're getting like instafomo or whatever they talk about general loathing sense of humanity it may just be that there's three accounts you're following you could follow all monks at this point on twitter monks I wonder like who would have accounts these days if they were still alive sometimes at face value it's hard not to see how obvious instagram is literally the way it all started was like literally life through filters that was the whole point of it we're going to augment things to look better that's all it is and of course sometimes your own life is going to feel a bit shittier because it's never as glossy the fact that we've lost track of that and then you add in the whole quantifying factor into it this is x is better than y because it's a bigger number and this idea of influence but you know influence for what we've forgotten that the primacy okay rom-dos so they asked me rogley's been bugging me to do another track but with old material and my big problem was there's too much I don't know where to start you know before when we did the album together I just put a mic up and it's like give me what you got and that's what I'll use now it's like oh there's 15,000 hours of recording we've settled on it I found a talk and I collaborated with another artist I wish I could tell you who it is but I can't yet but it's one of my idols I'm just blowing my mind that this is even happening I'm sorry Bob Marley and in the sample rom-dos says like the real work is in the privacy of your own heart and it's so true though we've gotten lost in how many people you influence is clearly more important because you're clearly now talking to more people but it's like yes but that's the Maya because you know none of that matters because the real work is in the privacy of your own heart and only you have the litmus test to say how well that's going you're the only judge and jury and to me it's like that's what we're losing a bit of that everything else is the judge of who we are and our worth and our influence when there's only real one influence the rest is just icing on the cake yeah that is so cool man it's like in the way I mean theoretically because of the neocortex because of the rapid evolution of the human brain suddenly we have this thought continuum and where it's kind of us but it's not us we have this never ending it's we yeah yeah we and so people believe they're their thoughts and they're connected their thoughts and now it's almost like social media has become an exteriorization of that very same problem oh totally so now it's like you're not your social media and you're not your thoughts it's like neither of these things really mean that much if anything at all but god you know it's so fascinating what you're saying because how easy is it to just believe that the world that you're seeing in your phone is the real world and how easy to think that because you're having some effect on a digital world in your phone that you're having any real impact on the world that you're in right now how you know it's easy to think that oh yeah you got a bunch of retweets or you made a meme that got popular your tiktok has got a zillion views whatever the fucking metric is you're using and in that you get some false satisfaction like it worked I did it what'd you do it is the real world in a sense because you made it your real world like and so it's you're choosing your world it just doesn't add up to much it's digital candy I mean it tastes good in the moment but then it's gone and if anything it actually feels shitty afterwards and that's how you were talking about how it's messing with our whole this whole space suit that we're in that's a chemical system it's just another form of coffee or LSD or heroin it's just digital and we're not fully recognizing and we know this to be true quite literally in our brain it's chemicals so I mean it's a way of getting high people need to be honest about that and I'm not judging getting high but it's like you know try putting your phone down and not touching it first thing in the morning and going and peeing having breakfast doing everything you do and it's how long can you last and it'll show you how strong that connection is in your synapses man that that's pretty much I think that is the exercise that's it if you want to do a modern form of vipassana digital vipassana yeah get up in the morning don't look at your phone and then look at that itch for me the way Satan my phone is the it's always there's a good reason I gotta see what time it is what I mean or I need to check my talent time even suddenly knowing what time it is becomes the most important thing or you know that moment where you're like fuck what day is this to me those are good signs if you don't know what day it is sign of success you've made it you're doing great way to go like you're free of the burden of time but then of course you're not just looking at it for time what's on your calendar that day you're within moments you're going to be absorbed in god knows what this is a really dark few days ago my wife and I were both in arguments with different people online on our phones hanging out with each other but we weren't each other at all we're like debating people for something just like both of us are all tense you know what I mean and she's like are you are you in a fight online right now and I'm like yeah me too it was terrible bad but yeah you know I think that yeah we all have to take responsibility for the fact that we're guilty of breaking the number one rule when it comes to vampirism vampire only goes where it's invited and your phone if you don't have it calibrated is a fucking vampire alien thing answering with parasitic memes that it's just what is it you might as well instead of a phone why not just get one of those face suckers from fucking aliens and just show that's how we fix it that should be what the phone is it's a slimy wet thing that like you have to put it on your face to actually look at social media and it shoves some phallic probiscous thing down into your fucking stomach and that's the only way to check the time yeah you pull it off it's 115 guys 115 yeah um I heard if you make your phone monochrome Tristan Harris mentioned this it takes about 10 to 15% less addictive just like little just the color and the dazzlingness of the color and the lights lights up less of that in your brain it's nuts but like let's talk about the actual anecdotes because they're not they're real they're accessible and I know people have heard them but it actually really does work yeah let's hear it it's everything that's the opposite polarity what is the phone made of the substrate of things in the natural world go to the natural world that's the direct source take a walk walk around the neighborhood take some deep breaths if you have the time go get on some trees or some open landscapes you will feel awesome you know many people know this other forms of direct experience anything that's off a screen like creativity is a big one if you feel like you're not a creative being write a letter you will feel fantastic after you mail that letter it takes 10 minutes not everyone loves mail it goes on and on cook something call a friend or zoom a friend have sex my friend who's in a happy marriage with kids the only person I shouldn't say only but one of my only friends that's truly happily married his only piece of advice is don't stop fucking it's simple you know but it's just engage in these things that light up the natural being that you are and they're all around us it's just creating that balance and you will face resistance just like any form of like exercise but you don't carry around like a nature walk in your back pocket like you do a phone and so it's just I'm guilty of it as much as anybody we're cyborgs and that's part of our future we just now need to bring more grace to it we've just been like little kids running around hammers hitting everything and now we need to understand like wait a minute if I hit certain things I could build a house hit other things I'm gonna kill you yeah right yeah we just have to learn how to use it we are learning we are learning it's just like some of us are kicking and screaming a bit more because we're not really being honest about how the full experience of that cigarette you know if you're really honest about it it's not a net positive perhaps and you need to shift how you smoke or don't smoke to make it truly in the privacy of your own heart your decision about like I know what makes me feel good it makes me a better god damn person in this world and what doesn't thank you so much for your time today what a wonderful conversation thank you it's so good to see you man I missed you chat with you can you tell folks where they can find you well on the internet I know I gotta stop asking the question it's like I don't know why I do that it's like a ritual you know what if you want to find me there's two ways I'd recommend one is right before you go to bed say East Forest three times in your mind and I hopefully will meet up Astroly if that doesn't work and you have access to well sourced psilocybin some part of my being will attend and we can have tea together so follow East Forest on psilocybin I'll have to do that in the astral plane and I'm going to be a good partner and the only website I'm going to mention is my partner Rada Marissa Rada believe.com it's a new site but she released a guided meditation album and I did the music and mixed it and mastered it for it and it's lovely and it's free it's lovely and free it's a little tool out there if you want to ground out check her out watch out y'all these people are spiritual blasters he sounds really calm about it but I guarantee whatever it is is going to knock your socks off I'll have the links at duckatrustle.com online sorry and thank you I really appreciate this chat man it was like yeah I really needed to hear it my cheeks are actually a little sore because I

404^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - 541: Lisa Romero Transcript and Discussion^2022-12-12^At Progressive, we know how much you love your recreational vehicles, so we decided to record this commercial in an RV with a family on vacation. Mom, who are these people? Oh, that's Flo and Jamie. They're recording a commercial, sweetie. Don't they do that in the studio? Oh, normally, but we wanted to feature a family who bundled their home in RV and saved with Progressive. Um, yeah, it looks like you're all out of chips. Okay, I think we'll just drop you off at the next gas station. Bundle your home and other vehicles with Progressive. Progressive Casualty Insurance Company affiliates and other insurers discounted on available in all states or situations. Greetings, friends. It is I. D. True Cell, and this is the Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour podcast. Number one, I'm sorry. I'm sorry if the audio is a little weird right now. If you hear too many birds behind me, too many fountains. If you hear too many waves crashing, perhaps you even hear the sound of a whale singing far beneath the Hawaiian sea, technically the Pacific Ocean. I'm in Hawaii. This is my last couple of days of vacation, but I wanted to check in with you and say, hi, we'll be back next week with the normal, incredibly complex, beautiful, nuanced, subtle, powerful, sonically invigorating intros to the DTFH. For now, I'm just here to say aloha. I love you, and I'm really excited for you to listen to this conversation I had with the incredible Lisa Romero. I met Lisa during an episode of a podcast with my friend Connor Habib and was so taken with how mystical she is and brilliant she is that I asked her to come on the DTFH. And she did. And what you're about to listen to is a conversation we had about the astral realm, that liminal space that some of us go to in our dreams. Some people go to it on high doses of psychedelics, and some people intentionally travel there using various means such as yoga or astral projection. We talked about this place and how it can actually be a little bit of a sand trap, a place you can get stuck in when you start taking up whatever discipline, mystical, spiritual practice you're drawn to. And we talked about what lies beyond this place. If you enjoyed this conversation with Lisa Romero, I would invite you to check out her website at innerworkpath.com. You can check out one of her awesome books such as A Bridge to Spirit, Understanding Conscious Self-Development and Consciousness Altering Substances. You'll hear us talk a little bit about that during this conversation. Or the Inner Work Path. There's lots there at innerworkpath.com. You can also take a course with Lisa, hang out with Lisa during private sessions, all of this stuff you can find at innerworkpath.com. Now everybody, welcome to the DTFH, Lisa Romero. Lisa, welcome to the DTFH. How are you doing? Very well. Thanks for having me here. I'm so glad you're here. You know, I was thinking how, someone like you, how do we even dive in? Let's just go right to the deep end. I've got a question for you. I realize that doesn't, if it does get answered, it's never answered in a concise way. And it's one of these things that you hear all the time in the spiritual world. So my question for you, what is waking up? What does that mean? Everyone's always talking about waking up. What does that even mean? If you had to define waking up from the spiritual perspective, how would you define that? Yeah, that's, it's a great question because you could, in one way, ask that question several times on the path of awakening. So first, the first awakening that you might understand, or we may all understand, is the sense that this reality, as we know it, the sense perceptible world. And that's not all there is. So that might be the first awakening for someone. Okay. But then there are also other awakenings where you experience yourself within other realms of consciousness. And that may be another kind of awakening. And then there is what might archetypically be called the sort of awakening of the higher eye, the sort of wiser consciousness in yourself that you know is not your everyday personal particular self. So it's possible that this idea of waking up isn't answerable in one, for everyone, at the same point in the, on the path. And I think that's a really significant point for where we are as a collective today, because we can't just give one answer in the fact that we're all at different points or places or even different perspectives on the journey. So what is waking up for you, what is waking up for me? And that's, I think, important to ask today, because it's not the same for everyone, even though we might have this kind of collective idea of enlightenment, for instance, the idea of awakening to the true nature of your eternal being. But that's not how it is for everyone today. And that old, older path of the illumination or the enlightenment of, in the Eastern traditions, that once it occurred, that was it, as it's very different today. We're in a certain way, we could call the new mysteries, and these new mysteries mean that we're all working individually on the awakening that allows that allows each one of us to take our next step. New mysteries. Yeah, you know, it's, it, it's interesting to think about sort of the times before certain systems appeared in the world, you know, that before Buddhism, there was, you know, Hinduism, and there were all, you know, obviously all of the, like, thriving religions that, you know, were aware of, and probably zillions that we will never, ever know about, that were sort of the spinning rainbow wheel, like on your computer, as the mind of so many people is trying to process what it means to exist as a human. And then it manifests as Buddhism or it manifests as hermeticism or all the, all of the different lineages and paths. So it's, it's interesting for me to hear you say that that could be happening right now, that we're actually doing that collectively. Is that what you mean? Like we're all sort of processing even more that could lead to some kind of, I don't know, a new thing, a new path, a new religion. Is that what you mean? I wouldn't call it necessarily a new religion, because in a certain sense religion has this connotation of a sort of blind faith. And I think when the evolution of human consciousness, we're not really willing to do that in the same way anymore. And that's why I really think this individual awakening is essential, because you need to know this is really true for you on some level. Now, of course, you know, that's not necessarily, that's easier said than done, because depends again, where you are on the path of your own unfolding, how easy it is to accept that. But in a certain way, we can see that everybody's trying to find a reality that is really true for them. And in a certain sense, you could say a meaning of life that is true for them. Right. Well, yes, I mean, or just a truth that's true for them, right? Like, just that alone, it seems like people discovering some kind of stable reality that isn't based on the like insane speed at which things are going right now, meaning that one thing seems true one day, the next day. Oh, no, actually, they found out that's not true at all. And so it can create, I think, a lot of insecurity for people for just sort of plugging into some kind of, I could see how just finding a truth, if I think you could make a fairly good comparison between popular culture, addiction to popular culture, and the mode of perception it creates to like a frenetic sort of dream state, like a literal, you know, when you've, I don't know, had too much coffee, but you managed to fall asleep, and you have that crazy kind of dreaming. You know, it's like that is can be your waking life. If you were adhering too much or plugging in too much to the you know, consensus reality, default reality. Yeah, so I guess. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. I think we would say people are restless because we are constantly stimulated by a restless world. Right. But you know, I think that's why a lot of people are turning towards practice, meditation and so forth, to find that center, which is at rest, that is at peace. And in a certain sense, it's becoming almost like a necessity to, to manage this world, which on one hand is an ethatising, because we forget who we are and why we're here. And on the other hand, creates an over-stimulation, which almost sound like contradictions to each other. But yeah, it is quite something to navigate the times that we're living in. It really is. You know, in the like desert religions, you get this, you know, God's pissed a lot of the time. And one of the things you want to piss God off idolatry, you know, like worshiping false idols, and I literalism is annoying. But you know, it's like, at least in the old days, if you were going to worship some golden cow, theoretically, like you, you had the cow, there was a place you went with a golden cow. You knew it. Like there's no mystery about it. You're worshiping this thing, whatever. But these days, it would be easy to think you're not engaged in idolatry. It would be easy to think you're a modern person. You know, when you're bowing down in this bizarre modern temple to these like ideas that are not very alive and certainly not sustainable, you know, so that's to me. And yet simultaneously, while all this is going on, there is something else, something else happening, something to me that if you become hyper addicted to this stuff, which I have, when you start making contact with it, it's astounding, even though it's maybe the most normal thing there is, it's astounding. That's why I asked you about waking up because I'm curious how dream I know you mentioned these phases of waking up. I'm just curious from your own experience, how dramatic can this wake up be? Like how, how much can we wake up from this strange, illusionary, confusing temple where we're all sort of bowing down to a kind of, I don't know, chameleon-like, ever-changing, hypnotic phantom? Yeah. Well, I mean, it is interesting that it's almost done found in what we do with our time and energy, what we call life in a way. And certainly that expression arises from a certain awakening that can happen. And so, you know, these new mysteries, which really are connected to the heart, in a certain sense, you could say the heart is the new mystery temple. But as we work into that place in our own being, we have to ask ourselves, what is the questions of life that are most closely connected to you? Because that tells you something about the responses you'll get from the mystery itself. Wow. So, you know, the meaning of life really depends on the questions you hold most deeply about what is life for you. In a certain way, but to use a sort of slightly eastern expression, you could ask this question, a grain of wheat, does it ask the question, does the sun shine on me? Now, that is a question that someone might be asking today about the spiritual realities. But then another stalk or another grain might say, well, what do I do with this solar energy? It's a totally different question because they don't ask, does the sun shine on me? They know the sun shines. They know the spiritual world exists. So, it's not a question of does the sun shine. It's more, what do I do with this? Someone else might ask, well, how do I best transform this energy that's given to me? Right. Or someone else may be asking, will I give my life for the growth of another? And it's a completely different question. But the question itself says something about the meaning that will be in your life because it's the question in your own heart. And this is one of the greatest difficulties we have is finding our questions. What really is your question? And then how do you, first of all, live with your question? Not answer it. Just live with it. Because just being able to live with your question starts to awaken you to something about what's important in life. And then, you know, I wouldn't hurry to answer it because you've got to be able to also live the response. And the response is a really interesting thing, isn't it? Because the response tells us that, yeah, what will I be asked of, of myself, if I really find my own heart's question? And so these new mysteries have something really potent about them because in the past, you know, the awakening was for the chosen few. And some schools of thought still like to hold on to that old notion. But we now know that's really not the reality we're experiencing. It's not an uncommon thing to have varying degrees of waking up to the truth of who we are and why we're here and in the ways that we do. And that extraordinary capacity that each of us actually have within us means that it's no longer for the chosen few, but it is really for the many. But are we willing to go that journey when it does not necessarily make life more comfortable or more easy or more full of the traditional gains that we've seen to be, well, that the world tells us it's what we should be aiming for.

So what is your question, do you reckon? My question is, how could this possibly be real? I mean, my question would be I guess it's a little cynical, but a sense of, I think a lot of people, I don't know if a lot of you, I don't know, I almost speak for a lot of people, but for me, I love, since I'm a kid, I've just been really interested in all kinds of spirituality, all forms, magic, Christianity, Buddhism, you name it. I've loved all of it and it still never gets old. I love reading it. But I think that I've, a lot of the time reading it, I've thought to myself, this is just a game people play before they die, kind of fun way to amuse yourself during your human incarnation, but I don't know how much of it's real. And then you get a little more interested. So you start, all right, well, I'll start practicing this meditation thing or whatever, and nothing happens because it doesn't happen fast like other things. But then maybe you brush shoulders with something and you realize, wait a minute, it's real. And it's astounding, that's astounding. But then this is where I'm at, it's like, come on, you're tricking yourself here, friend. You didn't, there wasn't, that wasn't, even though you, and I don't mean real, like when you're tripping and you see whatever, though that can be real. I'm talking about more of a kind of long-term, you just sort of watch your life change for the better. You know what I mean? That thing where you're like, shit, what is going on here? Like, where is that? Could this possibly actually be progress? You know, where am I fooling? That would be my question. And then, you know, aspects of it, I don't even want to publicly talk about necessarily, but just things where you're like, come on, that is incredible, but come on. So I feel very, it's not like me, but I feel quite reserved and like going, giving all the details about it. But I think you grok what I'm saying. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And what you're saying is incredibly common, because those first encounters with what is real, and because of the nature of it, it throws up a kind of doubt. And it's interesting, because a lot of the time when I'm working with people on meditation and in the development, many things that they have as experiences, they don't recognize to be a part of the path, but are actually signposts of progress. So one of the things that often people encounter on the path of their own development is they realize in a way how little love lives in me. And that recognition is actually so painful to bear, but it's actually because something in you is now able to perceive that there has been a change in your capacity. Now, it can be daunting to experience that, but it is also a sign that true meditation is taking place, because we see, for instance, how we love to overestimate ourselves and put others down and see ourselves as great and grand. And as you perceive all those things, it's really not easy, but that's actually a sign of having a different orientation in yourself. If you're unable to perceive all that, then perhaps you haven't yet started on those steps. So experiencing doubt, experiencing even it interestingly enough, experiencing a depth of fear that leads to a kind of atheism is also a part of a spiritual experience. And yet, so because we're getting this idea that a spiritual experience will all be about bliss and wonder, we miss so many of the signposts that progress itself is taking place. Even, for instance, there's a point in your meditative life where you can feel like there's like six radio stations going off all at once, you're never going to have silence, all you've got is more thought than ever before. But actually, that happens when you first start to loosen into this slightly body, it's not body less, but not as body bound in your consciousness as you were. The first thing you experience in a way is the highways and byways of astral life. And it is noisy, very noisy. And most people think I'm getting nowhere. But actual fact, there is movement. And it is most of the time, we're not attuned to understanding the various experiences that may occur. And absolutely doubt is one of them. But then you get to a point where you just, you do not ask the question, does the sun shine on me? You go, it's there. I know it's there. What's it? What's it? Well, the spiritual world are the other dimension of being and eternal consciousness. There are many ways of which you will perceive it. And that's the interesting thing. I mean, this isn't supposed to be real. You know, that's the thing, Lisa, you know, it's not supposed to be real. Like, if it's true, the, you know, you hear it again and again, and it's pleasant, the veil that separates this realm from the next. There is a lot going on that you're not seeing. A lot going on that you're not seeing, which isn't the most pleasant thing, even though it's cool to read it in a book. You know, it's like, I don't want an invisible person living in my house. You know what I mean? The idea that there's some possibility that there are things about that are aware of you, that you're not aware of them, and that there, it seems to be maybe a little bit more purpose to things than you might have originally thought. I mean, there's a lot of comfort and chaos. I know that sounds nuts, but you know, if everything's just pointless, meaningless, cosmic, sentience, bubbling about before it dies, you know what I mean? Like, great. That's kind of great in its own dark way. But if we are talking about some bizarre, I don't know, Hogwarts for whatever we are, some of evolutionary temple or some kind of place where there's like, not just teachers who, you know, are in bodies, but like teachers who talk to the teachers in bodies. What? And then, yeah, I know what you're saying. Then what? And then what do you do? What comes after that? Like, what? And then especially if you can't forget it, like at least if you're like high as a kite, and you, and you like catch some glimpse of a thing when you come down, you're like, those are really great mushrooms. But what do you do when it didn't happen because of the mushrooms, Lisa, you know, then what? Well, so in here, you know, while you're talking about the various planes, the first plane, you could talk about that as the spiritual atmosphere of the earth is full of a lot of junk mail and full of a lot of thoughts and forms that actually belong much more to our human consciousness, our hopes and fears of wishes and desires. And in a certain way, it's the psychic realm. And most people working with meditation are not trying to hang out there. And you're not trying to, you know, there's a difference between national travel, for instance, then a continuation of consciousness. And so you're not really trying to work to take your particular personality that's formed to this incarnation and play around in that atmosphere. That is a path that some people take. But I'm not really sure for what reason, maybe it's entertainment, but it is not the path that leads necessarily to real wisdom. It will give you personal and certainly experience, but it's a curiosity that I would be cautious of because of what exists in those realms. So meditative life usually tries to bring us above that atmosphere, above the junk mail and to the point where you could say you enter into a school in where you know, for instance, you have a trustworthy guidance and you know you have a trustworthy guidance because the benevolent nature of this connection you have to this consciousness that is developed. And so that's a very different process. Now, I know in the realm of magic and so forth, working on the astral plane could be advantageous around certain creation of form and so forth. But that's not really the goal of the path of awakening. The path of awakening isn't about the astral plane, it's really to work into the realm where those beings that support the progress of humanity and support your individual progress and the collective progress are working from. And you know, in some schools of thought, maybe in esoteric Christianity, we take about that as the hierarchies, the spiritual angelic hierarchies. But you can, it's not really the name, but their way of being in relationship to our being that is the most important. So there is a difficulty and that is to get from where we are in this realm of sense perceptible consciousness where everything I touch and feel seems to be the only reality. And to get to that plane of being where you absolutely know you are a spiritual being among spiritual beings, you have to cross this threshold. And this threshold is where a lot of people get caught up. And this threshold in an interesting way is being encountered by a lot more people in this world today than ever before. Again, that threshold would have in itself been entered into by the chosen few, now the many are going there. And if you don't go there prepared, consequences can be states of deep anxiety, states of depression, states of sensing that there's no ground under your feet. You're not certain of where you stand in what's true, what's not true. And that process of that threshold up is getting stronger in the world. And so we really need to begin, I think, to have a language or an understanding for what these different planes of being are so that people can make sense of some of the experiences they're having, and also strangely not take them too personally. Because it's a part of the path, but we need to know how to get through that threshold, not hang out there. I want to wish it on my worst enemy that I know what the highways and byways of actual life are like, and it is really difficult to endure. But going through there, now that's different. Can I get some confirmation from you? I want to talk about getting through it because I hear you and I'm totally like, it's like, do we need, we already have enough problems like dealing with the people in this world, like I don't need a whole new batch of people I have to deal with or whatever you want to call it. But I want to talk about a dream. It's like, so here's the dream, and I'm not going to earbeat you with a long dream, it wasn't that long, but it was, you know, sort of you imagine, you hear the astral plane, another thing you hear all the time waking up the astral plane, you hear this stuff a lot. In the dream, I have gone into the astral realm, some part of it, at least in the dream, there's cities, there's cities, buildings, people living in the buildings. I'm hanging out with these people living in a kind of bohemian apartment or something, but it's in the astral realm. They're doing some kind of drug. They're amused by me. And one of them says, we do the same things here that you do there. Like, you know, seeming like what you think with it over here is different at all. We have countries, states, buildings, the whole like, this is just, you know, I think they liked it there better. They didn't see it as stuck or anything like that. I think they felt a little more free or less encumbered or something. But there was a sort of, they seemed like they thought they were hot shit. But not in a weird way, just kind of like when you meet really cool people, you know, that thing. And then I woke up. I remember that dream all the time. And I think, my God, is that it? Is that what it is? Is that what's going on over there? It's just like what's happening here. No, no, that is that realm between the earth and the moon, we could say, you know, in a spatial sense. That's the astral plane. And, you know, you have to get beyond there. Beyond there is where the real schooling occurs. But unfortunately, or fortunately, because, you know, it's different people's destinies, people do get a little caught up there. Now, I was one of those people where I, you know, I had a very natural sensitivity that I was very clear that, you know, I'm over my own thinking. So why do I want to know what someone else is thinking in the sense of, you know, surely just increasing my story into knowing all about your story on that astral level is not what spiritual development is really about. But there are certainly scores of thought that like to work in that realm. But it is a semblance. It isn't real. It's formulated out of the stuff that lives in us. That's why it looks so familiar. But will you understand the lawfulness of karma there? No. Will you understand that the depths of what the law of love is there? No. Will you understand all the real mysteries that totally transform your life there? No. What you understand there is lots of processes about the human soul and the forces that get involved with that. Certain group souls of animals also can be met there and certain elemental forms can be met there. And it is a very, very, very difficult place to navigate. But I certainly don't spend any time trying to hang out there. My senses and it's my understanding that we have to go through that threshold. And it's very, very difficult to, when you see people that are kind of half caught there, there's really sometimes no difference between that individual and someone with a psychosis at times because it is so shattering to the psyche for some people. So yeah, look, if you've got a doorway there, my suggestion for anyone that has a doorway there is go beyond that. Once you have that real sense of what the spiritual world is in its higher form of love and truth and all that it really brings the human being as true sustenance, it strengthens you in a way where you can take hold of this life very differently. We're not trying to create a metaverse with our spiritual development. We're really trying to find those powers that really are the evolution of the human being. Now, the difficult thing is that there is some human being, those powers and forces that connect to the evolution of the human being. Because the power of love is an extraordinary power. The difficulty is that there is some relationship to this realm that we're talking about as the astral world. It's sometimes called the elemental world. It has named differently in different schools, but there is certain experiences there that are illuminating, but it's not the goal for the evolution of the soul. For my definite in my experiences, you would not want to put anyone there unprepared. You should really try to go through to the place where you find the solidity and truth of your spiritual life, and then it's much more manageable. It seemed a little grimy over there to me. It definitely didn't seem like I get it, but it seems like I could see how if you became obsessed with it. All my teachers say the same thing. They're like, don't waste your time. But I could see how if you became adept at going there, not randomly in a dream, but you could learn how to do it, which I know you can. And that became your obsession. I could see how you would become kind of like an outflow pipe for some really weird shit into this realm. You would be putting out all kinds of odd stuff that I could see could probably give you some power. It could probably give you a little bit of swagger or something because you have this entire new group of people or elementals or whatever it is out there that you are now like you're in a bigger weird community. I could see how you get into that. But this other place, to me, that's some echo or maybe we're an echo of the astral realm. I don't know how or maybe we echo off each other. But to me, where it does get astounding, where it gets really interesting is what you're talking that post whatever that is. That's what I'm talking about. To me, that's wild. Because that thing through there, it makes you feel a little transparent or something here, less real or less condensed as you thought you were in a good way, not a bad way. Absolutely. In everyday life, in a way, this is a sleep compared to how awake your consciousness is in those other planes. Yeah. And there's quite something really to perceive that.

When you, in everyday life in a way, this is a sleep compared to how awake your consciousness is in those other planes. And that's quite something really to perceive that. Yeah. Yeah. And I'm interested when you were saying about love being inside of you. Or how is, is love even inside you anyway? I mean, isn't it more like some emanation or something? I mean, is it like a sun? Are we talking about some kind of sun thing here? Or like, this sounds nuts. I'm sorry, everybody. You don't get to talk to people like this that often. So forgive me. The sun, obviously. Whoa. It's like, I love looking at like the solar observatories of the sun. And just like, that's what makes food grow here. That thing is crazy. It seems alive to me. You look at it, it seems like the movement of the plasma is sentient or something. It's got like a, it doesn't seem unintentional. I don't know what it's doing, but it seems up to something. I don't mean that. And I'm not, I don't mean up to something like an nefarious way, but like, you know, like when you're watching animals or when you're watching anything that's got sentience, it's like, you might not know what the squirrel is up to, but it's doing something. So anyway, is this other, this post place outside of that astral realm? Is it a sun? Is it, is it, is it a love sun or something? That's a great, that's a great expression. But you know, the sun alchemically is the heart, right? And so when you're in the earthly plane, you know, you, you perceive your heart, this is your heart. But in the spiritual plane, the sun is your heart. But we all say my heart to the same sun. That's an extraordinary picture. So yes, it's, it, this is what's so profound. Is it in me outside of me? Well, there's becomes no division in those realms of being. And the sun is an extraordinary picture of that, because it has light, which is, you know, esoterically recognized to be connected to wisdom. It has the warmth, which is love. And it also has this life, which, you know, gives life. So this, this strength, these three forces of wisdom, love and strength that we really know we're on the right path as they're growing in us. And they're, they're, they're, that's when I talk about those powers in us, because they're not really in us. They are just a part of our ability to can't be a conduit for that force that is actually accessible to all souls. And again, I'm going to say it's not for the chosen few. It really is not any longer. It is, we are now a point where if we choose to, we can unfold these capacities. The greatest difficulty is getting through that threshold where many things rise through that abyss. And a lot of people hang out there thinking that's it, but actually that's really a semblance of something that is a distraction from what is the real heart of spiritual life. What a crazy thing that there's another son. That's crazy. And then you, it doesn't strike me as something that it seems quantifiable. Like it doesn't, it seems like at some point it may be part of what you're saying that this, I mean, what an amazing secret. There's another son. You know, there's probably a better name for it, but there's, if you think the sun's incredible, wait, wait, just wait, there's another one that no one can see that's informing everything in a specific way. Yeah. Yeah, there's a beautiful, I think this comes out of the Bhagavad Gita, which says, more radiant than the sun, purer than the snow, finer than the ether is the self, spirit in my heart. I am this self, this self am I. Wow. And that is an extraordinary, meditative verse that can help us cross that threshold, because when you're holding those pictures in your consciousness, you're not up to the highways and biways of astral life. You're not trying to work out if someone's having an affair with someone else or how to influence somebody's and have power over them. All that crap that does not belong there is dissolved in those words that carry us across that astral plane and have us resound with the truth of what spiritual life is. And that's the interesting thing, is that if you don't carry in your heart the echoes of the true spiritual world, then it isn't illuminated necessarily to you. It will just be empty. But if you carry in your heart what is true to it, then it resounds back. And that's what we experience. What is in your heart? What's your true question? What is truly in your heart? Because that's actually going to be what reflects back when you enter into the spiritual realms. And that's how this thing is getting through the astral plane. Crossing the threshold is difficult. We know obviously we have to encounter our own shadow, all the things in us that can't cross because they belong to the constructs of our earthly existence. But what can cross is that which in the depths of your soul already resounds and sounds with the truth of spiritual life. Lisa, could it kill you? Could you theoretically just by some stroke of luck or something cross the like maybe it's not as difficult to cross the threshold. You've been to Burning Man. You've been to the raves. You're not tricked by the astral realm. You know what's going on here. It's the same thing. But no offense, burners or whatever. But I've never seen a more physical manifestation of the astral realm than Burning Man. But suddenly there's this sun, this place. Could it kill you? Could you meditate yourself to death? In other words, because you've found a way to encounter this space and because the space seems just like that beautiful verse in the Gita, not different from you at all. Is it possible that your wife or husband or friend or cake could walk in and you're just sort of slumped over because you just left? Is that a danger? I'm not exaggerating the question. Is it possible that that could kill you? No, it can't kill you, no. But let me say more about that. One, is that part of you that you wakes up there was never born and never dies. It cannot kill you in itself. Yourself is eternal. But this part of you that is living in this existence is likely to end its life when it can learn no more. So could it be that you conclude all of your learning for a particular spiritual experience that you then leave the body? It's unlikely that it's going to happen in that way. I know that there are masters that choose to leave this existence because you can. But most of the time what occurs is this relationship between being in the spiritual world, which you are every night, sleep is the little brother of death. And every night you go to sleep and you enter into the spiritual world. But you come back and you wake up and you might forget that and you may forget the depths of where you were, but you wake back up. Now usually in meditation, the very similar thing happens. You're in your meditation state and you come back as though and you wake right back up into yourself. So you don't ever have to fear that. I think that there's certain things that can happen on that actual plane that can really disturb people, but not in the spiritual world. You know, we've got this picture of sleep is the little brother of death and humour is the little sister of love. And what's interesting about these two forces of sleep and humour is that they loosen us from ourselves a little bit. We don't have to kind of be so bound to ourselves and we do that with sleep every day. And you know, humour is one of the ways we do it through life. Being able to not be so serious about our personal, particular existence and find our ways to find this, really engage with life that we're meeting, but deepen our relationship to the spiritual world. A younger version of me would have for sure only wanted to hang out there. Like for sure. Like I get it, it's sticky, but this, this, it's good to hear. I think that there's something really curious and relieving when you, when you realize what you're talking about. This, this, there's a part of you that really isn't quite here the way you think you are. I mean, you are here, no doubt about it. You're the, you're in Ireland. I'm here in Texas. We have bodies. We have to walk around eating all that, but that can become really quite heavy if you, if you think that's all, all that's going on. And so I think there's really something quite beautiful and poignant about this possibility in a human life that if you wanted to, you could through some practice actually sort of die and stay alive, even though being alive won't be quite as important, right? Like that's, it's, it's not as, I don't mean it's a nihilistic way or, you know, drop way. What, I mean, it just becomes less like severe or something, you know, which is really quite wonderful, you know, if you're married especially. Yeah. But it's so, it's so imagine this, imagine how enriching a spiritual life is for you as an individual. And then imagine if those impulses that enrich your life would actually change, for instance, agriculture would actually change medicine, would actually have an effect on education. Imagine a world where spiritual impulses are helped to shape and take form to enrich the world in which we live in. And I think that's where we are really attempting to participate. Because if we don't participate in the spiritual world, how would we bring those resources, those riches back into our, into our earthly life, even into our conversations or even into the way of which we, for instance, perceive an illness and want to bring a healing to that illness process. Everything changes when you have a new way of seeing and understanding. You know, as far as the earthly world is concerned, illness is wrong and you have to stop it. But it's not the whole picture. It's not the whole picture. Illness can be a way of progressing something in yourself that would be impossible to do so unless you had suffered and overcome that suffering. I mean, we know in itself the immune system is developed through the overcoming of things, not by being put in a big plastic bubble. And there is something really true in the human being's ability to meet and overcome instead of, you know, not have to have any of those experiences.

Thank you, Bluetooth. I just want to give, I want to read this quote from Rudolf Steiner, who's someone that I find extraordinary in the way he views his cosmology, or has bought the cosmology. He says, if life continues without the stimuli that comes from the spiritual world, industry can go on, banks can continue to exist, as well as universities where all the sciences are taught and other professions can be developed. But everything will lead to decadence and brutality and the fall of civilization. And that's a really interesting thing. What happens if we don't enliven this world with the impulses of the spirit that only can come through the human being? So if you, you know, the richness that this journey has brought to my life, I cannot say anything other than the extraordinary blessing of it. Yes, the highways and byways of the astral world have been, were and live in nightmare. They were hell. But to get beyond that and to actually understand the realities of spiritual life and to come to a new place is such a gift. But what it also gives is this impulse to actually bring about the renewal of the world around us. To be connected to the spiritual world, where those guiding benevolent spiritual forces support humanity's evolution, and to see the richness that it does to the individual's life, but then to actually bring that in permeating your own existence and therefore rippling that into the world around us, imagine the difference that would make. And I say that because there's so many forms that we understand spiritually that we go encounter in the earthly existence. So, for instance, in the spiritual world, one would say, as a spiritual being, the more you have, the more you give. So in the hierarchy of the angels, archangels, archi, and all of the great celestial hosts, the more you have, the more you give, we don't follow that lawfulness in the earthly life. In fact, there seems to be completely opposite lawfulness that we've constructed our social forms on and our monetary systems and corporations. And so as we touch into what's a true reality of the spiritual world, we could imagine creating a really humane, true-filled, beauty-filled world around us because of that. So, in that sense, we become participators of the spirit in order to carry those revelations into the world around us. And that's only human beings can do that. The angels can give us those angels can give us those impotences, those guiding thoughts, but only we transform the earth. Okay. So, Lisa, I have a question that has popped into my mind during our conversation and that has popped into my mind before, which, you know, I think the way that you've been sort of describing this cosmology, the astral realm, the possibility of crossing the abyss to this source or whatever you might want to call it, second another sun, it presents something that's slightly unnerving for me, which is, do you kick around the idea that in the same way some people want to go to the astral realm, hang out there, gain power, do all the magic stuff, the astral realm wants to come here, that there could actually be the potential for beings over there trying to influence this reality. You know, people don't like to use the term Satan, I understand why, or darkness, or evil, but I got creeped out because I started thinking, my God, is there some possibility that there are entities or forces in the astral realm that don't want people to cross the abyss, that want people to think that's all there is? Yeah. Well, yeah, that's absolutely a question we need to penetrate, because it's not only a reality that's always been, it's a reality that is getting stronger. So it's always been known that there are adversaries that work on the astral plane, that have scorn in on the astral plane and work the power there, but what is changing? And it's important to understand that the astral plane, although we can talk about it as here, we have the sensory earthly life, and then between here and the true spiritual world, we have this astral world, which has a lot of familiarities to this earthly plane, but also is extraordinarily different to it as well, depending on which of the seven realms that you're entering into the astral. But at the same time, it's not actually out there somewhere. Like you probably know for yourself, you can go to, walk into a room where people have been arguing, even though they're not arguing anymore, you've got the atmosphere. You can go to a hospital and feel the atmosphere of a hospital or a particular place, or even like a university town has a very different atmosphere. So the astral isn't just out there. So what you're expressing is actually all around us. So, but what is quickening and what is changing, what is trying to really take hold in the heart of the materialistic mind is to really believe this astral plane to be the spiritual world and to kind of take hold in such a way that we don't go through to recognize the truth from the reality of who we are. So there are certainly adverse forces really working to merge those two realms, physical astral, in such a way that it makes it harder for us to find that deepest spiritual connection. However, just as much as that's happening, there are huge supports from those higher spiritual realms for humanity right now. And it's always in a growing counterforce because that's the nature of freedom. You can't have dark forces that are darker than the light in the nature of freedom, because it just would not allow for the great unfolding of what's possible for the human being. So it's not, we shouldn't worry about it, we should understand it and know it. And my, you know, the astral for some people is an important place. For me, what's important there is that we ensure that there are light field spiritual pictures and not just this idea that it is just like a physical plane, but mostly I would say you move through, really recognize who you are and why you're here and then working from the other direction into the astral plane, from the spiritual plane into the astral, rather than from the physical where you have to meet the lowest astral plane first, you have the most spiritual impact to do something significant for those that are seekers. But once you know the other side, it's not an issue, you're never going to, well you actually, I shouldn't say you never, great ones fall back and everyone can be tempted, particularly when it comes to power. But once you really know it, it's very different, but it's all of those that are seeking. And that's why I did write that book around conscious inner development and consciousness altering substances, because many seekers are seeking to get to the spiritual plane, but where can a substance get you to? That's a really interesting question, how far can it take you on the astral plane? What then becomes interested in you? These are all questions that I think many people don't want to explore, but getting through the astral plane does require a certain amount of rigor in the sense of effort, effort of will to not just flow and just hope that something carries you. So you know, fortunately, fortunately we have a lot of support and at the same time, you could say that whatever we can do to participate, then the spiritual forces can take that forward. But if we do nothing in ourselves to engage with it, then we have to make our way slowly and surely through that astral plane. And that's a very tricky thing to do, particularly because it's been occupied by so many forces now, and it's much more familiar to people. In fact, a lot of the struggles that we have today are coming because there is this reality that humanity has started to, that the line between, the boundary between the physical sense perceptual reality in the astral world is getting thinner, more permeable, and more people are having these experiences of the astral world, but not always consciously, not even subconsciously sometimes, sometimes it's completely unconsciously, but going into that realm and not actually understanding why you're having these experiences increases things like anxiety, and we will see anxiety, depression, some very intensive processes increase unless people can wake up to the guiding light, really, that, you know, the love sun, as you called it, which is what I speak about a lot in that book, A Bridge to Spirit. And I'm not sure if you read the book or you just came to the same pictures through your own insight, and then I was like, wow, that's interesting, right there. Yeah. I feel like I could talk to you for a million hours and I plan to. I am really excited about having a session with you offline. And I think other people are going to want to connect with you too. Can you talk to people a little bit? Is that something available to folks who might be interested in sort of going a little deeper with stuff privately with you? Yeah, absolutely. I give a number of webinars and seminars and courses on inner development, and you can find all of that on my website innerworkpath.com. And there you can see how to, if you want a private session, they're usually quite an involved process. It's not, it takes a while to get that, but you can, you know, you can always send in a, put it out there and we see what unfolds. And, but my books are also available. So if you go to the website, you'll find some links to places where I'm working all the time. I like to work with the festivals because they are an exoteric picture of deep esoteric wisdom. And breaking open those is what I've been doing for years working with that. So anyone can join in those. And then I'll have particular themes. So at the beginning of 2023, I'll do a course on Western esoteric training because I think people are seeking, they don't necessarily get everything they need from the East. And there are some extraordinary pictures that really speak to how the transformation goes when you're schooled through the consciousness of the modern world. So innerworkpath.com is how you can contact me. And yeah, I believe, I'm not sure when, when is this going out? Do you know? This will be released. Whatever works for you. Tell, what works best for you, Lisa? Well, if it went out at the beginning of December, what I can do is put an offer to anyone that comes through you to get a 50% reduction off by the esoteric course that's happening in January. Wow. And that will be really helpful for anyone that just wants to touch in. It's really inexpensive anyway, but it means that you can. Great, great. Wonderful. Yeah, yeah. I'll do that for all of your, all of your visitors. Yeah, there's a lot out there. It's sometimes it's interesting to listen in to what is it you need so you can take that next step on your path. And that's often what I do in the individual sessions is working with that turning point where someone's really ready to step up. Lisa, it has been a real pleasure. You've given us a lot to think about. Thank you so much. All the links you need to finally say are going to be at dugitrussel.com. If you can't remember those. Thank you. I hope you have a wonderful time. And I hope I get to see you in person in Ireland at some point. That would be a dream. The elements here are really in harmony. So it would be wonderful to share that with you. That was Lisa Romero, everybody. Don't forget you can find her at innerworkpath.com. A tremendous thank you to our sponsors.

Greetings, my dear sweet children of the winter wind. It is I, Detrust, and now we're listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast and this intro is being recorded on December 21st, 2016. The winter solstice, the shortest day of the year, the longest night. This is the point in time where every subsequent day will be a little longer and every night a little shorter. This is why the Christians celebrate Christmas, the birth of the baby Jesus during this time of year. It's the representation of how no matter how dark your personal life may seem, no matter how rotten the civilization you've incarnated into may seem, there's always a chance that from the most unexpected of places a miracle can happen and that's real. You know it's true. The best things that have ever happened to you in life have quite often come from the places you would never expect them. Who would imagine that the king of kings would be born in a manger surrounded by filthy animals? Who would imagine that psilocybin would grow from cow manure? Who would imagine that life can in completely ridiculous ways produce answers to seemingly unsolvable problems at the very least expected time in the very least expected place. And that is the kind of world that we live in and thus faith. The reason that no matter how miserable things may be, we can still subscribe to the transcendental truth that this is a universe where miracles truly happen. We live on a planet that's spun long enough that it produced hyper intelligent monkeys that are currently creating spaceships and machines that are about to wake up. If that's the kind of planet we live on, then what can happen to you in your subjective life? All you have to do is let go. And remember these words I heard in a yoga class taught by Sarah Swaddy Marcus. At a Ram Dass retreat I went to a few years ago. The bridge between suffering and grace is surrender. Surrender to the miracle. Why not? What do you have to lose? If you get consumed by the unromantic darkness, at least you'll be in a good mood when it happens. This episode of the DTFH is brought to you by Squarespace.com, a company headquartered in New York City, a company that no doubt my life turns into a smoldering crater of self-destruction because of a move to New York City that I shouldn't have made, will come to that smoldering crater, pull me out, pluck the heroin needles, hanging from my arms out, and put me under a nice cold shower and place me back in front of a podcasting microphone to talk about what a fantastic company Squarespace truly is.

Thank you for continuing to listen. We got a wonderful episode for you today. Today's guest is a martial artist. He's an entrepreneur who runs a company called Caveman Coffee. He is also an actor who more than likely you've seen if you've watched any action movies for the last couple of years. He was in Westworld, man, and I've known him for a really long time and I have watched his ascent into the world of action movie stardom, an ascent I believe that is only just beginning. Now everybody, please welcome to the DTFH, the great Tate Fletcher. Tate, welcome back to the DTFH, my friend. Thank you, man, great to be here. I gotta tell you, I kind of texted this to you, but I had a vision. Oh, yeah, dude, God, we've been trying to get together for so long. Yeah, I remember the text. You remember the text and I was kind of embarrassed by the text, but you know, I'm not saying it's like a pay-outy vision where like, you know, I saw like- If there's anybody that had a vision where I'm like, there's legs on that vision, it would be you. Well, here's what it was. So, I mean, it's hard to explain, but it's like, I was just like, driving to the comedy store. I guess I was thinking about Westworld and how one of my favorite parts of Westworld was when suddenly I saw you and it just made me so happy because that show is so good. And I was like, man, that is amazing. That was a big part. That was like a big part for them. That linked a lot of things together. So anyway, this is a weird thing. I had a vision. And I thought, shit. Now, where were you when you had the vision? Only the way you were in the car? I was just driving. But it was like one of those things where, you know, like your brain goes, oh yes, oh yes. Then all of a sudden it just all clicked. I'm like, fuck, Tate's gonna be like a big action movie star, God. And it all kind of clicked. It was like, oh yeah, because I keep seeing him in these parts pretty much now. Anytime I'm watching and at lots of times when I'm watching an action movie, you're in there. And your parts keep getting bigger and bigger. And then it doesn't take a fucking Nostradamus to like put it together. But it's like, whoa, wow. So anyway, enough of me yapping. What's, and I don't want to do like career talk out the gate, but Jesus Christ, Tate, I gotta tell you, man, I get so excited seeing you. And I want to know what trajectory you're on and what's going on with you right now. It's, I wish that there were a way to mark it in a way that you could understand. Strangely enough, the biggest advice I'd ever heard, or it wasn't like great advice, but it was just like a matter of fact. Pauly Shore said one time when I was in like acting class, we're doing an improv thing and we're at the comedy store in the middle of the afternoon, Pauly happens to walk through. And he says, you guys want to know the best advice there is. And which is weird coming from Paul, like cause it's not like a guy you would think to go to for advice really. He doesn't strike that in you. Not to get in the way, but I do have a couple of bits of advice that Pauly Shore gave me that I hang on to to this day. I mean, I'm doing that too, but it's like, what my point is is that it was an unlikely source for me. And what he'd said was, you guys are all looking for the route like how to do it. Nobody knows. There's not one. And you know, just do it any kind of way. Just throw it out there. And cause there's not really like, after he said that, I thought, I could tell you, I could put you on a course, how to get in the UFC and fight simply. I could not tell you how to get into film. Like I couldn't, like it's just, it's a weird deal. And there's like a catch 22. There's like a huge barrier to entry to get in it. And then to be able to recreate it and do it. Like I'm just super grateful. I'm the one I guess I want to say is I'm just surprised as anybody and it's cool to see that there is a growth. Like it seems to be accelerating. I mean, it is. And I was just on the phone on the way here to get an agent to start working with somebody. Cause I haven't, I've had an agent that signs stuff and everything, but like, if I've had a hundred jobs, 95 of them, I haven't gotten with an agent. How do you get them? Usually it's word of mouth. And it's like a second unit director, a stunt coordinator or something will say, we need a guy that can act, that can also do the action and that's physical or a guy that takes care of the actor so they don't get hurt and they're in their spot. And like, and I've been putting those spots. Wow. And, and then it's grown from there. Yeah. I mean, it, it's, I mean, I still remember when we were like, I was opening for Rogan. Dude, you moved out of his house and I moved in. I mean, really, you know. That's right. That is crazy, man. It's crazy. And I started looking at that dude. When I drove up La Cien again, I look at Ari Shafir's sign and that, you know, condemned, crummy, section eight apartment housing that he's living in there. That's right. And, and then there's a billboard with his goddamn face on it over that building. I was like, this is beautiful. And I just, I looked at that and I looked at all of us in that way. And like, there's not anybody that is straggling out of that. Like, you know what I mean? It's like everybody's doing very well. And I think the thing is, is that everybody's been like, and I don't know that they're correlated, but you know, everybody's really friendly and everybody's very strong and everybody's dedicated to working hard and very kind and gracious. And like, those are all characteristics of like that whole crew of guys, you know? Whether that's Eddie or Ari, you, me, Brian, like it's this whole group of people, Joey Diaz. And the first time I met Joey predated all that. Like I met him on the set of the longest yard in like 2005 or something like that. And it's just a trip. It's a trip. It's a trip. It really is. And you know, especially just knowing how circuitous the route is to that place and knowing that you're doing that thing. It's just, it's pretty mind blowing, man. I mean, I don't want to keep going on and on about, I don't want to sound like a weirdo, but I got to say, you know the term compersion, you know that term? A lot of like people who were into like swinging say it, but I don't mean it in that way, obviously here. Like I can tell you, man, every time I see you in a movie, I get an authentic burst of joy. And like it is just the coolest thing to see because you're acting, you're good at it, man. It's not just like you're like, you know, you're killing it. So anyway. It makes me blush, but thanks, man. That's, that's cool. That's a, it's neat, man. And it's nice to like, you know, there's stuff I want to do. There's goals that I've got within that industry, but I'm having a lot of fun doing all the things. And every time the phone rings, I'm just super grateful. And I'm like, right now, man, this is, you know, and I show up to do that. So it's not that I'm not looking to go somewhere, but I'm really enjoying the whole ride of what it is. Right. Yeah, that's cool. You're not getting freaked out by it at all yet. Yeah. And then what, either at all, like, I guess I'm really like, it's why I do a lot of stuff. It's like, I've got K-man coffee. I've got that. I just opened a little tavern in New Mexico. I've got a gym there. And all of this stuff, all centers are on friends. I've got these, you know, the concrete cowboy clubs in Texas and all that. And you're also doing, you know what I bet you're doing? I bet you're doing some kind of black ops shit that you won't talk about. I bet you- And, but like all this stuff, you know, because I know that anything goes away at any time. And I don't ever want to be a victim of life. I want to be engaged in life in a way where it's like I'm proactive and moving the needle for people and showing people like this is all possible, but also like not that it's, the air is going to come out of it at the other end. If I don't take care of it or, you know, the stock market crashes or whatever, you know, because like it's like the president or whatever. Everybody's freaked out about X, Y, or Z. Yeah. And I think they'll be freaked out. I mean, there's a whole nother group that would be freaked out if it were anybody else. That's right. So all that stuff can't bother me. I've got to kill it regardless of who sits in that chair. Like I can't be a victim of somebody else's action. Like I've got to, you know what I mean? And there's something about mastering yourself, I think in that way where you can stay absolved of the external chaos for lack of a better term than and not unbalance you, you know? And I think that's the goal for us, for all of us, you know? Yeah, but it's that beginning phase, you know, it's that thing where you're, when you're down the line, like where you're at right now and you've got all these plates spinning and you're seeing like the flowering of this amazing tree that you've been growing for a long time. It's, what about, you know, what about when you're not there at all? Like I'm thinking of like young Tate, you know? You know, breaking the law. Right. A lot. And lost. And lost, right? Like lost, lost, lost. So, or even not, you know, even not that romantically lost. Like that's kind of cool. Like you're lost, but it's kind of, it's weirdly in some weird way. You're still taking these risks. You're still throwing yourself out. It's the same. To me, dude, I was looking at it and I'm like, it's the same. It's the, that, that adrenaline-wise, like wanting to have big dopamine burst, like having huge consequence from whatever action it is that you're doing. When I look at that and I look at whatever my life is at any point, it's all the same thing. It's just now for the last 20 years or whatever, it's been nothing criminal in that way, but like still a life with huge consequences, huge risk. And I'm going to try to walk that rope anyway. All right. And, and. So kind of this is replaced. Yeah, for sure. Or it's feeding that, that. It's part of who I am. That's my nature, right? Is that kind of hunger? And so it needs to be there. And I think also it's helpful for me because I think when you do that and you live a life that's got consequences like that, you are always confronting your ego, right? And I think that's really the root of where it is in life, is to get our ego out of the way so that we see that we're all similar and we're all one in that way, you know? Yeah, that is the, how do you, what are some methods you use or have used in the past when you come face to face with some really shitty part of yourself that you, that is shocking? You know when you're in denial, you know, like, and you, and you are, you just don't want to believe that you've become that person. And then suddenly you just can't help but face it. Right. What do you do there, man? What, what, what is your technique? Surely in your process, you've kind of, I feel like there's choices, you know, like you got, you can either deny it, you can, and you see that a lot, right? Yeah. And so I think a lot of it, I've had good training by seeing people and noticing that they're at that crossroads of that choice and going, oh, that guy did it this way. And that is not a good look. You know what I mean? And, and so you start to look at it those ways. And I think the other thing I would, I benefited everything in my life really to my friends and to the people around me because without the people around me that I trust and that I love, it's hard to detach myself from my ego and be objective while I'm right in it, whatever the mud is. And so I need you to go, hey dude, look at this and does, what does this look like to you? And I've got to then know that you love me enough. You're not malicious. And because I've got this mind that's going to be defensive right away. Right. And so I need to have somebody that I know cares, that I trust in that. Yeah. And I need to learn to take their word for that and to look at it and go, okay, I'm going to look at this and I'm going to make adjustments. And it sucks and you have to eat it. But I think there's only one choice at the end of the day is you've got to do the hard thing. Like the easy thing is to avoid stuff. Yes. And you've got to do the hard thing and you've got to face it and you've got to own it. And I think the only kind of light, it's like in, you know, whether it's relationships or whether it's whatever, if you've been wronged or whatever, who cares? Nice story, tell it to read or digest kind of thing, you know? Yeah. The thing is it's got to be 100% on you because you're the only one like, if I'm not willing to take all the responsibility, then I shouldn't even be in the game because it's all on me in that way, you know? And when I do that, the people around me then are way more gracious because they're like, no, no, there'll be the ones that'll be like, it's not all like, but I really, I really want to authentically look at it. And so now I've just, I've come to that battle enough to where I don't battle it and I just go, it's all on you, take responsibility and let's move through this. So you're saying, and I've heard this from people at the Ram Dass Retreat event. Really? I've been wanting to go to this retreat with you. I mean, it's been in my head for the last six months or something. You would love it. Yeah. Sorry to interrupt. No, you're repeating like what's come to me from them. It's, they say, you know, this is any human relationship that you get into. It's a very easy thing to want the other person to change. Right. You start working on the other person. You start trying to... Or if only this were different about them. Yes. And that is usually what's going on there is you're projecting what you want to change about yourself onto this other person, but you can't deal with the fact that this is actually you. So the idea is the thing you're trying to change is someone else. Make sure you look into yourself and see if there's a corollary there. Maybe it's not gonna be identical. And then if you start working on that, then suddenly the relationship becomes this, like you're sitting at the feet of the guru and you're being shown all your places, you're stuck. And just essentially what they say is work on yourself, change yourself, perfect yourself, but don't perfect the person you're with. Right. I think that whole phrase to that own self be true and it's out of a Shakespeare play and it's really been ringing in my ears lately. And that whole thing about, it doesn't matter who you are. Like whether you're a girl I want to date or whether you're an employer or whatever, it has zero bearing on the conversation. I'd like to be both of those to you. You kind of have been at different times. You know, there's a season for everything. But like, it's more important that I'm the fish it's more important that I'm the fish I got to catch. You know, it's important that I come and like it doesn't matter who she is in the relationship. It's who I am like, like, oh, she were different. Like I'm not ready for that then. All right. You know, and knowing like, or going, you know, what I battled with forever is monogamy. And so then I've just, and for a while I tried to pull, like at first it was confusing to me as a little boy. And I was like, seems weird that like Joey and Chrissy are dating and then Chrissy kissed Tommy and now Joey, everybody's like, ooh, you got to do something about that. And there's an impelling notion to be either violent or aggressive or whatever. And you need to hate her. And then they do that. And then they, and this web weaves with all these people, you know, I'm like, this is fascinating. And, but they liked each other at the beginning. Why can't they just still like each other? And she also kissed him or whatever the thing is. It always seemed weird anyway to me. And this ownership, this propriety we have over another person. And that that was a trust or an infraction in some way. And I thought, that seems so odd. And everybody I knew was divorced and whatever. And, but you go through life like that. And I think, well, for me then, I tried to play in that serial monogamy kind of role that everybody is in. Yes. And it doesn't fit very well. And then you're a bad guy. That's the setup, you know? And nobody thinks you're a bad guy. If you're a woman, then you're just, I'm craving to get married. I'm craving to have a baby. Like that's a normal biological thing. Well, so is the other. So is the dude trying. Like, it's all part of that whole conversation. And you can't demean one without demeaning the other. And how about nobody has to be wrong? Right. And so then I start going, well, you know, I'd like to have more honest conversations about that and say, like, I love you more than anything, but at the same time, I'm not, I can't hold this to be my, this is not the mantle that I can carry, you know? And so if that's what it looks like for you to understand that, so to my own self be true in that regard as well, of going, I need to own that. If that's part of me that I'm not willing to do, why am I making an agreement that I'm not gonna honor? Historically anyway, you know? Yeah. And maybe that changes over time or whatever. But at the same time, I think that being true to yourself is so important that to not be true to my word to you is inconsequential in a way. Maybe it makes me look like a dick or untrustworthy or this or that, but really that thing about telling yourself, because what that does is imbue shame in you. Like that you're a broken person and you can't do that. You know what I mean? Yeah, man. And it's like changing your eye color. It's like, if it's part of who you are, and it's not deleterious, except in the way that somebody else feels as far as they feel smited in some way, but it's just your action and you're not stepping on anybody's toes. What is the problem, you know? Well, it's way better if you know that's how you function. Right. It's way, way better up front to just say, I'm not monogamous, I can't do it. Doesn't work, never pulled it off. And also, doesn't mean that I'm out every night. It's like, it's all of that. It's an interesting thing, but we get scared. And so that thing too about like getting the ego out of the way of going, we're not that dissimilar and maybe we could be a little more gracious with each other, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure. And this is like a piece of the puzzle for sure. It's always the ego though. Good God. And man, you can really run into trouble the older you get. If you're not like, if you let it slide at all, like if I let it slide for me, it gets bad fast. It's scary how very quickly things can like suddenly like I've gone insane. Like I'm being dragged around by my ego. And then that sucks because now I've got to like go to the people I love, completely embarrassed and be like, you know what, I've, I went crazy. My ego got crazy. I lost my fucking mind. That feels so bad because you're, you know that ego is in the Lord of the Rings. Do you watch those movies? It's Sauron. It's the Dark Lord. It's the thing that's just like, why would you apologize? Will you show your weakness to them? Show your weakness to them and you will be exploited. And then you will regret showing this weakness. Better to be strong and wrong. You know, it's fucked. It's weird how it's all routed in like drug culture too. I think like Gollum is like the consummate junkie. Yes, yes, that's right. It's amazing in that regard. And I've had that. I've had conversations like that guys come to me and they, so dude, you're sober and I go, yeah. And they go, I don't do it all the time, but I've been doing coke for a while. Like I'll call a guy and then I'll be out for three days. And then, and then I won't do anything for two days. And then I feel like shit. And then I go back and then, and maybe it's two months and I don't do it again. And then I'm in the wrong, it's all in the cycle, right? That they're, and I go, listen, man, maybe you're just partying and you're bored and this and that. I don't know. Maybe it's not a bad deal. However, if it is, it'll be recurrent and it'll get worse. And then there's options take, but right now what's going to happen is, you just did this last night. And so what's going to happen is in two days, you're going to be like, fuck, I snitched on myself to Tate. And then you're going to feel really weird every time you see me. So let's not do that. I'm going to pretend like we didn't have this conversation. And if you really want to talk in a few days, cool. And if not, we'll never mention it again. You know, but like that, like that thing that Soran has done, it's just like that. It's like, you're going to out yourself and say your weakness and then you're going to be sorry and regret that you did that. But that is the thing is like to show you, for me when I got sober, I was like, I just want to go ahead and, if it's between me dying and me showing my weak, I'll go ahead and I'll risk this because I already know what the other thing gets me. And when you already know the sadness that the other thing brings long enough, you're like, well, fuck, I'll try something different then. You know, at a certain point you have to. What does it give you? That winning in that way. I don't know. Yeah, what's winning, right? Yeah. It's eating ashes. It's like eating dead things. It's like you win nothing. What do you win? Like the ego wants you to win, at the cost of the self. Yes, at the cost of the soul. And the spoils of an ego victory are so transient and bitter. It is ashes. It's ashes in your mind. It's just that. It's beautiful. It's scooping ashes in. And then you're looking out at the world and you see like devastated people that you've. Well, that's the thing is like you want to go through life and you'd like, I don't want to hurt myself or anybody else. And then you moved contrary to that because you had a good idea or whatever. Right. It's crazy. You will hurt people. For sure. Like if there's someone, like if you're about to be incarnated and someone sits down with you, they're going to say, you're probably going to hurt people. You're going to hurt yourself. You're going to end up doing something that fucks somebody up. And any power is like that. Right. I mean, really. The president. I mean, you look at somebody, I forget where I read this, but they said their assertion was that anybody that got passed like a governor, if you're in contention for the highest office in the land, you've done evil, which means you've been complicit in the death and murder of children and women. And like you've done horrible things. And that's everybody that gets to that spot has like, you got blood on your hands. You can't get away from that. Cause that's what the office dictates, you know? And that's what power is. I was just listening. There's like a Beatles interview. I can't remember. John Lennon, who's like, anyone who's successful has stabbed someone in the back. Anyone who's successful is very cynical. I don't know if that's- What year was that in? I don't know. It was, my friend was playing it in the car. I don't know. It was like, you know, John Lennon, he's kind of, he's not, he's not- They're super interesting because of where they were and then where they evolved to through psychedelics really is what I think. Yeah. Yes, right. But I want to talk to you a little bit about this concept of power being kind of inevitably dangerous or success hurting people. Have you, in your progress through life, have you run into a situation where you find yourself having to choose between like success and your integrity? Have you hurt? If you want to talk about it, do you feel like you've hurt people accidentally or? I probably have. I always ask people to tell me. I mean, like if that comes up or if somebody is like at odds with me, I always want to see what it is. I don't want to, I want to clean it up. I don't even like it. I mean, like, I don't even like trolls when they're like, get sad on the internet. And that, like, I, like every, like, I'm like, man, I would, I want to live in collusion with you. I don't want to be at odds with anybody. It's an impossibility to happen, but it's like the ideal that I strive for still. You don't think it's good to have enemies? I was reading this. I guess it can be, you know. There's a school of thought, right? But it doesn't feel good. Doesn't feel good. And I want to feel good. But isn't there a school of thought that having a few enemies is like, kind of like having access to a really great gem that if you have enemies, then you can sort of buy the survival that's being forced from, you know, because when you do get to a certain level. Anybody that I would see as an enemy would be a weak person, though. They would be an unevolved person. The way I get stronger and go to the gym more in that regard, and whether that's emotionally, spiritually, intellectually, physically, whatever, is by the core people around me that I go, that fucker's getting ahead of you in this. And you need to keep up to be valuable to be around the circle. You know, you want to carry your own weight. And also, you know, I think about it too, fuck, there's people counting on me. You know what I mean? It's like, I need strong legs, man. There's people that I need to carry through to the next thing, you know? Yeah, that's cool. So when you're doing, you seem to be very community. For sure. Oriented. When you're thinking about stuff, you're not really, you're thinking about how it affects the people around you. I think it's the only way I can go through. It's the one thing that keeps me in check a little bit. Does this come from, do you think it's a 12-step program that has taught you this, or was it, were you like that before? I think I've always craved a community, I guess. Or a core acceptance, maybe, right? How much of this is from, because everything you're saying is, sounds like a person with a strong spiritual practice. And do you consider the 12-step program to be a spiritual practice, like chanting, or going to church, or anything like that? Is this wisdom that you, and also not just, it's like, you're not just talking the talk, you're clearly walking the walk. How much of it is related to the 12-step program? I feel like, whether you talk about 12-step programs, or you talk about neuro-linguistic programming, or you talk about vitamin C, or whatever. It's like everything has a power to it, and I think that... Do you get into NLP? The juice, yeah. I've been just dabbing in that a little bit. I'd like to get it, make it a practice. I don't know much about it. I haven't gotten in very deep. But I think all those things, you know, I try to immerse myself in stuff. And I see a lot of people that, every naysayer I know about almost anything, dips their toe in it, and is like, that didn't feel good, that's bullshit. Right. So, yeah, I've immersed myself in things, and drawn what's out of it now. In whatever I've been in, whether it's been in some program, or in jujitsu, or in like a fitness modality, or a nutrition modality, or a spiritual thing, I mean, is the Catholic Church all evil? No, do they fuck a lot of kids? Yep. Like, it's like all of that. It's like, sure, there's good to be extracted from that. Sure, there's terrific evil out of that. Like, if you go to any NA meeting or something, you're gonna find the most beautiful, altruistic people in the world, and you're gonna find rapists, and junkies, and murderers. Like, it's just part of the deal. Right. And so... So you're taking it from everywhere. You get an opportunity to become who you wanna become when you get exposed to things and go, do I wanna get better, or do I wanna blame somebody? And those are the choices you get. You cannot be a victim and recover, and so do I wanna get well, and do I wanna improve and continually grow into a better human? Or am I looking for somebody to blame? And I look at that as retirement. When I'm ready to blame somebody, I'm not gonna do the work to take responsibility for that. So all I need is a good scapegoat, and I'm good. You know, and I've lived my life like that for a long time. But when you rot in cancer from living that kind of life, because that's what it gets you. And so at a certain point, you just go, I'm just gonna go ahead and take responsibility for everything. Yes. Because it tastes way better. Way, way better. And I get benefits from it, and I can be helpful to people behind me for a minute. And yeah, it's like a dude that helped me a bunch, I guess, where I get that community from, or that wanting to help the guy coming behind me is a dude that helped me a tremendous amount, and I talked about what I owed him, you know? And I thought, I don't have anything, man, but I recognize that, oh, you're not like a dick. You've done kindnesses and been gracious in ways I can't pay you for. And he says, you don't owe me, you owe everybody. And he says, and what you need to do is you need to keep a spiritual life in your life, and get as well as you can, and you need to help the guy coming behind you, and you need to be a symbol for that. Wow. And that's been kind of the only thing I've been wanting to hold true to for a couple decades now is that kind of an oath to that guy, John Lowe. And, because it was bigger than him saying that, you know? It seemed like that was a universal echo, that like, here's what you need to do, man. And in doing that, if I keep my eye on that, all these other things can grow, but like, that's the platform from which I come, you know? Well, this is very Buddhist of you. It's the idea of abstaining from true realization until all sentient beings in the universe have achieved true realization. That's the bodhisattva vow. Would that be like, I don't wanna be rich by myself? If you were gonna give me a million dollars, I would rather, if I've got three best friends, have everybody have 250,000? Yeah. I want everybody to do well. That's kind of it. Or it's like, how am I gonna enjoy it? In a real base, monetary, fucking shitty, capitalistic way. I can't enjoy this oasis that I'm in because I know that there's 20 people. Who were in the plane crash I was in lost in the desert. So I'm gonna go back out in the desert to try to bring them to this oasis. And then once I've gotten all of them in, then I'll come and enjoy it too. So it's the idea of like, let's just help each other right now. And this is like a kind of confusing form of Buddhism that Sharon Salzburg teaches, which is this idea of meta, like the idea of cultivating compassion, cultivating compassion. So compassion isn't, you don't, you're not born with it. You don't just get, you don't suddenly feel compassion for things, even though you can't, you feel sorry for things or you see something suffering, you want the suffering to stop. It's not like it's not in people, but already it is there. So it's wrong to say we're not born with it, but the idea is in the same way we're born with muscles, you can develop those muscles. So in the same way you have a little bit of compassion, you can grow it and grow it and grow it. And so there's a practice that you do. Now, what would an example of a, of minutia compassion be with a huge magnitude of compassion? Like what would a little bit of compassion look like compared to, you know what I mean? Like a little bit of muscle could move 10 pounds. A lot of muscle could move 400 pounds. Okay, a little bit of compassion would be, okay, like think of someone who's done you wrong. Okay. And okay, and the ego, there's a question the ego does not want you to ask. It is an unforgivable question to ask if you want to achieve a state of being angry at someone. And that question is, why are they doing this? Like, why are they acting like this? If I was in their shoes, why would I be doing this? And then you go in, right? You're like, oh, wait a minute. The reason they're acting like this is because they don't feel like I respect them because I haven't been showing them that I respect them. I haven't been giving them the love they deserve to show that I respect them. So the reason they're doing this right now is not because of their an innate flaw inside of them. It's just a, oh my God, they just want love. They just want to be loved. Almost always the answer you'll get back is in some way, this person really wants to be loved. So the idea is that these retreats, they do this thing that I always duck out on because it's so cheese ball. But I wish I did it and they make fun of me because I'm always like, whenever it happens, I feel like I can't do it for some reason. It's really lame. But you sit across from them, you look, and you say, you go through this thing, but you say, just like me, you have suffered. Just like me, you deserve love. Just like me, you deserve to have a great life. You go through all the things. Is this what they used to do? It was like five minutes or something like that. It's a long time. And people start bawling because you connect with somebody and you realize like, oh my God, every single person you cross paths with in this world deserves love. They've suffered. One of the things Jack Cornfield says is when he was a monk, they say, you have to bow. They, you have to bow to people who, it's like kind of a martial arts. You bow to people who have, who became monks before you, you bow to them. There's a formality to it. And he was, he's like, some of these people I don't, I couldn't find what to bow to because I didn't like some of them. Like just cause you joined a monastery doesn't mean you're getting along with people in the monastery, you know? But then he realized, oh shit, look at that wrinkle. Look at the wrinkles in that man's face. Where did those wrinkles come from? Those, that came from grief. That came from so much sorrow and suffering. I can bow to the wrinkles. I can bow to the, the, the, the, the manifestation of the suffering this being has experienced in this incarnation. So it's like that you, and it's, I think they call it meta and it's the idea of like wishing or, I mean, I'm going to ruin this. So I'm sorry for those of you who are very familiar with meta because it's a real spiritual practice, but you remind me of that. It's the idea of like, how can I spread? How can I spread? How can I embrace people around me, no matter who they are? How can I spread that out into the world? I got a, like a practice late on me a few, I don't know how many years ago, but, and the dude just said, just leave everybody with a gift. And like for me, it's like the simple things like that work really well, you know, like to not, to have it, not this huge explanation, but leave everybody with a gift and, and. Yeah, like we brought this tea over or whatever. But like, or even, you know, he, he broke it down. Even, he says, even strangers in the street, you can smile, you're brave, you're friendly. That's it. Or when you're leaving somebody, even if you're not saying goodbye to them or whatever, or somebody in a car that is, maybe has the potential to piss you off because of whatever happens in the car to leave them with a gift, a kind thought, even in your head. And I started, when I started doing this, man, I walked by this guy who's a friend of mine, but who's like a little bit too much. He's a little bit like high energy and like tough to be around sometimes. And, and I was racing through my day. I saw him and we're saying goodbye. And I was, I was like, all right, man, later. And he said, bye. And he walked, and I'm like, that motherfucker, like in my head, right? And I'm like, that doesn't serve you, Tate. And catching my own thoughts. And so like a lot of it has been like that reprogramming of my thoughts to have different pathways instead of just this automatic negative reaction to whatever. To take notice at least when it pops up. And that's the thing is you start noticing your mind. Yeah. And I think with that, I mean, it's like the one, the big compassion versus the little compassion. I was like, yeah, if somebody does you wrong or something or you're bitter about someone, you go, oh, I love that person from across the street. That's a little bit of compassion. I'm going to avoid them forever, but and then a bigger compassion of, how can I be helpful to that guy's life or what? Like, you know, I get what you're saying after you explain that. Well, they say you can train it. And they've done, apparently they've done scans of monks, brains who practice this. And it transforms the shape of your brain. So you're sort of like, there's a whole, you know, I'll look it up. Like it's the meta, there's a meta prayer that people say, let me find it, because it's pretty interesting. You know, it's funny because it's like, let's see if we can find it. The meta prayer of loving kindness. This is what it's called. The meta prayer of loving kindness. And it goes, so it goes, and in the way that Sharon Salzburg teaches this, or my, the way I've seen her teacher, she prays a lot of different ways she teaches it, is she recommends that you start small and go big with it. But it goes, the end of it is, may all beings be peaceful, may all beings be happy, may all beings be safe, may all beings awaken to the light of their true nature, may all beings be free. That's the prayer. And so in meditation, there's a lot of different ways to do it. And there's different versions of this prayer too. You can look it up. That's just one translation. But the way you would do it is instead of all beings, who the fuck understands what that means, right? So the way you would do it at prayer is you would think about like, I don't know, do you have any pets, Tate? Yeah. What kind of animal? A dog. Okay, what's your dog's name? Hank. So you would think of Hank. So when, so first you just think of something that you just love no matter what. You love Hank. And I love my dog, Fox. So it's a direct connection. And I can sit and think, may Fox be peaceful, may Fox be happy and really want that for him, right? So then you're exercising this compassion. Training the muscles. Yes, that's right. Cause you can easily do it with your dog. When you get to like whoever the fuck it is that you have like beef with, that's where it gets trickier, right? Or even more tricky when you get to yourself. May I be peaceful, may I be happy, may I be safe, may I awake into the light of my true nature. May I be free. When you even, for a lot of people that's the hard one. Cause it's like, I don't deserve that. I mean, there's stuff that I do to myself or like expectations I'll have myself that I would not have for anybody. I bet. You know? I mean, it's like, I think that's the nature of us, right? Are you hard on yourself? Oh, for sure. Absolutely. Not a fan. Like, I mean, everything is like, I said to, I don't know, I was talking to Joe once and I was like, I said, it's weird. All the things that I have been my biggest failures have turned into my greatest assets. You know, and like just to, we were talking about something earlier and there's a guy and you're talking about like, well, when we did these retreats in the 60s or something, what they're like, right? Yeah. And I look at it now, 2016 in the 60s. To me, it seems like, it's like the 90s were like five years ago. It's like the 60s was like 20 years ago or something. It's like, that's not really where we're at. Like, I don't have a scope of that. But the scope that that guy has. Yeah. And that's the thing about being like a real adult is not like, you've got all this idealism and good ideas or it's a 16 year old or 24 year old or whatever. But you've lived like four, five, six, eight decades. You've got scope of like, what a real big deal is, what it's not, how the nature of everything is kind of balanced and like, how do I want to be inside of that? All right. And because the thing of all this work, like when the question comes, well, why would I do that? Well, because we find that a self that's run on ego is hurtful, it's uncomfortable, man. And when you get to that thing, why would I practice that stuff? Well, because I want to feel good, man. That's right. And that becomes the thing I want to, because I think that's what the soul craves is to be whole. Like, and there is that craving. And I think with like, with alcoholism and everything, we go, yeah, I want to be whole. I want to be spiritually evolved or attain some kind of level or whatever. But at the same time, I'll settle for oblivion. So I'll go ahead and guzzle a bottle of Jack Daniels, and that will suffice for a while. And then after a while, that isn't sufficient anymore and you're left with this empty cancer of your whole wreckage of your life. And if you can catch it in time, and there's like a window that opens where you're able to be listened to or able to listen to somebody else and go, hey, let's try this other thing. And if you adopt that other thing fully, that's why I jump into things fully is because there's not another way. If you run the tape all the way out to the end on this side, there's only the one other way to go. And that's usually the way I learn this. Me too. By doing that, you know? Yeah, that's the way I learn. It's called the Fool's Method. Right, yeah, like be a negative, I've heard, and all kinds of things. Yeah, I'm not alone in it. It's a brutal university. Because you don't have to go to that university of pain. There's so many other ways to learn just by listening to people who have lived longer. And when those people say something, what do you say to them? I got it. Yeah, sure. You know, it's like, and that's all that ego shit that takes you down that. Like they're just saying that, you know? And that's an easy thing to, when my teacher's in particular, it's a really easy thing for me to be like, yeah, all right, you're just saying that we should love ourselves completely and that everything's perfect and all is one. You're just saying that, but they are not just saying it. They've practiced it. This is their practice, so it's a different ball of wax altogether, but the ego wants to believe that, no, no, no, that's not it. Because what they're talking about, the idea of completely loving yourself, not being hard on yourself, this is a quote Cornfield does all the time from a poet I think called Hafiz, which is fear is the cheapest room in the house. I hope you find better quarters. And it's the idea that you don't have to hate yourself. You don't have to hate yourself. You don't have to look at yourself or even recognize what that is. Like a lot of the time, I remember when I was a little kid and my mom says, I don't know, I was doing some evil shit. And she said, you know that only tarnishes your soul. Oh, shit. And then she said that, I was like, that is some corny shit. I was like, clearly it hurts them. Like it's got nothing to do with me. And when you cost it, it tarnishes, and I'm little, like I'm like 10 or 11 years old, I'm a little kid and I don't get it at all until like I look back on that and I look at the wisdom of what that is. Like, you know, that whole corny shit that looks like, to hurt you is to hurt me. Like the night damage to your damage. But let me just say this, let me stick up for young Tate. Yes, please. If young Tate, after hearing from someone he loved, is your soul as tarnished came to me, I'd be like, it does not tarnish your soul. It might make you look like a dick, but your soul tarnished, no. And this is you would, when we get these things, that sticks with you. And you think, oh, well then I must have a tarnished soul. There must be something wrong with me. And it's like, but the truth of the matter is, nothing's wrong with you. You, like every single other person here on planet earth, we are in a very perplexing and confusing situation here. This is confusing as hell on every single level, from what's happening politically, to what's happening personally, to what's happening with our realization that our media is completely bought and sold and the majority of what we've been learning is only like different shades of the truth. We knew, by the way, you and I, we knew this because in the old days for you, and maybe not such the old days for me, LSD teaches you right away, like, wait a minute, I don't think. I'm so grateful. I'm so, I must have tripped acid, I don't know, at least a hundred times. Sure. A couple hundred times. And when you were talking earlier and you're like, well, you know, you can't just, like we're talking about burning man. And you said, well, you can't just trip every day. And I go, oh yeah, because I remember if I wanted to have a big weekend, like a Friday and Saturday, usually it'd be reserved for like one night, you're gonna be able to drop acid. Yeah. But the only, because the only way you can get off on it, if you haven't done acid before, is you need to at least double the dose the next day. And then it's a shoddy trip. It's like a facsimile of the first night. It's never as crisp and it's fun and it's not the same. It's like a dirtier, muddier journey, but you can get off on it. You can still get high on the acid. But the third day, you're running into some obstacles. And like, but that- Particularly the part of the mind awoken by the LSD, which is saying, what are you doing this every day for? We're already here. Yeah. But that's the thing is that formation of your mind to open up. And my question is when did you stop taking it also seriously? Cause clearly we're like in a magic trick or something or you're talking about that we're in a multiverse. For sure there's another universe where the gods are laughing going, this is crazy. Look at what they're doing now. Right. Cause it's hilarious. Like it doesn't even make sense what's happening. The gods do laugh. And it's, well, it's a, so I think right now in particular, the problem is that not to completely switch gears, but the problem is that, so there were all these polls coming out from the mainstream media, which had a bias, I think, and the bias was they wanted Hillary Clinton to be president more than they wanted Trump to be president because Trump was putting reporters in a bullpen. Like, I don't know if you've seen videos of what he was doing, hilarious, very post-apocalyptic, but he would take, he was, you can just look up the video. So he didn't like the media cause the media were being shitty with him. Right. And he's like, all right, fuck you. I'm not a politician. I'm a New York mogul businessman. So if you fuck with me, I'm going to fuck with you. Just like I've always been doing. Right. Like I'd fuck with the unions or like whoever. Whoever I perceive as an enemy, I'm going to torture them because that's what I do. You get in his books, you know, there's different, he talks, he's a, there's people have met him. He's, and by the way, I'm not making some judgment on him. It's just his part of his personality. Right. And you can see it. He takes a very particular kind of glee. So what would he do? Well, he puts reporters in a bullpen in the back of the room. And then he would like- Like a little fenced off quadrant? Yes. And he'd say to the audience, boo them. They're corrupt. They're, you know, these people are awful folks. Look at them back there. And then when they would ask questions, he's not taking any questions. He wouldn't let them ask questions. They just wanted to be at his rallies. He just had a section in the rallies where everyone could boo the press. So the media clearly does not have- He had like a dunce room. He had a, yes. He was doing that to them. And so they were like, you know, clearly he's not making friends that way, right? So, and so, so what happened is the media in this incredibly biased way, because they didn't want him to be president probably started putting out these polls saying, oh yes, Hillary's going to be president. Hillary's going to be president. Hillary's going to be president. For sure. No doubt. We know it's for sure. We know it's for sure. But really what was happening is some kind of propaganda campaign designed to manipulate people into affirming some paradigm that no matter what, Hillary Clinton was going to be president. It feels like that. Like there was a- It felt like that to me. Yeah, something was going on. And in this whole time, Trump was saying like, yeah, but like I'm getting hundreds of thousands of people- And he even bought it though. Cause he was like, watch the polls. Like he knew he was going to lose. He's like, watch the polls. We're going to redo the polls cause they're going to cheat. Like he knew that it was a fixed game. Like he was sure of it. And I think what it was is it just wasn't as fixed as he thought it was. Right. Yeah, it wasn't. Whatever we thought it was, how it was fixed, it definitely wasn't. And except maybe the media. Like maybe the part of the game that's fixed is the media because the media maybe is owned by corporations that donated to the Clinton campaign. Like the same two corporations. Right. I mean, that maybe, I don't know. What about the aspect that perhaps with Hillary and Donald that they're on the same team? That one. And there's that, that they're in complete collusion with each other headed down the road together. And this is oligarchy. I don't think so. There's that. And then there's another one. I mean, when you look at it and go, is he going to even take hospice? What's really going to happen? Is he going to be put in jail before that happens? Is that possible? Or what if it is neither of them and it's whoever really runs shit and they're going, let's see how fucking horrible we can make this. He's going to be a puppet that's going to say horrific things that are going to be slanderous, that are going to be treasonous. And he's going to go ahead and be an enemy of the state in all the ways except he'll be the president. So that will set a precedent for when our next guy gets in and he can do real evil. And we're going to put everybody in a bullpen. That's what's scary. That's what I think. I mean, that's what it looks like, right? And all that stuff is so big. I can just only laugh at it and go, this is not even real. Well, I'll tell you this, man. He's got balls because he's apparently pissed off the CIA. And the FBI. And he's going to get killed by China or Russia or Mexico or somebody like. Not Russia. I don't think it can be safe that he leaves the country. I think that it's when it comes to the politics of Trump and all this weirdos that he's assigning to these different places, right? That suck that, like, you know, as attorney general is like just staunchly against all forms of marijuana. Right. The guy that is hired for the, or that's notched for the EPA is a guy that is a non-believer of global warming and he's a big proponent of oil and gas and all that, like all that. But meanwhile, in the last days of Obama's presidency, the DEA just made CBD, a completely non-psychoactive drug, a schedule-on drug. So it's like, that's not Trump. That's Obama. That's a person. And that's why I say there's a bigger thing here that it's not about the person that's there. There's a bigger thing that's happening here that's outside of all that scope. Cause if you're going to ask Obama, like if you could sit in a room with him like this, maybe not recorded and go, what the fuck? He'd be like, yeah, I don't know. Maybe he's got to answer for that. Cause he can't be for that. Like he's a stoner, right? Didn't he used to smoke pot or- I don't know. I mean- He pardoned a lot of non-violent drug offenders. Like he's pardoned a lot of people. He's pardoned people who've been in jail, had life sentences for possession of LSD. He's done beautiful things like that. So it's particularly confusing that, but you know, maybe we're over- And that he keeps everybody in one ton of obey. I mean, all of it. Yeah, he does that too. He's so confusing. He's like the whole, like it's clearly fucked up to the point where if Trump becomes president, it's, again, like I tweeted this a long time ago, I have to rewrite all my conspiracy theories because if a man who is now pissed off the CIA, he doesn't want to hear their security reports. The security reports that he get- It's so crazy. The security reports that they give him, he's like, I don't believe it. I don't think it was hacked by Russia. So he's dissing the intelligence, what they call the intelligence community. So it's the intelligence community, which is really very funny. Like a guy who can't spell unprecedented, like a guy who like can't spell on Twitter is pissed off a community called the intelligence community. But really, he's got fucking balls, man. Because to like, this is the CIA. This isn't the FBI. This isn't even the Clintons, however fucked up they may be. They wiped Kennedy. Yeah. Like, they got priors for hitting the president. It's the fucking CIA. Like they, in the world, the eye on the top of the fucking Illuminati pyramid, if you look at it from the dark perspective and not the positive perspective, that's the CIA. It's a shadow government of people who know everything about Donald Trump. Everything, they, he's gotta know that. Like you're pissing off somebody who probably has pictures of you taking shits from the perspective of under your asshole. The person who's shitting on you. Yeah, there you go, that too. Exactly, you have like in fear, I mean, maybe I'm building up the CIA, but in my mind, the CIA has always been, for one, how often do you hear about the CIA? And they've got no breaks. I mean, that's the, you know what I mean? It's like, and the NSA, like all that kind of stuff. It's like, those are all complicit and they don't answer to anybody. No. Really? They don't, and we don't know. Unless there's a fuck up. And then they throw a, they're like, nah, sorry, you're gonna have to burn for this one. And then it goes back to business as usual. I mean, it's crazy. But the technology they must have. Oh. You know, the shit that they must have. It's gotta be amazing. Amazing. One of the worst parts, I think, about the whole thing, about how vile Donald Trump behaves, like, to basically everybody. I mean, it's weird that people will argue, like, he hasn't said anything racist. He's hiring women. He's not against, it's weird that, like, that counters everything that he's said in his whole ethics. Like, it's like, well, those, he can hire a woman and also be a rapist. Like, those can exist in the same room. Like, the fuck. Yeah. But the bummer, bummer part is the blowback that's happening with the online community. And whether it's, like, the caustic feminists that are out there or people just that are looking for safe places or all these kinds of things that come up that get inflamed. And that anybody that is kind of like, I kind of want everybody to do well. And I don't think that, and I think competition is good. Nobody should really have a leg up on anybody else. And so if, you know, you twist affirmative action, like too far, it's dangerous for everybody or whatever, all those kinds of things. And then you get the people that are on the far left, like this crazy allowance. And then all the midline people are like, somebody's got to counter the bullshit that's happening over here. For sure. And like, he's made that environment happen in a bigger way. Whereas before you would just laugh those people off and go, whatever, you really identify as being a gummy bear. I have to refer to you as a gummy bear. That's ridiculous. Right. Now that person has credence. Well, you're looking at two extremes that are both just rotten. And that's what I don't like about it is that it's, okay, this is something, I'm sorry, if I've said this on the podcast before, but there's this guy, Zizek is his name, he's a philosopher, and he's talking about the different forms of tyranny. Says there's two different forms of tyranny, or he talks about two different forms of tyranny. And uses the example of a kid whose dad is forcing him to go see his grandmother. And he says, okay, there's two different ways that dad can do this. One way, pure tyranny. He could say to the kid, I don't give a fuck what you want to do. Oh, you want to play Xbox all day? No, you're going to see your grandmother today because she wants to see you. Overt oppression there. And you don't have freedom. I'm taking you to go see your fucking grandma. The other form of tyranny is where the dad says to the kid, listen, your grandmother is getting old and she loves you so much. You don't have to go see her today, but I think you know the right thing to do. In that situation, you not only have to do the thing you don't want to do, you have to pretend that's who you are, right? And that's a far more nefarious form of tyranny, right? So with the thing that's been- Or you go to the thing and you go, we're all whores. Listen, I'm going to give you cake if you go see grandma. Oh, that too, you can get bride too. That's at least, there's that. But in the case of the idea of like, well, you know the right way you're supposed to be. Yeah, the manipulations. You do know, don't you? I mean, you know you're a white guy, right? You do know- I also like the thing, the first one more, where it's like duty. It's like, this is what you do. This is your old person and you're going to go and take care of them and be nice and that's what it is. And it's your duty as a kid. Or like, with Hillary Clinton versus Trump, you're getting this, you're getting, listen, we're going to take care of the environment. We're going to take care of earth. We're going to do just what we need to do to make the planet okay. Just ignore the fact that we're dropping bombs on Syria and possibly creating a nuclear holocaust from a confrontation with Russia. Just ignore that. But we do care for the environment, but we are willing to posture against another nuclear superpower and risk a potential nuclear holocaust, which is going to be really bad for the environment. So it's like, you know what I'm saying? So in that way, it's like, at least with fucking Trump, there's this like, idiotic and yet- You know what it is. Seemingly successful. Like, this is one thing I can't wrap my head around. And maybe I'm going to get blowback for saying it. But when Trump suggests the possibility of friendship with Russia- That doesn't bother me. That doesn't upset me very much. Like, what exactly is it about Russia that I'm supposed to hate versus what I know the United States does? Like, in other words, the United States used bad information to go to war with Iraq. It used absolutely faulty intelligence to rationalize going to war with Iraq, a war that they already had planned out. They already knew what they were going to do. They deposed Saddam Hussein, chaos spread through the Middle East. All these refugees have gone into different countries. Many of them radicalized Islamic terrorists who are doing rotten, who are driving trucks into fucking crowds of people. Saddam Hussein sucked. Oh yeah, he was of Hyena, who had kill rooms underneath his palace. But God damn it, go to fucking Reddit, watch people die, and check out one of the well-shot ISIS videos of these psychopaths slicing people's throats and human fucking slaughterhouses and you decide which one's worse. And then you realize, well, the United States, we did that, we created the instability, we created the chaos, we did all that. So if the concept is like, oh, Russia's terrible, it's like, really? Are they the people who? I'm kind of a fan. Of Russia? Yeah, man, I think part of it is like, and maybe, you know, I don't know, I'm not like a political analyst. Me either. But God damn, man, he got swagger. Putin is a fucking G. Yeah. Like the way, and I feel like when he looks at America, I feel like he's like, you guys are rotten bitches that are not very just in the way that you behave in the world. And I don't think that's Americans. I think Americans are a group of hugely righteous people that have ideals that are rooted back to 1776. And I think our government is a nefarious, capitalistic, cancerous organism that wants to spread at any cost. And it doesn't matter the misery that it puts out. And I think that Putin looks at that and he's just like, I think it's laughable to him. And he's like, fuck this. And I think that like when you look at Russia, like I also think it's a horrible place. You ever watch free running videos from Russia? Yes. They're the most dastardly things ever. Like there's guys that are willing to jump off four-story buildings onto cement to see if they can tuck and roll out of it. Risk death. Just hoping that somebody sees that YouTube video that can take them out of fucking Russia. Russia is not probably an awesome place to live. It doesn't look like. Because people are dying to get the fuck out of there. That's good to say, because inevitably some are like, why don't you just move to fucking Russia and then if you love Putin so much? Right, exactly. I mean, so there's all of that that exists, but it's kind of like saying, I don't really fucking Hillary, fuck her, and fuck Benghazi, what she did, and fuck all this shit. You could say that, and then you go, oh, so you're for Trump? Or fuck Trump and all this bullshit. Oh, you want Hillary to be it? It's like, no, one doesn't mean the other. They're both horrific choices. Do you want syphilis or warts? Like, it's all horrible. And that wasn't a real question. You don't have to pick. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. May you never be asked that question seriously. But we kind of were just asked that question. Totally. And it's a, I think that it's a- I abstained. I go, well, I'm not gonna play either of those. And I'll vote for Derry Johnson. I don't think he's great either, but he's not them. And I don't think, and he's just like a lovable Lumix, I think. Yeah, man. I abstained too. I didn't vote for either. I voted for a bag of tarantulas. And in retrospect, I would do the exact same thing in any state. And I don't feel like the idea of like, oh, vote your conscience. Well, I don't think the idea of like vote. I used it in the beginning of the podcast. I was fully on board the pragmatic Hillary Clinton vote train. I started off there and I would, I had talks with people and like the idea was, listen, we don't know. Trump's a loose cannon. Who knows what's gonna happen. So I, my idea was pragmatically vote for Hillary Clinton. Then more and more of the shit started getting dumped from WikiLeaks. And the more you look into what's going on there, especially the posturing against Russia that she was doing. And then when you realize like, this is war. This woman is going to create a war. Like there is a war. It seems somehow certain that this woman is going to at least do some kind of air war in Syria to help the rebels. And a lot of those rebels are fucking ISIS. A lot of those rebels are like radicalized, Islamic potential terrorists, not to get sucked into it. As our father, daddy, Donald Trump would say, they're not good people. They're bad, bad hombres. Bad hombres. So anyway, I don't, listen, I'm not a. I agree. I'm not a political. I'm clearly no one listening to this podcast is thinking, wow, these two must be Harvard educated political. Maybe those are our new diplomats. No one's thinking that. God damn right we are. But, and I, and Trump's appointees are just wretched to me, but mother fuck man, Hillary Clinton and that global, the global is the policy of endless war. No more war. That's happening regardless. You think so? Oh yeah. You think we're going to have a war forever? I think that the militarized, that whole complex is unstoppable. I think that is the NSA. That is the CIA. And all those people, I would like to look at her tax portfolio and his tax portfolio and Michael Moore's tax, they're all the fucking same. It's all fucking, I bet in selling tanks, stealth bombers and warheads, like all those people are invested in all these things. Oh God. You know what I mean? And so like the people that really have the money, they're selling war. They don't want to not be at war. That's good money for them. And then they can use American kids as fodder and then they trick the dumb people into going, oh, you're against the soldiers. You don't want the war. No mother fucker. I'm for the soldiers. I don't want them to come back with no legs, you know? And that becomes the whole thing. And I think whether it's Hillary or whether it's Donald, I feel like it's the same cliff. The world's on fire. We're headed to the cliff. She's going to stretch it out because she wants to suck every dollar out of it, she can. And he's going to get us there fast because he just doesn't know how to handle it. Like, he doesn't know, at first I thought, well, maybe Hillary's better because he doesn't know the difference between like, Shia and Sunni, he doesn't know anything globally. And maybe she does. And I'm like, it's all just evil. And we're going to the same cliff either way. Isn't it possible though that like, I mean, listen, I've been, I'm a naive person. We're heading into reset button. Here's the thing. Because I'm naive. You know, my dream when Trump got elected, I thought, you know what, maybe, maybe he's like going to like legalize marijuana on the federal level because he knows that'll create an economic boom. It's not helping. That would be death. Here's the thing about that though. I mean, not to interrupt the thought, but the whole thing about, you know, you see all these knuckleheads that are like, fucking weed's legal, awesome. It's not really legal while there's still brothers and sisters that are locked up on weed charges. Like that's ridiculous to celebrate in the streets. You look like a fucking fool and a self-obsessed little fucking kid. It depends, but it depends. Because that's crazy. But in California though, what they just passed, a lot of people are having their sentences commuted because of the- Great. So there are- It didn't happen in Denver. It hasn't happened in Washington. It's just, it hasn't happened. So it's not really legal. The other thing is this. The only reason that anybody is making anything legal is to make real money off of it. Right. And so that means that it's gonna be Pfizer and Upjohn and these characters. Monsanto. That are going, and Monsanto's already got dibs on it. That's what I heard. And they signed off in California for five years. The big companies, corporations won't get into it. Well, five years is nothing. That will elapse. They're gonna power fuck the system. It'll be illegal for you to grow. There won't be any seeds except Monsanto seeds. And it's gonna give you fucking death. You're gonna find the first deaths from weed and you won't have any of the helpful aspects of weed anymore because that cuts into the Oxycontin thing. The Oxycontin thing came out. The biggest opiate deaths that have happened in the last 10 years happened this year. And it's not heroin, it's Oto-Oxycontin. That's right. They start to fucking get bad press on that. So then did you see the, is the LA Times the other day? It was Oxycontin, little tablets over the whole globe. And they go, we're doing a globalization of Oxycontin and we're really hopeful about the widespread proliferation to help all their countries. Like they're just creating junkies everywhere and they know it just kills people. They also know, like what I know from heroin use is the same for all the opiate use. It doesn't really negate pain. It makes you more sensitive to pain. It makes the receptors more hot. You don't become like numb. You become hyper-pussy. You become hurt easily. Yeah. And so it does, it's fucking evil, man. Well, listen, I agree that the pharmaceutical companies, especially the people who are dispensing Oxycontin, which is just amazing. It's amazing. That drug cartel, I mean, to me- And then they get it okay, yeah, if you're under 12, it's okay too. I love that. That drug cartel is so smart because it's this like super powerful drug cartel sitting right in front of everyone- Fuck the war as cartels, you got nothing on them. Nothing, nothing. So what were you gonna say about it? You were hoping the federal legalization of marijuana? Well, I'm saying that the, well, yeah. My naive idea was Trump with like, and it was clearly an absolutely idiotic thing that I've thought. I don't even know why I thought it. But so Trump continues to disappoint me, but at least with the people he's picking to run shit. It's fucked up. So, but my hope is only just because from the pure, just from the hilarity of it, it would be, and that's not gonna happen probably. It's not gonna happen. It would be that the war's stopped, that the war's stopped, that the Middle East balances out, a dictator goes back into power, which fucking sucks, but at least it's not an endless air campaign. The war's stopped. It just slows down, at least it just stops. And then, not only does the war stop, again, this is my dream. Go ahead and play it back after the first fucking nuclear attack happens. I'm sorry I said it. I'm naive, like we both said, we're not political analysis. But my dream is this, only because if the war's stopped and then somehow the economy booms, which the stock market's doing great right now, the Federal Reserve just up the interest rate because it's apparently, now I know a lot of you guys are saying, no, it's a bubble, it's gonna fucking pop, but the economy, the stock market's booming. So the dream is that what happens is we realize that we have been completely brainwashed by a media that's owned by a couple of corporations that wanted war to continue and wanted shit to stay fucked up for a long time. And this is, again, this is just a stupid dream. He's appointing people who are absolutely ridiculous to high positions of power, it's horrible. But the dream is that somehow, all of a sudden the economy gets better. We see the end of ISIS and there is a period of prosperity and no war. They're, my dream date is that somehow, I'm gonna run for office. Through this lunatic, somehow through this person that we thought would be a lunatic, over the next four years or eight years or however long he's in office, we get to see the first baby born in the last, what, 20 years in an American nod at war. And if that fucking happens, if that happens, that will be such an insane indictment on a political regime that's been in power for so long that we just thought it was normal that it's gonna make me, it's gonna make a lot of people rethink a lot of shit. Now, all that being said, probably within the next six weeks, we're gonna be eating North Korean nukes. They're like, we've got our missile system designed. Yeah, bro, I feel like it, I mean, I had hope for Obama too. And then I thought in the second term, I'm like, I had hope again. Yeah, me too. And then I was like, he's fucking us again. And then this, it's interesting about that whole thing about like the way we saved Iraq. I was on a movie with these Iraqi people that were, I was going to shake down, like we were gonna search them for bombs and whatever, it was like a Navy SEAL movie. And talking to them. And they'd been, I think two years out of Baghdad at that time. And I said, well, what's it like? They're like, oh, well, when we were there, it was beautiful. It was like one of the most beautiful places. And it was like, it was like New York city or anything else. And I go, was it scary? They're like, no. And I go, was it horrible? Like it was, you know, cause you hear, all we hear about is the rape dungeons and shit and Saddam's crazy kids and all that kind of stuff. And I said, she said, well, it's not good to be in opposition to Saddam. Like, you know, those guys are who the rooms are reserved for. But those are like six guys. It's not like there's trains of people that are going down there being gassed. But they would make it seem the propaganda machine. It seemed like that. And so I'm talking to this lady and she's like, yeah, electricity running, like she's like, yeah, it's a city. Like I'm an asshole for like, I'm like, I figured you're like, you know, I had no idea. And yeah, the vision of it. And she said, and now it's just warring tribe. And so we've created chaos. We've created, we've created ISIS. We've created all of this to happen through our first assault on them through George Bush. And then, I mean, and I hate to even name George Bush. I used to think it was, I could put a name to it. It's whoever runs the show, man. Like, and then you talk about they want to destabilize like Arab Spring and all that kind of stuff. It's happening right now. Syria is one of the last things on the tick list. I mean, we go and we kill Qaddafi. But it didn't, but Syria didn't work. It's coming. I mean, we're in the mix right now. We're in the mix in Syria, but because of this. All we need to do is destabilize it. Yeah, but it isn't, I mean, I could be wrong because I'm not following this. But I know like Aleppo, that rotten war that's been going on in that city is ending. The rebels are burning buses that were supposed to get refugees out of there. They're burning the fucking buses. These are rebels supported in some way or another by the United States and they're burning buses to keep innocent people from getting out of there. So because of the Russian, the heavy Russian presence there and Russia helping Syria because apparently Russia has an oil pipeline that runs through there and needs the port or some shit. And that's really what it's all about is they want to get it all the way to the Gulf. That's it. But what's happening is because the new president is coming in who doesn't fit into the plan. Right. We're suddenly witnessing this thing that's been this conflict that's been going on. It's like simmering down a little bit. Why is that? Because why? Because maybe just fucking maybe whoever Clinton was working for wanted this war to keep going on forever. And maybe whoever Trump happens to be in all his awfulness and brusqueness and what's the word? Just brutishness. Maybe he's like, I don't want to be at war. I'm a fucking New York businessman. I make stakes. Until somebody gives him a check. You think so? Here's a billion dollars. Hey, would you like to be, here's 5% of our tank business. We're going to sell it all to the US defense. Would you like to be a part of that? You're going to garner a billion dollars. Oh, you're right, Tate. Like if you make the money, if you're the Fed and you want somebody on your side, how hard is it to put a bunch of zeros in their bank account? Yeah, but he's like, I mean, again, man, I sound like I'm a fucking Trump supporter, which I'm not. I'm not a Hillary supporter. You look like a Trump supporter. I fucking wear the red hat with pride. I just don't, you know what? I just don't want war. I'm sick of, I would love to live again in a country that's not at war. I think that would be great. I think the fact that war seems normal to people, that in fact it's like, we just don't even think about it. It's just something that's just part of being an American is like dropping bombs on other countries. That's just part of what it is to be, I want that to end. I want that to end. And I think that starts inside though. Right. Like, whenever I start thinking too much about fucking global warming or global extinction or whatever, those are things that, those are riddles that it doesn't even matter. All I'm doing is blowing air. Right. And at the end of the day, all I can do is impact the people that I touch throughout the day and kind of imbue safety and love and kindness in that, right? Easy to forget. And then that goes, right? I think it's also easy to forget like being on the West Coast, like, or the East Coast or somewhere. Like, I grew up in Michigan. I got an idea of like what that's like, you know? Or like you travel through the world, you're like, oh, this is, so the bigger question is, why is so much of America so disenfranchised that anything different is what we want? We don't, cause what we can say is that neither choice looked like a sane sound choice. So why is it when they give us two insane choices, people are actually for one or the other? That's an environment that's unsafe and like, why is our own country, why are our own communities unsafe and the dialogue is so contrary to each other that we'll hate our brothers here. You know what I mean? Because if you believe, cause you have this bumper sticker. Right. Like there's people that'll get their windows broken out for that bumper sticker. Why is it in the world like where there's, and also the press, the whole doctrine of that, like, you know, like the pipeline that's going through and the water protectors, that didn't get brought up once in the, like you could have really gotten people on your side. What, cause oil is so strong and both of them are complicit in that. Or that massive Norwegian fucking pedophile ring. That's not happening. It's not getting brought up. Yeah. You can stop that Obama. It's not, you don't mention it once. Any reporter could ask Clinton or Trump that. It doesn't get brought up. It's weird. Weird. And then what's really weird is I post a thing about it and then people are like, why do you want to stop progress, bro? Like they're talking about poisoning and it's like, they're like, what, you use oil? I'm like, yeah, and I'll continue to. But I think there's a way to safely get it. And in the greatest depression that America's had ever, a few years ago, the oil companies had record profits again every quarter. That's crazy, man. And so you're looking at something that is corrosive. And also, I think a really important thing to remember here, this is something that I keep forgetting cause it's so absolutely bizarre is that in the midst of all of us getting tangled up in Trump versus Hillary and all of these immediate considerations politically that we're having to deal with mentally, machines are waking up. Yes, last world, this is full circle. Yeah, and jobs are going away. Oh, different. You know what I mean? It's the same, it's all, I mean, even all, I think one thing that with Trump that people are missing that isn't getting reported on is that Trump is an example of the technological disruption that we're all experiencing. Because what happened was, what's his name? The Podesta got an email from someone saying, this is like Google, we have a security concern, click on this link and we've got to redo your password. That was the hack, it was just phishing. And Podesta sends that to the security analysis to looks at it and writes back with a typo supposedly saying you should deal with this. When he was saying you shouldn't, you left out an NT or something. It was just a simple typo, apparently. Who knows, a lot of people, everything is questioned now. But anyway, the whole point is the medium that allowed for the infiltration to happen is a brand new thing on the planet. And so this political victory has a lot of its roots in a relatively brand new technology. And so what you're seeing is novelty being generated from the acceleration of technology as we get closer to the singularity. I think that's maybe what Terrence McKenna would say is that Donald Trump being president is a foreshock of the incoming singularity, of the weirdness that we're going to begin experiencing with such rapidity that it makes the Donald Trump, the weirdness of the host of celebrity apprentice being president, seem like nothing. And to add to it, another complaint that people are filing against Trump is him tweeting. So it's again another technological disruption. He's using a brand new technology to express himself, no other president has done this in this way before. He's not being politically just saying how he feels through this brand new technology. And it's shocking to us. It's shocking not just because the guy isn't spell checking his tweets, which anyone I do that, and I'm not gonna be fucking president, it's shocking because it's brand new. We've never seen that happen, a president doing that before. Again, novelty, novelty, novelty. And it all is an indication of what's in store for us as a species. We don't know exactly what it's gonna be, but the next fucking thing is gonna make Donald Trump seem like nothing. Like he was a good guy. Or just, I don't think it will be like it'll, he'll seem like good or bad. I don't think it's an ethical thing. It's gonna be like, I mean, God. Like we're not even in that existence anymore. It's gonna be like contact with an alien. It's gonna be a machine waking up. That's totally true though. I mean, I feel like technology's about to trip over itself, right? When, like whatever Kurzweil's ideas were, it's like that. It seems like that's inevitable. Like when you look at like, that we rode a horse a hundred years ago. And I mean, cause that's transportation. And you look at like the only reason we don't run on air right now in our cars is only because oil and gas is so strong that they strangle any new technology that comes up. So they actually stop evolution, right? They negate that from happening. And I think that's the, also the sad part is that they go, well, people are dumber and they're not as informed. If we can control the narrative, then, and we can make dumber people with pharmacy. Like it's all this whole thing that all works together. We can poison their food. We can do what, they want a dumber populace and whoever this they is. And it's for what end? Like I don't, like I wish there was at least a big picture that was like an intergalactic picture that I don't know about instead of just some fucking green. Let me give you a new way to be fucking intergalactic theory. I'm ready. So a lot of people say that the government, you know, the people who believe in aliens will say the government is in some way working with aliens to attempt to like to get new technologies or they have made contact. But what if the reality of the situation is the government, some governments of the world or these shadowy people are actively trying to suppress an alien invasion that's happening in the form of emergent technologies that are manifesting in these ways that are making us become more tightly connected. So what's actually happening is the aliens aren't coming in the form of UFOs. The aliens are coming in the form of technologies that unify people and create a kind of unification that can't be tainted by the government. It's created this, it's like the ultimate weapon. If you were going to war with a government would be to shoot something into a planet that would make it to the people joined together. We talk through the internet, we come up with our own ability to figure out what is true and what isn't true. Through that, it subverts all the governments of the world and then in that level of connectivity, we can give birth to the super intelligence that is going to be the final subversion of all power systems because it will be exponentially more intelligent. I love it. So that's the idea. There's a war happening to suppress the birth of a new consciousness that's growing out of technology and places where people gather together in a way that they aren't being suppressed or by ridiculous laws. And that's the real war that's happening and no one, no one can stop what's coming. No Vladimir Putin, no oil company executive, no Donald Trump, no Hillary Clinton because this is a fucking spaceship. Do you think the biggest coup was when the internet went live? It's hard to trace it back. Was it when the internet went live? Was it when, who knows? Like there's no telling. You could, was it when the first single cell organism connected with another single cell organism and began the march in the direction of like a brand new intelligence appearance? But now you're talking about stuff that can happen in one generation versus in the thousand generations. That's right. It's a spaceship. And this is what's really funny about it is because, and this is what humans do. We think we know what a thing looks like based on our own technologies. And so because we think that it creates these massive blind spots in our ability to see things. So we're like, oh yeah, that's what a bad person looks like. Or that's what, you know what I mean? That's what a UFO is gonna at least have lights glowing on the side. It's probably gonna, it's definitely gonna have lights. It's a little like the Millennium Falcon. Yeah, it'll look probably like a little more advanced than the Millennium Falcon. You know, it'll be close to that. It'll definitely have engines. No, you know what I mean? So when the UFO begins to fly out of the combined attention of all the people currently working on technology and bioengineering, when the UFO is flying out of our own minds and appearing in the form of rapid increase and technological innovations and discoveries, all leading to the very obvious conclusion of a superintelligence appearing on the planet, when that's happening, we're just like, I don't know, I don't see it. You know what we're doing? What we're doing is as a group, as a collective, we're going, that doesn't look like anything to me. Well, remember Westworld when they show up, that doesn't look like anything to me. I think we can't see it. It's like, this thing is a Trump, it doesn't matter because a fucking alien is about to land here. It just isn't landing in the way we predicted it would land. And it's a weird motherfucker, man. Whatever this thing is, it's weird. Like it is exponentially getting weirder, you know? And so that's exciting to me. Do you think in the subconscious there's evil? Yeah. I mean, evil in the sense of like what we were talking about earlier. Like nefarious thoughts and like wanting to hurt others and things. Well, certainly, I mean, if you haven't thought about throwing coffee onto a baby at a rest room. That'd be a conscious though. What? Oh, deep down. Like I'm wondering, like if you're transcendent, like if you die, if the soul's a thing and you die and you're immortal, which I kind of think you are, like in this other verse, what does that, is there evil in that afterlife or in that next life type of idea? You know what I mean? Like is there such enlightenment that we come together in a unified form like what you're talking about in a way? Or is there still room for greed and avarice and these kinds of things? Well, probably, I would say like, I mean, that's the thing is like the... Cause that would be just another incarnation of this then. Well, that's, well, I mean, that's the... So the idea is, I just had this guy on a blue-eyed mind. Probably people are gonna get sick of me yapping about him, but this guy, David Nicktern, is just a Buddhist teacher. And he says, well, it's not, he doesn't say it, but it's a Buddhist idea. Anything based on causes and conditions has to be impermanent. So is there evil? Well, there's gonna be impermanence. Like even if some super intelligence comes blasting through the combined imagination of the smartest people on the planet and presses reset in a way that we didn't expect at all by maybe allowing for a sensory apparatus that we didn't even know we had to open up so that we can see things that formerly we couldn't see, if those things are based on causes and conditions, they're still going to be impermanent, no matter what it is. So some fundamental problem would probably still remain. Would at that higher level where, I don't know, let's just imagine that the economies of the world through this as of yet non-existent technology triple quadruple quadruple quadruple quadruple quadruple. So now no one has any need for anything because anything they can think instantly appears in front of them, anywhere they wanna travel, they instantly appear in that place. They know that there's no such thing as death anymore. Essentially, heaven appears on earth. Is there still gonna be avarice? Is there still gonna be jealousy, competition? Sure, but maybe that game won't seem so serious at that level. Maybe it'll just be like playing Monopoly with your friends. Maybe it won't, because how much of evil is really just based on the idea that there's a limited supply? Certainly. So much, how much of exploitation comes from, I guess I'm thinking of it more like we go into like a gaseous, aqueous ether that we all become one in that. And there's not a other. You know what I mean? Yes, and then you take it one step further than that. Which is that this thing that we're contemplating the possibility of this unified consciousness that then unifies with the universe that when then unifies with all potential universes and then unifies with everything. Now you're looking at just the thing waking up, waking up, God waking, it's like God coming out of a daydream or something. Like, wow, shit, fuck. That was wild, what I was just fantasizing about. When I take LSD, I'll go deep into these thought spirals where you get lost in almost another existence down there and you come out of it for a second like, what the fuck was that? Like, I was witnessing mushroom clouds for a second. I saw the end of the world. Whoa, that was amazing. So who knows? Will there be- How often do you take LSD? No, well, I mean, since I realized the consequences that come from taking schedule one drugs and realized that it's not worth the risk anymore, I stopped taking it completely. Is that right? Yeah, I absolutely don't take it. Any time I talk about taking it on the podcast, I do it as a form of entertainment. But I certainly would never take- You won't risk it. Well, not only would I not risk it, but I think that- You think there's answers there? In LSD? Yeah. Absolutely. I think that it's one of the most powerful neutropic drugs that is ever- So like you think it's neutropic in the way that it would nourish the brain? Yeah, absolutely. No question. The more they do research on it, the more they're gonna find that out. And thank God they are doing the research. Is that right? Absolutely. It's a therapeutic chemical or blessed that it has appeared on the earth. It's one of the great gifts of science. It's one of the great gifts of humanity. It's one of the- What do you think the best ones are? I mean- The great gifts? As far as those kinds of things, if you were gonna go mushrooms, ayahuasca, LSD, DMT, like which transcendental experience? I think this is why we need to end the prohibition on these substances, is that trained psychologists can prescribe these things based on a person's needs. It's, there's no one substance that is right for everybody. There are people who should definitely never, ever put LSD in their bodies. Ever. Ever- I remember there's always the stories like they're like, you know that guy that walks around with the bow and arrow on his back in the long trench coat, they call him Batman. And he just wanders the streets because he had a bad LSD trip and he separated. You know, like there's always a guy like that in every town, right? Sure. Yeah, you'll hear that. And I think those are ghost stories. Like there's like, nobody ever's like, there's other things going on there. It's always like they blame. You can do this. You can find, they did, I can't remember the name of this type of study, but basically they went through, they wanted to see is there, what is the correlation between taking LSD and psychosis or schizophrenia or mental illness or whatever. And so you can look it up. They did this study and using just data, they gathered from mental patients. You know, maybe they, you know, who knows, maybe when they did the interviews, they lied about having taken LSD because they felt like they would be like prosecuted because they're apparently, who the fuck knows? But apparently there isn't a correlation. You guys can look it up. I know that sounds insane. It's one of the many things that have been planted in our brains by this rotten war on drugs. Is it good to take a psychedelic non-stop to never, to take massive amounts of a psychedelic over and over and over again, when you need to like be in the marketplace and work and have a productive life? You know, no, clearly not. Is it good to do anything like that? I mean, I feel like that about like push-ups. No, you need a recovery period. You need to be able to experience it. You need to reflect on it. You need to grow into it. There's all that for sure. But with psychedelics, you know, someone I was talking to once came to me and said he was in recovery and they had read about the Bill Wilson being a- He did acid, he was Timothy Leary's buddy. Yes, and this person came to me, he was in recovery and said, you know, I'm thinking about taking LSD. And sometimes people do that in recovery. They come to me because they know that I have a strong stance on psychedelics and they think that I'm gonna be like, yeah, man. Get it. Do it, man. Or whatever they think, yeah. But what I say is, if there is a 1% chance that you take this substance and relapse, don't take it. You can't take it. If there's any, if there- If there's a risk of that. If there's a risk that you're gonna start hitting the bottle again from this because it triggers some part of your brain that you conquer- And we just don't know enough. We don't know enough. Don't risk that, man. It's not, the thing is, are you enjoying your sobriety? Is it working for you? Have you been working hard? Did you achieve the state of years of sobriety? Are you willing to risk being plunged back into that fucking hell? Because in other words, the reason you, now if somebody was in the throes of alcohol addiction and came to me and said, man, I don't know what to do. Like, I don't know if you saw this terrible video of a guy who was euthanized himself because he couldn't stop drinking. In one of these countries where it's legal, and I see that and I think, my God, if only I had had a, with some, not me, but I know people- Get a few days with them, yeah. With a trained psychiatrist from MAPS, with a nice satchel filled with pharmaceutical grade, LSD or MDMA or any kind of psychedelic, if only we had tried that before the person killed himself because he was suffering so much because he was pouring poison in his body. You know what I mean? In that case, if someone came to me and said- Why not try? Yes, do it. That's what I say to everybody, like, before they, if anybody's looking at like, oh, I'd like to get sober, I'm like, have you tried everything? Because if you haven't tried everything, you're gonna be unsatisfied. You need to try everything, burn down every bridge, and fucking, if it doesn't work, there's another option. But if, fuck, if you can do something else, if you can eat Twizzlers, and all of a sudden Twizzlers takes the place of that for you, awesome, enjoy the Twizzlers. Do you, can I ask you, yeah. I have to ask you this, you know, we've been, this is like, we're going over a little bit, it's 553. You need to go somewhere? No, I've got no life. This is what I wanna ask you, Tate. Okay. Because for me, people like you, who have achieved this sobriety, mean a lot to people. You know what I mean? Because it means a lot to people, because people see you and they think, you know what, if shit gets really out of control for me, like if, I think it. I think, man, what would happen to you if like, you started, who knows? Let's just say, out of someone, one experimental weekend in New York, you decide to shoot heroin. Let's imagine, I'm not gonna, friends, I will never do that. I'm never gonna shoot heroin, nor will I snort heroin. I'm not gonna take any heroin. I'm not gonna do that to me. But I do think, what did you say it did happen? Right. And I went off the fucking rails. And I went deep down some dark hole. It's really nice to know that people like you around who I can borrow money from. Right, yeah. I'm just kidding. Yeah, perfect, perfect. I know, it's nice to know. People, this is, I just sober people to me remind me of these life rafts floating in the ocean. And you know that, so do you feel like a responsibility to hang on to your sobriety for everybody else? 100%. 100%. That's the one reason I think it's like, you know, I listened to, God, there's a really pretty blonde girl that talks a lot about ayahuasca as being a cure for alcoholism or drug addiction. There's all kinds of stuff around that kind of stuff. Amber lion? Yeah, yeah, that's her. And I've read some of those things and it's interesting and whatever. And everybody, everybody points to the stories. The stories about Bill Wilson taking acid are now famous. They're lower at this point for anybody in the drug community that's going to see. I mean, there's a lot of that. Whatever your agenda is, you could use whatever story to create a narrative for whatever you'd like. You know, awesome. Does that get you help or closer to your goals? Probably not. It's just like, you know, it's like the guy coming that's sober for a long time going, what do you think about me taking acid? It's like, I love acid. What do you mean? What are you asking me for? Or whatever. And all he wants is some comfort of somebody else. And that's the thing is like, we're always looking regardless of who it is or what they're looking for. They're looking for somebody else to defer their own responsibility and accountability for their lives by saying, well, Duncan said it was okay. So now I feel stronger and more confident because now there's confidence in numbers and whatever. And it's just part of the human condition. I mean, I do it. I feel like you have to be on guard for that kind of thing and go, I need to own my own thing fully. I don't want to ever say what somebody should do because I don't want you to blame me later. I want you to go and pray to whatever God it is you do, get right with the universe and ask for answers. And if you're not sure of your answers, then be real careful how you tread. That's right. And so I think that stuff that Amber does is cool. It's interesting. I think that if I'm not wrong, she's a person that has found a chemical salvation kind of later in life. I think Joe introduced her to it actually. She hadn't smoked pot or done any mushrooms or anything up until that point of her life. And then it had such a profound effect. She's like, looks into all these studies and everything is a panacea, right? It's very nice. Here's a weight loss pill. It'll also give you huge muscles and you'll be ripped and your tits will be big. Whatever the thing is, everybody wants the thing, right? And there's not the thing. There's just work. There's work, diligence, consistency, commitment, discipline. Those are the things, man. And that's in a spiritual life. That's in a physical, whatever self you want to form, that's where it exists. And nobody likes to look at that because that's tough. And it's not like I can flip a switch, but I can take a pill and if I could take a pill, fuck, that's better. And it's not, there's no result like that. I've taken a lot of pills in my life and I've seen a lot of people take a lot of pills. I've never seen anything that replaces diligence, hard work, consistency, discipline. I've never seen it. And now also, I think that one important thing to note is that Bill Wilson, the idea is that when you're fucking addicted to something really, truly addicted, this is a spiritual disease. This is a malady that can't really be cured in the normal ways. And so the idea is, it really comes down to, sorry, but only God can save you now. That's the idea. There's nothing anyone in this dimension can do for you. You need a transcendent experience. And thus, LSD. The idea was- I agree. I agree with that, but the thing that I'm careful about and just to finish up my thought on talking about those things as being curative is that perhaps, but I would hate to give the impression that you can supplant this chemical plant, whatever it is, with the hard work, discipline, dedication, because what you know is what I know. I've had spiritual experiences before on drugs and off drugs and they don't have legs. No way. They don't last. I need to stay in the conversation. I need to stay in the work if I want that thing to continue for me. And so I think it's the same way. And it's like, and you can't just stay on drug. Like that's not an answer, you know what I mean? And so like, I think that if you've got that, I think they could be, because the problem with alcoholism is you get caught into a mantra where there's no help. There's no, like people will offer you sobriety. You're like, that's ridiculous. There's no way. And then there's a small window that opens, a little window of hope opportunity. People call it a moment of clarity sometimes. With which you can maybe crawl through the other side and get a little bit of breath of fresh air. And when that happens, and maybe what you can do, maybe you can orchestrate that with ayahuasca or with LSD or something like that. Maybe that can happen for an al-Qaq. I don't know. I haven't had this. Like it can create the moment of clarity. Right, right. But then you better get fucking busy, man. You better move your feet. Don't take that shit for granted. Cause I feel like it's like the athlete that comes into the gym and he's like a natural talent. Like he's fucking naturally gymnastic. He's talented at jiu-jitsu. He's really good. He moves great. And maybe he comes in and he doesn't know anything. And maybe he finishes a purple belt or something or something crazy. Like that, that doesn't really ever happen. But like, maybe there's something like crazy. Like he's a phenom. That guy never lasts. He never stays cause he almost got it for free. And so he never learns how to work hard. That's what happened to me. I know, I know. Ari Shafir also, same experience. Running in there was so easy for us. It just all came naturally. And then you're like, yeah, what's the big deal about that? Eddie's like, please let me just give you the purple belt. I'm like, Eddie, you know, I've only been here for a couple of weeks. You don't even respect the art, really. I'm out. Yeah, I gotta go. Yeah. I'll never forget the day that I left. Eddie Bravo's Dojo and he, I remember he cried, he wept. He's like, I, yeah, he's like, I've never seen a man so talented at Jiu Jitsu. He'll, I'm sure he'll vouch for this. And he's probably, you can probably find that on YouTube. Yeah. I think it's on YouTube and testimonial. I feel like that will be on YouTube. But I learned, it's not right now. But I learned from, I mean, he taught me everything I know about Jiu Jitsu, which is that for me, it was one of those things like, you didn't need a lot of lessons. I only needed like seven. Seven. Tate, man, this is so inspirational. And you always are. How can people find you? People are gonna want it. Oh, well, I've got a podcast called Pirate Life Radio. You can find me there. I try to put something up every week. And you can find me at Tate Fletcher, T-A-I-T, F-L-E-T-C-H-E-R on all the social media stuff. And we forgot to talk about your, oh, go ahead. Go ahead.

And you can find us at K-Man Coffee, C-O, K-Man Coffee Co on Instagram, all kinds of stuff happening there. I don't know. Cool, man. What were you gonna say? Oh, we forgot to talk about neuro-linguistic programming, which please don't use NLP on me, man. I don't want to be sucked into some weird fucking vortex. And if you already have been doing it, stop. Don't you feel safer? Yeah. Instantly, yeah. I feel like you're my daddy. Okay, Tate, you're the best, man. I love you, man. Thank you. Thanks for listening, everybody. That was Tate Fletcher.

It is I, Dee Trussell, and you are listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast. This is the second intro that has been recorded within the beautiful mansion of Ari Shafir. Right now I'm in the one of the lower rooms. I keep finding new rooms in the place. It's incredible. There's secret chambers, there's hidden gardens, there's wind chime rooms. I found what appears to be some kind of factory where these children are manufacturing something for them. I'm not sure what. The guard there made me leave right away, which is fine. I'm just grateful that Ari gave us this amazing launching pad to start our lives here in New York. And the good news is we finally found a New York apartment and we will be moving in at the end of the month. But I must admit finding a New York apartment has been incredibly stressful. It's not like finding an apartment in Los Angeles. In LA, you go on Craigslist, you find an apartment, you go to the apartment, smoke some weed with your landlord, and boom, you're in a place. But not in New York. In New York, if you actually have to go into a scanning chamber where a doctor, this crazy, our doctor was this bald headed. He had these glistening fingers and they rub every part of your body. They feel your nipples, under your nipples, down to your stomach, pushing into your fat, if you have it, down to your legs, into your groin and taint and lower buttocks, they squeeze your ass like ham. And while they need your buttocks, they sing what is called the New York landlord's hymn. Will you be accepted to a concrete hive? It's really fucked up. Then after that, they go through all your bank records, all your receipts. They go through every single thing that they can find. They tumble through your earwax, globules with metallic glistening tweezers. It's a never ending process. Then finally, when you get approved for the apartment, it's just an apartment. It's not like you're trying to get access to a fucking nuclear missile silo. You just want to move into an apartment. Finally, when you get access to the apartment, you have to take 800 individually signed cashiers checks in a leather bound box into the depths of the financial district. You are warned, by the way, when you go to bring your leather bound box of cashiers checks to your apartment manager in the financial district, that if you go the wrong way, you may never come back. They say there are things down there, pathways down there that lead to places that no man should go. So you have to be very careful. Your phone doesn't work the moment you walk through a certain part of the financial district. The clock starts running backwards. Weird texts started coming in from my past. I was getting texts from like 12 years ago. Then I got a text. It malfunctioned and appeared to be a text coming in from my mother from 2045. Just strange fucked up mechanical problems, I guess, because they say there's some kind of crystal buried underneath the financial district or some kind of geode deposit or some shit. I wasn't paying attention. You go down into this fucking financial district until finally you come to just this blank wall of a skyscraper. No windows, just it's massive. It looks like a monolith, essentially, with one doorway leading into it. You walk to the door. It does a retinal scan. It's the door leads just into an elevator, not to a lobby, nothing like that. No buttons in the elevator. You shoot. It didn't even feel like it was moving, but I'm assuming it went up. The door opens up. You go down this. It essentially looks like a mausoleum. Flowers in urns on the wall, incense, the dingling of bells from somewhere far away. Then you enter into this central annex where you have to sign, I don't know, 30 pages of contracts written in very small letters. They actually fucking make you sign in with a quill pin dipped in red ink because it's New York City and everybody wants to be fancy. And then what's really fucked up is they take a tiny little drop of blood from your pinky finger and squeeze that into the ink and mix that in with some ash from the incense. This is how arcane the New York City regulations are when it comes to housing. Like you would think you could just use a regular pen. No, quill pin, big, thick contract, dude in robes with no whites in his eyes, just black fucking eyes. You sign this fucking contract, which by the way, I don't have time to fucking read. I was hungry. I had to use a bathroom. There were no bathrooms in the monolith. And then right after you sign the fucking thing, a woman wearing like high heels and it looked essentially like a Valkyrie costume bangs a gong and then no joke. The guy and he was in the robes. I guess he's got some kind of New York disease because it's easy to get sick out here. He cries. He's fucking blood. He cried blood like out of one of his eyes, just a single bloody tear drip down and landed right next to my signature on the contract. So it's a pain in the ass to get a place here in New York, but we did get a place, but I am feeling a little stressed out. So I'm not going to complain though. I'm happy to be here. It's a beautiful city. I'm so happy that we got into a place and I don't mean to like diss the powers that be here in New York City. I recognize your power and your omnipresence and I'm glad that you've allowed me to enter into this wonderful hive of humanity and power. We have a humdinger of a show for you today, friends.

Everybody please, a giant round of applause for Emil Amos, everybody. Let him hear it. Emil Amos! I was born to love no one. I was born to love no one. No one to love me. Just the wind and the long green grass. Frost in a broken tree. I was made to love magic. All it's one that you know. But you all lost that magic. Many, many, many, many years ago. I was born to use my eyes. Dream past the silent skies. Not to be tied to an old stone grave. Paint the world with a brush in the shape of a sling. I was made to love magic. All it's one that you know. But you all lost that magic. Many, many, many, many years ago. Thank you. Sometimes you want the world to spin around you. And you remember the world should never spin around you. I see that look in your eyes. It made me very upset. And I don't know how I'm gonna get you back yet, back yet, back yet. I don't reflect the others around me. I still can't understand just what it is about me. Tracks from hell you face. To this far we place. And I don't know how I'm gonna need to erase, erase, erase. The annals of history can skip over me. Get on with it. I never wanted to encourage the fools to be part of it. Don't you know I don't know how, I don't know how. Sometimes you want the world to spin around you. Then you remember the world should never spin around you. Emile Amos everybody, let him hear it, Emile Amos. Everybody welcome to a live Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast being recorded from the Bell House in Brooklyn. Today's guest, he was a student of one of my favorite Buddhist leaders, someone I consider to be, someone I think about at least three times a day. Chokyum Trumper Rinpoche is his name. An incredible teacher who started the Shambhala tradition of Buddhism. David Nickturn is his longest student. He is a senior Buddhist teacher, meditation guide, and an Emmy award-winning composer and musician. Everybody please a giant round of applause for David Nickturn. Let him hear it, David Nickturn. Welcome. Thank you. That was quite an introduction there. Oh thanks. Too long what do you think? Too much? I shut up, I went too long. You're projecting some version of the future there, right? I was projecting? Yeah. I mean, I think it's a pretty, I think it's a, yes, I was projecting, you have to project a version of the future, but I would say that it is an assessment that's probably pretty accurate about what we can expect ahead of us. I mean, I don't think it takes Terrence McKenna to say things are going to get really weird pretty soon. Weirder than they are now. You disagree? That's what he does, he just doesn't talk. There is an interesting atmosphere right now, don't you all agree? Sort of heightened in some way and laced with uncertainty. I've been trying to think if there's anything, if I've experienced in my life a similar energy or time. So, most of you New Yorkers, right, you remember 2009-11, yeah, walking down towards the World Trade Area. There's a kind of gap feeling to it, like that nobody knows what's going to happen next, which is why I thought it was interesting that you started to project a future into that gap. Well, I mean, isn't, that's what we do as humans, right? You have this emptiness ahead of you. You have to, part of what our brains allow us to do is to construct some kind of prediction for what will happen so that we can plan our next move. That's a good thing, isn't it? Yeah, unless you believe it. Right. Well, okay, alright, let's follow that. So, yes, okay. So, I'll tell you about believing in something. Yeah, I know exactly what you mean. So, I just got the flu, and I'm doing exactly what you should do if you want to get better from the flu quickly. Lay in bed and just look at the internet, because that'll definitely heal you. I'm just like sitting there, jumping backwards and forwards from Huffington Post to Drudge Report, Drudge Report to Huffington Post, Reddit conspiracy, Reddit WTF, back to Drudge Report. I don't know why I'm doing that. Just snorting, just snorting Satan's fucking shit off of the earth. Oh yeah, just getting baked on demon farts, basically. And then somewhere in the midst of that, I realized I'm sick. I mean, not sick physically, but this is sickening my mind. My mind feels afflicted by this in a way that isn't the flu, like it's like dragging me down. And so, yes, absolutely, I believe in it. Even now, I mean, even you saying like, well, it's the belief, it's the problem, implying that there's the potential to not believe in it, I don't believe that. Well, like if we could, could we enter the realm of meditation practice? Are you all meditators out there? A lot of people meditate these days, right? When I started, nobody was meditating in 1970. It was kind of not exactly geeky, but off the map. So when you meditate, right, you're sitting still, which is novel and innovative in itself. That's something we rarely do. And you're just paying attention to some simple experience that you're having, like breathing, listening to sound, just being where you are, right? Like here, you hear the roar of the air conditioning system. So then in that space that you leave, your mind arises, right? And all kinds of thoughts like some of the ones you described will flurry through, like traffic going through an intersection, right? And you do have the opportunity to look at it and go recognize that it appears to have form and it appears to be engaged with this sort of reality kind of thing. But it's totally ephemeral. Your thoughts are ephemeral, right? So have any of you had that experience meditating that you have a moment of recognition? Oh, these are just thoughts. And they could be good thoughts. They could be really positive thoughts, or they could be scary thoughts. They could be kind of neutral thoughts. But there's a moment of clarity, which you recognize that it is the mind producing narrative, producing discursive thought. And you don't have to be afraid of it, and you don't have to chase it, and you don't have to repress it, but you can just see it as it is. So that's powerful if more of that was going on right now. Right now, people are chasing their narratives down dark corridors. Isn't that true? Yes. And we're getting sucked into that. Right. Some people have made a profession of creating dark narratives and sucking other people into them. But we're getting sucked in. So I think a lot of people I'm talking to feel their own mental process accelerating in this kind of time, and fear will accelerate it, and anxiety will accelerate it. But the truth is, as you said, we don't really know what's going to happen. Right. So if there's any way to kind of acknowledge that uncertainty and the space of that uncertainty and not move too quickly one way or the other, I think that's going to be what the next iteration is, because right now everybody's going, well, what do we do? All right. Well, let's talk about the uncertainty then. Yeah. Because, okay. Does that make sense to you? Yes, absolutely. Okay. So just because you're a teacher and I think part of getting a chance to be with a teacher is you have to be completely honest or you're wasting time, right? Yeah. So when you say that, when you say it, talk about that, you know, the uncertainty, like land in the world of uncertainty. Yeah. Part of me is like, not me, but a part of me is angrily like, fuck that shit, man. I don't want to do that. Like that sounds awful. Like the whole point of the part of my mind that manufactures the future and contemplates what's going to happen. You just said two different things though. What do you mean? You said manufacture and contemplating. Yes. Manufacturing is like, are you manufacturing the future or are you contemplating possibilities? Those are two different things. Oh, fuck. He's been doing this to me for like a couple of months now. Well, I'm actually listening to you. Wow. Yeah. Okay. Well, sometimes a part of my mind is projecting a future. Sometimes a part, and sometimes I'm contemplating that projection, but they're not happening at the same time. I don't think. Okay. So, but still, then this is the same thing that pissed me off about Shogun Trumpa, which is also what makes me love him is the thing that it produces inside of me is that is a lot of frustrated feelings, a lot of like, like that sounds boring to live in uncertainty like that. It's uncomfortable. Oh, yeah. Yeah. From a conventional point of view. Yes. Right. What you're used to. Yes. From what I'm used to. Then you have to look at the things you do to make yourself comfortable and all of us and just look, are we really comfortable? Is that really working? No. Not at all. It's one of the things you did to make yourself comfortable while you had the flu, right? You were lying on the bed snorting. You had a lot of quite a lot of adjectives there. Yeah. Demons. I caught demons. You know, so that might have been a superficial idea of comfort, but it sounded to me at least like it wasn't really making you comfortable. No. Right. No, it's more like, I guess comparable to when you have poison ivy and you're scratching the poison ivy and like in those moments of scratching it, it feels so good. Sure. But then when you're like eventually it just becomes this oozing pink blistered thing, which is what this is for sure. It's scratching like a poison ivy. Because I know for certain that I don't need to go on Drudge Report nine times a day. Like there's nothing there for me after the second time. It's like the same thing. And it's been the same thing for years. Yeah. Yeah, I still do it. I really do. Why? I think I do like it. Duncan, that's what addicts say. Wow, fuck. Oh, you think it's like an internet addiction? Yeah, clearly. This is an intervention. You motherfucker. You profanity fuck you. Fuck you assholes. I'll never stop. I'm out of here. Somebody get me an internet. Fuck. Yes, it's addiction. I will admit it and accept it. Yeah. Well, that's the first step. Yeah, that's good. Where is your mother anyhow? Is she here? What? No, she died. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Yeah, me too. What do you got to say something? The other way, if I'm like, yeah, no, it's not that bad. Just keep moving. I actually would have liked to meet her. What? I would have liked to meet her. She would have liked you. Yeah? A lot, yeah. She's a very spiritual person. Uh-huh. I think, you know, again, I'm trained in Buddhism, so that's just naturally what's going to flow through. And if there was one thing to say about it that maybe is in common with other things, it's the art of working with your mind as it is. So we are all experiencing our minds in this context, I think, in a heightened way. And I noticed that, like, we were having dinner last night, and one of my friends is quite politically active, and she started talking about what's happening now. And her energy started to whip up like a tornado, you know? I think a lot of us have had this happen. It happened to you when you were talking about the current situation. Yes. You start to, you know, kind of wind power up, you know? And it was actually a funny moment. It reminded me of about 40 years ago when I was in LA I mean, a lot of music work. I was having dinner with a bunch of people, and one of them was Linda Ronstadt. And she was a very politically active person. She was talking about nuclear war, which at that time was like a big issue. And as she started talking about it, I started, in my mind's eye, I started, she looked like she was turning into a bomb, like literally her energy was going, and I thought she was going to explode at a certain point. So the question is, can we view these situations without them stealing our minds away and controlling the way our energy is shaping, or can we ground ourselves into this experience, which I think is going to become increasingly important. All the things you talked about, the digital, the virtual reality, people are going to become more and more ungrounded and alienated into their own bodies and their own kind of earthly existence. So to me, that's a counterpoint, isn't it, for us to stay grounded. And in being grounded, you have to pay attention to the present very carefully, and if you find yourself getting too far into the future, you've just lifted off. So in the present, you can have insights about the future. People have had projections and predictions, and in Tibetan Buddhism, they say, sometimes people have achieved a kind of knowingness about past, present, and future, like that it opens up. Like, did you see that movie, Arrival? Where time is sort of just a loop, and the past and the present and the future are all sort of less distinct than the way we think about it. So, but if we ground ourselves in the present, like we're here right now, right, everybody here? You feel your chair, you feel your body. We're not so hysterical right now, right? There's a kind of stability here. That's what I think the antidote is personally going forward. It doesn't say what you do or what you don't do. You might have to fight. That's the right way to go into battle, like Duncan and I were talking about going to battle properly. There's been all kinds of battles since the beginning of time. So we were talking about, remember the mixed martial arts thing? I do. Say something about that. Well, we had this conversation before the day or two ago. One of the things I said before the mixed martial arts thing is I don't want to be part of history. I was thinking I get to live this incarnation without experiencing real American history, like no serious, serious history, because we've got a bit of history. September 11th was a little taste of history. The war in Iraq was sanitized. It wasn't like World War II unless you fought there or have a friendly member who fought there. It's like just this distance, kind of like clean little war, the war in Afghanistan, no. But this feels like we're on the verge of like history, history. Like real history could happen. Like the kind I don't want to be in. I want a nice, relaxed, like I want it to be like, you know, like a surprise celebrity death. Just hang out there, but not history, history. So that's what we were talking about. And then the idea is, well, if we are entering this place, you can Shambhala his path. That's what you'd call it, right? Shambhala is a warrior's tradition, which means that it's not a passive thing. You enter into what's happening like a warrior, ready to fight. Wait, wait, whoa, slow down. Thank you, teacher. Yeah. Only if you really had to, because the real code of the war is not to fight to find a way not to. Right. And to do that, you have to kind of know yourself and know the landscape very well. So there's a deep need to settle in and really learn yourself in a kind of deep way. Then you see what needs to happen, but we don't shy away from entering history, right? Yeah. There's another way of looking at history is that you might want to flip that and go, yeah, let's enter history. In a good way. Let's make good history. Oh, yeah. Well, that'd be cool. Like the invention of a time machine or something. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Like... I just want to go to a FEMA camp, man. I don't want to get taken to a gulag. I've got these, you know, hours and hours of podcasts that any, like, just vaguely fascist tribunal would play it and be like taking behind the building and make love to him. I don't know. That would be good history. A sexual fascist regime. So in your history, you're kind of the star of your history, right? I don't think... The history I just depicted, I don't know if I'm a star, I'm getting fucked behind a building by fascists. I don't know if that... I guess it's a star of a certain kind of history. But what's happening to all these people? What's that? While you're getting fucked in the ass, what's happening to all these people? You projected the fuck in the ass, Mr. Nickton. But that is exactly what was happening. Well, they're watching, you know, they're applauding. No, they're not. They're... What are you doing? What are you going to be doing? Filming it. Filming it! Thank you. Yeah. Monetizing it. Yeah. But the metaphor, going back to the metaphor of the warrior, the metaphor is manifesting some kind of bravery. Right. Actually, that's what the word really means in the Tibetan, it's pao wo means being brave. And the most powerful thing to be afraid of in this tradition is being afraid of yourself. So you keep avoiding any kind of genuine moment of reckoning with who you are. Right. And you find a lot of distractions to do that. Now, on that note, I can remember in cutting through spiritual materialism in the very beginning, he talks about the importance of going through your past and confronting it or writing it down. Do you remember that? I remember him describing this process of analyzing your past and then... And it reminds me of what you were just saying right now, which is that you don't hang out there, but you come to terms with who you are. And he said there's a kind of sweet sorrow in that, which that always stuck with me. But sometimes, for me, I could... I'll tell you, I had a float tank at my house once and I was spending time floating, a lot of time floating. And I don't know if you guys float or not, if you've ever been in a floatation tank. But meditators, too, you know this from meditating. Sometimes when you're meditating, a memory will just dislodge from in there and this crystal clear memory will float to the surface and you'll see something maybe unremarkable. But in this case, I was floating and I had the most vivid memory of... When I was a kid... I hate talking about this even now. It still troubles me. When I was a kid in Daytona Beach, Florida, and the float tank just kind of brought this out on a silver platter, like, look at you, look at this is who you are. So this weird leaving, we'd stayed the whole summer, there was some girl there, some girl my age, and I think I was like 12 or 13 or something. I don't know. My brother and I are driving off and she comes running up to the car. I hadn't really noticed her the whole summer. And she says, like, I love you to me. Very sweet, right? I don't even want to say it, especially in front of an audience, but only because this is... You froze, right? No, I said, you're fat. Yes, the worst. The worst, the worst, the worst. Yes, horrible. Okay, it's not the worst. It's not like I shot her. It's not like I grabbed a knife and like jumped on her like... But it's not the best. It's just a shitty thing I did when I was a kid because I thought it impressed my brother or something. And there it was. The float tank presented it to me with just... Like I was there again. And then I got out of the float tank and just... I still feel it now. Just like, oh, fuck. There's a part of you that's awful. There's a part of you that's just like not that great. That if you don't control it, at least when you were a kid and certainly as an adult, sometimes it'll spring out and say the very worst thing. So I do understand the idea of being afraid of yourself and the potential to cause harm to other people in a state of being lost in your mind or not in the present moment. You know, we all have... Does anybody not relate to that story? We all have some, you know, moments where... What's striking to me about that story is how mild what you did was. In terms of the... and how strong the reaction is currently. Well, I'll tell you. The look on her face. It was like... She was a little girl. I was like... I became the part of the universe that's like, this place sucks. You go to something and tell it you love it and it's gonna tell you to fuck off. I became that part of the universe and I saw what that looks like in the face of someone else and sure, for you know what? As an adult, yeah, whatever. People call me fat all the time. It's like, yeah, I am, so I have to deal with it a little bit. Whatever the point is, we'll talk about that later. The point is... I... You know, whatever that did, maybe she just forgot about it instantly or maybe that was just one little pebble on the scale that made her universe or her subjective experience of life not so great in this incarnation and I'd rather not be dropping pebbles like that onto people's scales, which... But you don't, do you? Yeah, I do. Sure I do. Yesterday you did that? Well, yeah, maybe so. You know, maybe like... Yeah, maybe you don't realize you're doing it or something but I could tell you that when I think about, I don't know, interactions I had with my mom, there's huge moments of regret there. Well, there's a kind of powerful point from my point of view of what you're saying which is that even if you practice some kind of presencing, you know, however you do that, being present with the current situation, there's still the issue of karma, what you've done and what has happened in the past and, you know, I do talk about that in the book and understanding that process is really interesting because it kind of... You're right, the first stage is becoming aware of it. So that's... And in order to do that, you have to kind of be a little gentle with yourself because a lot of people when they're trying to meditate, they're so hard on themselves right away that they never even... even minutes even. And that's because their own mind is somewhat tormented in a way, if you're honest about it. And that's why people will create alternate types of practice where you're just trying to create some kind of tranquility and calm, layered over that underlying kind of anxiety. So if you're going to cut through that level of trying to just use meditation as a way to get high or tranquil or peaceful, as a way to really learn about yourself and really discover yourself, what's always recommended is a kind of gentle attitude towards yourself. So it's interesting, whatever you did today... I mean, I'm just here kind of talking with you, but whatever you did to that girl seems like you're 10 times harder on yourself to me. Well, that's a fair statement. Yeah, I think so. So the question is, could you look at that and kind of just be kind to yourself to start with about the whole thing? I don't know who she is at all right now. Yeah. But you're right there. Okay, well, let's talk about the kindness to self thing, because I'd love to talk about that, because you hear that a lot. And I've said it, and sometimes I believe it, but sometimes it's like, well, okay, think of gratitude. You know, people will say, gratitude's the attitude. Just like, shut up, don't fucking tell me to be grateful. Like, it doesn't work like that. It's like, you know, that's not how gratitude works. Like, gratitude is a... Well, wait a minute, if I could. Yeah. Let's stay precisely with what we were talking about, which is being gentle and kind to yourself. Okay, sorry, I was using the gratitude thing only because it reminds me of the same principle, which is gratitude is a spontaneous thing that appears. Kindness to the self. I can like, for example, I can reflect on myself right now. And I could look at myself and be like, well, it's okay, man. As a long time... No, no, no, you're so sarcastic. All I'm talking about is gentleness and kindness. Good idea or not? Good idea. Okay. And you can do it. It's not a huge leap, but there is a sort of shift of attitude that is engendered there. Let's talk about the shift. Yeah. Because when you're in a sort of... when your energetic state is not like at its place of like, where you're kind. Where it's just an intellectual conceit, which is like, yes, sure, being kind to myself would be great right now. It'd be amazing. It'd also be amazing if I, like, grow hair back into my bald spot. That'd be incredible, too. Yeah. But it's not gonna happen. So... The... You're right, it's not gonna happen. It's not going that way. It's not. Definitely is it. That street is a one-way street. Yes, it is. And it's a hairless one-way street. But this self-kindness thing, when you're in a state of consciousness where you don't really feel like being kind to yourself or you don't feel the feeling of kindness, then it becomes more of sort of an intellectual exercise. Kind of like affirmations, which I think are great. You know, where you just like look in the mirror and you're like, I love you. Like, even though you don't really feel it and you feel automatically like, guess it's a back-in-the-midlife crisis talking to myself in the mirror. I love you. But it doesn't feel real. Okay, well, then that's an important point. So it doesn't feel real because you're pushing too hard. In that case, there's too much effort. And really, when we're kind and gentle to ourselves or somebody else, we're actually softening and using less effort. There you did it. Oh, yeah, that's really cool. Okay, I get it. That's very subtle. That's pretty cool. Right, because I'm like, you're okay, man! No, you're okay! You're fine! No, you're fine. You're fucking fine. You're great, whatever. Yeah, I get it. So it's more of a relaxed kind of, okay, I get it. You're right, it has to be genuine because otherwise it becomes New Age. Right. This is old age stuff, I mean, or antiquity stuff. So do you know what you get when you play New Age music backwards? What? New Age music. No offense to anybody in particular. Well, we might as well go there. What do you get when you play country music backwards? That's how I figure you already know. You must know that one, right? Nobody knows that one? Do you know? No. You get sober, you get your house back, you get your wife back. Awesome. You know I hang around with comedians, right? Yes, I do. No. I'm doing that right now. Yeah. I don't like, you're the funny one right now, man. I'm like talking about the bullying little girls and hating myself. I don't know why you got me in this fucking fix. Would you like to switch microphones? Yeah. Thanks. Okay, yeah, it's better. It's a fucking bad mic, man. Guys, your mic here makes you feel really insecure. You should get a new mic. So that thing that you just did, which produced kind of like a millisecond of some effect, is that considered part of this process that Chogim Champa taught, or is this something that you developed yourself? Yeah, when it comes to this tradition, I didn't develop anything myself. It's like classical music. You interpret and you express your way, but this is a 2,500 years of transmission through a very human process. So it takes that into account. People are going to be living in different times and different places. Right now we have a kind of interesting situation, which is that certain approaches or views that were developed in Asia are now becoming quite popular in the West. And guess what? The other way around, too. So, for example, I find myself in a super ironic position of teaching Buddhism in Japan. I've been there five times this year. And I go over there and I look at the people. At first I apologize to say, you have Buddhists here that are older than our whole country. They have 512-year-old bonsai trees there, you know, and they have a kind of deeply traditional kind of mindfulness and gracefulness in the culture that's quite stunning actually, quite lovely. But I would have to say that our people doing the kind of regular meditation practice, you know, people like us over there who are like living regular lives, no, most people know, very few. So it's ironic, but that's what's happening now. So I think, you know, we have to look, and that's part of the Shambhala teachings, which is what we can find that people have already experienced before that could be useful to us today, that would be helpful in the modern world. And you look back and you, you know, I think the notion of mindfulness is so popular now. It was on, you know, the front cover of Time Magazine, for example, because the idea of mindfulness or being sort of more connected, the mind and the body, and you're doing what you're doing when you're doing it, like racing ahead or is it a generic, hugely beneficial thing to cultivate. And oddly, we do need to cultivate it. We didn't really learn it actually growing up, most of us, you know, how to just stabilize a little bit and be steady with what we're doing. So that becomes a universal type of medicine. And then there's a lot, a lot more to this tradition, because it goes beyond the personal level of cultivation into how can we work together, how can we be together as people in a sane way. We're seeing what it's like to be together in an insane way right now. It's almost like, you know, a perfect setting for seeing how it's not supposed to be. Do any of you feel that? I look and I go, this is not how this is supposed to be going. If somebody's talking, the other person should be listening, you know? So nobody's modeling that kind of behavior actually right now. But I think if we're looking for anything other than a speedy, apocalyptic end to our misery, we could look to some of these things and continue to cultivate even in difficult times. That's the approach of warriorship. Even if you're the only person doing it and everybody else is going around crazy, you still cultivate the virtues that you think are worth cultivating. If you find yourself lost, if you find yourself as you've been explaining in backstage, you're explaining it. So the concept being here we are in this moment right now, I can feel my body, I'm relating to my five senses in my, you were saying that the primary way of doing that is through respiration. That's the advice in meditation at least, is go back to the inflow and outflow of your breath. That's one approach, but it's common. Haven't most of you meditated that way when you meditate, just feeling the breath going in and out, and just sort of letting your attention rest there and settling into that. And then, you know, the thoughts they come and go, and if you find yourself too caught up in them, you can kind of notice that and then come back to the breath. So you're kind of landing the plane, you know? Landing the plane is a great way to put it, but how, with this particular form of teaching, this idea of like being in a variety of daydreams, how do you know, even if you are breathing in and breathing out, and even if you are feeling your body, that this isn't just another trick that you're playing on yourself to give you the impression that, oh yes, no, this is it, now we're in the moment, but actually it's just another layer of delusion. See, both you and Pete have this kind of mind and I actually love it. Good question. Thanks. Just keep meditating. Really? That was pretty fast. I mean, okay, let's say you have a legitimate question. Is this real or not? Are we actually here? Right. Whether I'm doing this exercise or not, now I'm sort of convincing myself that I found the kind of ground of a hum here of just being and breathing, and now I feel kind of better. But then the room, like I was in Japan and there was an earthquake, I was on the 43rd floor of the building, it started to shake. Now, where's your breath now? Where's your equanimity now? Yeah. So the question is, how deep is your equanimity or is it completely invented, another level of fabrication, another level of fiction? I love that you have that kind of mind. Well, what is the answer to that? Why are you asking me? You wrote the book, you write books on this stuff, man. But you have a podcast. Everyone has a podcast. Everybody writes books. Yeah. In other words, if you need to answer that question, then you need to look at who's asking that question. Okay. Right, so who wants to know? The most handsome man on earth. See, I love myself now, isn't it? I know, but it's too much. It's in the middle way. Right. Who wants to know? Yeah, well, I guess the person who wants to know, I mean, would be the answer would, God, it's such a mind fuck, man. Well, it's definitely me. I'm asking the question. Well, the idea would be to permanently wake up, right? To not trick yourself anymore into thinking that you have achieved something that you haven't, but to actually, like, obtain some kind of state of lucidity that... I think people make too big a deal of that, personally. You know, and really, if you study any of these teachings, and the more sort of progressed versions of them, you are already awake. That has already happened. This is it right now. You're already able to be with your experience right now. So to think, project, there's some kind of, like, you know, heavy lifting going on, and then you get the 500-pound weight up. Right. Oh, I'm awake. You're enlightened. And then, you know, people are going to cheer and give you money and follow you around and so forth. But the idea of smaller weights, you know, and just keep coming back, just keep coming back, to me is a much more productive type of practice. You just, you have so many opportunities to just keep coming back and keep coming... Look, in our conversation, we keep coming back. Yeah. Yeah, it's amazing. You know, we're not looking for a big epiphany, right? We're trying to communicate. Yes, that's right. I know, I mean, I would like a big epiphany. Yeah? Well, out behind the barn there... That stopped your mind, didn't it? Yeah, it did. It definitely brought me back here. Was Chokim Trumple like this? Was he a reverent like this? Did he teach you like this? Well, that's an interesting question, because really he died almost, yeah, 30 years ago. So some part of this is my holodeck, you know, and remember when I started taking that holodeck, I do go on the holodeck and I talk to him today in that way, you know, but in other words, in a projected mind. But as far as remembering the tangible feeling of being sitting with him in a room, there are certain impressions that come, and maybe different ones at different times, but he was very kind, very kind of soft, and then the other side was very powerful. So I think of it as a kind of yin and yang kind of energy. And, you know, he was responsible, really, if you really study the history of Tibetan Buddhism coming to the West. He was probably the most influential person to make that happen in terms of laying a foundation, you know, he created Naropa University in Boulder, Colorado, and centers all over the place, and he brought a lot of the Heilamas from India and Nepal and so forth to America. So he was kind of a first guy, and he was smart about Americans, so you look, there's different degrees of recognizing how we work, and he got it kind of very fast, that was my impression. So I felt like, you know, he was able to talk to us in our own terms, you know, and that included being a little looser, maybe, definitely some good joking around and having fun. It was the 70s, and every, you know, some of you have probably read about it, but they say if you remember it, you weren't there, remember that? But Trumpo, Trumpo was definitely parting, like he was taking acid, he was getting drunk, he's, like, that's one of the fascinating things about his teacher, is that this is not by any means a traditional teacher, at least from the Netflix documentary. No, no, no, no. He's always got a, he's always got like a drink, he's, he seemed, I don't want to use the word dangerous because it's not the right word, he didn't seem tame, he seemed incredibly unpredictable in a really good way, but did you ever feel that's accurate? Oh yeah, that sounds unpredictable in a really good way. But also taking LSD, like getting... Everybody was taking LSD. I don't know if it's still around, do you all still have it? Yeah, it's definitely still around. I mean, you know, in that sense, like the, you know, the vibe of the time was like if you weren't doing that, you would have been kind of not really, I don't know what the equivalent would be now, if you're not doing what, you're not really kind of with the thing, but... Well, I mean, we're talking about a llama, this is a... Well, you see that, he's, well, okay, there's a good point of departure. That's how he was raised and trained, so, you know, he was... Like they went to a village to find him. They went to a village to find him, he was two years old, he recognized all the trinkets and things from his previous life, they take him back to the monastery, they have his mom move outside of the monastery, and then they're training him from two. So he finished by the time he was 11, most of the practices that people here have finished, like, you know, in the last 40 years. Wow. He's 11. Wow. So it's like Juilliard, I try to give people that kind of analogy, it's like a prodigal, somebody who has tremendous capacity and they really get seriously trained. But then, you know, if we go into his life for a minute, his life was, and the whole culture was interrupted, you know, like they had something that was probably pretty similar to what it would have been 500 years ago, no cars, no planes, no roads, you know, and then they got invaded in 1959, I'm sure most of you know this story by China, and it was no longer a safe place for somebody like him to be. So, like your hat. Is it two hats? It's two hats, right? Good. So, what did she say? She said it's chomping on all the things you're saying right now. Oh, okay. I said good, that's good. I'd rather that than, like, not eating them. So, you know, he was an immigrant, a forceful immigrant. Imagine if we hadn't let him in. I wouldn't be here having this conversation. So, but he had to shift, you know, when you have a comfortable setup, it's sort of like what you were talking about earlier, you have a comfortable setup, you can get too comfortable, and things, you know, things just go on the way that you're used to them. So, he got interrupted by external forces. So, before he even came to the United States, he stopped being a monk. He was raised as a monk, and he's stopping a monk. He didn't think that was the right way to manifest the teachings in the West. People were too fascinated with that kind of stuff, and, oh, you know, like, we would just sort of imitate or mimic, and he wanted to really communicate, so he sort of came into our world. And he, I mean, he was very stylish. He, like, wore these amazing suits. He, this is a fascinating human being, and also last night I was talking to someone about him, and they said, and maybe you can tell me if this is true or not, they said he, like, he, he had cities. Like, he could teleport, that he could, okay, not true, damn. Oh, no, no, I mean, see, this is still, his major contribution was deflating all that. Right. It's called Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism. It's a great book. If you don't ever read another book, I recommend that book. People are enchanted, or, you know, to fantasize about those kind of things. It doesn't say whether they exist or not. There are certain practices that are kind of more advanced that can create, you know, sort of relative cities, you know. Then what? Well, like, there's a Tibetan heat practice in New Yoga. Right. Where you generate heat, and they would go out into the woods and get naked in cold Tibetan winter, and they'd put wet sheets on them, and how many sheets you could dry off was how well you were doing with the practice. Right. I've seen, I think I've seen... Do you want to learn that, or do you want to learn how to be kind to the fat girl? Hmm. I mean, it's pretty cold here in the winter, man. I want to learn both. But I think it's an important... I mean, I know that that's not the only city that is considered possible in the Tibetan tradition. Like, they're pretty far out. Some of them don't. They believe that if you are advanced enough when you die, you can, like, transform into a rainbow. Isn't that an intact... You've heard of that, surely. No, no, I think there's a couple of things mushed up in there. There could be signs, like if you read any biography of a Tibetan Lama, maybe there's a rainbow at their death or something like that. Right. So, oh, you're talking about a rainbow body. Yes. Look, here's the thing. But that's true. I don't believe that. You're a rainbow body already, Duncan, from that point of view. What? Right now. No, I mean... Because your main body is energy. Oh, right. Right now. That's what it means. Right. You know... Everything's light. It is light. You know, or energy. Right. Otherwise, if you look at a corpse, you know, it's kind of inanimate, isn't it? Yes. But if you look at a living being, there's all kinds of energy and movement in them and emotional energy. So, I think the thing he felt, and this is kind of good that you're bringing this out, is that this kind of conversation would be the conversation that people in the West would have, because they want to remain fascinated and they don't really want to address the fat girl. Right. You know, they don't really want to look at their own heart, their own mind. Right. And that requires some stability, some boredom, some slowing down. So, you know, he was slowing down a very fast-moving train coming here. Right. So, the practice that he started with was very solid. You know, he made us all sit a lot. Like, do a lot of sitting meditation. But... How long would you have to sit with him? Well, like, there was a seminary for people who really wanted to go deeper with him that he started in 73. That was three months long. And, you know, the majority of that time was some kind of practice all day every day. Ten, twelve hours. Teachings going on. So, you know, when you look for cultivation, you know, anybody who's looking to cultivate something, you know it takes time. You have to build up the muscles for it, the attitude of it. Nobody's going to go become, you know, a black belt in Aikido in the weekend. They don't have Aikido black belt weekends. No. So, it's even more ridiculous to think of an enlightenment weekend. It's ridiculous. Right. It's criminal, actually. You're selling candy to babies. Right. Babies like candy. They do. There's actually a big market for it. Actually, the market is to sell it to the parents. Right. So, to get back to the real world, what is the... What are the beginning phases of this practice? How does... How would I start... I mean, we've had these great conversations and I do keep thinking, like, God, that's... I want to start doing this for real. I'd like to start actually practicing it. So, how do you... How does someone become a real student of this? Well, you know, all of us are looking for some way to live, you know, some kind of path. For different people, it's different things. Buddhism appeals to certain type of people. Chanting, you know, you... We met at the... In my day job, I'm a musician, so I play with this guy, Krishna Das, who does kirtan, chanting and so forth. And I produce his records and play guitar with him. And that world is, you know, has a certain kind of practice that people enjoy. And there's a community aspect to it, I think, that people like. So, you have to do a little research, you know, look around a little bit to see what... Some people like Zen. Zen is very popular here. Some people like the Insight Meditation group. Some people like Christian prayer or whatever. But the general recommendation is to look around for a while and then see if you can settle into something, so that you don't become a dilettante and kind of like supermarket spiritual person. But what about Shambhala? Like, how do you get into that? If you want to go... If you like Shambhala, I mean, there's a lot of books that are great about it. Shambhala and the Sacred Path of the Warriors, great place to start. But there's a Shambhala Center here in New York. But how do you... You go there. You physically... I'm not going to do that. For example, they have online courses. So between those nine visits to what was it, what website was it? Oh, Drudge and Huffington. Take three of those and do an online course. Right. With Shambhala. But it's a very nice place. And my son, Ethan Nickturn, happens to be the head teacher there. And he's, you know, people... He also has something called the Interdependence Project here in New York, which a lot of people are aware of. So the idea is you go someplace where people kind of are practicing. You can practice together. You learn a little bit more about how to practice. You work with a teacher. I guess what I'm fishing for here is like, what's something that we can do? Like, what's something I could start doing tomorrow that doesn't involve going to some center? And I know what you guys do. You go and take the personality test. And then you get sucked in deeper. The next thing you know... I wish it was that organized. No. The simplest thing, and this is exactly what the Buddha did, is you just do a very simple meditation practice to start with this. Like mindfulness practice. Right. Definitely, I could, you know, give that instruction in five minutes, and everybody could do it for another three minutes, and then you'd have it for the rest of your life. Okay. It's so simple that I can almost guarantee you'll make it more complicated than it is. So how about this? How about we do that now, and then after that... We've been talking for about an hour now, so let's do this meditation. Then we'll take some questions for about 20 minutes. So, and by the way, if you guys, someone has to, if you have to use the bathroom, don't be shy, just go do it. Like this is a longer maybe than a normal show, so please don't feel weird if you got to go. You'll be a little shy. Well, yeah. I mean, go out there. Yeah. Okay. So, are you all game for this? Yeah. Okay. And for some of you, it'll be repeating something you're already familiar with or have done a different variation of. So there are really three simple steps to this mindfulness style of meditation. And the first one is just taking a good seat, like recognizing your body as the ground of the practice. So since we're in chairs, obviously, you know, you can sit on a cushion on the floor. You can sit in your chair, but now there's a feeling of coming into a sort of stronger posture and a little bit more presence. And so you can have your feet sort of flat on the floor if that's comfortable for you. And then a nice strong relationship to the cushion or the seat of the chair. And you can just rest your hands on your knees. That's a very fine little gesture that you can make. And then there's a nice long spine, as you'd say in yoga. They don't say a straight spine, but a nice long spine. So you feel uplifted really. You should feel good to take this seat. And your back is strong and your front is soft and open. So one of the things we say about it is upright but not uptight. So there's a kind of strength and ease together. Your mouth can be sort of lightly open or lips can be loosely closed. So there's a relaxed feeling in the jaw. And then the general attitude of the sense perceptions is that we're not going somewhere else. This is not an inner garden type of meditation, it's a presence meditation. So you can just lower your gaze, keep your eyes open though, with a soft downward gaze. So you're quite present in the sensory realm, but not chasing perceptions, just resting there. So that's all step one, that's taking your seat. Sometimes at the end of that it's okay to do what we call checking in to sort of see how you feel. Maybe you had a really busy day today. Maybe you're worried about something coming up, but just sort of touch in with yourself and see how you are. And then the second step is to, and key to it, is placing your attention on your breath. So you're actually becoming mindful of your breathing. In a very direct physical way, it's not a game, it's not an exercise. It's just become aware of your breath, put your attention on the breath. If you're confused about it, just rest it at the tip of the nose, or you can feel the full cycle of breath throughout the whole body. So the third step is that we might notice, from time to time, that our attention has wandered far away from the breath, and we're lost in some kind of thought, right? Thinking about your exam tomorrow, or your relationship, or dinner, having to move your house. All the sort of narrative that's going on, and you're lost there. You're not paying attention to the breath, you're not with the breath. So when you notice that, you just label it thinking. Just say the word thinking, and that identifies that whole thing, and then you come back to the breath. Bring your attention back to the breath. The attitude that we take towards the thoughts is they're not bad or good. And so we don't have to, you know, if we're thinking, for example, in this exercise, boy, I wish I hadn't called that girl fat, you would label the thinking, and not dwell on it further. Let it go. But you could feel the texture of it, and then let it go, and come back to the breath. So we're always coming back. So why don't we just try that for, can we do this? This is dead air on the air? How would that work? The people can just do it with us in cyberspace? Okay, good. All right, so just for a couple of minutes, let's try it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So when you finish your session, it's a good idea just to let the whole experience go. There's nothing really in it that we're trying to create or cling to. There's no special experience. Some abiding, it's called calm abiding, or sort of staying with what happens. And maybe we could have, should we have a little discussion based on that? And anything else people want to talk to? Yeah, perfect. So we're going to set it up right now. We've got a microphone right here, and anybody who wants to ask a question, please don't be shy. This is sometimes my favorite part of the live podcast. So anybody who feels like coming up here, we got a mic for you right here. So if you want to try that practice at home, I'd recommend 10 or 15 minutes to start with. Try it every day for a month. See how it colors your world. Sir. Sorry. That's for you, David. What's your name? Ed. Yeah. How do you help someone who's depressed? What do you say to that person? How do you help someone who's depressed? What do you say to that person who, you know, doesn't want to be mindful of someone who, you know, doesn't have that inner peace? Like how do you help that person? You know, once we do our own cultivation, of course it's natural then you want to reach out. So the second sort of level of practice with Buddhism is to become more compassionate, you know, by answering questions like that. So of course this is your friend you're talking about. And I think everybody in this room has had experiences with depression, either themselves or other people. So we all know what it feels like. That's a great starting point. It's not like he's an alien or something like that. We can sometimes help people and sometimes we can't. You recognize that, right? So losing the idea that, A, that you somehow have the power to pull him up and out of it will liberate you in the first place. And secondly, if you're not on strong ground yourself, like cultivating your own strength of mind, then the image that we use is like somebody's in quicksand. And they're drowning and you jump in to save them, now both of you are in there. So that's what Trungpa Rinpoche called idiot compassion. Isn't that a great phrase? It's compassion without skill, without sort of skillful means. So when we want to help people, it's a wonderful instinct, don't you think? I mean, everybody here went, yeah, I'd help your friend, you know. But we have to kind of have some skill or knowing what the skillful action is going to be. Now sometimes the skillful action can be just being gentle and kind to the person in spacious. Sometimes it's enriching, you know, making them feel better about themselves. Sometimes it's including them in situations so they can start to feel human again. And sometimes it's cutting through, you know. And if you're going to cut through, it has to be free of any kind of aggression. That's the thing, you have to feel very grounded. But like, I can totally relate to that. I have many friends who are suffering with various addictions and things like that. And the main thing is you have to have a good sense of humor if you're going to work with people. Because they don't. He has no sense of humor, right? He does have a sense of humor? There's a way out. That moment is a kind of way out. So bring her to one of... Would she come? So she could have been here tonight. For example, that would be a skillful means. You include her and then you put her in an environment which naturally the energy rises and she's able to kind of feel better about herself and other people. Okay, welcome. I would stand here. Duncan, welcome to New York City, my brother. Thank you, brother. Thank you so much. It's great to be here. And thank you. Thank you both for combining that humor with that spirituality. And welcome to this day in the world, right? In our civilization, in our society. And really this day that we can now create virtual spaces, right? Virtual reality. And I guess, I mean, I have so many questions. I think you mentioned that plants have religion. There were Buddhist plants that are 500 years old. And I want to dive deep into so many topics with you. But on a kind of quick level, now that we can make this virtual reality, right? These experiences that are completely crafted from our imagination, right? And a lot of, even some of, guided meditation has the visualization elements of it. Both of you personally, what would the experience be that you would create? You know, for the title of, like, what would you call it? And what would you, what would the experience be? Within virtual reality? Yeah, right. Which encompasses all reality, right? All possible reality if you can make... Well, I mean, encompassing this, right? This is virtual reality from that point of view, too. Right, yeah. Yeah, yeah. You want to say something about it? Your question is, if I could make a virtual reality experience... Right. ...that encompassed all reality. Whichever one, which one would you make, right? If you can make one right now, today? A VR? Yeah, VR. Of anything out there, right? Oh, anything. Anything in that world. Yeah, what would you... Well, I mean, I've talked about it on the podcast before, and I'll never change in my desire to make it. Which is... It's the VR crucifixion experience. Right? Which no one is... I've said it on the podcast a bunch of times. I've thrown it out there. No one will make it. I don't know why. There's, like... Sir, what if I will make it for you? Make it for me, but you also have to make the accessory that comes with it. I'm sorry, sorry. A crucifix. No, I mean... Like, it needs, like, a little, like, many crucifix. You could put your hands on, but... Here's the thing. And I do seriously mean it. The... Just epigenetically, I think that encoded in most of us by now is Jesus Christ, just because it's been around... It's been, like, our culture is based on Christianity. A lot of our culture is. And the symbol of Jesus is everywhere. This is why so many people, you know, connect with a lot of the teachings to this very day. It's a very powerful thing. This is why there's so many paintings of Jesus. How many paintings of Jesus are there? No one knows. A billion, billion, trillion paintings of Jesus. They net... So I guarantee right now there's 16,000 people, minimum, painting a picture of Jesus right now, somewhere around the planet, just painting Jesus. Like, that's how... Whatever that was, whatever that was, it was so powerful that here we are thousands of years later and people are still painting him. People are still praying, thinking, talking, just like Buddha. But the... So the idea is there's some extra power in that symbol. And you can be moved... You don't even have to be a Christian to be moved by a painting of Jesus. Like, I just saw a great painting of Jesus in the desert. And it was... I can't remember the name of the painter. It's a very famous painting. Maybe someone here, when I describe it, you'll know what I'm talking about, and there's probably 50 million paintings of Jesus in the desert. But this one in particular was really cool because the look on Jesus' face in this painting was a combination of the saddest, grimmest, most horrifying realization. Like, the most... Like, he... At that moment, I guess he realized what was going to happen, mixed in with the strangest smile. Like this warrior, comedic, almost comedic spot. It's the most beautiful combination. This simultaneous heaviness and the horror of being a Messiah who's going to get murdered, mixed in with almost a gleeful joy and knowing that that isn't going to stop you. And those two things intersecting, it's just a powerful painting. So, I think how much more powerful would it be to actually translate that experience into VR so that you can look out from the cross at the disciple, at people weeping, at your hands, and like, even if you're not... Even if you're like the staunchest of atheists, anyone in your family was Christian, theoretically, bad science. There could be some epigenetic marker inside of you that still makes you connect to that archetypical experience. So, just from that POV would be incredible. And then on top of it, you know, the add-on being that you could like maybe put in a coat and the cross launches into the air, drop bombs, fly across Jerusalem or whatever, but that's a... So, that would be what I would build. That's incredibly fitting, brother. I mean, you... It is the perfect archetype for you, right? Not only are you the very modern day, you know, Christ, right? You have the comedy of, you know, self... What? You know, when you... Crucifixion? Absolutely, right? Self-crucifixion. But also, you know, very relatable, right? Well, we're all... The thing about Christ is... And I will go on for another two hours about Jesus, my friends. Well, the thing about that symbol is we're all Christ. That's the idea. Every single one of us is Christ. And that's why the symbol of the crucifix... Have you ever heard this before? The crucifix represents two timelines. It represents the past, present, and future intersecting with infinity. And that is every single human being's experience. Every... All of us have been nailed to this moment. We are existing in the time-space continuum. And yet there is this sense that there is something in us that isn't really going to die. The soul is what they call Christianity in some religions. I don't know in your lineage if there's a soul. But that crucifixion, that's why we're all, you know, experiencing this very difficult situation, you know, to be pinned on a timeline. But... So, yeah. V.R. Christ, build it for me, please. That's rock'n'roll. So we actually need... Would you say the cross would get heavier over the experience? Or how... Do you actually use that? Haptics. Haptic cross. You could, like, depending on what level you want to run it at, it could vibrate. Heat up, maybe. I don't know. I have a small demo for you on this right here. The Epsomu Vario. Smallest, latest... You want to show me a demo now? I'm going to show you, yes. Well, after the... Let's look at it afterwards. We could all demo. I have an old, you know, prototype that I built with a little hackathon. Inspired by you, sir. Can't wait to see it, man. Please. Thank you. Stick around for one more minute. Please. While we're on this topic, which is interesting to me, virtual reality. Seriously. I have a project. I wrote a book called Awakening from the Daydream. That's how Duncan and I got together. We have it here in case you want to read it. And originally, the idea was for it to be a virtual reality. It's based on the wheel of life, which is to go very briefly into it. Six realms, six psychological landscapes that we go through, ranging from the hell realms to the hungry ghosts, to the, you know, things are going great in the God realms. Donald Trump is presiding over the jealous God realm at the moment. Competition, envy. You know, you have all the human emotions that can become kind of a strong imprint of how you're living and how you're feeling your reality to be, which gets superimposed on what's actually happening, you know? So you might be in a beautiful setting, but you feel horrible, you know? So we're really looking at the mindscape in this book. And I thought at first, this should be a virtual reality game. You get to play it. And the logo is going to be how to win the game you're already playing. Because you are already in this virtual reality, this diorama of believing whatever you believe to be the tone and mood of your existence from moment to moment. So in the virtual reality version, you could be like, for example, you could be in Syria, in Aleppo, and you'd get to experience that hell realm of that very viscerally and see how would you respond to it, how would you react to it. You would create these different landscapes and you'd be able to occupy them and learn from them, which is the main purpose of what's in the book. So I wanted to do the book first, so people get more familiar with this ancient kind of prototype and then play with it a little bit in virtual reality. So is that what you do? You design virtual reality? Absolutely. Well, actually, I run a community here in New York. I've developed for a lot of these platforms the HTC Vive, which is quite luxurious. Actually, this last week, we had a most epic week in VR history at Nikola Tesla's original laboratory. Absolutely. There's some people that have come. Yeah, we have some great speakers and literally teaching you the ideas we now live in this time where our imagination is completely easily transferable from online to onto others. The communication of not having a sacrifice from the beginning of tribal societies where you had to, you couldn't tell somebody a three-dimensional scene. You had to paint it on flat surfaces, right? And all through the Renaissance and only today, only now, only this year. What's your name again? My name's Lex. Lex, so there's also some virtue I think you'll agree in not doing that. Absolutely. Well, I was going to ask you about your specific game, right? No, what I mean is not creating anything, just being with what already is there. So that's the counterpoint. Do you understand what I'm saying? Absolutely. So stop your dream, asshole. Get the fuck out of here. We don't want your VR. Right, there should be those. There should be one that is, you know, traditional, right? You should say no, but then also you should say yes. No, is there not both? No, that's what I'm saying is both. Well, you could be in the moment in VR. In the game, though, right? In your game with the circle of life, was it to win the game to get into the circle or to leave? How was the victory achieved? To win the game, you have to first enter the human realm of being a good human being. You can't get out without that. You can't skip that step. Wait, your game is to be good in the human realm? Starting. I'm not going to sell anything, man. No one wants to fucking do that kind of run over thing. Not goody-goody. Okay. Like have a compassion, have wisdom, you know, use this very life to develop those things. But then the idea is that you don't get trapped anywhere in that game. The Buddha is not trapped in those six realms. The Buddha is outside of the six realms in a kind of awakened, non-conceptual state. It's perfect. Okay. Thank you. Sign on. Thank you for the question. Talk to you after the show. I asked this of a lot of teachers, so I'm very blessed to be able to ask you, someone who's from a more active tradition. What's your name, please? My name is Evan. Evan? Evan. Evan. Any advice beyond what you've already said this evening that you could provide for us on how to figure out where to suss out burning off karma and political activism? Yeah. You know, how do I not be a cis white male pillow sitter? And how do I, but how do I not, you know, be adding to destruction of other people's enjoyment or positive life? I don't know. However you would like to interpret that, I'm curious what you'd have to provide. Of course this is a huge, and we've talked about it, this is a burning issue of the day in a way is how to balance contemplative and active, right? So it's not the right time for people to just go away and be deep contemplatives in my humble opinion. That's why I follow these particular teachings which say that you have to engage the world on its own terms. So is there some formula for that? There are a few kind of principles that I believe in. Like for example, I don't think adding aggression to the mix is what is needed. That's my personal belief. Now that doesn't mean you can't have what we call wrathful compassion, which means you interrupt certain things that are really dangerous and harmful to people. But if it's coming from your own aggression, that's not going to help probably. So if we don't know ourselves at some level, we might just pour gasoline on the fire. I'd say do some practice. Continue with your practice and find where that action needs to lay within that. Well continue your practice and while you're cultivating that, move out into the world and see where you can be of help. And that's going to be different in different times. But I think the things that's not helping everybody right now is just strumming up anxiety and aggression. I don't see the fruit on that tree. Thank you. Welcome to New York, man. Thank you, sir. Hi. Hi. You had another talk with... What's your name? Cornelius. You had another talk with Duncan where you talked about the wheel of life. And at the center, you've got desire, aversion and aggression. I think you use different terms than the ones you were familiar with. Aversion and aggression are the same. Ignorance is the third one. Ignoring being dull. Or sloth. It's a pig, a rooster, a cock. Well, because that's the horny one. That's the desire. That's the horny one. That's the desire. And a snake. Yes. Snake's the aggression. Right. And the pig is kind of like we'll just eat whatever's in front of it. Ignorance. Kind of dullness. Just to clarify, for those of you guys who don't know what we're talking about, the idea is there's this mandala at the center of it. The cog that the whole thing spins on has these three fundamental delusions at the center. Which is ignorance, aversion, slash aggression and desire. There you go. Three modalities are what's constantly sort of rolling through your operating system subjectively. And that's what's causing you to experience suffering. Suffering. That's it. Yeah. Right? Well, because you're always off balance in those. There's a lack of, right? You're tipped by those three things. Yes. Yeah. It's not that they're bad. That's not the point. The point is the way that we relate to them puts us all out of balance. Okay. Okay. Okay. What I took away from that was you gave the example of going into a yoga studio and experiencing each one of them saying, well, that's a pretty girl. That's where your rooster comes out and says, I'm going to go put my mat down over there. Yeah. Yeah. Put out a little control over the universe. Downward dog. I'm going to get my way. I'm going to get my comfort out of it, right? Yeah. Downward dog. You just started blowing your nose and your aversion slash aggression came out. And you're like, get me away from this person. Again, wanting to get my way, get in my comfort zone, right? And just all of this expectation and failure to get that comfort zone caused suffering. Yeah. And this person wanted to go to do yoga. The most relaxing thing that came out with all this heap of suffering because of their, they found them a dollar. Right. Literally spinning in the Mando. Yeah. If you, who are so acutely aware that these are the sources of potential suffering for you and your existence. Well, you seem acutely aware of it. I've been listening to him. And you were on the show. How do you let yourself have dreams and desires to do things to go compose music? If you know that any attempt to manifest your own destiny is bound to cause suffering. Well, okay. That's a great question, Cornelius. And I think it shows a layer that needs to be clarified of these teachings in general, which is that in the West, Buddhism is taken to be nihilistic. Like, oh, don't do those things because they create suffering. Like, you know, your, your sort of uptight grandmother was a Buddhist, you know, and she said, don't play in the dirt. You'll get dirty and don't chase those girls. They'll get you in trouble. So the point is not that those energies themselves are problematic, but how we relate to them is so if you, there's a, like, let's say there's a pretty girl in the yoga studio. I like that one. Do you like that one? Love that one. Yeah. Okay. Poor girl. Poor girl. She just came to do yoga. Someone's like, God damn it. I have my wheels spinning here. Let's say she's on one side of you and the fat girl from the previous. Baby, why can't she be the fat girl? Maybe the fat girl, like, was in shape and now she does yoga. Yeah. All of these are metaphors. Please don't take any of these personally. What's happening to your mind is the point. Like, when you're in a state of craving, you stop seeing that person the way that they are. You just put your projection onto them, right? Have you found that when you're sort of chasing? Your idealization of them. Yeah. You're delusional. So that creates the suffering, not the attraction, not falling in love, not being a man, not being a woman, not being a human being. It's the sort of fixation and your mind stops being dynamic and fluid and you go into your fantasy world. That's what we call waking up. And then the general energy of those things is actually quite healthy. Is a part of fantasy not what inspires your creativity to compose music, though? No. I mean, speaking personally as a composer, I would say almost nothing's happening when I'm doing it. It just, even sometimes a full song and it comes out in a dream. I feel like, you know, this is a creativity discussion and it's a fun one for a group like this, but being creative, I think you're kind of, the best bet is to clear out and just let it come through. You'll write some great music. The more I listen to smart people, the more it sounds like you're just a channel and maybe we have an over-identification with being the source of the creative process. Because it's highly romanticized to be you are the genius. You are the idea maker. Is your duty, your purpose on this earth to sing that song? Yeah, and then that will create a kind of relationship to the art form that's sort of toxic for you. Bound to suffer. Yeah, but music's everywhere, you know. You like music? Yeah, I love music. Yeah, so that's it. That's the part of attachment that's healthy. That's already out there. It's already in here, out there. Sure, sure. You're just connecting and communicating. So that's the alternative to the fixation element of the relationship. And changing how you identify with it. It perfectly said. Sort of owning it. Yeah, good one, Cornelis. Thanks. Okay. Thanks. Cool. We are the channel, right, Cornelis? David, thank you. Duncan, you rock. Thanks. Really appreciate it. So I'm like completely fascinated with two things that I think you're fascinated with too. And this is actually a perfect question for you as well. So I think in some ways humanity is kind of on this journey of bifurcation, if you will, right? So we have this, and we've talked about it a little bit, you know, VR and this interconnectedness and AI. And it's kind of the interconnectedness of ones and zeros versus the interconnectedness of the zero, which is the mind. We kind of have two different things happening because as, you know, the future of interconnectedness through technology is taking off exponentially, we're having a neo-renaissance of the future of the mind. You know, psychedelics are starting to be re-explored. We're literally in a room where we're doing, you know, an own session together. I mean, this is really fascinating. And these two worlds are happening at the same time. And for me, I'm like, wow. And for other people, it's like, whoa, okay, what's going on here? So my question, I guess, to both of you would be, you know, I guess, do you think that humanity will eventually have to choose a path where we're going to be interconnected? You know, and I know, you know, you know, on Joe Rogan podcast, one thing he talks about is, you know, a line is going to be very difficult. We're going to be able to speak through ones and zeros interconnectedly where everything is going to be, you'll know exactly what I'm saying before it even comes out. Yeah. Versus a sort of organic feeling where we're actually getting and connecting through the jewel of Indra sort of way where we're going to be reconnecting ourselves through this organic way by disconnecting, if you will, which is what you've been talking about. So I just kind of wanted to splash that idea around and see what you guys thought of it. And then maybe is humanity ever going to have to choose what path to take? Well, I think, you know, I think if you unpackage your question, it's interesting. See what? I'm already picking it up. If you unpackage the question, then you find within your own question that you've created this hierarchy kind of like it sounds like there's the synthetic world of digitalized interconnectivity. And then there's the jeweled net of Indra world of some kind of like nature thing where I guess we commune by arming together, getting into the rhythm of nature together. And you've made these two things completely separate. That's one thing. The other thing you're saying is, will humanity have to choose? You know, which is like, let's hope humanity as a whole never has to choose anything because we can't figure anything out at all. One of the big problems of us as a species is that we are, it's really hard for us to collectivize in any real way. And anytime we do collectivize, quite often it's like in the worst way possible, like the Nazis or some or like Marxism, like the gulags, like when you look at like the kind of compulsory collectivization of the species, it usually doesn't manifest in any kind of positive way. So, or the collection could be what we just did here as well. Temporal, temporary, you know, and that's the other side is like, yeah, like the temporary autonomous zone, you can create these little moments like these flowers grow out of a community temporarily, and then they have to dissipate because there's not enough energy to keep it going. This is Burning Man, this is any of like the really great music festivals, this temporary amazing thing that represents what humans can do. But to answer your question, I would refer to Tail Hard De Chardon, who says, well, first of all, it's not a choice. It's we're being drawn into a kind of harmonization that will incorporate both sides of the, what the spectrum that you just created, it will encapsulate the entire thing. So, we're being pulled in to this. We're not choosing to go in that direction as much as we are being drawn closer and closer to this thing, which has as its manifestation increasing levels of complexity and simultaneous harmony. So, that's what's happening. And to finish, I think really what we're seeing is a UFO is landing, like it's a UFO. Like we're witnessing an alien intelligence is coming to the planet, but the way it's coming to the planet doesn't look the way we thought an alien was going to come to the planet. Like we thought the alien would come in a UFO. They said the aliens are actually robots, that's what some scientists have been saying is that aliens aren't an organic thing, but they're actually super intelligent interconnected robots. Yeah, right. That's the idea. That's the concept. The concept is like what's happening is a super intelligence is coming into this planet using human inspiration as like precursor material to create technologies that will allow it to become more fully manifest. But is the super intelligence inside us in the organic realm, and I guess I would point this to you and I guess I'll take my answer up there so these guys can ask questions too. Say that question again. So going back to what I was talking about. You're just very concise. Yes. What's the essence of the question? Is the next level of human interconnectedness the interconnectedness of technology through the ones and zeros or is our new level of interconnectedness the organic meditative interconnectedness that may be the ancient India and ancient Egypt we're trying to connect to? So is it organic or inorganic in essence? I think a lot of people are talking about these exactly singularity or whatever you want to look at in terms of these things. So I myself like to speculate about these things and sometimes I've actually sort of had the idea that I was from the future, which is that's why that movie Arrival was kind of interesting. And so if you were from the future, what reality would you be creating to that you would receive when you re-arrived? But it's equally interesting to me. So I'm not disquieted by your question or like, but it's equally interesting to me to just find all the roots and strands and leaves and branches of what you just talked about in this room right now. And so we probably know the answer to your question on some level, but I also want to know how you are. How are you? I'm surfing, man. Surfing? I'm surfing. Okay. We'll have a good ride, okay? Thanks. I really appreciate it, guys. Thanks for the question. How's it going? My name is Boris. I'm really great listening to you, especially here at the Mindful Exercise. Did you say Boris? Yes, Boris. The Mindful Exercise is really great in this space. Duncan, my question is for you. This is referencing something that you said during your introduction. So you talked about Terrence McKenna's novelty theory. So the novelty theory, and tell me if you know that the end part of it is that sometime around November 2012, you were supposed to reach peak novelty, where the most novelty on the earth that's possible can happen, and there's going to be some sort of a cataclysmic event, and everyone's minds are going to be blown. And I take myself back to, you know, kind of mid-2012, sometime in the summer. And I was also drawing parallels where the Mayans predicted that December 21st, the calendar is going to end, so the world's going to end. So going back to 2013, and I was freaking out a little bit about the end of the world, but not taking it too seriously, and then come 2013, the world's still there. Something exciting really happened, the movie that came out wasn't that good. So my question to you is, in your opinion, who do you think lost more credibility 2013 going forward? Was it Terrence McKenna who ate a lot of mushrooms and came up with a Stone Age theory, or was it this huge ancient civilization that was wrong about the populace, and also the Spanish invasion? Okay, so to answer your question, McKenna, so what McKenna said, a lot of people accused and he did, I mean, in some of his lectures, he was just like, I studied the Yi Qing, December 21st, 2012, that's the end of the world. But if you read some other interviews with him, he says, even if they're off by 50 years in one direction or the other, 100 years in one direction or the other, it's still pretty tremendous that a civilization, pre-internet civilization, pre-television, could come that close to predicting a time period in the history of our species, where if there ever was a high probability that we were going to migrate to another planet, if there ever was a high probability that we would witness the emergence of technologies on the planet that would fundamentally alter the way we do business, the way that we function, then to predict it within to 2012? Okay, sure, we didn't have self-driving cars in 2012, but we're going to have them in 2025, and by 2035, 2045, right around there, that's where Ray Kurzweil and a lot of other people predict that we're going to start seeing a strong AI. We're going to start seeing a computer that has the operating power of our human brain, and then the subsequent year, we would see a computer that has the operating power of every human brain on the planet, so this is no longer somebody eating mounds of mushrooms in the forests of Peru with his brother talking to aliens. These are people who are like hardcore technologists who are making these predictions, and it's only a little ways away from 2012. So I think that number one, to say that anyone's been discredited is a misapprehension of the slow boil progress that we're experiencing right now, because if you think of the world right now, and you go back to say, I don't know, 2001, it's a different world, man. We've entered into a completely different, we've gone around a bend in the river. The former vegetation that we're used to, it ain't there anymore. This is a whole new place we're in right now. 2001, walk down the street. What do you see? People looking like this. Now walk down the street, what do you see? Bing, looking into the rectangle, looking into the rectangle. That's universal, and that's a change that happened that has never happened before. It's such a profound change to think that the majority of our times are since been staring at glowing rectangles, and that that change is just one of the many, many changes that have happened that does coincidentally fall right around the time period that it was predicted at the end of that calendar. So what in nature, what that's part of the, think of the way the seasons change. You know, it's like fall's supposed to start, when does fall start, September? Like towards the end of September, middle of September, I don't know, when does it start around here? What? Maybe September 20th something. Let's say September 13th, someone, when's the equine, when does it, what's the 21st? So let's say September 22nd, you look around, it's like, well, leaves are still green, there's not going to be a fall asshole, you know? So in the same way, it's like, look around, man, the leaves are changing, the colors have changed, the leaves are falling off trees, and trees are falling down right now. So I don't think anyone's discredited, I just think that if there was a mistake he made, it was in being a little too staunch on the exact date in some interviews, and not giving some leeway for the potential of there to be a 10, 20, 30 year cushion in there somewhere. So the idea that he wasn't wrong about peak novelty, he was just wrong about the date, you know, I'm just having trouble with the term peak novelty because in my, in the way that I conceptualize it is, you know, what is that going to look like? Are we ever going to read, what would peak novelty look like? Because in my idea, novelty is never going to expire. The world is always going to change, and to have a singular point cataclysmic event is to imply, well, there's not going to be anything new anymore because we've reached the maximum of things, and do you think he's kind of right about that concept, or am I misinterpreting the name? Well, I think what you said, what you're saying is like, when I interviewed the folks from Singularity University, they, one of the things they said is that what we're looking at here is that there will be a point in human history just based on the way progress is happening. Where, or there is the potential for this point, let's say, that there, not that there will be, but there could be. There could, there's a high probability, you know, unless we get hit by a comet, solar flare, the usual like list of things that can like slow progress, that we will experience in one day 20,000 years of human progress, right? So that's called the Singularity. So to understand that, imagine going back in time 20,000 years, and saying to someone 20,000 years ago, predict 20,000 years in the future what it's going to look like. And that person couldn't do it. There were no matter how hard they tried, no matter how they looked out at the world, they couldn't, they didn't, they wouldn't know that there was electricity. There certainly wouldn't know there was cars, satellites, space stations, the internet. So in that same way, all we can say about the particular corner, the hard singularity, as it's called, or peak novelty as Terence McKenna called it, is that it is fundamentally impossible to peer around it, which is why it's called the Singularity. It's like a black hole is a singularity. We can't look the Big Bang. We can't, we don't, it's considered irrelevant what that data was prior to the Big Bang. So the answer is, it's impossible to say, you know, if he's predicting some, I think his idea was like everything happening at once or something. I won't even pretend to understand it, but people like the folks from Singularity University just say that it's a kind of inconceivable thing because it's so fast and so many things happen at once. The only thing, the other thing about that, it's a discrete timeline, is that when you say something like 2012, it makes you think that it's going to happen within our lifetimes. And you referenced 20,000 years from now, and then, you know, if people are still around with Standard the Common Glass, perhaps the innovation that we can picture further, you know, the novelty that's going to happen 20,000 years from now, it's going to be, you know, completely mind-blowing and on a completely different scale, which is why I'm kind of questioning the idea of ever-reaching peak novelty within 40 years, 20,000 years, 20 years, et cetera. Well, you know, getting caught up in that, if you get caught up in that, you know, actually I just was reading an essay by McKenna where he was saying, I mentioned in the beginning of the show, the more you get into the present moment, the more you will experience novelty, that getting caught up in this concept of this thing that is coming, and I think he said we live in the shadow of the strange attractor at the end of time, like we can feel its shadow now, you know, upon our civilization. But to get caught up in what is coming is to miss out on what's here, and what's here is already weirder than weird, stranger than strange. It's almost inconceivably odd what's happening in almost every field, in almost every family, in almost every mind. It's already so weird that it's fun to prognosticate, but then to get too caught up and tangled in that is to miss out on just the joy of the particular moment, which is that we're experiencing together here. Joy listening to you guys. Thank you. Thanks for the question. Hi, guys. Hi. I'm Tom. So the thing that like won me over, so to speak, with you was years ago on Rogan's podcast, you compared life to like a dolphin, if you remember, coming up out of the water and then once you breach the air, like hopefully you can do a trick, you know, that's life. Hopefully at the top you can do something and then you go back down into the infinite is the way you put it. And I was just wondering, you know, that was years ago, you obviously think about religion and things like that. How do you, how does that still sit with you and how does that sit with you as a comparison to the life that we live? Well, thanks for asking that. I still, I mean, I, it still feels like that, like I still think about one of the things my grandmother said to me when she was, I think in her nineties is, and I've said on the podcast before I think about it a lot, is she's like, I look in the mirror, I see a 90 year old woman, but inside I feel like I'm still 14. I don't feel like I've, of eight, there doesn't seem like a passing of time or I think about like those moments when catastrophe strikes and you knew catastrophe was going to come in your life at some point, but then suddenly it comes and you know, I'll, I'll tell you like once when I was like getting radiation therapy, I was driving, driving to go get it and this was, actually this is before it's getting radiation therapy. This is when I was just fine when I had cancer, didn't know where it was in my body, had to go get like the results of all these fucking tests, really miserable drive and I'm driving and I'm like, because in that moment, you don't know what they're going to say, it could be all over your fucking body, you just don't know. So I'm driving and I'm looking out at the world and I'm thinking, fuck man, this world is like, it's still going to be here, but I won't be here and I won't matter that I, I'm not here. It won't, the impact isn't going to change the pulsation of like this, of civilization, right? But suddenly you're like right up there against the wall of your own, of your own mortality. Like right there, you're there, you're at the fucking precipice. This might be it. This might be where the doctor's like, yeah man, it's like, well try, but you know, I don't know, six months, whatever, they're going to give you a fucking wall that you're going to run into, right? So there it is. And then all of a sudden all that shit that was your life that you thought was going to go on forever, all that shit, it's in the, it's back here now and there's just this wall coming and then you realize, oh fuck, there's no time, you know, and so ever since then I've realized, oh, there, it will be a moment where I'm going to wait, I'm going to look around and be on my deathbed, hopefully nowhere, nowhere in the near future. But certainly in the future, fuck the singularity, there's no question about it, but there's going to be a personal singularity which is right on the horizon. And based on my general experience of time, it's like there's no such thing as time. So it's already happening, right? So the dolphin thing is this idea that for this very fleeting moment we appear out of the nothingness, no idea where we came from, I don't know, I hope there was stuff back there, millions of wonderful incarnations that were amazing, but I don't know, could just be a fucking nothing. And you come into a something and you're here for a second. Not like in a lot of people say that life is but a flickering of an eye, it really is. You're here for a fucking second and all these things you have to do, you have a body, you have thoughts, you have a mother, a father, a family, people you love, love. You feel love and scared, right? And it's fucking confusing. So in the midst of all that, if you can pull off some incredible thing, the flip is the dolphin flip. Like, you know, because you're on the fishing boat and you see dolphins show off, it's funny because they see us and then they like, one of them will be like, look, I can flip and it's like, fuck, that's amazing and flipped. So a human life, you know, like if you could do a flip as a human and the flip can be anything, you know, it could be something like, look, I became a Kanye West or, you know, that's a cool, because that's what Kanye West, that's what any real, real super famous person, just a dolphin doing a flip. That's all it is. No matter what Kanye West, all of them are going to plunge back into the nothingness with all of us other dolphins who are like belly flopping and like, I don't know what this is, a fucking dive alcohol poisoning. That's my flip. Belly flopping and like divorcing each other and like, that's my kid, give it to me. That's our fucking flip, which is okay because you just get a little second here. You're not expected to be a master of flipping right away. You know, I just hope that, you know, once we dive back in there, we come back out again. That's maybe what he can answer. I expected that from him. That's what I expected. That was unbelievable. Thank you. Thank you. And I think that is your flip right there. Oh, good. I'm done. Right? No. And there will be another one. You know, the whole time I was thinking about a guitar solo, just like taking a great solo, you know? But then it's over and I think the real question about the manifesting that peak kind of expression and emptiness or impermanence is what haunts us as human beings. It's that we can't attach to the emptiness and we can't attach to the form either. So we're kind of caught in a really poetic way between recognizing just everything that Duncan was saying, that there's none of it that's substantial, none of it is gonna last. It's immediately, you know, it's like writing on water the minute you take the pen up. You know, it's already dissolving. And then they say it's already broken. They look at the cup and they say it's already broken, which is sort of a summary of what that was about. Yet on the other hand, we can't sink into that nihilistic thing, which could be comforting in a weird way, to go, well, it's empty, it's impermanence, so I don't have to do my flip. I don't have to be a dolphin. And the irony is, yes, you do. So that's expressed in Buddhism as form and emptiness, those two things. And they're kind of not a true duality. They're kind of interwoven. So when you look at your existence, it's permeated by both of those things. Some kind of expression, some kind of individuality, some kind of creative force, some kind of manifesting. And it is empty, fundamentally, in the sense that it's not made of anything substantial. It doesn't last forever. And it doesn't have independent existence, that's what we say about emptiness. It doesn't have substantial existence. It doesn't exist independently, it exists interdependently. And it's impermanent. And yet it's not void. So this is deep when you contemplate this kind of thing or practice in that way. You're always on what we call the razor's edge, that's what it's called. There's a sort of edge quality to life. And you appreciate when other people are dancing on their edge, like our friend here. That is, there's some sense of risk, there's some sense of taking a shot and doing your best with it. There's a poignancy that's connected with it, that's a heart energy, where you recognize other people are going through the same thing. Even animals, other beings. And so we have sympathy hardwired into us in that way. And there's also a kind of dance or mirage-like quality of it. And that's who we are. So I didn't, I don't think I made that up. But maybe I did make it up. Well, thank you anyway. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. From, I can point you to the information later, please. I would love that. Absolutely. Thank you guys so much.

Today's guest is the author of two wonderful books, Create Your Own Religion, and On the Warrior's Path. He's also got a fantastic podcast called The Drunken Taoist. Now everybody, please welcome to The Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast, the great Danielle Bollelli. Welcome back to The Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast. God damn, it's good to see you. I'm very excited of being like a giggly girl for the last couple of days since we said let's record one more. I miss this. This is awesome. Well, this is the only way that I have friendship interaction anymore, weirdly, and it's so odd because when you came over before you started recording, and I'm like, man, I'm suddenly in a really great mood, and I'm thinking like, what happened? Why did I suddenly get in such a really good mood? I'm like, you're friends here, dumbass. You don't hang out with your friends enough, except when you're recording the conversations, and that's sick. But I'm glad to get to spend this time with you. This is going to be fun, but why do you think? Is it just being crazy busy that we all are that way? No, it's not busy. I think busy is a good excuse. It's a wonderful excuse, man, but the truth of it is that it's easier to stay inside and to be distracted by your cell phone and video games and to be in the shelter of your home than it is to leave your home and go through traffic. Right. And in the long run, all that you're doing is choosing comfort over freedom. And whenever that happens, whenever you make that decision, you are generally instantaneously punished by the universe. As it should be. As you should be, so I apologize. We got to hang out more. Let's do that. I'm quite pumped for that. Let's make that happen. We'll figure out, you know, especially in the US, we have this thing that unless there's a reason to get together, people don't. So it's kind of like, let's do lunch a month from now, from 12.15 to 1.15. And it's like, otherwise, the only way people get together is, you know, we go to the same gym then you get together, because you're working out together. Or we do, you know, there's an activity, otherwise people don't make it. It's kind of weird. It's really sick. Like the way that I help understand just how bizarre human existence is, is I imagine what if my dogs did that? And then, and then like, because if you, if you're dogs, actually, if you're, if your dogs did anything that you did, like if you came home and your dog was like, gave a kind of weak like bark and then just was like, went back to like playing some game, like Squirrel Chaser. Right. On the, on the iPad. You, you, you are even worse if your dog was just like, and then like scrolling through pictures of other dogs at parks on Instagram. Look at that one, the way that one lifted the leg. Oh God, that's hot. Yeah. Yeah. Looking at like, yeah, like what is your dog was like looking at whatever the Suicide Girl version of dog Instagrams was mixed in with like athletic dogs, mixed in with dogs, like dogs in the Adirondacks or something. And just like, you know, would look at it dog a gram and then stop it and then go and like lap up some water in its bowl and then take a six hour nap. You would, if your dog was doing what you're doing, you would take away its phone. Yeah. I think you would take away the dog. You would be like, fuck you. Dogs would go extinct because nobody would put up with them anymore. It's like, well, you want food? Fuck you. It's not going to happen. Vets, vets would just have baskets of dog cell phones that people left there after they had their dogs, you and I. Yeah, exactly. It's better for it to die. Yeah. Yeah. Now, yeah. So I think that, that the, if you consider your dog making appointments or any other, if your dog had a busy calendar or not busy calendar, if your dog kept a calendar, you would think to yourself, this is an awful thing that has happened to this dog. So yet for humans, it's just part of life. Yeah. We have to accept the fact that that's how it is and hope that it's leading us to some glorious future that we're as of yet unaware of. Yeah. And I think I don't have the, you know, our friend Chris Ryan, he has the whole civilization going down a bad path and it's all, it all sucks. I don't feel it all sucks, but it's, it's a mixed bag. You know, there are blessing courses in the whole thing. And we need to figure out ways to navigate to get the best out of it because there's so much that's good about it and staying away from the nasty parts that are a lot. There's a lot of bad shit going on. So it's like anything else is like figuring out that dance to get some of the best without getting settled down with all the heavy weights and the bullshit of it all. Yeah. I think it is something about a balance. And I think anytime you find yourself pining over the past, whether it's your recent past, whether it's your childhood or whether it's the childhood of your species, you're still kind of engaged in a, in a, in a form of nostalgia that doesn't seem to me to be very utilitarian. Not that you need a purpose to be nostalgic, but it does seem like, well, you know, let's imagine that in the past, you know, it was just like every animal was. Not only delicious, but gave blowjobs and just like, like the trees would massage you and the ground was made of boobs. That's like my image. That's the awful version of life. That's actually, I just described hell. I just described so good if you're walking on boobs all the time, like animals are eating or sucking you off. Your blowjobs? No. It's awful. Anyway, so it's a bad example, but you can get my point. I got your point. Even though I'm right now picturing hot trees with boobs, I don't know, there may be something to that. It's scary. It could be. It's scary. You don't want to, at first it's kind of cool, but like at night when you're walking, you bump into a blue tree. That would be disturbing. So you're working on a new podcast now, huh? Yeah. I'm pumped. I'm doing, it started actually a while back because I started putting two and two together and I listened to Hardcore History by Dan Carly. Yes. I love Dan. He's just an awesome human being, a brilliant podcaster. And then I realized, wait, wait, wait, wait, I teach history in college. That's what I do. And I dig Dan precisely because we have a similar taste for how to present the material. And I do podcasting. How about I put the two together and I play with it as well? Definitely. That seems like a no-brainer there. It's a complete no-brainer, but of course it took me about three years to figure out. The best no-brainers, too. And now the only thing that I understand why it took me three years to figure out is because it's an amount of work that's not even funny, you know? Right. Because you can just sit down and like, oh, let's see what we can bullshit about today and play and make it great and creative. No, it's not. You have to prepare like a motherfucker. You have to study, I don't know, the average episode, you have to read 3,000 pages or something that just to get ready to roll. Then you have to put all your notes together in a way that flows then. So it's a hell of a lot of work. That's why the last year and a half or so have been working on it because I didn't want to do a release episode one. And then in six months, see you guys, I'll get you episode two, you know? So you got to do, though, basically an entire course. Yeah. But it's not even a course. It needs to be entertaining. Absolutely. You've got to figure out a way to weave all of these points together that if by themselves read, read, read off, read off, remarkable, maybe boring. Yeah. The books you read are painful. The books you read are not fun to read. They are like torture, but you're like digging for gold there. You know, you find your one little gold nugget and they are like, oh, this is awesome. Surrounded by a horrible, boring, tedious language, heavy academic stuff. And then by picking out all these little gold nuggets, then when you have them all in front of you, you figure out a way to put them together in a way that delivers. We take it with passion, you know, with the Game of Thrones versions of history, right? That's what history was. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. When you look at it, there are stories that they don't give you in school. They tend to, even when they touch on the cool topics, it presented in such a way that it doesn't really spark a fire in anybody. And it's crazy because the source material is there. You know, it's right there for you to pick and just deliver it as it's supposed to. You're not even doing something crazy. And it will be exciting. It will be passionate because it's about crazy humans involved in wild sex and killing and heroic stories and horrible stories. You know, there's so much passion in human history. And it really doesn't take much to highlight it. It almost takes more to make it boring, but apparently that's the name of the game in a lot of academia. A good history teacher is like the Hubble telescope compared to those shitty old, the most other ones. Because like an astronomer can look at, I don't know, can look at microwave signals. I'm just talking about this on another podcast and get excited about that. Whereas anybody else who looks at it, they're like, it just looks like a bunch of shit on a black whatever. I don't care what this, I don't care if Godzilla farted this out at the beginning of time. It's the most uninteresting thing I've ever seen. But if you look at like, when you see those crazy Hubble deep field images of the stars, almost humanoid clouds that are billions of times larger than our sun floating out there, it makes you, it gives you this incredible, swooning sense of awe. And a good history teacher does the same thing when you realize that you're perched at the very top of this precarious temporal tower that contains within it level upon level upon level of the most atrocious brutality, the most insane shifts in paradigms that as an end result has allowed you to come emerging out of your mother's vagina in one piece. And that makes you, it makes you feel crazy. It is. And it is like literally like, why do people like Game of Thrones? You know, you do get that. You do get the horror, the heroism, the beauty, the disgusting. It's all to the 10th power. And it's right there in history. You just have to highlight it the right way. What is it? What is your, can you talk about what your theme of this first podcast is going to be? Yeah, the first one is going to be about the slave wars in ancient Rome. There were like three major rebellions that turned into full-fledged wars by enslaved people within Italy who got pissed off and decided to go after the Romans. The third one is the most famous, Spartacus. The first two are a little less known, but they are. How long ago is this? This is about maybe 2100 years ago. 2100 years ago. So 2100 years ago in Rome, they are keeping, where are the slaves coming from? You know, the fact of being a big military power meant that as they were conquering more and more people, they would enslave more and more people, prisoners of war. And then the other thing that they did was they would force some of their subjects to pay crazy high taxes. And if you didn't, couldn't pay, well, too bad now you're a slave. So there were a ton of people who ended up in slavery. So how did Romans collect taxes? They had a system where they would have, it's kind of privatized in a way. They had guys who had the job to go out and collect taxes and bring the money back to the state. How they did it, nobody gave a fuck. As long as you bring the money back, we're all happy. But how do they keep records? What were they writing on? Oh, yeah. They had, what did they used to write? Fuck if I remember. I can't remember what they used to write, but we aren't talking about... Papyrus or something? Yeah, you are talking about something along those lines. It's not anymore the old style, cuneiform table, that kind of thing. This is actual writing, I think, is literally like pen as in, like, feather, two paper type of stuff. Did they have filing cabinets? That's, if you're rich, you have a lot of shit that you could... Yeah, basically you have documents upon documents. You have historians, you have medical treaties, you have a lot of stuff that gets written. And in that regard, the technology for writing didn't really improve that much until for, like, good thousand-plus years after that. It's just weird to imagine that then, back then, there was some bastard who had a fucking chest full of scrolls that contained... And he would go through it and be like, oh, this guy owes me however much money, and he would come to your house and arrest you? Or would he send guards to get you? Or would he just come and say, look, you have one more chance to pay? Well, he would have his enforcer who come with him, and he's very mafia-like, you know, in that sense. It sounds like a mafia. It's kind of like, hey, you haven't paid, I think we need to break a leg. Instead of breaking a leg that doesn't get you money, you enslave them. Then that gets you money. So you would sell them? Yeah. You would take the person to some prison, a debtor's prison kind of situation, then you sell them into slavery. Yep, you put them up on the slave market, you still make money, you give a cut to the state, everybody wins. What happened to their kids? Like, what if you had kids? Maybe we'll enslave them too. So the whole family goes? Yeah. Or you end up in a situation where you have the mom and kids left without the father, so that would cause even more economic decline, which then would require even more people being enslaved. If one of those laborers is funny because there's romis involved with somebody trying to invade them, there's like these Nordic tribes, sort of what the Romans was, a bunch of barbarians trying to invade them, and they are successful, they are kicking Roman ass left and right. Yeah. And they have to turn to some of their subject states and say, okay, send us some people for the army. And these guys are like, we got nobody left, because you have been harassed in all the young men and put them all, you enslave them all. We have nobody left to send you. Wow. And so the Romans are like, oh, shit, that's not good. So then they have to try to figure out a way to free some of the slaves that were arrested because of taxes, because they were too heavy and promised that they are not going to do that anymore, so that they can throw them into the army to settle. Good news and bad news. You're out of jail, but now you got to go fight the goddamn, what are they called? The starts of the G, doesn't it? Which ones? The barbarians. Oh, yeah, there was the two main tribes at that time were the Kimbrian and the Teutones, and they were pretty badass. Yeah, they were not the guys you wanted to go fight just for the fun of it. Now, the term barbarian, these weren't really barbarians, these were just indigenous people, or who were they? Like, why do they get, when I think of, or are they like, when I think of a barbarian, I think of like the guys in Game of Thrones, the guys on the other side of the wall, the animal skins, painted faces. A little of, like, the barbarian is obviously a racist idea, right? You're not like us, so you're a barbarian, you know, it's like, that's actually the word itself, it was a Greek word, because to the Greeks, the sound that these other people would make when they spoke was like, ba, ba, ba, ba, so it became barbarian because of that, because it sounded like a bunch of, like, meaningless syllables. Are you fucking shitting me, man? Yeah, that's where the word barbarian comes from. So their name for them is the equivalent of when somebody says something to you and you go, gip, gip, gip, gip, gip, gip, gip. That's exactly it, yes. That's hilarious. The word is like, yo, those are the bee, bee, bees. Exactly. What? I can't understand what you're saying. I'm just going to take your fucking land anyway. That's precisely where barbarian, the barbarian comes from. That's so fucked. We're going to war with a gip, gip, gip, gip, gip. That's, you nailed it. So what happens is that from the point of view of these guys, you know, we are civilized Greeks. We are civilized Romans. We are, anybody who was not like them was like, you are fucking barbarians. You speak weird. You go around tending to your flocks rather than building big cities. Right. Fuck you. But basically they were mostly pastoralists, the guys coming in. So they had giant flocks. They could be, they meant they could be nomadic. They didn't have to be in one place. So they didn't build an urban culture. And that's such that they are considered barbarians. Did they keep slaves? I'm pretty sure they did. Just about anybody did at that time. So back then, you just, if you could get somebody to be your slave, they were your slave. You do. Yes. I mean, what, what was keep, like, let's say that I'm a barbarian and then I see a weaker dude walking in front of me as I'm tending my sheep. Am I allowed to just throw a lasso on him and be like, sorry, man, you're my servant. If he's not one of your guys, you know, if he's one of the people in the tribe, no, you'll get somebody else who is their protector and will be trapped. But if he's somebody else, if he's from another people, yeah, fuck them. They are not as a soap. Okay. So it was open game. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So one of the, because I like to think about like modern worries versus ancient worries. Yeah, that's a big one right there. And, you know, like modern worries are very real and very scary. But no, when I walk, when I went to get breakfast, I'd set definitely on my mind was like, shit, man, I hope I don't get turned into a slave. Yeah, that's my thought. I had exact same thought. I always thought like, what if, you know, you're there tending your land, planting seeds, doing your thing, and all of a sudden right above the hill, you see like 200 guys on horseback with giant swords coming in. What the fuck do you do? You're done. There's nothing you can do. You're like, no, you're just like, all right, here we go. Gonna be a slave, I guess. It's like, I hope I got to be a slave and they don't decide just to chop my head off and use it as a drinking vessel instead. Oh yeah, right. Because that, I mean, that's the other option. Being a slave is like, that's a good day. Like that you're lucky. You're alive. Yeah, you're alive. You got to live. So what was the, it seems like there must have been a fairly grim outlook of life back then. Like most people must have had a fairly sad, depressed approximation of what it was like to be alive. You're, well, I guess it becomes one of those existential trips because, of course, life was insanely hard. You know, life expectancy wasn't that much. Or rather, you know, people could live a long time, but there were crazy high infant mortality, lots of diseases, lots of warfare, lots of violence. There were 3 million ways to die young. So obviously, many people did not have a plan for 80 years from now kind of mentality, which is not good because you're dealing with serious existential threats to your life on a regular basis. But at the same time, you take the future less for granted. So there's a lot more to pass on the wine right now. Let's go have sex right now. Let's have a big party because who the hell knows what a year from now is going to be like. So it's kind of, this is, I'm sure you, have you seen the wild and wonderful whites of West Virginia? No. It's a fantastic documentary about this family in West Virginia. It's a really large family of what you would safely call like hardcore white trash. Like deep, deep, like, you know, doing things like snorting oxy-cotton in the hospital next to your newborn. Wow. And, you know, that kind of level of depravity and just complete insane survivalist living. But one of the points they make is that these are descendants of coal miners. And the coal miners, their life expectancy was short. They didn't know what was going to happen to them every time they went into that mine. They could die. And so it created a sort of fatalism. And fatalism often produces a kind of sad hedonism, this kind of melancholy hedonism, which is fuck it. Just fuck it. You seriously want me to not inhale this wonderful powder that makes me feel like I'm not about to die and that my life isn't more pointless. Yeah, exactly. It's like so that maybe, yeah, because you're right. Because there are 3,000 other things that can kill you now. So they're like, eh, fuck it. I'll just have fun. Yeah. So this is like generational fatalism that got passed down. So probably back then there was some similar kind of world outlook. And it was a must, people must have been, were people more, were people, was the individual more violent back then? Yeah. The level of violence was insane, which is why I think there's actually a connection with this existential fatalism and the fact that in Rome the gladiators were such a big hit. I mean, think about what that says about a society where your form of entertainment is, you know, let's bring the family to go watch some dudes slicing up each other with swords and while you're eating your lunch and commenting on the fights, you know. Wow. If that's your number one form of entertainment, that's saying something about the culture. Right. Okay. That's so effective. Recently on the news, this, yet another atrocity. A lunatic with a gun blasts a reporter on TV. It is fucked. It is so fucked that it instantly, I'd say within eight minutes, pretty much the entire planet with access to the internet is aware that this event happened. In Rome, this was happening every day and was commodified. So people would just go and watch slaves who couldn't pay their, you would go and sit in arena watching men who couldn't pay their taxes hack each other to death while you ate fucking fast food. That's exactly how it was. Now to throw a weird curve to the story, though, while what you painted is exactly true, because the majority of gladiators were slaves and that's exactly what happens. You're there in the bleachers, eating your fast food, seeing two guys killing each other. The two guys killing each other is actually the best part of the game, best from modern perspective. They were like executions where criminals got thrown to the beasts to be eaten. There's all sort of crazy. They got really creative with their execution. They would do this like Roman snap plays, basically, where they would reenact like meats with the convicts. So they would do like some guy with, they would put them up on a tower with wings and then they would throw him off saying, Icarus, look, this is the meat of Icarus right here. And the dude is just plummeting to his dead and everybody claps and go, that was a great play. You had crazy perverted weird shit that was like stories about Zeus taking the form of a bull. Zeus was always busy seducing women beside the goddesses. And so Zeus taking the form of a bull to have sex with a woman. So they decide, hmm, we have a woman who's been sentenced to death. We are going to have a bull have sex with her and literally kill her in the process of having sex. Wow. Stuff like that where you're like, what the fuck, how dark does it get? When they were selling tickets for these shows, did they list what was going to happen on the, were people aware? Yeah, there was the program. There was a program. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So you could actually make, did you know in advance, like when you came in, you could be like, what's up today? Yeah, you were like, I saw the Icarus thing. I don't really care about, oh shit, they're going to let a woman get fucked to death by a bull. In that case, please. I want to see that one. Okay. Where are the tickets? Daddy, I want to see the woman get fucked to death by a bull. Yeah. Because there'd be kids there. Of course. And the reaction is not one that now if anyone witnessed this, the reaction would be one of like, you know, you'd be depressed for, you'd probably have some PTSD. Yeah. You'd be, you'd wake up screaming. Well, I think you did even back then have PTSD, but the culture turns it into something. All right, there is still this PTSD, but it's normalized where it's like, there's a story about one of the Roman emperors. I forgot if he was Commodore Circle Eagle, but one of the totally crazy ones who grew up and once he grows up is a badass, mean motherfucker. But there's a story of him as a kid and they bring him to the games and they see when they throw a bunch of prisoners to the lions and the lions tear them apart. And the kid is freaked out and he's trying to look away and his parents are like, no, this is what we do as Romans. You need to enjoy this and kind of turn his face and make him watch. Now, as he grows up, he goes, you know, he becomes a sadistic, crazy motherfucker. So the odds that that had an influence on the A caused B, it seems pretty likely. Or if he's not hosed 100 percent, he sure as hell gave a push in that direction. Well, now, when did it start? Is there, does anyone aware of the gladiatorial stuff? Yeah. Yeah, the gladiators. There's one of the common theories is that this was popular either with the Atrozcans, which were right before the Romans and then leading into Roman times. Or it was something from Campania, which is southern Italy, Greek origin. Like they even have in like in the Iliad or something, they have this idea of for somebody's funeral. This was part of funeral games originally. They weren't games as entertainment as they become in Roman times. Funeral games. Yes, somebody dies and you have a contest with people shedding blood to basically feed the spirit of the dead. Because there was this idea that the shedding of blood would give them would give them nourishment. And so you have two guys just go at it. It could even be three people or after a while when three people decided, yeah, I don't really want to kill myself because that other guy died. How about we grab some slaves and have them do it? And so if we follow this down the line, it ends. It must rather begins with a crazy person who was very charismatic. That sounds like what it is. It's a person who was strong and scary or charismatic and he was around a group of people in the dark and he said to them, listen, I don't want to do this. You don't want to do this. But Jack died. And what's his ghost going to eat? Yep, need some blood. We got to get some blood guys. Yep. So I came up with a game where we could play it as funeral where we make our slaves fight each other. Yep. So it's just a crazy. It starts with a crazy person and it starts with a circle of gullible people who I guess succumb to the crazy. Because you know whoever came up with this idea. You know, way, way, way, way, way back when whoever came up with this idea, some, his friends, a lot of them are like, no, I don't think we should do that, man. Are you sure? And he's like, I was right about the time we got the deer. And they're like, yeah, you're right, I guess. Or it could even be the other way because probably what happened before the games was that they would just grab somebody and sacrifice them straight up, right? And it would be just a human sacrifice at the grave of this big important person who died. Yeah. And so it could be that what happened is one of the people to be sacrificed say, whoa, time out. How about we do this? We're still giving you blood. Okay, it's still gonna happen. Right. But rather than just grabbing me and tearing out my heart and dropping blood on top of this guy grave. Why don't you give me somebody else, another guy to be sacrificed? You give us sword. So yes, somebody will die. Somebody will shed the blood. But we make a contest out of it. So you guys can have a good time watching. And at least you have a chance. And do you know how they responded to that guy? Exactly. Throw him a sword and just stop talking. You can fight. So this, I'm really interested in this because in the same way that one of the great mysteries of planet Earth is the moment inorganic life. Became organic life. Became organic life. We'll never know exactly what process has happened. We can theorize. But unless maybe we'll know, but maybe we'll have a time machine or something. We can go watch it happen. But right now we don't know. So it's a big old mystery and it's a wonderful mystery. In the same way, there's the mystery of the first human sacrifice. There's the mystery of the first, the first time one person got so terrified that his solution to this internal turmoil was to kill his brother or sister in the name of an invisible non-existent being. And that person, there must have been a first. Sure. And it echoed all the way down and through time and became more complex, more organized. And that brings us to the Roman arenas. That brings us to what you're talking about right now. You're seeing this thing that is morphed through time. And now here it is. And this, you know, when you came in, you saw I'm reading this book by Sam Harris called Waking Up. And I was telling you, I love the book. Not just because the writing's great, but because I vehemently disagree with him on certain points. And I love disagreeing with him. And it's great. You don't want to read something you disagree with. It's fucking awesome. So I sit there reading and like, I've actually tried to send him an email through his website just because I'm like, it's a weird email too. It's an authentic, I fucking love this book, man. But, you know, saying certain things I don't, I don't understand that he's saying or I just don't agree with. But one point he's making. And when you tell me these stories, it really seems to put that point in italics. It seems to be that if, you know, one superstition becomes institutionalized, what starts off as really cute turns into the most brutal fucked up shit ever. Yeah. I mean, think about like the Aztecs or the Maya where human sacrifice was like, you know, what do we do on Sunday? Let's tear out some hearts, you know, it's or, you know, you have that in the most brutal way possible. Hell, in the Bible, you have like Jewish patriarchs setting people on fire as a sacrifice. You have, you know, snipping off the tips of dicks. You see all over the place, right? And then you see sacrifice at the other way where I probably originated where it was originally somebody doing it to themselves, where you still see today like somebody sun dancing where they pierce and they shed their own blood. They don't die, but there's the idea of the shedding of blood to give strength to your prayers and everything else. May we stop for a moment? May I have you read something? I want you to read something if I could. By all means. Okay, great. I'm going to pull it up. We're going to stop for a second just because we're talking about human sacrifice right now. Cool. I'd like you to read a little bit from Alistair Crowley's essay on human sacrifice, just because it's a very astute, awesome, creepy thing that's fun to put on the podcast. One second. Let me find it. A reading from Danielli Bollelli of Libre Four by Alistair Crowley. It would be unwise to condemn, as irrational, the practice of those savages who tear the heart and liver from an adversary and devour them while yet warm. In any case, it was the theory of the ancient magicians that any living being is a storehouse of energy, varying in quantity according to the size and health of the animal and in quality according to its mental and moral character. At the death of the animal, these energies liberated suddenly. Yeah. That's pretty intense. I think it nails it as far as where the Aztec idea came from, where probably early Roman, before it became entertainment, where the gladiator stuff was tied to religion, where that's... Pretty intense. I'm curious to imagine that as the Romans sat around the dying slaves, watching them get eaten by animals, watching them get hacked to death, what they were actually doing was absorbing their life energy as it exploded out of them. It was more of a coven of vampiric witches who thought they were there for entertainment, unaware of the fact that what they were really doing was sucking in a tiny bit of that being's dispersed life energy. Almost like the splitting of the atom, only instead of an atomic explosion, it was a spiritual explosion. And that to this very day, the reason so many people have clicked play on the YouTube video showing this woman getting shot is not because there's some kind of perverse voyeuristic desire to watch someone die, but that that woman's life energy has somehow been digitally encoded and is now being transmitted to the entire planet and what happened was an inadvertent human sacrifice that is being amplified by technology. You're a master, my man. Yeah, that's trippy to think, but I wouldn't put it past to the fact that that was a lot of what was going on originally. And I think all those motivations mix. The voyeuristic, I want to see blood, sure is a part. The original religious aspect was a part. There are so many different motivations that I think even the people watching half of the time don't understand. In the romance case, this is a weird guess. This is how flat out schizophrenic the attitude was. On one hand, they despise gladiator because they are slaves. They have to, with their bodies, give entertainment to other people through their death, which is considered such, you know, worthy of a slave. It's like a low class thing. On the other hand, gladiators were heroes and they were people who worshiped them. They became celebrities. They became kind of like the sport, the top athletes of the day. Or they became like American Sniper. Yeah, but even like literally almost like NBA kind of thing where you women would line up to have sex with them. Men would idolize them. Right. And it's like the same one that is despised as this low class slave. At the same time, he was probably the only slave who had a chance to climb to the top of fame, popular worship and everything else. Because in another kind of way, what is that the gladiator did? What was the whole thing about? It was really about fighting on where everything is hopeless. You know, the life of a gladiator is pretty grim. The odds are high that you'll die in the arena in front of a screaming mob who said, die, bust or die. And so what is that the Romans admire? How you handle that? You know, if you are able, if you are scared and you go in and your hand is trembling and you run away when the other gladiator is trying to hack you, everybody's like, what a waste. This is sad to watch. This is pathetic. But if you go out with this sense of like, I don't give a fuck. I'm gonna fight the last second. And not only that, I'm gonna fucking enjoy it. I'm gonna enjoy this death struggle against hopeless odds. It's the ultimate slave mentality. Yeah, then you become a hero because the reality of the Roman world was that everybody had to deal with that shit because everybody was dying left and right, not in the arena in other ways. And suddenly the gladiator gave them a model to live after. It's like that spirit. If I can channel that in daily life, that's what it is. So in an odd way gladiators became they would teach a master class in stoic philosophy. Well, they teach a class in how to worship your master. They're the ultimate example of pure and absolute servitude in the most perverse and sick way. The gladiators are an example of somebody working at a fucking 7-Eleven, or not a 7-Eleven, or some place where you're not getting paid enough and you're having to do too much shit and you're being mistreated in the most extreme way and you're giving up your life to somebody who's turning it into a profit for them and you're getting nothing back. They're an example of somebody who in that situation on their lunch break has conversations about how awesome their boss is. Oh, he's great. Mr. Williams, he gives me five minutes of an extra break. Mr. Williams gave me a free hot dog yesterday. I didn't have enough to afford it, but he lets me eat the hot dogs for free when I work here. Oh, he's great. That's on the goddamn, that's on the gladiator spectrum. It's just because here you have a slave with a sword. Who could, instead of attacking some other fucking slave who's in the exact same predicament, could turn around to whoever his captors are and at least decapitate a few of those motherfuckers before going down. And that's gotta be what starts these slave rebellions that you're talking about. That's where the Spartacus rebellion is super famous because this was a bunch of gladiators who decided fuck this, we're out of here. Because the masters were aware of the fact that you give weapons to people who are likely to die in the arena for your entertainment, probably these guys are not gonna be so happy about it. So they would always lock up the weapons, they would do all this stuff. So Spartacus rebellion literally starts with about 70 guys grabbing kitchen knives and skewers that they were used for roasting a pig or something. And they kill the guards with those and then get the guards weapons. And then they kind of like graduate to better and better weapons with each one they beat along the way. Wow, it's like a video game. Yeah, until they become a full-fledged army. I mean, by the end, the Spartacus thing is probably has like 70,000 people with him. Can you not to do a spoiler, but how does that rebellion end? No, well, which is why as a general rule, you don't see many slave rebellions. You see people running away because one guy running away. You have a shot. You can run away. You see, you know, stuff like that. You see big scale slave rebellion. I mean, what are the odds that you're going to be able to take down this huge power who's able to enslave hundreds of thousands or millions of people? Even if you give it a hard time like Spartacus is super successful. He defeats like seven Roman armies in a row. It's unbelievable in Rome. They are really freaking out for real. The end of the day, they steal the way it's going to end after this last giant battle in which Spartacus forces get chopped to pieces. There are about like 6,000 people who are captured and the ones who didn't die in the battle. And the Romans will line them up from roughly modern day Naples, Capua technically, which is right next to it, all the way to Rome. It's like 100 miles, 110 miles, something like that. And every 40 yards, they crucify one of these guys. So you have this forest of crosses that go from Naples to Rome along the main way with the crucified slaves every few yards. Yeah. That's a message of don't fuck with us. Anybody thinking of rebelling again? Take a look at this first. You know what sucks? If you've got to deliver a fucking package on that 40 miles a weekend. Yeah, you pass. The smell. Yeah. You're just like, God damn it, man. Could you have crucified these guys like a little off their route? I've got my commute. Is there any way you could have crucified these guys? Why on the road? That's precisely because they want as many people as possible to see it. Oh, the stink, of course. I know. Yeah, they want to scare people. The messages. This is what happens when you fight Rome. This is what happens when you're not a good slave. Yeah. It's funny because the heroism that Rome worships is decried the moment that it turns onto its true enemy. And it's funny that way, isn't it? That you can apply so much of what's happening back then to modern life, which is that you take somebody like Snowden, for example. Somebody who's enlisted in the military, or not Snowden, rather, manning. Someone who's enlisted in the military, who sees what's actually happening, which is that people or reporters are getting gunned down in the most fucked up way, like the sadism that's happening. There's just something that nobody who is in the United States would want their military to be doing for any reason at all if they had any modicum of sanity. And he does a truly heroic act. Right? Oh, man, what a heroic act that was. He fucking gets that information out into the world, knowing he has to. Moral character. He knows I can't ignore this. I've seen it. I either do something about it or I spend the rest of my life as a half person. He does it. Now, he's in solitary confinement in what I think is super max prison, where I believe that he's being held in solitary confinement for things like having the wrong kind of toothpaste or something like that. So he's being tortured. And they're letting the information get out that he's being tortured in the most obscene ways because that's the new form of crucifixion. Yeah, that's the message. It's like, anybody else think about leaking stuff like that? Take a look at this guy. Look at this guy. Yeah. That's the truth. Here's who you're up against. Yep. Just so you know. You're up against someone who won't crucify you because we can. Yeah, exactly. But if we could, we would. Oh, gladly. We would. If they could have, if they could have, they would have had Manning in front of the White House on a fucking cross. Yeah. And there would probably be bus loads of Republicans coming in from churches in the local area to watch him get crucified while they ate popcorn. Absolutely. That's the game. That's why in fact, human psychology hasn't really, humans are humans, you know, you don't change them culture or influence you and stuff. You're more likely. But some of the stuff that made the romance sit down to watch gladiatorial fights is in us now. You know, it's not that we can temper it. We can, but the instinct is there. That's why like, I don't know, you know, when you go watch UFC sometime, you know, you're enjoying the fights for the technical aspect. You're already enjoying the fights for the bravery of somebody. I trips me out every time I see somebody was like yelling, Boston motherfucker up, snap the legs, break it, break it, break it. I'm like, Jesus Christ, you're sick. What's your problem? I mean, it's one thing to appreciate the bravery of the contest and the technique, but to actually be there because you want somebody's bone to poke through the skin and see it. You want to see some blood? Look, man, I'm sorry. I would love to like tell you that because you're a martial artist you train. I got to admit when I went to see the UFC, I've been training a little bit. That's what in Muay Thai. That's awesome. A little bit. But enough where now it's like, Oh God, this is the most beautiful, incredible, spiritual. Discipline that I've ever encountered. It's amazing. The effect it has on your life. It's magic. It's terrific. So now when I watch fights, it really is this beautiful thing when you realize what they're doing. And even now I barely understand it, but I understand it enough to be awed by it. Right. But I will admit, initially, part of what was the excitement was the thrill of watching somebody get knocked out. Right. It was sickening. Yeah. Also, it's pretty entertaining, man. I mean, there is a thing inside. Of course. I mean, I will admit that I'm sick. I'm sexually depraved. And I suppose, I don't really think it's depraved, but nobody's going to say that I'm having missionary styles. But in the same way, but I don't think that's depraved in the same way. I just don't think it's fair to say somebody's sick necessarily because they're like getting off on someone, getting the shit kicked out of them in an arena where prior to the fight, they're playing war drums. Right. You know what you have to see when Elvis is out of the blue? It's like boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. That kind of sound does not generate a thing. We're like, man, I hope these guys hug. Yeah, exactly. I like to see these two friends get together and have a nice chat in the middle of this group of people who are half drunk. That's not one of the guy, Evan Tanner, who was an early UFC fighter. He won the middleweight championship at one point way back in the day before Anderson Silva, before Rich Franklin. And Evan Tanner was a very interesting guy, super complex because he was a genuinely sweet and nice guy and he would go in the cage and elbow people in the head. So he had this weird tension because on one hand he felt like he loved the fighting because of what he forced him to dig in inside of himself spiritually to kind of be brave in the face of stuff that scared the hell out of him. So he loved the tension of the fight and what he brought out in him. And at the same time, he was kind of bummed out that it's like for me to experience that, I have to leave another dude in blood. And so his whole thing was like, I wish there was a way to get this side of the equation without having to pay that price that to him doing it was kind of ugly. If you want to get high, you got to cough, right? I guess that's the name of the game. You're getting high. Right. Let's face it, you're getting high on these very intense endogenous chemicals that aren't coming out of those sweet synaptic vesicles unless your fist is banging into somebody's fucking head in the middle of your entire planet. I guess the closest that I could think of what Tanner was talking about, like when I saw people Sundance where you see guys, so you're not doing anything to somebody else, you're doing it to yourself. You see guys pierced through their chest and be tied to the tree or they pierced from the back and they have buffalo skulls tied to this rope that they drag around for round after round after round until either they break loose or they will get kids to sit on the buffalo skull, pinning them down and you push forward and break loose. When you hear about it, it's nuts. It's like, who the fuck does that? Why? Why would you do that to yourself? When you see it, it makes perfect sense in a non-rational kind of way. There's something actually beautiful about that because there is that high of the tough, scary, but you embrace it in a way. But in this case, you're doing it to yourself so you don't have anything that involves somebody else, whereas somebody else has blood. So it goes back to Crowley's very sinister assessment of human sacrifice or animal sacrifice or sacrifices of any sort, which is that no matter what, if you're alive right now, you're alive because you've absorbed the energy of a thing that you've eaten. Now the thing that you've eaten may have been plant matter, but it was alive. I don't know if it has consciousness or can feel or if it's just a kind of blank photosynthetic machine, but you fucking killed it. You can't deny the fact that it was alive and it's dead so that you could live. If it's an animal, it's the same thing, obviously, but it goes even further. If you're listening to this through a cell phone, then you have within your pocket a thing that was more than likely constructed in a society where the people are not being fairly compensated for their work. The chemicals within the thing itself have been probably the process to create them has created some level of environmental degradation, perhaps small, more likely fairly extreme. A lot of it was mined in regions where people are in the middle of or often find themselves in terrible civil wars. A lot of it has been is being defended. The thing in your pocket is there because the system that is used to create it is being defended by people with high powered weapons that go into places where there's the minerals needed to produce this stuff so that you could have your phone. So what you're saying is that basically each cell phone is the result of somebody being fucked to death by a bull. That's essentially, if we want to sum it up, that's the image, right? Well, yeah, in a version of being fucked to death by a bull, in fact, there may even be people who've created these things who, if you said to them, hey, would you rather be doing this or we can end it quick? You just got to be fucked to death by a bull. There might be some of them who are like, you know, I'll take the bull. I don't want to sit in this goddamn fucking factory for 12 hours a day in a communist regime where the air is 80% solar. Which is exactly why people chose to become gladiators sometimes. There were volunteers at times where your life sucks so bad that it's like, you know what? I have one shot of being worshipped by women, by everybody, at glory. Fuck it, look at the rest of my life. This is better. I'll take that. The cycle is, we have that. The snake is eating its tail. And there's no way around that. There's a collie right now that has emerged, that is constantly tearing off the heads of great men and women and putting them in her mouth that is constantly destroying, you know, like ISIS. I talk about ISIS too much, guys. I don't really care, I just think they're a great example. But ISIS, videos coming out of them destroying these beautiful Syrian temples. Now, take a picture of collie and place it next to the picture of the destruction of the temple of ISIS. And you will see collie at work in the world because collie wears a necklace of heads that are the old gods. Collie represents the tendency for the ice, for glaciers to destroy and powderize civilizations thanks to meteor impacts. And sometimes monkeys do the same thing to each other. So what I mean is it's like, it's an unavoidable and inescapable aspect of human existence at this moment. And if you think that you're somehow out of it, you're fucking nuts. If you are in any way on the grid, then you are absorbing the life energy of people who are being exploited all over the planet so that you could have some modicum of comfort. And you're probably exchanging your suffering so that you can get more of the other things from other people's suffering. We say that the fucking currency is paper, the currency is suffering. We trade suffering for suffering. And that's the way the system works right now. And from what you're saying, it appears to be the way the fucking thing has worked for a very long time. Very, very much. Is it hopeless? Do you think that the history, these cycles, the Roman Empire, and it seems to be more of a spiral than a circle, right? Things do change. The way slavery works now is not the way slavery used to work, but it's still a form of slavery if you have to survive in this country by finding a boss. The boss is the master. The master, instead of giving you food and shelter, gives you money that gives you just enough for the food and shelter that you need to work for the boss. It's a word you could say. You could actually even say that in some ways it may be preferable to be a slave in the sense that if you become a slave, at least you've got job security. Yeah, it's like, look, I have TV, I have internet, I got to have my house, I can eat what I want. I'm a good slave. If you're a good owner, you're going to let your slave use your wireless. And there's going to be slave forums. If slavery was around today, there'd be a slave tender. There'd be slave dating services. But anyway, you see these similarities that are less brutal. Yeah, it's still similarly brutal, just in a different way. Do you think it can get to the point where humans are no longer exploiting each other? Can it get to the point where we're no longer crucifying heroes? Do you think it's possible that this spirals into a more utopian version of history, or are we doomed to this consistent, endless echo of violence that has been going on for as long as history has been recorded? I think to some degrees, you have to figure out, it's magic. You have to figure out a way to not depend on resources that are limited. Because as long as the resources are limited, there's competition. As long as the resources are limited, I got to eat you in order to survive. As long as you rely on limited resources, that's the name of the game. There's power games to control them. There's predatory games to be able to consume them so that you get them and not the other guy. In a game of unlimited resources, that whole power competition, that whole Tiger 8 Deer game wouldn't probably work the same way, because you don't have to. But of course, that's right now, it's completely utopia, because how the hell do you get unlimited resources? How do you... I don't see any... And again, maybe tomorrow, somebody come along and figure out a way that we press this button and suddenly you can produce food out of thin air and anybody can have anything they want. Then there is none of that game anymore. But right now, this is crazy utopia to a level that granted, all sorts of crazy shit has happened over the last 20, 30, 40 years. The technologies have been developed that nobody would have ever pictured before. And the general attitudes of much of humanity has become a little more mellow about what we accept, at least openly and what we don't. So, you know, if you look at racism today, it's way less than it was 100 years ago. If you look at attitudes towards violence today, you know, that kind of thing. So there's some stuff has improved, but at the same time, the game can only change so much, as long as people are killing each other over limited resources. And it's safe to say that if you went back to the time of the Romans and had a conversation with the gladiator who was about to go fight a bear, and he said, hey, do you want to go fight the bear? I'm going to take you back to the future where you can work at Starbucks. The gladiator's kidding. 90 out of 100 would have said that Starbucks sound awesome. And then there would have been the one who was like, you know what? Fuck it. I want to go down with the bang and everybody clap at my crazy bravery and screw Starbucks. I want to go for it. Bring on the bear. Yeah, there's going to be some still some dummies who decide or bear haters. Yeah, but that that is. I think that it's I wouldn't be surprised if the Romans when they contemplated their lives, even though they were like, man, this sucks. They were probably thinking hell of a lot better than it was 100 years ago, man. Yeah. Do you think was it is it always every further generation rationalizes the inherent violence existing in their society by looking at the previous levels of violence and thinking, OK, that well, it's not as violent as it used to be. So we're doing pretty good. It may or may not be about violence. Maybe violence increases, but there's something else they are running away from. And so you feel like an increasing violence is worth it because at least we don't have to deal with that shit anymore. Right. So maybe it's just that you used to live in a swamp and you get beaten by mosquitoes and you die of malaria by the time you're 20 all the time. And so you're like, yeah, right now we have to kill a whole lot of people to keep the system going, but at least we're not fucking getting malaria and dying in the swamps. Right. So, you know, the specifics may change, but that's why to me is like the nostalgia for the past can only work so much because if something else come along and it proves more popular than whatever it was in the past, it means the past wasn't that hot because otherwise people are selfish in the best possible selfishness is not always a bad thing. They're selfish as in I want what's best for me. Right. And if the new way deliver something that the old way couldn't, people embrace it. If the new way sucks, people will stick to the old way. Right. So there is something to the fact that while there may be awesome stuff about the past, is not that people all flee from some heavenly perfect thing into some hellish demonic stuff because they are masochist is because they're getting something out of it that the old way wasn't given. Right. Yeah. I mean, I, you know, I my my assessment of things continues to be very optimistic. I think it's an incredible time to be alive. But then the more I do the podcast and try to look into things that I don't like normally thinking about like what Chris Ryan teaches, you do get to this point. Like, well, how much of that optimism is based on actual fact and how much of it is based on complete denial? Just just the distance of it all, you know? Sure. And then also the not to not that that should put you in a pessimistic state. I mean, let's face it. We're all gladiators. The arena is time. And the thing that we're battling is, well, you don't have to battle it, but many people are battling the inexorable progression of the aging process towards the complete disintegration of your physical form. You don't have to battle it. That depends anyway. But it's good to battle for a while, do, you know, exercise, eat good food, you know, like it is good. It is a noble fight. So we're all kind of in the in the in that situation, you know, but but I think that you can have that optimistic approach. You can have the gladiators attitude, right? There is something that we could even still extract from that attitude. It's just you shouldn't turn the sword on your brother who is in the same fight. We should all be turning our swords against the forces that are keeping us from achieving the potential that humans seem like we could achieve, like the species, the species could achieve. If we could harmonize the species somehow, and that's the dream of all hippies and fascists, but if we could harmonize the species to one truth based on reality, as it is right now, not based on sacrificing people for their life energy, but based on transforming our time into energy that can create unlimited resources so that we could somehow erode or disintegrate the current power structure, we would live in heaven. Absolutely. It would be as though we opened a portal into a paradise world and that paradise world came pouring into this world. Why isn't that possible? That's the fight, man. That's the fight. That's the fight. That's what we want to do. And this is, you know, you hear about the different classes of civilizations, you know, class A, class B, class C, class A civilization being a civilization where there's a unified front that has somehow managed to extract energy from the sun, no longer taking energy that's destroying the planet, but once you do that, and then the class B, I can't remember all the civilizations, basically, it's just varying methods of harnessing energy. We're not even class A yet. No, not even close. Many of us are, our minds are haunted with the ghosts of, we're haunted by all these old ideas. Like many of us right now are still every single day waking up and looking out at the world and thinking I am a sinner. I have failed my Lord. People think that. Right. I have failed my Lord. I have failed my Lord. My Lord is angry with me. My Lord is a jealous God who is angry with me. There are people who think that every day. Absolutely. There are varying different versions of this and there's people in parts of the world who think my God wants me to kill Jews. That's safe to say, right? Absolutely. That's not just government propaganda. That's how it is. And there's people who think my God wants me to kill gay people. And there's people who, and anyway, the end result of those kinds of people thinking like that is that we don't get to experience freedom from the gladiator pit in the way that we could, right? Absolutely. So what do you do? This is where Sam Harris has gotten to my fucking head because the question is what do you do? What does he say? Well, I don't know what is, hopefully some Sam Harris devotee can get him on the podcast for me because I would like to ask what the solution is because I keep thinking about his approximation, his approximation of things, which is, I will admit that I don't understand his complete approximation of things. Listen to his podcast a bit and read his book, but I combined the idea of like shit, man, we've got this, these fundamentalists, you know, fundamentalists, not just Muslims, we've got fundamentalists problems. Any kind. Yep. And these fundamentalists are getting to have access to the most advanced technology that has ever existed in the history of our species. That is a terrible tarot. This is the power line meeting the puddle. That's a bad situation. That's a very bad situation. Yes. So what the fuck do we do? Because at some point, an attitude of like, just let them do their thing. It doesn't work. No. The other attitude of like, well, I guess we got to start the camps up and put people who believe in this crazy shit into internment camps and either reprogram them or get them the fuck out of the casino. Right. Because they're going to destroy the planet. That doesn't work either. No, exactly. So what do we do? That's the big question. Like what the fuck do you do? How do you stop viral thought forms being transferred from one scared person to the next from completely in the long run? Not right now. Right now it's still kind of cute. Right now it's still kind of interesting. But how do you keep it from the in the long run completely, you know, destroying the species or will it? Or can you just let things run their course and everything will be fine? Absolutely not. No. That's never worked. I think to some degree what you have is that it's already a fight that has been going on and there have been huge victories in that department. Because if you look at the degree of rabid fundamentalism that existed in much of the world 300 years ago versus what exists today, today is like the bonsai version of the giant oak tree that it was 300 years ago. In that sense, there has been monstrous improvement in the regard of how many people are buying the idea that no, there's not a single truth that I own and I have to impose on everybody whether they like it or not. You know, that idea of this, at least in its most violent and blatant form of there's only room for my way is less and less popular. So in that sense, that's a fight that he's been won slowly, so it takes centuries and the other argument is, yeah, well, there are still a gazillion people suffering because it hasn't been extinguished quick. But it's not a fight that continues to be the same or is on the losing end. There has been tremendous improvement and now that doesn't mean shit if tomorrow some crazy fundamentalist start dropping 300 atomic bombs around the world. It doesn't matter that the tide of history is going to wipe him out. He gets to wipe out the game first. But you know, the reality is that they are losing power every day, completely and totally. It's just an issue of how dangerous our day while the game goes on. And that's why the problem is of not being able because, you know, the fact that, you know, when you bring up Isis is obviously why you do because they are such a stereotypical just bad shit. You know, most people you can see, I don't disagree with them, but there's 20 percent that I can see their point. You know, Isis is just bad shit, crazy shit. It's almost like when you talk about, you know, the Nazis, they become the stereotypical bad guy where it's like you can't say, well, but the Nazis had a couple of good ideas. No, it's like it's Nazis. They are 100 percent bad. It's sort of like the Isis game. With people like that, you wish that there was an alternative so that if it is something that needs to be stopped and it needs to be stopped. Because as you say, you know, you can't just let crazy sons of bitches, massacre people left and right in the name of their one God. But who's doing the stopping? Because the problem is, you know, one says, I mean, if somebody tomorrow told me there's a perfectly benign power that goes in and wipe out Isis of the first of the earth in violent fashion. I don't really have a moral problem with it. The moral problem kicks in when who's the one who's stepping in because there really are no good guys on the world stage. It's like what the U.S. government has done all these beautiful nice things in the Middle East all this time. You trust those guys. It's like, I mean, sure, I take them over Isis, but not by match. Right. So the problem becomes... Definitely take them over Isis. Yeah, of course. Of course. I mean, when I say by not by match... That's on a menu. You're ordering U.S. government. Yeah, totally. And that's what Sam Harris does. He's like, we are the good guys at the end of the game. You know, he's like, yeah, there are a couple of weird things about it, but ultimately we are the good guys fighting the good fight. And he's like, no, just because you are fighting the horrible bad guys, that doesn't make you the good guy person. Because if you are doing it for the same type of stuff that the U.S. government has been doing in the Middle East, you are obviously preferable to some crazed, rabid, fundamentalist, but you're still an asshole. And you are doing it for reasons that still fuck up the lives of millions of people. In a different way. In a different way. In a less... Well, again, it gets technical there. But obviously, you know, me today, you take me ISIS or the U.S. government. I take the U.S. government. But that doesn't mean I like them or I even trust them in any way, shape or form to do the right thing in the situation. Well, a lot of people say that ISIS is the dream of the military industrial complex. Because really, I mean, it's like communism, our old enemy, clearly didn't work, doesn't work, doesn't seem to work. So everyone hates it. No one really understands it that much now. And even like bringing it up now, people look at you like you're a fucking witch or something. It's so brainwashed into us that it's a terrible, awful system. Don't even investigate it, right? Yeah, nobody. So that's one. They won that one. And then Al Qaeda. That fizzled out quick. That fizzled out, man. We, you know, it seems like we kind of got them, I guess, somehow. Like whatever that narrative is that has been given to us, we got them. And here we have a thing that hopefully, if I'm a weapons manufacturer, my dream would be a world religion that had a population of folks who wanted to die and who wanted to fight. Of course. That's my dream come true. Yep. Because that's like an infinite, they're going to need a lot of bullets for that because especially if you've got a nice feedback loop there, which is that the more we kill them, the more there are other people in the area who've lost everything thanks to war become fanatical. Yep. And then they're going to want to die too. Yep. I've got one of those ant death spirals going on and I'm making bombs and I'm happy as I could be. Absolutely. So that is a dream come true for the military industrial complex, which is why sometimes I think that my focus on them and me even saying some of the things I just said accidentally fit into exactly what a war machine gearing up would want people to be saying. Yeah. And that's the problem with the two biggest forms of evil in the world. One is the fanatics who are ideological fanatics who want to impose their point of view on everyone else, whether they are religious or whether they were like the Nazis or communists or crazy Muslim fundamentalist or Christian. Doesn't matter. They are all the same people. They are all the ones who want to impose their viewpoint on everyone else. And that's one type of people. And then you got the other one that's not ideological that just greed. And in this case, when you have the military industrial complex versus religious fanatics, they are the two kinds of evil feeding off each other. Yes. Oh God. It's a two headed dog biting itself. Yep. Now, this is the problem. Because of all this bullshit, we've become so cynical that should an actual enemy emerge, our ability to combat that enemy is going to be diffused somewhat by the deep skepticism Americans have for the government right now. Of course. That's a real scary problem, isn't it? It is. Because, you know, after you have decades and decades of corruption and weird power games that are really in the name of the greed of a few guys, you can't trust the US government as the good guys, because they're not plain and simple. And so you do have something real nasty and evil that should be taken out. Who do you trust to do it? The US government? It's like you can't. And so you're kind of fucked because there is, you know, the way back in the day when people had the dream of the United Nations, kind of this impartial body that would just not have an ideological agenda would just stop threats to life on earth, whether you know through genocide, people carrying out genocide, they would just step in, stop those guys and that was it. There was no economic interest or nothing. Well, that was a sweet dream. Didn't quite pan out that way because that's not the way the United Nations has operated since they started. The idea was great. The reality is not. Well, I, you know, man, I'm, I feel like I, what I ended up doing here accidentally was creating a gloomy sort of approximation of things. And now I need you to work your magic and transform. Let's find our way out. Yeah. How do we get out of this? Let's claw our way out of the darkness. Let's claw our way out of the darkness. Let's claw our way out of me feeding in yet again. This is just hearing me app like this is just a sign. I'm on the internet too much because really doesn't it, regardless of what's going on out there, how much control do we really have over it? And if you find yourself worrying over fucking ISIS, are you, you're probably not taking vitamins. Right. Unless you live right there in the middle of the action, then which then you have a legitimate worry. Then yeah, you are so far removed where is not. You're probably not taking care of like shit in your life. You need to be taken care of, right? I'm not saying there's a direct correlation between not dealing or procrastinating with important things in your life and being obsessed with external enemies that have no real impact on you. But it does seem like an easier thing to deal with the threat of some looming, ominous, invisible thing you'll never encounter. Then to deal with your own mortality. Absolutely. Because the reality is you don't have control over ISIS the same way as you don't have control over a million other things. What is that you do have control? Your body, your attitude, sometimes the influence you can have on the people around you. The influence that you can have on the people around you, which by the way is now magnified monstrously thanks to the internet. So you can actually reach out and get in touch with way more people than was ever been possible in the past. That you do have power on. So as much as it's not as sexy because it's not this one big heroic battle where you win the fight and it's all over and we move on into a better world. The reality is that not environmentally, but from every other standpoint, things have actually gotten better over the last few hundred years. The fact that we don't burn witches at the stake. The fact that it is kind of frowned upon to be viciously and blatantly racist. The fact that certain things that have made us a bit more compassionate, a bit more empathic, a bit more willing to live with other people without chopping their head off. That's a win. And that's a win that has happened in a gradual, slow way, but it has happened. And so their stuff to be celebrated in what has already happened. And the name of the game is to continue doing it on a greater and greater scale to the point where nobody wants to join ISIS because it's a damn shit to do. It's like, really, I have, you know, it was like I was talking with Cenk Yuger, you know, the guy from the Young Turks. Yes. And his approach to, you know, crazy fundamentalist was, you know, bomb them with porn, bomb them with, you know, the kind of stuff that, you know, nobody did. Once they, once you hook with sex, pop culture, rock and things that it start automatically sucking the power away from that vibe that feed the rabid fundamentalist. Right. And that's probably a healthier way to go. Now, that does not mean that if somebody is not coming into your village tomorrow trying to raise it to the ground, you don't turn your AK and try to mow them down. But otherwise, since that's not what any of us sitting at this table are going to do tomorrow anyway, what the fuck is the point of fantasizing about it? Let's just worry about what we can do, which is that create trying to create a different consciousness first and foremost for ourselves for the media to love the ones in our life. And then as the circle got bigger and bigger, hopefully hope that the pebble spread as far as humanly possible. Yes. And I think, and I think that you can begin by combating whatever fundamentalism lives in the villages of your mind. Yeah. Find that place. Find the place where you are living according to ideologies that you have absorbed from terrified people, but that are completely unprovable, not valid, not verifiable. And yet you continue to live according to these ideas specifically that you're not that you're not that you can't have love. A lot of people live according to the ideology or that you're not beautiful, that you're not amazing. Like it sounds so cheesy, but it's so like so many people live according to these very grim assessments of their own subjective universe that aren't based on their actual subjectivity. Their actual subjective universe but are based on the way someone told them their universe was. These fucking fundamentalist shitheads, these poor bastards when they were very young, they had some snake human come to them and tell them about a universe that they don't even exist in. Oh, look at that. That's a devil. And look at that. That's a sign of hell. And look at that. That's an indication of why this group of people is evil. And look at that. There's another indication. All of it wrong. All of it unverifiable. All of it unprovable. In the same way, man, every single person carries around some version of that or some bully, some shithead, some bad boss, angry parent, said to them, oh, you are an idiot. You're just a piece of shit, aren't you? And then you carry that around with you. You worship those gods, right? Yep. So that's the idea. Mow down with a fucking machine gun of empiricism. Whatever particular thought patterns are keeping you from, well, I guess, from enjoying your life to the maximum or from spreading love as much as possible. And that's exactly the other one, is the level of kindness that you put out to other people. Because, you know, it's easy for I'm a judgmental motherfucker, so I see stuff I don't like and I'm super quick to point a finger. And sometimes it's healthy also to point out for shit for calling it for what it is. But at the same time, you don't help anybody by doing that. You know, it's like, yeah, okay, good job. You recognize that that's bad, but does it help to yell at somebody, fuck you, look at the bad thing you're doing? How can you figure out a way to kind of really team in a way in a place of health that's better for me and the other person? You know, how can so many of the arguments I see, and again, spending too much time on the Internet, you know, when you see people arguing about stuff. When I see vegans arguing against people with meat. When I see feminists arguing against guys who are pushing a more macho ideology. When I see liberals arguing against conservative religious people against that. To me, they all piss me off because I'm all like, you are right. And you are right to some degree, the proportions obviously change. Somebody may be very right and the other one a little, but it's never one hundred and zero. And instead, rather than a knowledge in hate, what is a healthy balance? What can we figure? What can we sit down here and figure out what the healthy balance is? People prefer yell at each other across ideological lines trying to my side need to win one at my side. Who the fuck said that's your side? Your side is my side is whatever is healthy. That's my side. Whatever the balance there between opposites is that's healthy. I like that one. And instead, people are married to ideology and that's source of the problem. It's like we need to start in ourselves to look at, am I saying this shit because I actually am trying to come up with the best possible solution? Or am I saying because it belongs to my preconceived notion of how it should be? That's it. It's like analyzing your intention anytime you're writing. When you're about to write that, you know, when you're about to write the Cunty Yelp review, when you're about to get into some kind of idiotic fight with somebody on Twitter, who it doesn't matter because you're not going to change anyone's opinion, all you're going to do is amplify people's perception of you as being angry. That's all that comes out of that. Whenever I see any Twitter war between people or whenever I've gotten in a Twitter war, it's not, no one wins that arm wrestling match. That sucks. All that, as they say, it's a bad look. And so I think maybe that's part of this potential revolution, is we've got to start the dumb, tiny, petty gladiator matches that are happening in the forums and message boards and comment sections on the Internet. Yep. And figure out ways to start joining forces even in the most making impossible alliances. Alliances that make no sense. That's the trick, man. Absolutely. I had one the other day, somebody on Twitter was saying they were clearly coming from a very religious standpoint, and they were like, you know, I like some of your stuff, but you're too much of an asshole when it comes to religion. You are too aggressive. You say all the bad stuff without pointing to alternatives. And while I disagree with that, because I do think that I put the accent on alternatives, I told him, you know what, to a point, right? Because I do tend to focus on the negative too much. Right. And it doesn't help. And yes, I can understand why I do it. You know, I can understand that I met with nasty shit that caused suffering in other human beings, and I want to call it for what it is. But you're right. Ultimately, I should spend more time focusing on the positive and trying to find a better alternative. And so we went at it like that, coming from a radically starting point. And by the end, it was a love fest. He was all like, oh, this was a great chat. I was like, oh, look at that. This is awesome. And he was nice. I was nice. You know, we disagreed, but we are trying to figure out a way to be human to each other. It doesn't always work. And when that's done publicly, like when two people notoriously opposed, publicly get into some form of debate that ends in a place where they both found it, found a truth they agree on, and their malice has been transformed into camaraderie. That's a miracle, man. That's incredible to watch. That's the ultimate impossible dream. Like imagine invading a country, and yet instead of there being violence, somehow both opposing armies merge and become one unified front. See, those kinds of novel miracles that I dream about, the potential for these things, the potential exists for that to happen. The potential exists for the people of the planet, despite all cultural paradigms, to discard any kind of ideology or national pride leading towards violence and destruction, and replace it with a sense of just being a unified front when it comes to caring for each other. There were famous stories about World War One when German troops and Allied troops decided not to shoot at each other, and they would just literally wander off like right around Christmas, meeting the middle where there are bodies everywhere from the previous days, and party it up for a couple of days and exchange gifts, and it was like, and it's trippies, like it was that triumph of being a human being who recognized that the other poor bastard maybe has kids and is nice to his wife and is whatever, and you don't really have anything personal against this guy, that doesn't happen often, the structure of the game makes sure that that will not happen, because you can't have fights, armies that say hello to each other and become friends, otherwise the people pulling the strings are not going to be too happy, but it can happen, and it does happen. Oh, God, see, that's the real war, that's the real victory. When the armies of the Earth stop fighting each other and start fighting whatever it is that's telling them to kill, see, that's where you enter into the age of Aquarius, brother. Let's smoke s'more weed! Shut the fuck up, hippie! It's never going to happen! Buy more bombs! Invest in Raytheon, hippie! Shut the fuck up! No fucking fundamentalist goddamn fascist shithead gives two green dollars about your goddamn happy idea that the armies are going to stop. No, it's not. That's like the dream that your cancer cells are going to make friends with your other cells. Yeah, but I guess what is that they care about? Do they want their grandkids to have a good place to live in and have clean water, and if you care about that, okay, forget all the other shit that we disagree on. Let's focus on that part. Let's focus on how we can make sure that that part happens, you know? There's not often much that you may, like, if I meet somebody who's, as I have met in multiple occasions, somebody who's like hardcore Nazi to this day, obviously our ideologies are not going to click very well. There are going to be like 99,000 sinks where we're going to have problems, so it becomes a challenge to figure out. Mostly a musical taste, right? Exactly, or architecture. But, you know, it's like, what can I find at a basic human level, something that you care about that I can have respect for, you know? The fact that you fucking care for your kid. Let's talk about your child. Forget about politics. Let's talk about your child for a little bit, you know? And try to slowly work it in a way where, look, I'm not the fucking enemy. I'm not here to try to take away what you really cherish deep at heart and what's most sacred to you. It's just that you go about it in a way that to me is suicidal, horrible and nasty. I go about it in another way, but again, let's forget about the lecture. And you think that, and they think you're as nasty as you think they are, probably. Of course, of course. So let's go back to square one. What is the one fucking thing we can agree on? You know, it's like, let's start with that, and then slowly figure out how we can do it in a way that if we don't agree, at least we don't have to pull a trigger on each other. That's it, man, and that's got to start now in your life at this moment with all adversaries, human and thought form. That process starts now. It doesn't start when, you know, I was talking to a friend of mine. He's like, yeah, I'm thinking about going to Africa to help to volunteer, which is a beautiful thing to do. But don't wait to get to fucking Africa to start doing good things for people. Start right now. The war starts now. And the war, the jihad, is a war not against each other. It's a war against the thought patterns that are making us go to war with each other. Absolutely. I love you, man. You're a wonderful human. It clearly has been too long because we have gone in at least ten directions that could have been a podcast, each one of them. Well, we got to do this more often. Absolutely. And I hope you'll let me be on your podcast soon. Let's do it right away. Beautiful. Thank you, sir. Howdy, Krista. Thanks for bearing with the air conditioning noise, friends.

Dirty Angel. Out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Hello, pals. You're listening to the Dugget Trussell Family Hour podcast, and today we have with us a technological druid. Joe Petucci has invented a device that allows you to listen to the singing of plants. But first, we're being forced by the FCC to play this disclaimer at the beginning of all future episodes of the DTFH. So here it is. The Dugget Trussell Family Hour podcast by continuing to listen to its leader allow this podcast to play hyperdimensional cookies inside another second shot. The Pumpkin Patch by T.S. Eliot.

Do I dare to shave my brown? Will you force me to kneel down? Will you paint your face as a pumpkin clown? Will you be the one to shave my brown? And when my brown is shaved will you say I shaved your patch today? I've seen the pumpkin clowns, seen them all. Seen them shaving brown and the kiosks of the malls. I do not think that they will shave my brown. In pumpkin patches we do slumber dressed as pumpkin clowns till human voices wake us and in our brown we drown.

I sit around and drink big mugs of heated pureed salmon chunks and write beautiful songs and I'm just going to share one with you. This song is called Let Us Bow to the One in the Woods. Let us suckle on your mind. Take a drink from its hundreds of nipples. Fill your goblet with its yellow wine. Yes, sure. I get it. We're all hyperdimensional rainbow creatures who are living in multiple places at once. But right now we're here on planet earth and what better way to express yourself to the entire globe than by creating a beautiful website. This episode of the DTFH has been brought to you by the good folks at Squarespace dot com. Squarespace is what I use to make Duncan trustle dot com, which has gotten 17 Grammy awards just to name a few. Go check it out over at Duncan trustle dot com and get ready to have your eyeballs come so hard. You will experience temporary enlightenment and very possibly come up with a plan to transform our planet into a harmonized hyper complex yet hyper harmonized utopia. It's that good a website and I made it with Squarespace dot com. They've got shopping cart functionality. They size to every phone and they have incredible customer service. Best of all, you can just try it out by going to Squarespace dot com and when you're ready to launch, go to Squarespace dot com forward slash Duncan and use offer code Duncan that Squarespace dot com forward slash Duncan and use offer code Duncan to get 10% off your first order of a website or a domain. It's time for you to take that parasitic procrastination entity that has lodged itself in your heart chakra out by its wriggling wart covered hell tail and send it plunging back into the icy pits of hell from which it came. And the best way to do that is to get going on that website you've been wanting to make. Thanks Squarespace. We're going to talk about plants today. We're going to talk about what it means to be able to communicate sentience. This podcast blew my mind. It got me back on stage. I'm doing standup again after a year. This is why a podcast. Joe is a very inspiring guy. This is not just going to be about music or technology. This thing gets deep. We're going to jump right into it. But first, some quick business. Do you hear it? The sound of the hummingbird wings, the conch shells blowing, the smacking sound of beautiful entities making love in some silky sea. Then what you're hearing is the DTFH over at Patreon. If you want to dive into the deepest waters of the DTFH, all you have to do is go to patreon.com. You'll get early access to episodes of the DTFH along with at least one extra hour long rambling tirade. It's all there for you at patreon.com. We also have a shop located at DuncanTrussell.com. Also, if you have the slightest interest of sitting with a group of people meditating the first Sunday of every month, we are doing a sit where we just meditate. It's free and Denver. I'm going to be at the Denver Comedy Works next year in January. That's on their website. Today's guest is a multimedia healer. He's some kind of technological healing druid who is the co-creator of this incredible technology that allows plants to sing. This conversation blew my mind. All the links you need to find Joe will be at DuncanTrussell.com. Without further ado, please welcome to the DTFH Joe Padatucci. Welcome to the DTFH. How cool to be in your presence. It's really exciting when people like you show up. You've got an incredible vibe and it's filling up the whole podcast studio. I just love that. It's the best when that happens. You have co-created, I guess you would say, one of the coolest bits of sound technology that I've ever come across. You can see I've got all the stuff here, the Moog, crazy modular synthesizers, but holy shit. You are part of Midi PlantWave, formerly known as Midi Sprout. This is a technology that lets plants that transforms electrical activity on the surface of the plant into midi, which then turns that into music. Essentially, you figure out a way to let plants sink. I thank you for the technology. I'm sure if the plants could thank you, they would also thank you because the implications of the technology to me and where it's going to go are mind-shattering. That's where I want to start off with my first question. Do you think that people are actually a little nervous about what this technology reveals in the sense that it's easier to live on the planet and be selfish if you can narrow what you consider to be life forms or sentience to a very small scope and that the more that scope expands, if you're a thing that eats, the more you have to deal with the fact that just by existing, you must consume things that might be a little bit more or a lot more intelligent than you think. Wow. Yeah, you went straight there. Right there. That's a great question. For me, I'm an omnivore, for instance. A lot of people, they come to me and they think that since I make plant music, you must be vegetarian. I'm kind of like, wait, how does that make sense? Because then I have vegans that come into my workshops and stuff and they're like, oh my god, this is a living sentient being. I don't know what I can eat anymore. I think people are ready to experience the fact that everything is conscious. I think that's important for us to understand and it's important for us to see ourselves as part of this chain of consciousness and whatever we're consuming to recognize it as sentient in some way and conscious. Even rocks, I mean, rocks are conscious. They're just on a slower time scale or just different things move at different speeds. That's the way I think of it. To me, it's like a calling to honor and see that everything that you are consuming is conscious, whether it's a plant or an animal, and take that time before you ingest it into your body to acknowledge it, thank it, and acknowledge all of the things that came into the formation of that food, whatever it is, down to the systems that were put in place for the distribution of it and the people that had the meal with their family before they went to work to build those systems and everything, and to really tune into that and honor that in your food, send love to those people too. Then when you're taking a plant into your body or when you're taking an animal into your body, it doesn't have to be about this thing. It doesn't have to be about I'm consuming this thing. It can be about we're co-creating an experience, so bacon or whatever, I don't know what trauma you experienced, but here I am, I love you, and you're here now, you're safe now. Come on in, let's do this together. What are your dreams? How do you want your energy to be expressed through this vessel that I've been living in for whatever? Okay, I've thought about this. I'm an omnivore as well, but I'm a guilty omnivore, so I'm the worst omnivore because if someone were murdering me, and this is how I think about it, I think about it like being kidnapped, and you're in a situation where your kidnapper is going to eat you, and the kidnapper is conveying to you not just that he's going to eat you or she's going to eat you, but they feel guilty about it. They're like, I'm worried, I don't want you to suffer, but I'm going to eat you, and so I think if I had to choose between the psychology of the being consuming me, I would want that psychology to be happy at least, at least you be fucking enjoying this shit if you're eating me. The whole guilty thing just is like, well, don't eat me then, if you feel bad about it. If you can't get over the guilt of the fact that you're a fucking cannibal who kidnapped me, I'm a dad, I have a family, and you're going to fucking eat me, then let me go. Don't do that, oh my god, what am I doing? That's the worst kind of monster, isn't it? Oh my god, oh my god. It's like, don't do it. So I've tried a variety of psychological techniques to get over the guilt that I feel in regards to the way I treat animals. I treat my dogs great, but I still feel guilty. I just think, oh my god, I should walk them more than I do or they feel bad. I just have this very guilty connection to nature in general, like a sense of I'm just hurting things in the world. And some of that comes from watching TV and the ice caps are melting. And knowing my brother worked at PETA at one point, I've seen the videos. I've watched Morrissey's meet his murder that he plays at his concerts and seen the suffering that these animals go through. But I still love eating me. I feel better when I eat me. I have more energy when I'm eating meat. But still, this thing that you're saying, and I've been around people who have this sort of prayer. Some of my friends, once we had chicken and they were telling, saying, here's where the chicken came from. This is the farm the chicken came from. And let's thank this being for allowing us to live from its life. But I always felt queasy about like Jesus Christ. And so anyway, this is where it goes back to my first question, which is that we, the more you widen the scope of your understanding of suffering, the more your heart breaks. And the more you realize that I have to hurt to live. I have to cause pain to live. And we've up until your invention. And you know, there's been the books. Oh, you sing to the plants. They grow better. You say positive people seem to generate different reactions in plants. Plants seem to know when other plants are being hurt. And the new research coming out about the way trees will send nutrients to trees that need it. Up until this stuff coming out and plant wave, midi sprout formally, allowing these plants to sing, there's always at least been the possibility of retreating into a vegetarian lifestyle, vegan lifestyle. You know what I mean? And then you won't be hurting living things anymore. And now your technology, and I imagine the technology that will be inspired by your technology is widening the scope. So now people like your vegan friends are faced with this predicament. And I know what you mean. I'm consuming you. It's over now. I'm taking you into me. Who's eating us by the way? I don't know. Who's stomach are we in? Well, the microbes and everything else, you know, like we're all, there's no, there's no top of the food chain. It's a circle. So like, as long as you kind of understand that and just understand that we're all just like a part of this cycle, then I don't know yet. I'm interested though, like in, in the, in, like, when you express this kind of guilt that you're feeling and I'm interested in hearing like, I don't think that's, that's not just like related to food for you or animals. Like I'm, I'm sure this is like, there's like, I would imagine there's like this, because what I heard was in order to be like, I have to like, like, I have to be creating suffering for other people. So what I'm hearing from you is like this relationship to suffering being something that's suffering is caused by something outside of you. So for you, do you think that suffering is coming from things outside of you or do you feel like suffering is something that you create through your own, through your own view of the world? Great question. Great question. Thanks. Yeah. Well, pain comes from outside of you. I think the way your mind organizes why the pain can cause the suffering. And I don't know, is it like, was it because I was raised Christian? And this Christian story is, starts off with people getting kicked out of a garden because they weren't good enough to be there. You know, they weren't trustworthy. They were, they were devious and they got kicked out of paradise. And then this is the like, ancient way of sort of trying to make sense of why animals fucking run away from us. Well, you know what I mean? Like nature recoils from humanity quite often. If you see, if you walk and walk through any park and mostly if, and generally if an animal does approach you, a quote wild animal, it means it's sick a lot of the times or it's been too domesticated to the point where it associates you as a food source or something like that. And so why, why is this that things are so terrified of humans? And also, if you look at the other side of that, when we see pictures of saints, quite often they are shown with like animal birds landing on their shoulders and they're shown with like, you know, Lord Jitanya Mahaprabhu or the Bhakti Yoga saint of the Hare Krishnas supposedly walking through the jungle. Lions were like dancing with him or tigers and animals were just coming out and dancing. And you know, Jesus riding the donkey and saying, even if you try to silence us, the rocks themselves will sing for me. And so that's the other side. Sort of to me, it's always been like, if you get your shit together, then nature itself will begin to respond to you in a non-terrified way. And you, in your, the bio that I read about when I was reading about you, you mentioned this, that rike healers, medicine work, people who work with plant medicines, when they come into a room where you have connected this technology to a plant, it suddenly changes, it spikes. It's like it's aware of them, seemingly confirming this crazy notion that the universe embraces you the moment that you have sort of, I don't know, become less of a herder, less of a ignorant person, less of a crusher. Yeah, so I, you know, I think of it as, I think of it more as just like resonance, right? And so I, you know, I think of everything as waves, right? So like, that's part of what plant wave is about. But it's about resonance. And there's like the universe, everything around us, all these things that are solid are, are like, you know, vibrations at a quantum level. So, and then the universe is all, it's like, all this stuff is like an expression of a vibration, right? And an expression of not only a vibration, but then like, the vibration of consciousness bouncing off of that vibration, and then like, kind of like, and that becoming form, right? So to me, there's this like idea of, it's not about like, doing things that are right, or wrong, or any of this like black and white stuff. It's like, it's as simple as like, being in acknowledgement that everything is a vibration, and being in acknowledgement of the subtlety of reality and the fluidity of it. And then in that way, you're like, loving reality, instead of like, judging it. And what I mean by that is like, cool, right? When we're judging reality, we're saying, that is a fact. That is a thing. This is a table. Yeah. You know, whereas like, if you're honoring the process of the happening of the universe and the vibration, you know that this is like, tabling, right? Or this is like, this is like, this is happening as a table right now, right? So I guess what I'm saying is like, the people that have the biggest effect, the people I've experienced having the biggest effect on plants are like, not adding resistance to like, the signal chain of the universe. They're like, allowing reality to flow, right? Yeah. So that's kind of how I think of it. Resistance to the signal chain of the universe. Wow, that's like the most beautiful update on the word sin that I've ever heard in my life. Yeah, that's a really good way of putting it. Yeah, I know, right? Because like, I mean, that's the thing is like, you know, I was raised like, Catholic, and you know, I was like, an altar boy and all that stuff. And I'm like, taught good and bad and taught like shame and pride and all this stuff. And it's like, cool, those are all like constructions that are made so that you can mass produce, like those are an attempt to like mass produce goodness, or like resonance with like the universe, but it fails because they're like these constructs. But if we were like able to learn how like the process of coming into resonance with like the happening of the universe or loving things as they are loving things as processes and allowing them to be processes. Yeah, it would just be, you know, if we're allowed to be our own, like if we're allowed to be our own gurus in that way, or to like see everything as an oracle, right, and see everything as a symbol that's there to serve us, then we're able to like integrate all the stuff we're experiencing in our life, all the stuff that like we want to explore, that we would be taught to feel shame over, like I'm attracted to that person. But oh, I can't, I can't approach her like, you know, I don't want to be too forward or whatever, you know, all these other things, but just like allow yourself to feel resistance to the freaking signal chain. And you just summed it all up. That's the big problem. And I mean, I'm like, this is, I love what you're saying, you're illuminating something for me, because I don't even know why I've been really like down on myself lately. And it's cool to hear because it's easy to forget. And it's like, to the point where as I'm like contemplating humanity itself. I mean, it's so easy to just slide into some kind of like to become at least mentally, like to suddenly have like the ethics system of some kind of like Marvel comic super villain, you know what I mean, where you're just like, if you, if you don't watch out and you forget about love and you forget about this, the heart and going into the heart and then encountering reality from that location, instead of the vortex of your thought patterns, it's really easy to get dark, at least for me. And one of the things I was thinking is like, holy shit, humans themselves, are we just static in some beautiful field of love? Is it that there is the signal, the signal chain, the signal, which I would like to ask you what you think the signal is and where do you think the signal is coming from? But and then there's this temporary, meaty, static formation that's, that's just interrupting the fucking signal flow. But is it, is it, is it stagnant? I mean, like we're changing all the time. Like we don't even have like the same cells we had seven years ago or whatever, right? Not stagnant, static. Static. Like just fuzz. Oh yeah. You know what I mean? Distortions of like, here is this, like, you know that, you know, like when you go down in your heart and there it is for a second, there's no you anymore. The heart doesn't, the heart is, is just what you're saying. The heart is just, it loves and it's broken and it's sad, but in the most beautiful way. It doesn't want to win arguments. It doesn't care about winning. It doesn't care about losing. It just loves and it loves. And then he was, wait, that's not my heart. That's everything. And then there's the mind. And that's what I'm talking about. It's like you're jamming that flow or something like that, getting in the way, blocking and, and, and, and the process, the gestalt, the fucking sum total of an entire planet of people doing that is that shit's on fire. The Amazon's burning. The ice caps are melting. And you look at it all and you think, holy fuck, was Charles Manson right? It's the best thing that could happen for humans to just vanish from the planet and the sweet, beautiful world is finally allowed to just flow into time without us digging up poison and spraying it into our fucking cars and into the atmosphere. This is how dark I get sometimes. Duncan, I just want to give you a hug. Yeah, man. I mean, yeah, I mean, it's like, I think it comes down to like, it's up to us to like, if, if the universe is like really as fluid as we're talking about, as vibrations, and it's, it's really up to us and like the direction of our thoughts and the direction of our intentions to create that, to create the reality. So do we want to like, focus on how everything's burning and everything is like a problem? And then like, try to solve that. I mean, like, how do you solve a problem? Like, how you like, yeah, like these big problems, like, are you going to engage the mind to solve the problem that we're burning our planet down? Or are you going to like, approach that from the heart? And if you're going to approach that from the heart, then you better believe that it's possible to shift all of this stuff through love. And if you don't, and if you're following instead, instead, like the thought pattern that everything is fucked, then like, you are looking in that direction. Like there's a reason like, when you're like climbing or climbing a ladder or whatever, they say like, don't look down. Yeah. You don't look down. So it's like, where are you going? So like, if those thoughts are like, going in a direction of like, the planet is burning and we're all fucked and this is where it's going, you can like, yeah, you can fucking look down and like, you can go on that trip and feel all that anxiety while you're climbing, or you can look where you're going and like be like, I'm going there. This is where I'm going. This is what we're doing. This is how I'm getting there. And if you fall, you fucking fall, but you don't have your whole experience of climbing clouded by all this anxiety and bullshit about, am I going to fall? Oh, I love it. That's so good. Don't look down. I'm looking down. Yeah, man. What's the point? It's like, you could take that, you know, Alex Honnold, the free climber you ever watched. Oh, I haven't seen that documentary yet. I've heard about it. It's amazing and amazing. But a day for Alex Honnold, the best day for Alex Honnold is literally the worst day for anybody who has like, fear of heights, right? Yeah. Yeah. It seems like as a species, we have a, we've just gone, we've been climbing up this temporal wall that is, as we climb, it seems to be technologically transforming and to mirror us or to match us in somewhere or another. And it feels that we are on a, we've gone really far up now. And further up we get the, well, just like when you're climbing, the greater the potential for catastrophe, the greater the potential for absolute annihilation. And simultaneously, how beautiful is the view and how incredible is the expanse of science and the expanse of cosmology and the expanse of inner cosmology that's happening right now, the psychedelic revolution. And this is the weird race that Terrence McKenna talked about, these two competing, there's these two, like the more we understand, the more technology we have, the more powerful we become, there is this weird sense of like, my God, it feels like we are teetering on the edge of whatever the opposite of an apocalypse is. And you know what I mean? I love that. I love that. And it's a beautiful thing. And yet, man, and yet the mind, the mind is like really, really, really, this is the age of the mind. I was thinking this is the age of the mind, and also this is like the glory days for pickpockets. Because people have gone into their phones, the phone is a reflection of the mental stream. Do you know what I'm saying? They've gone into their phones, they've gone into, it used to be you would go into your mind. You know, I don't know if anyone, I don't know, I want to get into your history, I'm rambling a little bit. But like, you know, people, people would be like, oh, you're up in your head. You seem like someone is up in your head. This was before the phone. Now we can watch people being in their heads, because you see them staring in their phones and you're like, oh, I know what you're doing, because this is what I fucking do. You're sticking your head in the digital sand to try to get out of this moment right now. It used to be you would go up in your thoughts and daydream to do that. Now you go and do the mind of the universe or the world or whatever and then stick, we stick our heads in there. And so this has produced a terrible situation for us, I think, which is that if everyone's staring at their phones, you really do become kind of vulnerable to like all kinds of manipulation, all kinds of hypnosis, all kinds of tricks. This technology is like literally manipulating people using BF Skinner's operant conditioning to make consumers to like just to gather data on what people want to consume, and to sort of move the needle in people's minds to point them in new things to consume. So anyway, well, I'll just add like, yeah, I know there's a lot of fear around like AI and especially like AI advertising and stuff like that. My view on it is that there's actually this like potential to like actually, so when we were talking about like the resistance in the signal chain, I feel like there's actually potential like with all this AI stuff to amplify the resonance in the signal chain. So the same way that like, you know, you're like, Oh, I heard about this new cool thing. And then I see an ad for it like 10 minutes later, and you're like, Oh, like, Oh, this is so evil. Like they're trying to sell me this thing. It's like, no, it's like, you just saw the thing like you just got a discount code for the thing that you already want. Yeah. And it's like, you know, in the future, it's going to be like, you know, the AI is going to know what your body needs for you to achieve your goals in your life. Like you're going to be able to like journal or whatever and collect like you're going to have your like your life mission is going to live in the cloud. And the universe of AI is going to like aid you in achieving your life mission through this like signal chain of resonance. I mean, that's the highest expression of what that could be. So that's so that's what I choose a focus on because that's me climbing the ladder towards that. And I hope that we'll all like go on that ladder instead of like looking down at all the other things that we could do that are all based on like the way we used to do things. Yes. And we used to do things based on like fear and we used to, I mean, we still do, but like that's like, we built a lot of things, a lot of safety mechanisms to get us to this point, right, based on fear. Yeah. And that's helped us to like land in this place now where it's like, okay, we're safe. We're like in this house. There used to be like coyotes or whatever bears running around. Sure. Yeah. And it's like, it's like, I want, by the way, I want those animals to exist here still, but not to eat your family, but but yeah, you know, we've created this like physical comfort. And now it's and then it's like, and now what? Yeah. And so to me, it's like, okay, we can't keep using the same processes, the same like ideas of fear to inspire the next move, like let's move to that next move from this inspiration from love, from like self actualization, from like allowing people to actually contribute their unique value to the planet and society. Okay. This brings me to a question that I was going to mention earlier. Let's just get into the terms. If we're talking about resistance to the signal flow, the signal chain of the universe, the signal flow, let's get into it, the signal flow itself. Okay. And because it seems to me like what you have done as you have figured out this crazy way to hang wind chimes in the signal flow, so to speak. Yeah. And it said, like, my god, I mean, you're like one of the, you're like the inventor of wind chimes. Well, it's a team, but yeah, your team. It's like these wind chimes, the first people, the first person is like, shit, what happens if I hang these clanking things and let the wind blow it? And then suddenly it's like, Oh my God, you gave the wind a voice. We've heard the wind in the trees. We've heard the wind as it rustles, but never the wind as it clanks the bones of our enemies. Wow. It's cool or whatever you're using as your term. So this is the signal flow, except here we're not talking about wind. Here we're talking about, what would you call it? The life force? Do you, what would you, sentience? Yeah. So I mean, what we're measuring is like this subtle variation in the connection between two points in a plant, right? So that connection is varying based on how much water there is between those two points. Okay. So that variation is happening in a plant because the plant is a self-regulating being. And so there's a change in amount of water between those two points. And we graph that as a wave and we translate that wave into pitch. And then of course we design instruments for those pitch messages to play. And then we also, this is like the really fun part. So there's that wave, depending on how quickly the wavelength changes, that's actually like a CC message that like changes, that like turns knobs. So like on a car stereo or in this case, it can change what instruments playing, it can change what effects are playing. So how does that like apply to like, how, you know, another way of thinking of that is like, if you're like calm and at rest, you know, you have like a slow wavelength, right? And then if like something stimulating happens, like your wavelength gets fast really fast. Yeah. So if something like that happens, you'll hear instrument changes. So to me, what I end up, what you end up hearing is kind of like the plant is, you know, responding to energy that we can and can't see. It's eating sunlight, basically. It's also eating light that's outside of our visible light spectrum. Right. And if you think about these like people that are into like energy healing and like you felt that before, you know, or you feel it like when somebody walks in the room and they have a presence and it's like, oh, like I feel really comfortable right now or like, oh, there's a bad vibe. Yeah. Well, it's funny because like in our society, in some ways, like if you start talking like that, they're like, oh, you're woo. Yep. You know, but like if you watch a football game and like somebody gets sacked, you hear the announcer is like, oh, the energy is totally changing. Or like, oh, yeah, like, you know, everything just changed. Like you can feel it, right? So we're like good at it on like a map on like a huge level. But like, but like when it comes to subtle stuff, we're not as good. And my theory on that is that it comes from like industrialization. And like we, we became like an industrialized society, we're building factories, everything was big, we had steam engines, like everything is brute force power power. And then we built whole school systems around like, hey, this is what you need to know to operate in the third dimensional world and build this stuff for us to like prop progress as a species. And then like, you have other people that are like, oh, I'm like, communicating with plants, I'm like, feeling these things from like plants or from animals. And I feel really intuitively connected. And they're like, you're fucking crazy. What's wrong with you? How are you going to contribute to society? Like we have to build shit, we're here to build buildings and shit. So like, that's why we have all these people that like feel like they're not seen or don't feel like they're, they're able to like contribute and they get like depressed and they don't understand, they put them on meds and this and that. And it's like, just give people like an outlet to be who they are. And like feel how they feel. And like, let's create from there. That's like the opportunity for species is to start incorporating these people into what we build. So that's kind of that's how I see it. Wow. Yeah. Like the industrialization element is, I was listening to a lecture, if you ever heard of Bob Thurman, no, he's a great Buddhist teacher. And he was talking about this like, you know, how for, if you want to get to the point where you can have an oil spill that, you know, damages an ecosystem for the next 200 years and take your check for 200 million dollars, into your bonus and put that into your account. So fucked up. And not feel insane. Then you gotta make sure that you don't believe that shits anything more than like gravel. But then what happens when you die? Those people on their deathbed, like when they realize that like all the stuff that they've been holding on to their life is about to go? Like, I don't know, I always think about this, like our whole lives are like preparing for death. You know, so it's like our whole lives are like, when I, when I pass, am I going to pass in like resistance to like the happening of the passing? Or am I going to like pass in love and allow that to happen? Right. And like, I would think for somebody that's like that invested in like the material world just being about like money and like building stuff that that would just be really, I mean, like they seem comfortable and stuff like that. But I would imagine there's like an anxiety and like a loneliness in it. And it too, you know, it's like, you know, the one of the Buddhist houses, the hell of hungry ghosts and miserable creatures that can some versions of it, they can manifest anything they want to eat. Yeah, but their necks are really long. So they can't really get it in their stomachs. But it's sort of like, to get back to your signal flow idea, plants eating photons, this possibility of there being like, not just wavelengths that we can't see, but some other thing, dark matter is what they call it. But one of the words is dark matter, where some people say just a way of saying you don't understand or whatever, but some energy field, some, some somethingness that we might be able to eat in the way plants eat photons. And we might be eating it all the fucking time. And we're not tarianism is the answer, man. There it is. Which is, you know, you know, the idea we can and we can eat, eat light or eat this energy. But, you know, wake up in the morning. I've been trying to get up at five a.m. for you, man. Oh, it's not easy, but it's great. And then, and, but, you know, because five a.m. four a.m. five a.m. territory, that is fresh product. That's this, the earth is like sending out some kind of higher energy or something. And that's when I'm best at writing. That's when I'm best at making music. That's when I'm best at thinking. And so, and I've, I've heard this for ever, you know, the Hare Krishna, as they get up at four a.m. Yeah, they actually like, pray to Tulsi play. You see, you live in Venice, you should go at four a.m. to the Culver City, Hare Krishna. Oh, yeah, I've been there to eat. They have an amazing buffet there. Go for their morning longalarti and watches these like they celebrate every day coming in and blow conch shells. Whoa, this is how to do it if you're going to do it. Oh, yeah. It's beautiful. But this signal flow, it, to me, it is what we are. And so, if you were, again, but it's we're in the material universe right now, so it's so easy to get confused. I get confused all the time and start thinking, oh, I'm, you know, I'm this body. I'm this, I'm the stuff that I own. That's who I must be, right? Because this, this is like, and so we all hang shit on our walls and we try to get stuff. And we organize it in certain ways. And some people are really serious about it. Some people are sort of, I don't know, I don't care what's around. But this is what we do. And but in the more you get caught up in that hypnotic, the hypnotic quality of the material universe, the more you, the more miserable you become, it's, it's like, I guess it's like, when you take a plant and put it in the shade, the poor thing, they can't get those photons. And so it just slowly withers. Yeah, but you ever notice what it does? It doesn't like, it's like the beautiful thing about the plant is that it's like, it doesn't like, it doesn't necessarily like shrink. It kind of just like, it's not like, yo, fuck you, you put me in a dark place. I'm going to have like, build up all this resistance to you. I'll die. I'll show you like, I'll show you, you guys. The plant just like, wherever you put it, you put it in a dark room. No light. It's like a little bit of light creeping up from under a door across the room. plants just going to grow towards the light. That's what it's going to do. That's what, that's what it's here to do. And that's like, what we're here to do, right? Yeah. Like it's the same thing. It's like, just like grow. You just like, just like, be like a plant grow towards the light. Keep going, keep ground and grow towards the light. Ground and grow towards the light. This is where, when did, when did this start for you? This feels like you, to me, you seem like somewhat realized, like you seem like you've had some kind of true epiphanous moment, like the one of the big moments or something. When did that happen? Dude, I've had a few of them, man. I've had like, you know, I've been blessed to have like awesome parents that also like had like, but I also had like a troubled childhood with it too. Cause like, um, yeah, my dad's like super like cool into jazz stuff and everything. My mom's like, my mom was like in the like theater scene and stuff in New York and grew up in the woods. And then we like, my dad was like, Oh, we're going to take this job in Philadelphia. We're going to move there. And then my mom's like losing, she lost all of her, like, all of her like artistic connections. And we're going to this like really blue collar city where it's a lot more rough. And there isn't as much of a community. So I like grew up with like seeing my mom go through like multiple nervous breakdowns and like all this stuff. And it's really intense. Did your parents stay together? My parents are still together. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it's like, yeah. And like I, there's a, you know, a whole lifetime of like healing and realizing like what happened in that. And I don't think actually my parents, I haven't even talked, we haven't even like had a real conversation about that. And that happened like almost like 35 years ago or something like this. But I learned so much from it because I saw my mom, I saw what, well, I learned it later because I have had a good friend who I was in bands with and he kind of, he decided that he was going to kind of pursue a more conventional dream and stopped interacting as much in the music scene. And then when that conventional dream dissolved, he ended his life. And so I saw from that like, oh, that's what happens when you're like a really creative person and you abandon it. And then the other thing that you pursued dissolves like, yeah, you go crazy. So like I, that happened, that friend passed when I was like maybe 28. And that's when I realized why my mom had all those nervous breakdowns. And I was like, was that your first real heartbreak? What are the first like your friend passed? Like first time, like someone I was close with died. Yeah. Yeah, that was probably it. Yeah. And yeah, and the lesson I got there was like, how important it is to honor my creativity. So I like took my mom out to like, run to like the next week. And I was like, mom, like, I want to hear like, I was like, you know, I told her what happened. And I was like, I was like, able to say like, Oh, wow, like it was probably really hard for you to make that move from New York to Philadelphia. Like when you moved to New York at like 19 to be in theater, you know, and, and it was really hard for my dad probably to be like, Oh my God, I'm, I thought I married this awesome, amazing woman. And now she's a clinically crazy person, right? I need to protect my son. So there's like all this, all these like aspects that probably like happened in there. But yeah, like what I learned was like, honor the creativity and like make that primary. So you know, I had a real job and stuff for a while. That allowed me to like start my business. What was that? What's that? What was your real job? I worked in marketing at United Way. Cool. And I actually worked there for like 13 years. Wow, suit. Did you ever wear a suit to work? Was it that kind of job? Sometimes I would wear like a tie. I was like the weird artist dude that they were just like, you know, I started there as a temp. It was like ridiculous. Like the whole like, I went to a temp agency. I found out like my friends are like, yeah, we were all like musicians and stuff. And my friend like had a temp job that was like paying like 28 grand a year. And I was like 24. I was like, whoa, you mean you can like sit in an office and like just like get like 28 grand and then you can like play music. Like you get home at like six and then play music until like 1am and then go to work the next day. I was like, that's the shit. I can like plan my tours for my band on Myspace like while I'm at work and like, it's like hell yeah. So yeah, I just kind of did that for a bit and then kind of bounced around departments and learned a lot. You were making music the whole time and you were supporting yourself and you were like, that's beautiful. Yeah, it was great. That is the, you know, I don't want to say that everyone needs some experience with what that is, but it's like that love of making music carries you through and that love of making music and your creativity is you're saying. Yeah, it feels like in your story, this has been like the lighthouse in your heart that's absolutely illuminating everything. Yeah, I come from like a long line of piano teachers on my mom's side. Like my great-grandmother who lived to like 108 years old, she like taught piano into her like early 90s and like my grandmother, I think it do her 70s. 108. 108, dude. Sacred numbers too. Yeah, that's exactly right. Yeah, my mom's gonna live to like 140. She might outlive me, who the heck knows. But yeah, and there was always like a lot of pressure in my family that I play music. So like my parents are always trying to teach me piano. They're like trying to, you know, they're like, oh, what instruments do you want to play? I didn't really care. I just want to play. I want to run around and they're like, oh, look at that kid with a violin. Do you want to play violin? It's like, yeah, I want to play violin, you know, whatever. You know, and then I'm like learning Suzuki violin or whatever, like Charlie Brown and Snoopy and doing that whole thing. And dude, I was like going crazy. So I would like, I would like literally like accidentally drop the bow and it would like snap in half. And I probably went through like seven bows or something. And finally, my parents are just like, can't afford this or like, this is just, you know, and so it was just not my thing. And like, I've never actually been a very good musician. I've been, I'm good at like producing and I'm good at like conceptualizing and like creating and like writing, but I'm not like, you know, when people say you hear the universe expressing itself through this person when they're playing guitar, right? You just like hear it like flowing through them through their fingers was never that guy. So for me, like plant music and like kind of the creation of music in that way was like a natural progression for me. And it came by through a lot of different routes. But you know, I was started, you know, I was producing music and then I started to like do field recordings and then find like the melody in the wind and then like write music to that melody and then like allow it to form. And then, and then, you know, I started a record label data garden to like release my music and then like my business partner in data garden at the time, Alex was really into plant consciousness stuff. And then I was really into generative music. And then we had a friend who like built cool shit. And then so that together, the three of us like made an art installation where we like started making plant music. And then the design process, like originally my friend, Alex, who is co founder and whose idea it was to actually start like having plants control synthesizers, Alex like design these phrases, he like played these phrases. And he cut them up. And then I was going to figure out how to make the MIDI select the phrase. But then when I saw the data that Sam was able to get from the what became the MIDI sprout and what became plant wave, when I saw the resolution of the data, I was like, No, this plant is not playing phrases that are pre recorded by a human. This plant is playing every single fucking note. Yeah, cool. That's what's happening. Because then you then we're getting like a real time stream. And yeah. And so for me, like that, you know, I think what are like the biggest things that have like transformed my life like Carl Sagan's cosmos. Sure. Right. Like the opening scene, like Adams is massive suns, like universe is smaller than Adam, like that the like meta view of the universe, holographic theory. So this idea that like everything is kind of like a hologram, this is like the implicate order of the universe is a wave. Yeah, right. And then like everything else is like, yeah, this like expression of these resistances, right? So, you know, I was like reading that I was reading holographic universe when we were making plant music. And I didn't realize at all, I didn't realize what the tool is that we were building. I just thought it was like a novel way of creating music. And then yeah, and then we like have an installation and we have four plants in a room and each plant is playing a different instrument. And I'm just sitting there like reading like holographic universe and like reading about like the waves and all this stuff, right? So fucking cool. And like somebody like all the sudden I just noticed that, you know, the plant across the room is playing some sin. The pattern just completely changed. The pattern changed. The effects changed. It's clearly like a huge change in the way that's coming from that plant. What the hell is going on over there? So I look over there, there's a person standing there and they're not touching the plant. They're just like near it. I'm like, what's going on over there? So get up and I walk over the person and I'm like, all right, this might sound crazy, but I design these sounds and like they change based on this wave thing. And it's very clear from the data that when you walked into the room, the plant just completely changed. And not only did that plant change, but the other three plants in the room changed after that plant change. So it was like, it was like something was emanating from there. The person's like, I just broke up with this plant. We were dating. I didn't know she's going to be here. Exactly. Well, yeah, the answer like this happened about four times. Actually five, but the four, well, all right. So the first, well, yeah, it happened like four times. And each time I would bring this up, the person would just say like, oh, yeah, that makes total sense. And I'm like, oh, all right, what do you mean that makes total sense? And they'd say like, oh, yeah, I'm an energy healer or I'm a Reiki master or I'm a botanist. I'm a florist. So these are the people that are like totally in tune with plants. They get that there is this subtle energetic exchange between all beings and they're not adding resistance to the signal chain. That's how I see it. Right. So like, to me, that was between reading holographic universe and having that experience at the same time, I was like, oh my God, like something like this is this is actually happening. Like this is a way of monitoring these like subtle energetic exchanges. It's like, it sounds like almost like humanity is afflicted with some kind of weird kind of deafness or a sort of, I don't know, blindness or a limitation resulting from many of us, a belief that that shit's not real anyway, it's fantasy, it's make believe and it's because of that, we are completely limiting ourselves to this amazing dataset and all the possibilities we haven't even quite figured out yet, at least in this culture, I mean, in the shamanic culture, this is old news and the oldest news maybe. I can remember once someone was telling me that Shaman was telling him that the trees think humans are ridiculous because they don't, you know, they don't see them. They don't talk to them in the mind, but yet humans think they're really advanced. But the monkeys talk to the trees and know the trees are alive. But for some reason, humans are blind to this, man. To the point where even talking about what we're talking about right now, it's like people are like, shut the fuck up, hippie. It's literally stigmatized even this level of conversation, this type of conversation. It's like, go back to fucking Sedona, please. Oh, the planets weeping. Are they crying? Are you going to go bring a tissue to the Amazon? It's just wood, motherfucker. But this is one thing that comes to mind. You know, one of the possibilities here, which is really so many possibilities in this. And one of the possibilities with this technology is you could theoretically wire an acre of plant life to play music, have that music somehow, not just like amplified, but then organized, and then have that uploaded to SoundCloud, Spotify, and then monetize the music of that patch of land to support protecting that patch of land. Totally. That's a great idea. We can add that to the plant way of app in the future. That sounds cool. I like that. That's cool. You got it. You turned forest into bands. Yeah, that's a great idea. But this is like, and I've heard some kind of shit about like this being a possibility, the blockchain is that forests and bits of nature could buy themselves and somehow support themselves from the interest in the blockchain and then like pay for, to be private property that owns itself, making it off limits for people to harvest the trees. But there is the potential in this, you know, the more a thing can talk, the more rights it has, you know, the more it isn't just some natural material for us to chop down. But then also, what are you going to do when the fucking corn starts screaming? What are you going to do when the broccoli starts screaming? What are we going to do when our goddamn kale is like, you know, starts playing sad music because it's about to get plucked out of the ground. I'm not saying that maybe that wouldn't happen. Maybe it would be happy. Well, I always design it to be like kind of harmonious and chill. Well, this is an interesting ethical, let's go there because it's like, if you are, in other words, like one of my, there's a video game, Borderlands. They just released Borderlands 3. It was one of my favorite video games, but one of the little characters in there is a little robot. And one of the just, he says all kinds of funny shit, but one of the really poignant things he says is like, they program because it's to sound upbeat. I'm actually severely depressed. Yeah, that's great. I love it. Similarly, you know, it seems like the more refined your technology becomes and the more you are able to like identify like, okay, here's what plants tend to do when they've been hurt. Here's what plants tend to do when they're in stressful situations and then convert that specific formation into sadder music. You really could, at the very least, produce a way for people who are trying to keep plants happy to know their plants aren't doing okay. Yeah, it's challenging because like the way that the technology works is that, I mean, it would be a different vibration if you just like stuck the probes on different parts of the plant, it would be like a complete, it's a completely different signal. So the way, so it, the technology as it exists now doesn't really have the ability to tell you like, if this is a happy plant or a sad plant, it can tell you like a little bit if there's like not a lot of water content, I can like tell you a story about that later too. But yeah, so for me, so why do I design it to be like harmonious? The reason is, is because this is about creating an experience for people to connect to nature. Yes. And so the best way to experience plant music is by experiencing it by like experience it over a longer period of time. Because it's not about like, is it sick or is it healthy? Or is it a mango tree or an oak tree and can I tell by the signature? It's not as much about that as it is about, this is how this plant sounds right now. I'm going to tune into how this plant's sounding right now. And now I'm going to notice, is there a shift when there is a shift? If there's a big shift, or does it stop? Did something happen? And then you can use that as a prompt to start to ask the questions. What happened? Somebody walk into the room, is a plant responding to something? What was I thinking? How am I feeling? Like what's going on energetically? It's like outside of like what we normally think as our reality. Like that's, it's a way, it's a prompt for us to tune into ourselves more and to tune into this relationship we have with nature and like to dissolve this like separation and to just breathe and be an experience. Wow, man. Is it an oracle? Have you tried to do it? Oh hell yeah, dude. So have you tried to like, to, to populate like itching sets or? Oh dude, that's such a great question. We were playing with that. I think John, my business partner, he was, he was deep into itching when we actually started launching Midi Sprout. And yeah, so as an oracle, like, so for instance, when we were putting together Midi Sprout and we were like brainstorming on, on like how we were going to launch it and stuff. This is like, like whatever, like three or four years ago. We would, we would literally have a plant in the room, playing a sound set that I designed, and it had these like areas in the CC data, like at the very top end of the CC and the very bottom end of the CC. So they would sound like really blissful. So I would say like from CC, like 124 to 127 kick on a resonator reverb and like, like a redux or whatever. So and then it like, it's a signal chain that just like makes it sound super blissed out. So you would hear when there's a quick spike in the wave. Yes. So you would hear that. And so John and I would sit there and we would talk about like what we wanted to do and like ideas that we had. And when one of us expressed an idea with like a lot of excitement, and we heard the plant hit that resonator, we were like, write that shit down. Yeah. So like, you know, was the plant responding to us or not? Like, I don't know. But yeah, like it served our lives in like allowing us to like move forward with greater clarity because we felt like our ideas were in resonance either with the plant or the plant picked up the vibration of our excitement or the light that's coming off of our hearts when we're like lit up with joy, you know, whatever it was. But we use that as kind of like an oracle. And also, I mean, what you know, implicit in what you're saying is the assumption the ideas are coming from your head. Yeah, that's great. Yeah, exactly. This is weird. You know, we're still in the world of imagining like all of our thoughts and ideas that have their origination in our nervous system or in our brains or whatever. And sometimes I think, shit, maybe we're all just like sections of rivers. And our ideas are just schools of like sentient mimetic fish swimming through consciousness that lands in our brain sometimes. And we catch them, you know, conduits, man. It's just flowing, you know, and like, yeah, the more you open yourself up to the flow, the more that stuff can just like come through you. And well, like right now, for example, this conversation is making me realize this entire time I've been ignoring this wonderful plant. What was it called that you brought? Oh, it's called a diffinbacchia. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah, diffinbacchia. So I've been ignoring this beautiful diffinbacchia that's been so patiently sitting here. Yeah. And in the moment you shift your awareness of the form to include the plant. Oh, yeah. Feel the difference right away. Oh, yeah, I feel that. It's instant change. It's like now there's another thing in the room that this entire time we've been kind of ignoring. And then it does form at least some kind of at least a subjective circuit, I guess you could say, like, you know, there's a thing changes, it lightens things up. Things don't like to be ignored. You know, it's general, I mean, it generally things like at least to know that you know they're there. You know, some people are like dogs just don't like me. And it's like, well, that's because you don't think they're real. And they can tell dangerous to be around a thing that can't see you bottom line like if you want to be seen, because at least the thing won't step on you. You know, it's probably a leaf when a plant feels your awareness fall upon it in some kind of receptive way. It's cool, man. This technology is like blowing my mind. I'm so excited to experiment with specifically the, what would you say, oracular potentiality. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah. That's how I could say it. Yeah, because it's like, that's the, well, we can harvest wind power. Yeah, we can harvest sunlight. Uh huh. If there were some other signal flow that was the place that thoughts originate from and that signal flow was not limited to human biology, then there is this potential to like actually convert this stuff into an AI and into like an actual intelligence, which is I've always thought the path, everyone's pathway to an AI. And again, technology people out there forgive me. I don't know. And not any AI person, tech person, they're like, don't worry, you're, we're in no danger of the machines waking up anytime soon. But that's going along one specific path towards this super intelligence or computer intelligence, which is to code it, program it, let it learn. At some point it wakes up. The other path is more like what you're doing, which is to stick these kinds of technological windmills in the life flow itself and then figure out if this wind or whatever you want to call it, if it can actually maybe, if given the right set of symbols, if given the right structure, if it can begin to communicate in the same way, because I read one in what you were writing, channelers plants react differently to channelers plants. And when I've been around channelers, they are just a vessel and they'll say it. But this thing coming through them is alive. And it's like, oh, fuck, the bio computer is picking up this data set and converting it into human language. But it's flowing through them. It isn't them. So that's what, to me, the future of plant wave could be. I think that, I think still a big part of what's important in it is actual ownership of the experience of the user. So I don't know that we could create the AI right now that would do exactly what you say, because I feel like a big part of it is the self awareness of the user. I think that like a part of the plant wave device being an oracular tool is it requires that the user bring a certain consciousness to the experience. And then that awareness and direction of bringing that kind of consciousness to the experience actually like awakens just like more consciousness and more like seeing the Oracle and everything. So this experience is less about AI and prescriptive. This means this and this means that. It's like tune in, listen, is there a change? How are you feeling? And then you can use that in your life too. You're walking down the street, you notice a butterfly. What are you thinking about at that time? How can that whatever you're seeing be a symbol for you? You've seen people that like some people have an Instagram where they just take pictures of dog shit and trash and whatever. And that's what they're choosing to look at. And I don't know, you ever see just like I don't know, I saw there was a guy and he was like, I met this guy and I was like, I checked out his Instagram. It was like, he took a photo of like a bottle of piss he found on like a trail. And it was just like, you know, and that was like, that's it. That's today. That's today. That's why you took that all in life. That's what I'm putting out there in the universe, bottle of piss, you know? And then you have other people that are like, oh, look at that cloud. Like, look at these dreams. Like, look at this. And I mean, I'm not trying to like gloss over reality, but, but at the same time, like we have a choice over like, how we see everything we experience and everything we interact with as a symbol that's here to serve us in this moment and be like an oracle for us. So like, that's to me, to me, that's what plant wave helps to cultivate in people is like this practice of listening and like finding like the highest good and the highest message for you in that moment. I love it. Do you think this is why you're such a good listener? Like when I'm sitting with you, I can tell you really listen. Oh, right on. Yeah. Because you're training on plants. You're like teaching yourself how to listen to, to things that most people don't even think and talk. Yeah. Um, is this, do you think this is like improved your openness to hearing? Oh, man. I mean, I wouldn't put it past it. I mean, like for me, I've always, you know, like this kind of came from this practice of making like field recordings and always listening. But at the same time, like when we're talking about the first installation where, where I had this kind of stuff up and the people that it introduced me to, I mean, the plants introduced me to the healers and the healers introduced me to the fact that I was actually leading meditations already that I was already meditating. And then they showed me, Hey, there are other ways to meditate. There are other ways to cultivate your energy to tune into subtle vibrational fields. Right. And then so I started to learn like Reiki and breath work and meditation and, and I started working, I worked with Pauline Oliveros, Deep Listening. She's like, what's that? She passed recently. She, she's like a pioneer of, she's like an electronic music pioneer from like, like she was doing stuff at Mills, like back in like the, the 60s, like experimental circuitry, weird noise stuff. And she, yeah, I would really recommend checking out this book called, I think it's just called Deep Listening by Pauline Oliveros. What's it called? Deep Listening. What was that? Deep Listening. What? Yeah. Dad joke. I'm allowed now. You're doing it. You're doing it. Yeah. So, and it's, it's, it's a series, it's like a bunch of different like guided meditations on listening. So some of them are like, okay, like listen to, listen to the sound that's like closest to your ear. And now listen, listen like three inches from your ear. And now listen like to the edge of the room. Whoa. Right. And now listen outside of the space. And like only focus there, just there. Right. And now listen over the hill. Right. And then you can kind of keep going, you know, but it's like cultivating this, this awareness. And it's just like, if you think of it as, if you think of it as like a radio band, right? Distance in listening distance, being every, every foot, every millimeter, being like a different band on the, on the, on the channel. Right. So you're cultivating this awareness of like, of this like radio dial and distance and like perception, right? Whoa. So like, yeah. So she, she is just like a genius. And so I work with her and she also, her, her partner is named Ioni. And she, she taught this whole aspect of listening in dreams, like what sounds you hear in dreams and like cultivating like your whole dream world. And then Eloise is another one she taught about at her book is called the deeply, deeply listening body. And it's all about like cultivating awareness and listening in the body. Like, where are you feeling that? Like all that kind of stuff and like Qigong and all this stuff. So, so yeah, that kind of like, so yeah, I mean, the plants introduced me to the healers and then the healers taught me how to feel. And then like through feeling, I was able to like receive my own wisdom from plants or through breath. Yeah. Like you have to learn like that. I don't think anyone, I've never like, I'm not, people don't ever think like you need to learn how to feel. Yeah. They're like, Oh, I got to stop feeling, right? Yeah. I'm not supposed to feel that. That's a bad feeling. That's right. And just be like, dude, I feel this. This is where I am right now. And I'm just like allowing myself to feel that it's fucking hilarious. I'm watching this monkey feel this thing and freak out and try to close off. That's right. You're talking, you're talking about me, right? That's all of us, right? You know, but if you view it from like that, from that like outside perspective, I mean, and this is also, you know, this is where like psychedelics come in because like, I wasn't, you know, I'm not like a person that like smoked weed until I was like 28. And even then it was like once every month or something. But I did have a friend that kind of like led me in a like a DMT ceremony and just like meditated and held space for me during a DMT that he made or she made, whoever non existent human made up story helped promote this. Exactly. Yeah. Oh yeah. No, but so I remember like I distinctly remember having this experience of like the first time I smoked it, it was like, you know, I got like this like red grid around me. And I was like, oh, shit, that's like that grid you see in like Tron or whatever. And I was like, whoa, that's crazy. And then like, what do you mean a red grid? You're talking about that like, it's like a almost like a translucent fog like thing or you mean you saw like actual lines? Yeah, it was like lines. It was kind of like, yeah, it was kind of like lines, but it was like, it was it was a form and it was like it looked like it was like an extension of my body or like when you see like photos of auras, like how it's kind of the human form, but it's like bigger, you know, and I saw that. And then I then all of a sudden I like popped out of the top of it, it was like, like you popped like a open like a bottle of tea or whatever iced tea popped out of the top of it. And they were just like, the it was like an endless field of these two grids like going into infinity. And then I floated out of all of it. And I floated kind of around it and I saw that this this grid was actually like this kind of torsion field. It was a torus that was also kind of twisted. It was this like torsion field that was like twisted. And it was like beating. And I was like, whoa, I was like, that's my heart. Whoa, that's me. That's me. And I'm floating away looking at it like that's me. And then there's like a deeper awareness that it was observing me observing me. And it was kind of like, oh, you thinking that you're you. Yeah, actually, we're here. You know, I was like, this other space like that was like, it was this awareness of the awareness. And that's kind of how I that's like, why I'm saying like, you know, the seeing the monkey mind or seeing the monkey react to things like being in that position helped me to see how hilarious it is to like, like respond in fear, like to close up or get mad or like get stressed and like stuff like that. That is one of the great, great realizations. If you get lucky enough through whatever psychedelics, sometimes some people I have had the experience through psychedelics, through meditation, through just waking up in the morning before you remember you have a life and you remember your whole story and you like start processing that you're and you're just everything's great. There's no story. It reminds me of a Jack cornfield story I heard him say about this monk is having all these like incredible experiences from meditating, you know, communicating with deities and manifesting certain, I don't know, cities, you know, like the classics, you know, levitation, walking through walls, translocation. And so he goes to, there's some master living out in the woods and he goes very excited. He goes to tell him all this that was happening to him. He's like, I'm doing this. I'm seeing this. And the master says, well, you've missed the point here because it's not what's happening to you. It's who is it happening to you need to be paying attention to. And this, since I've been sitting with you and having this conversation, I have had the experience of my field of awareness expanding out. That's the effect you have on people, I think. And the, that's a relief. Isn't it? Cause we're so compressed, man. It's like it's a, it's a, many of us, maybe not you are just really steep in our bodies. I get there deep and deep in it. And the moment you just have this sense of like, fuck for a second, I'm letting the plant be there. Oh, the listening exercise of like, well, I've never tried to listen past a hill. Yeah. The, any of these things instantly seem to like somewhat created a decompression. Yeah. Oh, and, and, and a sort of a relief from a perceived limitation that isn't even real. Is it? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, all the information is there. It's all there. It's like, it's about like, what are we prioritizing and like, how are we building? Like from where are we building? It's not even about what we're building from where and in what direction are we building and creating? I'll tell you what direction I'm going in now. Weaponizing plants. Oh man. If we can figure out. Hey, look at this. Look up this lot. We're got, we're climbing. We got this man. We got this. I'm climbing into a weaponized Amazon, baby. We got to give them the ability to fit themselves with you. This is like, this is, I'm sorry, my mind works like this. No, it's, no, it's why you're funny. Thanks. As we're having this conversation, I'm thinking of like weapons manufacturer, just somehow stumbling upon midi sprout, seeing it and thinking like, holy fucking shit, we can make it so plants, when they feel like they're in danger, generate a signal that activates any kind of defense perimeter that you wanted. I mean, you could theoretically, you know, now people, these heroes, man, they go and chain themselves to treat these old growth forests and they will die. Some of these people will die for a forest. I mean, the people, the, you know, I'm sure you've met them. They're deep out there. They don't have social security numbers, but they'll fucking die. They'll die. I mean, I'm not trying to decide in the West in the rain forest. They don't have social security numbers because they were born out there, but they'll die for the forest too. And it's like, there is, I did it, I'm sorry, why do I do this? God, I'm sorry, forgive me. You know, it's wild. I would imagine it's already happening. So do you know about tree telephony? No. Do you know about like, you know, muzak, you know, muzak, like the stuff that it was like pumped into office buildings and stuff. The inventor of muzak was doing these like experimental things for the military during World War II called tree telephony, where they were like using, they were using trees to like track. I might be like totally off, but like they were like using trees in some way to track like, like, you know, the Germans like moving through the forest. But like, through this, they were like using trees as like telephone, like as like antennae. Wow. You know, so like, there is an understanding that these are like, I mean, like, if you think of an antenna, it's like a perfect antenna. Fuck it is. I mean, that's, that's, that's built to, that's built to really receive information, you know, like with all those leaves and like, how lightweight it is. And like, it just grows and it just keeps, yeah. So there's like, each light, each light, man. And I meant to tell you this, when we were talking about the devouring of photons, this is, is I'm like, you know, I don't know, you're bringing a lot out of me that, I don't know if I've talked about my guilt problems with nature itself, but like, then I'm reading this, I was reading this paper about how long it takes photons to grow inside the sun, millions of years. So by the time a photon pushes out of the surface of the sun, it's been essentially gestating in the sun for, I think millions of years, maybe hundreds of thousands of years. And these little sweeties go blasting out of the sun. They, they land on earth and the fucking plants are like, and our eyes eat them, you know, our eyes turn them into eating photons that have been growing for millions of years in the sun. So then I'm like, God damn it. Are we eating though? Or are we receiving in a part of this exchange with the universe? In my new life of looking up, I'm receiving these sweeties into my eyes. Prior to this conversation, I'm like, well, there you go. My eyes are black holes devouring these like, I don't know, formative zoa gings blast out the sun into my optic nerve. Now it's like, no, I'm receiving it. It's a big difference. Yeah, dude, allow it to flow through you. Like, what happens if you let the universe like, actually fully flow through you? What if you embody all of that energy of the universe that wants to flow through you and express itself as the purest transmission of Duncan Tressel? What's that feel like, man? Feels a lot better. Thank you so much. You're welcome, man. Tell folks how they can, now I saw that you have, when you, when you first sent me this incredible technology, it was definitely a little more obscure, but I'm excited that now you have an app and now people are going to be able, if they want to, they don't need to buy a bunch of sound equipment, you can just connect this, you can connect plants to your phone. Yeah, it's going to be wireless. So it was called Midi Sprout and now it's called PlantWave. PlantWave.com is where you can check it out. We're actually launching a Kickstarter on September 24th, 2019, and it's going through October 27th, 2019, and we're raising money to make PlantWave a reality. PlantWave is going to allow you to connect this device to your plants, and we're going to translate the information from the plants into music that, from the PlantWave device, it'll stream to your phone via Bluetooth, and on your phone is where all the instruments are going to live, and so the plant is basically playing instruments that live on your phone. It's going to work on iOS and Android devices. It's going to be super easy to use. You're going to be able to change the sounds. You're going to be able to design your own sounds, and if you're a pro musician, you're still going to be able to use it with synths and stuff. It's going to have a USB out, so you can do USB to Midi or to your DAW or whatever you need to do. So you could take, we'll be able to take our phones on a hike, connect to any plant we see, and hear it sing to us. Yeah, and it's all wireless, so it's like really, you just have this little box, and you hook it up to the plant, and then it just Bluetooth streams to your phone. Battery power. Yeah, it's battery power. It's rechargeable, and then yeah, and then the the enclosure is going to be made out of sustainable and recyclable materials. Right now, the current Midi Sprout is made out of corn or non-GMO corn and cork. Do you still put seed packs in? I remember when... We stopped, actually, because there are a lot of, because we changed our shipping supplier, and there are some countries where you kind of can't do that, so just to streamline it and make it easier, we stopped, but yeah, that was like fun for the early adopters. Man, it is so nice to meet you in person, and I just really, really am grateful to you for this conversation. I feel a lot better. I didn't, I was really, really like feel lucky that I get to have these chats in my life, and all the links to find, you are going to be at DuncanTrustle.com, and please, you've got to come back on. Dude, I would love to, yeah. Thank you. Thanks for listening, everybody. That was Joe Patatucci. Make sure you check out Plant Wave.

You're about to get your mind exploded by this brilliant human who is an entrepreneur, but also as infatuated with the Bhagavad Gita as anyone I've ever met. He's awesome. Do you hear that in the background? I'm actually recording this in the astral realm. We're going to jump right into this episode, but first this. This podcast is sponsored by BetterHelp. Is there something interfering with your happiness that's preventing you from achieving your goals? Like maybe you find yourself in the midst of a global pandemic that you thought was receding, but now seems to be coming back. Even though you're vaccinated, you've got kids, and you know that there's a possibility that you could actually infect your kids with the new variant. On top of all that, you're doing everything you can to support your family and be a good dad, but you're not exactly sure how to balance work with hanging out with your kids, giving yourself the time you need, but then if you can analyze your schedule, you realize that a lot of the time you're just on the internet, you're not actually working, so when you're telling people that you're busy, it's kind of a deception, and you're beginning to wonder if there's no way to escape becoming some version of your parents, the bad parts of your parents, and not the good parts of your parents, and so you're sort of losing sleep when you wake up in the middle of the night and think about that. Well then BetterHelp will assess your needs and match you with your own licensed professional therapist. You can start communicating in under 48 hours. It's not a crisis line, it's not self-help, it's professional therapy done securely online. There's a broad range of expertise available, which may not be locally available in many areas. The service is available for clients worldwide. You can log into your account anytime, send a message to your therapist, and you'll get timely and thoughtful responses, plus you can schedule weekly video or phone sessions so you won't ever have to sit in an uncomfortable waiting room as with traditional therapy. Who wants to do that? Who wants to sit in a therapist's office with other people in a kind of shared realization that you're both going to therapy? Not there's anything wrong with that, but come on, the reason I'm in therapy, or at least part of it, is I don't like it when I start feeling vulnerable because I try to live in my super ego, but I'm constantly getting sucked down into my id and it would be really nice if I could just figure out a way to live in between those two in a healthy way. BetterHelp is committed to facilitating great therapeutic matches so they make it easy and free to change therapists if needed. It's more affordable than traditional offline therapy and financial aid is available.

Listen, I don't want to keep going into this and my attorneys have advised me not to talk about it anymore, but listen, I am not saying that after the wild animal attacks that have been happening to people who haven't subscribed to my Patreon, there is going to be a new round of attacks from insects and snakes. Up until this point, it's only been mammals attacking people, small mammals attacking people who haven't subscribed to my Patreon, but and I'm not saying that the next round is going to be snakes and insects. I'm not saying that that would make me seem insane. Like I was threatening people saying, look, the only way I can protect you from an increasing number of attacks from varying creatures, cold-blooded, warm-blooded arachnids, et cetera, is by going on my Patreon. And I'm not saying that at all. My attorneys want me to emphasize that. But if you did want to subscribe to my Patreon, Patreon dot com forward slash DTFH, you would get instant access to commercial free episodes of this podcast along with lots of extra stuff. All right. That's the Patreon plug. Today's guest is brilliant. He is an angel investor. He's a CEO.

Everybody please welcome to the DTFH the brilliant James Bashara. James, welcome to the DTFH. I, you know, I'm so thrilled that we are becoming friends. I won't get into the details of how we met, but wow, it's really super cool to know somebody like you. I've already like just from like a few conversations with you, like my life is getting better. You're like plugging me into things that I'd never heard of before. And the reason I'm really excited to have you on the podcast is because I spend a lot of time having conversations with people about some pretty ethereal stuff, some mystical stuff and spiritual stuff. But you are this amazing intersection between a lot of the spiritual stuff that I'm interested in and real world, pragmatic entrepreneurial action. And that's pretty cool to me because I think a lot of people think those two things don't necessarily intertwine. Well, I am so excited to be, well, any, any conversation with you, I'm excited to have mics or mics on or not. So I'm really excited in, in our first conversation, I was telling you that, that I see comedians in general have this amazing ability to connect these disparate points and in beautiful, hilarious ways. And it's such an awareness as well as the articulation of the, the observation that the community is making that, that is so beautiful. And you do that not only with hilarity, but you also do the philosophical viewpoints so, it's just so seamless. And it's really beautiful to, to listen to because it's like a good laugh. You just never know when there's going to be some knowledge nuclear bomb that is, that has dropped around the corner. So I, I, man, I'm excited to, to chat with you any day of the week. Well, thanks. You know, I got to say, you're the first person on this podcast as far as I'm aware that's been in Time Magazine, 30 under 30, you're young, you're this young like Batman entrepreneur person who, and I'm really interested in that. I'm really interested in the, like, what, what do you think is the difference between you and all the other people out there who may be in the, would like to like not have a boss, would like to have their own business, would like to start, get their own thing going, but they just don't do it. There's no way for me to, to, to really know, to be honest, or, and certainly no way to, to concisely articulate what is the thing. But I will say that I believe the real answer, and this is actually somewhat dissatisfying for, for a lot of people, but I think it ultimately is enlightening, is that I remember hearing that Yo-Yo Ma said it takes three generations of families being serious about music to create a world-class musician. And so it's not just the precocious 13 year old saying, I want to be a world-class musician that, that makes it happen. It's multiple generations. But I'll get to the, the, I think the enlightening part, but that's always dissatisfying, dissatisfying because people want to, in many ways, and I'll get to the reality of the story because it is so not a Batman-esque story. It's so not a 30 under 30, like had it going on and still have it going on type of, type of story. And I despise those. I started a whole podcast that I've told you about to really unearth the real stories of people and the real backstories, but that articulation of Yo-Yo Ma saying takes three generations of families being serious about music to produce a world-class musician. I think about that a lot in the sense that my great grandfather was an entrepreneur. And he started a general store, hitchhiked his way from, basically comes over from, from Lebanon and Syria, hitchhiked his way to a tiny town in Oklahoma at 16 years old. It's just jumping on trains, getting, you're getting into strangers' trucks until he goes, until there isn't a, then he gets on a train that's going through Oklahoma and he says to himself, I'm going to create, I'm going to go until there's a train stop that doesn't have a general store. And then I'm going to create a general store. Wow. And, and that's, I mean, when I, when I would hear that story of my great grandfather, I would just, I'd be blown away by the simplicity and the brilliance of that of, all right, I'm going to create a general store, but I'm going to go where there's no competition. I'm going to stay on this train until there's a stop where there isn't a general store at 16. I mean, this motherfucker was just, he was, you know, what would suck is if he, you know, he was on the train with someone else with the same plan and they're like, all right. Four days in, wait, that guy's structure looks a lot like my structure. Wait, G E and it's like day 17. It's like finishing up the R A L. It's like, fuck general what? Not a store. No. Yeah. Exactly. So please continue. So then my grandfather goes from a small general store and then he owned a flower shop next to it, my great grandfather. My grandfather moves from that tiny town, Haskell, Oklahoma to Tulsa, Oklahoma and owns, starts with a laundry mat and then turns that into a few different laundry mats. And then my dad ends up running the, the oldest recruiting firm in Texas, moves from Oklahoma to Texas and sets up shop in Dallas and starts a recruiting firm that he, he builds out, you know, finding executives for companies. And Dallas just tends to do well and take off and, you know, it's headquarters for a bunch of companies. And so each generation has just taken a little bit further. So I think that that is dissatisfying for people to hear because it's not the thing that can change your life on a Tuesday to, to whatever version of success might be there. But what is enlightening, and I think is, I think about this so often as well, a pastor in San Francisco, a church that my wife and I went to for 10 years said one time is that we inherit the virtues and the sins of our, of our parents. And that's deep. All right. For me, it hit me in a couple of different ways, but, but, but I certainly felt like, okay, I feel like I inherited the, the both of virtues and sins of my parents, but in many ways it's even deeper for, for me, at least from the perspective of, I got to be really mindful of what I'm doing because my kids are going to inherit whatever example I'm saying. Right. Yeah. I mean, that is a, I know you have two daughters, that's that. And I've got two sons. This is a terrifying and beautiful thing to know, to know that and to, I, I don't know if you've experienced those moments yet where you're like, Oh my God, I am right now a drain pipe out of which is dripping the poison of my parents and into time. You're like, and I don't want it to, you feel like you feel like an open, I don't know, sewer dripping into some beautiful pure river and you're like, how the, I don't, I don't want to be this, but I, but suddenly this, it's just comes out and you know, so how do you mitigate that? What would be an example, especially for those that don't have kids, they probably, I can think of a handful, but I want from, you know, to, from you, what would be a specific example? Getting into like a vile argument with my wife in front of the kids, you know, where we're like really fighting with each other and looking each idiot in both share like this overwhelming love for our kids and for each other, both of us looking, watching each other turn into demons, you know, looking at poor forest watching us like, what the fuck is this? Like, I thought I was the only one who did tantrums around here. Like, what is this? And, and, and, but, you know, we, we've had conversations about it, you know, because it's like, look, if you're going to be married, you're going to get into arguments. Like you're going to fight, you're going to get into arguments. Like, so we've had the conversation. Do we have the argument in secret or do we have it in front of the kids? And we have heard you don't do the secret arguing thing because they need to see that there's conflict in life, but they also need to see resolution. That's the main thing is if you can get in the fight and the argument and the disagreement and, and then afterwards also don't get, don't make up in private, let them see that you have resolved the situation or compromise, then I think they get a, some approximation of reality, which is we don't always get a lot. People don't like, because you're arguing or fighting, it doesn't necessarily mean it's the apocalypse. Anyway, no, no, that's, no, that's huge for them to see that continuation to it, to see logic play out, I think is extremely powerful for a young mind. To see illogical sequence of events play out is confusing. We'll confuse them forever. So they don't see you fight, but then they see this bitterness, this, um, right. This kind of, you know, just a really sour exchange for a day or for two days. And they don't know why that's, they think, Oh, when you love someone, you, you can treat them like that, I guess, instead of conflict to resolution and love. And it's like, wait, you can get in a fight and then be hugging and holding each other two hours later. Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. But that being said, that, you know, in the, in the fights, when I've gotten really angry and when we've gotten really mean to each other, I feel like I'm making, painting a picture of it. That's a little prettier than it is, you know, I just, I, like, so this is something that I, I am, feel really like nervous about cause you, I, you know, the cliche about that you always hear, you'll never love anything more than your kids, you know, that's real. And so I feel what you're talking about there, but what about you? How do you, how are you, how do you mitigate it? How do you deal with that responsibility? So, you know, that, and, and I hope we talk about this a little bit or throughout the conversation of these, these knowledge nuclear bombs that just go off and then like the ground is leveled, you can't unhear that. And so that was one of, one of them in my life was that we inherit the virtues and sins of our parents. And then immediately with a three and a half year old and a, a nine month old, I heard this maybe actually before we had kids, but it stuck with me that, you know, what, what are my imparting to our children? And, and it shifts, it really has shifted my viewpoint of, of, you know, parenting to this thing where it's like, they're going to be a thousand generations that are going to inherit whatever I impart. It's not just this exchange on a Tuesday afternoon. Like one of, one of which where I was like, what are you doing? Um, and I was observing what I was doing is maybe two weeks ago, my family and I, and this is where, where I think, um, I'm going to love, hopefully for many years, love surfing with you on, on, uh, conceptual articulations of God. I think about God all the time. I mean, it's, uh, there isn't anything that I don't think that I think God is the only thing that I, um, think about. And, and whenever I, I'm distracted by something that is of here, the now, the, um, whatever it is, uh, complaining about it, $7 coffee in Los Angeles. In some way, I'm misinterpreting God. Um, and so that concept of, of like, what are you, the giving a, you know, imparting a vice, I remember about 10 days ago, two weeks ago, telling my three and a half year old, God's watching you. Oh yeah. And I took something so beautiful that I've critiqued. I mean, you and I have actually, the critique of taking, um, taking this, this beautiful, um, I think life altering concept of understanding God, but then using it in a macro sense, political, you know, from King James, uh, and his divorce that you were telling about, uh, that we were talking about all the way down to trying to get my three and a half year old to do what I want her to do. And it's, and I was, uh, thankfully aware that I was doing it, but I was like, shit, this is how it begins, man. There you go. You elf on the shelves, God, you know, it's the thing. I, yeah, I was, when I'm talking to forest about God or Jesus or, uh, I just realized like, well, what does he think I'm even talking about? Because we don't talk about it as, I don't know how to like, really talk about it with him, uh, anyway, I definitely haven't gotten to the point where I could do like the police state with God. That's all, that's all I've really talked about, uh, God with her. Yes. I mean, we, she sleeps with, and this is not of her own accord. She sleeps with a Bible. I'd say, you know, on the offset, uh, of this conversation for, for listeners, um, I'd be very hard to kind of figure out what category I am in terms of a, um, religious influence, but the, but yeah, she sleeps with a Bible of her own accord. We talk about maybe stories of, of Jesus because he has a children's Jesus, uh, children's Bible from her grandmother. Um, and, and so we'll talk about that. Maybe that's 10% of the equation. 90% of the equation has been around the concepts of hell have gotten into her head of just like punishment, God punished, and she's three and a half. And I was part of that because two weeks ago I'm telling her God's watching. Um, and I don't even remember the circumstance. I think it was like coming out of her, uh, not listening to, to her parents, but I was just like so, so blown away by a holy shit, man. You have so sent it's just so manipulative to use this, uh, beautiful thing for a tool of my own, um, yeah. And it's like, I, I, you know what? I love this idea that when you're, when you're a parent, you, it isn't just your children you're affecting. It's like your actions are reverberating through a genetic echo chamber that potentially can go on for millennia. Who even knows how long, and it's this simultaneous like surrender. I think a little bit just to the reality of like, look, we'll do the best we can. We'll be good enough to your, and for me, also the other realization is like shit, even when my parents were lost in their own, like, um, you know, lost in their own karma, they were doing the best they could because, you know, any parent loves their kids, like probably, probably unless you're dealing with like, I don't know. I'm obviously there's exceptions and maybe this is a little naive to say, but probably your parents were doing the best they could do because they loved you that much. And so if you had particularly rotten parents, you can't even imagine what they would have been like if you hadn't showed up in their life. My God, they, you know what I've got only knows without you what they would have been because they were at least experiencing raw love. And then whether or not they could overcome their own particular like gravity wells, addiction, alcoholism, mental illness, you know what I mean? They were still, you were experiencing probably the best they could do. You know, and for some people who are thinking like, oh, really? Well, my fucking dad was taking me to the goddamn bar, you know, at eight a.m. Is that the best he could do? Yes, that was the best he could do. Right. That was the best. And you might have never been able to hear his articulation of devices and virtues he inherited that he had to deal with that are the exact same logic that, you know, the person sitting and that therapist chair on a Thursday afternoon is complaining about their parents. Well, let's bring in the whole fucking story. Let's bring in their parents story. Let's bring in what they had. I mean, it's that the yeah, that's a never ending, a never ending loop. And I think that's that's a very that's a very positive thing because you're a part of that never ending loop. And there's gravity to the conversations that examples set for your three year old, because yeah, whatever you're going to impart, they're going to go on and impart to their children and so on. So yeah, I don't think it's a stretch to say if you believe this presumption that we inherit the virtues and vices of parents. I feel very fortunate for for my my parents and upbringing. If we believe that, then yeah, there's it's not like it just stops a generation or two down the road. Well, but James, do you don't you think that I mean, I'm not going to argue with yo-yo ma, at least about music, but don't you think that in this hyper connected world that we're in that those rules, they don't apply the same way anymore? I mean, I get three generations minus the internet, but now we've become everyone's children. Now we've become the children of whoever we pay the most attention to no matter how old we are. So don't you think there's a new possibility for people to? Yes. Yes. So yeah, I think totally. And I think, uh, and there's absolutely examples of this, of entrepreneurship, um, out of out of nowhere. I think, um, if the conversation is around entrepreneurship, professional success, or these stupid, stupid frigging lists, um, that people come up with, um, of entrepreneur, young entrepreneurs, which are so idiotic. Um, I mean, even though you despise them, well, well, first off, Forbes 30 under 30, that's like, or time 30, 30, 30, that's literally just a blogger, um, that is just reaching out to their network asking, Hey, who, who should I put on this list? Maybe they get 80 names from their first and second degree connections. And, and those lists are rarely ever indicated above who, you know, who goes on to have positive impact in the world 10 years down the road, 20 years down the road. This episode of the DTFH has been sponsored by Squarespace.com. Number one shout out to my friends over at lotionclown.com. Based on an assessment of their website, my guess is they probably cleared their first, I don't know, million dollars since they bought the domain name using Squarespace and built that website using Squarespace. I gave surprise lotionclown.com away a few podcasts ago. Now it is a thriving business. You can go check it out right now. It's got testimonials.

By the way, if you not to diverge into some other promotion here, this is a Squarespace commercial and surprise lotionclown.com is a Squarespace website. But my God, I just have to say there's nothing that makes me feel more relaxed or gives me that I'm at home on a nice Christmas morning than when I hear that fluttering tap of the gloved hands of a lotion clown puttering at my window to let me know that I'm about to get a surprise lotioning. The point is I love you, my listeners, so much that I want to give you the keys to your future prosperity. And that's what surprise lotionclown was, but I'm not just going to stop with that.

lotionsongs.com it's waiting there for you like some diamond shining in the sands of a mystical lotiony beach thank you square space I'm sorry I just have to tell you this I just got my sperm count I'm you know I'm old I might want to have another kid let me tell you great sperm count 108 million like the doctor was like what the fuck he's I got one ball I the other one I cancer and I had radiation therapy I've done acid since I was in my 20s you know I was you know fully prepared for the doctor to be like these fucking things this is not even sperm it's just some milky dead stuff coming out of your cock friend but he was like wow all I'm saying that for is I'm proud of that and I think you should I don't give a fuck if I'm not making this well I'm not crafting them probably a blogger in my testicles is making this but still I have okay you should be proud okay uh and there's um yeah there's there compliments I think you're twain and mark twain said he can go to uh two weeks on a single compliment so that compliments are helpful um they keep it they encourage you um yes but it's a it's just I I think about it and it's not so much I guess I told you the story about uh the preceding generations I think about um the I honestly think about the future generations of you know my kids and kids kids I'm just setting that example where it just really starts way earlier than people think again having said that there are plenty of examples uh Steve Jobs dropped out of college uh was adopted didn't know his his um you know his actual um his actual birth parents and turns out to be one of the best entrepreneurs of uh all time so yeah there's there are both sides um to that I guess what I want to impart to listeners is that it's it is um trying to go from zero to a hundred and a lifetime based on you read about someone like Elon Musk I think that that can be more depressing if you feel like all right we all started from the same place and then became that versus okay this is where I am now let me go let me try to go 100 steps forward knowing that my kids will be better off to then go 100 steps forward and their kids um you know and I love that I get it I get it oh I love that that's wonderful right because you become otherwise you could become just a self-flagellating self-hating masochistic then you become one of those like it's you know uh what do they call it grind culture or something you know that like that awful I think it's awful because it's that's why people start a company it doesn't go well uh to some narrative complete bullshit narrative in their head that oh well I was hoping this app would be worth a billion dollars in a year like that you know one thing from that kid that started when he was 20 or from that fake version of Instagram uh so Instagram in Silicon Valley Instagram is is commonly used as an example of they just started it sold her for a billion dollars you know the next day uh and the truth is they they had fucked up so bad for a year that they rebranded the product completely just kept going and then sold it two years later yes for a billion dollars complete lightning in a bottle but they had been fucking up for 12 13 months in a row and then they started to put together the piece and kept going and I think the false narrative of like oh I heard on a podcast that it's just these steps and then I really should quit my job and I'll be an entrepreneur I'll be you know successful by implementing these three four five steps 12 months later is just so I think we lose out I mean I this sounds like a I think it can sound like a peripheral argument to to what we're talking about but I think it's I think it's so core to how our culture should talk about entrepreneurship should talk about um the reality of creating it's so fucking hard yeah and that's the narrative that we should be putting forward so that people know when they are 12 months in and it's not you know going to to plan and some smooth graph up into the right towards whatever financial goal they have they should know oh this is how it's actually this is what it's really like right because you know what it's it's the we're talking about it's like a disease a psychic disease that is infecting people during those montages and movies right someone decides to start a fucking business they play a song it's the end of 12 months their business is running great or maybe they're doing home repairs or whatever the thing is it's a song at the end of the song and you see them painting and working and they wipe their brow or whatever but it's a two-minute song in the movie and and somehow that gets in people's heads where they think oh yeah that's just what it's like it's like a year or so of suffering and then probably you'll be okay but you know I know you must have been there I certainly have been there where you're like well there you're thinking like here are the steps a few more things go wrong and there's some possibility that I'm not going to be able to I'm gonna have to live in my car you know what I mean like a couple more things go wrong I don't think my parents are gonna have you felt that oh fuck yeah yeah what have my mom told me at one point um well you know at one point I was just failing in LA I was just failing I was working at the comedy store how old were you I want the whole I want the long version you want the whole the long virtual I'm a late first of all I'm a late bloomer so like I go to college I get a degree in psychology I go to LA uh work at the comedy store for a while get lucky enough that Rogan starts taking me on the road I'm touring with him a little bit but I just hit a wall man like I hit a bad spot where it's I must have been late 20s early 30s at this point and how long had you been on this grind because even in that that narrative the montage of just you went from LA to struggling and people don't hear it was six fucking years of struggling not yeah 90 days or however long but how many years had you said okay I want to do this too then hitting a wall and your late 20s early 30s uh yeah I well I guess it's definitely it must have been six it must have been six years at least I mean shit went really bad for me for a long time like it didn't like I like I'm a late I did not take anything seriously really I was I was doing the thing where you're like trying to like turn your laziness into like some kind of revolutionary attitude because you're so beat above everything that you're like I'm not really gonna apply myself any kind of real way I mean it was all the all the fables you know the my kid watches on tv now you know the stupid crickets playing as violin instead of saving up food for the winter and the ants have to like do different I think there's different versions of the story but that was me just fucking off you know like not taking it seriously and then grind this slow descent into like a really the kind of life you could expect to have if you're not like really like planning you know that was happening to me and and it was bad it was really bad it was just humiliating I was you know I was borrowing money from my mom I'd have to ask her for money in my late 20s early 30s and then finally she's like I'm not giving you anything like you can't I'm not gonna help you anymore she knew she couldn't help me anymore you know what I mean people were like helping me I was having to ask friends to pay for my parking tickets and stuff man it was bad you know like really really bad and and finally I just got to a point where I realized that if I didn't make it work if I didn't like I didn't make it work then I was gonna leave LA with my tail between my legs and who knows what you know maybe go back home convince my mom to let me live with her for a little bit while I get my fucking life together well who knows what you know just like and all of it was I was I had so many great opportunities I was kind of squandering you know like there were like a lot I was squandering I wasn't working as hard as I should have been working that's my story it's really a kind of depressing um in the sense that it was like uh you know when I when I look back on it and just think like shit I bet if I just applied myself a little bit more if I had like been a little less interested in like you know partying and and like having like the fun that LA can offer you and a little and listen I remember like I'm sorry man this is no no I knew dude this is um this is what people should hear this is that the experience stretching of that little montage or the part in your own story that we're even talking about this topic you went from struggling in LA to or moved to LA to struggling without mentioning the part that the person that's listening to us right now that's in year four right needs to hear right right right right right yes I mean yeah I hear you man that's beautiful too I do think you're right about that's like why create some kind of uh yeah if you if I tell the story wrong I will leave out all the embarrassing parts because you know there's certain like confessional things where you uh where you're still cool making the confession but a lot of this stuff was like legitimately humiliating you know like and it's so beautiful like people need to hear that because and this is this is the whole reason that that I started talking about this so much on on my podcast was because that person that's in year four we need what they're going to create you listening to this right now that's in month 13 yeah that's in month 59 I had Steven Pressfield on my podcast recently who's he wrote an amazing book called the the War of Art and he's also written he actually wrote Bagger Vance Legend of Bagger Vance based on the Bhagavad Gita that yeah the Legend of Bagger Vance the the book and then obviously the movie but the book is based on the Bhagavad Gita Bagger Vance had no idea Bagger Vance Bhagavad Gita what oh fuck that's crazy that's so funny because I know him more for the War of Art right than I do for the art that he made which is exactly I know and he and he tells me all the time he's like I'm a fiction writer I just happen to get known for my non-fiction books but my you know dream is to write fiction and so his first published book was 27 years when he's 53 now he's written like 12 best-selling books but it was 27 years after he said I'm gonna quit my job and I'm gonna be a writer wow and those are the stories that we need because we need his books that motherfucker and I hope you don't mind the cussing but it is um the Irish Catholic upbringing inheriting vices the that book the the War of Art we needed that book yes and that book spawned countless countless creative endeavors and creative careers because people talk about that book there's written 20 years ago people still mention it as when I published that episode I heard from 12 13 14 friends that said that that book was is the singular most impactful book they ever read that didn't write he didn't even get his first book published for 27 years and and he ends up writing the book that could spawn I don't know 10 000 other creative careers but so keep going on the humiliating part um when you when you say the humiliating it was humiliating it was humiliating I was like you know I was like in romantic relationships with people a thousand times more successful than me who are like becoming a fat like exponentially disinterested in me as they're kind of watching me like do that thing you know I know it's just a thing that can happen to people where you just like you think that I think I think most people feel their soul and when if you feel your soul then you feel a lot of power and you feel a lot of like possibility but that's not enough you can't just recognize this thing inside of you that is like a seed that's going to grow into something potentially you actually have to water it and like go through the there's you know right you know when I was at the comedy store as the talent coordinator in the unprecedented thing app and where the owner made me a paid regular which she generally didn't do and people were on that side of the fence to the point where when I became the talent coordinator other comics were like don't do it man you will not be a comic if you do that you can't do it and I did it because I needed the money I needed a job and I and she made me a paid regular which is unprecedented and awesome and and but I remember she said to me you know yeah there's no shortcuts I'm gonna put you through your paces and like but she had identified something in me which was like I wanted to take shortcuts you know I wanted to not go through my paces and not suffer the same way all the other comics are the paces you have to bomb your fucking ass off on stage all the time you got to go on stage all the time like five nights a week five nights a week yeah you have to go up all the time I still didn't do that but I you know I didn't but you do have to you really do have to like there's no way out of what out of it there's no way out of it and yet maybe the neural lace is gonna allow us to like do real shortcuts or something like that but there's really no way out of it and and so yeah you know that was um that was an an unprecedented moment but I remember her it was like kind of a warning or a reality check with me we're just like look it's so I make you this thing who cares you know you still have to do the work there's no way out of it you gotta do the work and then and so anyway it was humiliating it was like till it till finally it wasn't anymore because I was so backed into a corner and like I was in a sublet I was living in a sublet in Atwater Village before Atwater Village got expensive $650 a month uh I think I had somewhere around three or four thousand dollars that was it and what was your mindset like before you felt these inflection points start to go in the direction you wanted to go what was the mindset before maybe the euphoria of things stacking up your way I had a great therapist who like turned me on to this the mindset was I've got to get help so the mindset was this is now serious it's not fun anymore this is serious like I'm experiencing a series of of basically self-inflicted failures that are completely related to me being like a slacker and I don't I don't want to live like this anymore I'm gonna run out of chances like I'm out of already out of chances it felt like so that this therapist I was with is like look you're waking what time do you wake up oh you know like 11 or 10 all right you're not doing that anymore you're gonna wake up it's you know you gotta wake up early now you're gonna wake up really early and and you you're gonna like call people and ask if you can work for them and help them and like that's he was just he gave me this like really cheesy course online called the 100-day challenge I think or something yeah yeah it's clip art and shit but the guy's like tough loves you and he's just like right now right down five people who can help you get where you want to go but not like you know handout help but like you like you know part of failure is you don't ask to collaborate you don't ask for help you you just think you can do it all on your own because you know you know it's so true isn't it true and you feel like the people that could help you most are the ones you want to ask least because you're like I just want to show them I'm worthy of their help first I want to show them that I am badass then on the other side of that I might ask them for something yes that yeah exactly so it's like I didn't I think the guy just identified all the things that happen when people are failing and then reverses them on you like you know or you I was doing the thing where you don't look at your bank account I don't know I bet you've never I don't know if you've ever been there but it's it's a thing we do and I'm really low yeah I in uh so I studied development development economics which we chat about the application of economic theory towards developing regions of the world and I lived in Cape Town South Africa it's working in the townships at Cape Town South Africa for two years and I had I knew I had this support system on my parents but I was making about two grand a month no no 1300 a month in the beginning and it was in South Africa so 1300 went kind of you know decently far but that those two years were so stressful and I was starting I was creating a company my first startup um on the nights and weekends then I quit my job so stupidly quit my job with no I guess I could ask my parents for uh money and did at many points but I quit my job thinking like no I'm like five months away from this taking off and so and and those every night of those five months was so scary because I was like what did I I just jumped off the ledge yeah and I have no idea what I'm doing just falling into the future and it was yeah so I that that that amount of stress and anxiety I mean they've proved it out it actually decreases your IQ really yeah so oh fuck that's so crazy so yeah so to make matters worse you're sort of experiencing stress related like reduction of your ability to process information and so which is exactly what you need you know but that all that being said you know you there you must admit um there was something thrilling about those nights too there's something incredibly because powerful about it because you go from you go from like I remember when I finally left the comedy store and that was my last like paycheck job and I remember watching like the paycheck go into the ATM that I was depositing and just thinking like that's the last one of those that you're you know what I mean like they just ate your last thing yeah you know that's it's about to get real and you are you are you are certainly in the uh Gita sense you are certainly saying okay going into battle and you might be excited about it because we as creators before you really start to create and put it on the line you don't know how much of a battle it's going to be but yeah it is it is exciting to say yes to the battle and don't you think that's as important a thing to admit to it's like yeah six year grind five year grind and at some point in that grind it's like fuck the battle thing fuck this this is not but if you've been cocooned in a job long enough and suddenly you're now you've gone from I guess the comparison could be you've gone from someone with a little farm a sharecropper to being a hunter-gatherer it's a it's a whole different universe that you're in all of a sudden and that and that is I think in that inherent and so vices of virtues one of the biggest virtues we should impart to those around us not just children because it's obviously we inherit the vices and virtues of our community as well is that virtue we should impart is that you said yes to the battle so hell yeah we should we should absolutely make a note and and call out that part of the story because that is that is probably the most critical part the yo-yo ma stuff maybe that's like the background that I think about it's just transgenerational and by the way also one of the reasons I think about one of the reasons I think about this a lot is that within extreme abject poverty you can it's very transgenerational and that I just think about so many people that that want to jump into entrepreneurship to get away from whatever situation they're in and and it it might not be the right call for them because this this place where you have no safety net I I don't know if I'd recommend it for that many people but for those listening that feel that call and they feel the call towards it not the not the push away from the shitty job that they have right now like oh it'd be so great to be my own boss because that is not the case you as you could probably test there was even in those times when you didn't have a boss I'm sure you were stressed the f out it's not like it's you know rainbows and unicorns but I will say that for those 10 20 30 percent of people that might be listening to this that are that are hearing the call and ignoring it that vice is going to be imparted to those around you whoa right oh that's intense right it's not just like you're letting yourself down it's like just everyone around you doesn't get to you know watch what can happen because that is it that that's like a gift you know there's a people talk about in the comedy world it's like you're it's weird like success like success is contagious like where there's a weird thing that'll happen where suddenly one of your friends will book something for the first time and even though you might feel like like you know you inside like you just want to like just just out there dude oh totally in Silicon Valley that's that is you see a friend raise around raise around the funding and and you're just like eating mayonnaise sandwiches and they raise around and funding for two million you're like what the and it's your best friend and so you're texting more it's at least a close friend maybe not your best friend but I remember and you're texting like congrats man so excited in the back of your mind you're like with that fucking idea that's a terrible idea the systems broke but yeah so so that I think that's another important thing to do I admit is there's a natural human thing that happens at least for I think most people most comics I know you know that's one of the ways you know a comedian is beginning to get successful as other comedians are talking shit about him all the time you're like oh wow that's amazing they're about they must be taken off everyone's pissed oh yeah he does suck I'm gonna follow him on Instagram to see what he's doing so right yeah yeah but but uh but yeah but I do there there's a contagion that starts happening one of the ways to sort of soothe that darkness is to just like play around the idea that it does seem to be contagious like people succeed in groups I don't know what that is and so there's a term for it called seniors have you ever heard this term uh what's his name it's an art there's an artist or the musician I heard it came from um god anyway go ahead yeah yeah I had I had only heard this in a conversation um with Mark Andreessen who's a super famous investor and he was on he was an investor in my company and um and just a really great mentor but he mentioned it and it was um I can't people can google who first said it but it was just the concept that um genius can't exist alone and that genius is is a network and a fabric and it can get identified personified in one person but it's actually those people seek out each other just like you would seek out just like the musician would seek out the absolute uh you know extremes of of tactics of practice of you know even a self-isolation to get as good as possible well they're also going to seek out who could potentially help me get even better or get me towards where I want to go and so you see these clusters of people um and and I the way they were talking about was Bob Dylan going from Minnesota to um to Bleecker Street in New York he would not be Bob Dylan without that scene that he went towards and he knew it we don't know it we he moved there because he knew it but the stories get told is like oh it's Bob Dylan it's you know it's yeah amazing and you see these clusters New York Silicon Valley um LA and and it is yeah they I mean moods are contagious as colds I think success is as contagious as colds as well when you like you said when you when you're like that that he's no better than me it's yeah it's like you're and so when you're talking about people who are like born into poverty like or not just even in a poverty like most I think statistically most people get born into families where their parents have a boss that's normal it's nothing weird about it you know it's like that's just the way it is it's a I that's the way it was for the entirety of my life um and and yes it is it is a part of it and I think that there's probably maybe a significant portion of that that part of that equation that is purely natural and it is their own version of saying yes to the battle I mean being the first to graduate you know from their family and then take a job and and move up the ranks at AT&T that's their version of saying yes and then I think there's a significant portion of that equation where there that family member is inheriting the vice of the person not saying yes to the battle wow yeah oh wow right that thing where you like you recognize like true genius in a person like in and I've seen it inarguable like oh my god that is a the not the like yeah that guy's a genius see that but an actual like holy shit like a tesla but because of who know like a variety of who knows what they're not going for it and and it's a it's a it's a dark thing to see and we and that's I mean not to bring it this will be the last time I bring it back to this point but that is what we need we got some big big fucking problems yeah and we need those people and we're going to need them way more over the next 10 20 30 years than we ever have before and it is I mean these things are on you know global these problems aren't local like oh we need to figure out a new fishing spot for our village like this is global everyone is impacted and we need those people to know what they're really getting into say yes anyhow but then I think of the beautiful thing on the other side of that is that then they they aren't so deterred by month seven month 17 month 39 being so terrible they're like oh yeah this is like this is the story not the I think what goes through so many founders would be founders would be creators heads is this story isn't like anyone else's maybe I need to go back and take the job at at Intel right yeah I mean it's see it seems like what you're saying is you know it's the and maybe this is an obvious thing it's the intention first of all it's like if you're and we talked about this off mic and I've been thinking about it a lot uh you know earlier in in this conversation you were talking about look you don't want to jump into this because you're running away from something out to you the energy of running away from something is will dissipate the you're gonna and it dissipates entropy and it's the antithesis of running to something you know it's too it's it looks the same but it's completely it may maybe the expression on the face of someone running away from a bear is going to be a little different from someone I don't I don't know you know they say in um Advaita Vedanta which is something we've chatted about oh and I these are the philosophical conversations that I love I love having with with brilliant people like yourself is you know that that they say you should you should be grasping for this knowledge like gasping for air when you're submerged yeah and one is going towards it and one is uh is you know seemingly running away from um you know death yeah I I oh that that's an interesting point I mean it's like when I'm running away from something though I'll tell you mixed in to that run is gonna be a lot of anger and fear and weird like shit in there whereas I'm running to something I'm excited if I'm learning like if I'm sitting down to practice piano or if I'm like deciding to spend some time you know working on a song or learning how to like or writing uh the writing I'm not as excited about but still there's this kind of excitement there's this like okay here we fucking go we're gonna jump jump in this thing again versus if I'm just like blindly trying to escape something that I don't want to look dead in the eye or something two different things but you are so understanding your intention seems really important but the off-might conversation we had you were telling me about the difference between seeking success like seeking success through peace if you try if you're trying to achieve success but it's the the methodology is chaotic then you can expect chaotic success if you're trying to achieve success but there's peace within it maybe you can help maybe we could talk about it again because clearly it didn't sink in as much as I am like no I feel like I'm not articulating I think I think you're um well you're certainly uh right in that and and this is my viewpoint but also this is a pedantic viewpoint um and for for listeners uh that may have never heard of the term Vedantic Vedanta is a means end of knowledge it's a 5000 year old um Indian philosophy that that is really sits at the source of all Eastern philosophies uh so then Hinduism is built on top of it as the adage goes Buddhism is Hinduism made for export a simplified version which which they all these are all needed because it you need this convergence divergence but um you follow it back to uh this the the Upanishads and the Vedic scriptures Vedanta um it it says what what I mean if I were to ask 10 people on the street what do you want that Alan Watts has a great soliloquy where he says you don't know what you want and if you um all it takes is for you to take take five minutes to write down 250 words of what you quote unquote want not a uh placeholder of like a one happiness or something but you write down or I want uh I want 10 million dollars because then I can live off the interest or whatever but you write down 250 words what paradise looks like to you and just that exercise of having to write down 250 words what paradise looks for you you realize you have no fucking clue what you're talking about right and it's when you do have to expand the language beyond placeholder words and so Vedanta uses somewhat of a placeholder but says what we want is peace and peace and prosperity yeah and to get prosperity if you want both start with peace and so you start with peace because if you are going for for prosperity and you don't really know which tool in the you know golf club set it's going to get you there you choose chaos you choose dishonesty you choose selfishness you choose whatever is the wrong golf club because you don't pick out the peace golf club then that's the type of prosperity you're going to have and you will you will have missed the chance to utilize peace whereas if you use peace then one you maybe you choose maybe you say okay my prosperity is this piece and I don't need that that other version but no matter what if you say okay look I'm playing the game of peace first then you're only going to choose here you're you'll only be left to be able to choose the prosperous path that is through peace that is that is so that is perfect genius that is the ant that is that's a solution that I've been stumbling around for a long time like that is the thing it you because how many people you must know so many people who made the wretched mistake of thinking that prosperity will give you tranquility peace and it's it's the most satanic mistake you can make because you will go for prosperity like you were invited to go for spiritual wisdom you'll go for it as though you were running out of air you'll go for it with the exact same passion and energy and all the stuff that gets mixed into the Instagram embarrassing Instagram grind memes that you see all the time and you'll get it it'll work it'll fucking work you will get it you would something will happen you you you might stab some backs or you know who knows what you end up doing but you actually get it and then you're sitting in your nice fucking hotel room at the end of the day slurping back benzos like they were m&m's because you can't fucking sleep and you're trying to ignore the fact your hand is shaking a little bit and you look at your phone and you just feel like a general gross emptiness and maybe your cock hurts because you've been compulsively masturbating and you know what I mean yes well that is the graphic that's accurate in that you're you're just going for if you don't have peace you're gonna seek distraction yeah I'm telling you man and if you got prosperity the distraction that is at your fingertips is dangerous oh yes a big thank you to purple for supporting this episode of the DTFH my friends it seems like the entire universe is trying to keep us from sleeping this summer you've got super hot unnatural

terms apply thank you purple so it is and you know that's I yeah you I 10 years in Silicon Valley and I mean at the at the epicenter and I always feel like I need to tell people I have I feel like my whole 20s it was just failure all the way through um so this you introduced me kindly as someone that seems to have it together and that's not it at all it's it's someone that at least can look back and say good god you did not have it together when with that awareness and talk about how I did not have it together now I was I will say that I do love um the the day to day design of my life now but it's through really ancient philosophy and reflection and daily meditation on it that that it at least has given me enough peace to say no to so many paths of chaos that I could have I would have when I was younger said yes let's I mean my first my first company I'll tell you my first company the ambition behind it was um Duncan you'll appreciate how silly and stupid this uh ambition was I looked at Facebook I was a senior and Facebook was valued at and college and Facebook was valued at um a billion dollars yeah 2008 billion dollars and I said I want what I want to build something bigger than Facebook that that no that's exactly exactly that was that was um that was exactly like my own internal dialogue is what would be cool something bigger than Facebook bigger than Facebook and then and then I was like cool and that's my you know if everyone thinks that's cool well something cooler than that is going to be even cooler and and I sat there and this is the way to not build a startup set you know on your path in your career sit on a couch and I call it concepting literally was sitting on my couch I was thinking what would be the biggest idea possible and so that ultimately ego engineering so that I can be the biggest hero possible and did you call that ego engineering ego engineering yeah and and concepting is is what you do when you're ego engineering well you're you're thinking on the on a couch with my notepad you know this one right here um one like it and thinking what what would be the biggest thing that will essentially get me the most love yeah connection admiration and um and prosperity and this is a bit of a sidebar but that the way to build something of value and to get a ziggler famous one of the og's of of the self-help space motivational speaking space also Dallas Texan said give others everything that they want and you'll get everything that you want it's a reverse it's not this is what I want love aberration to be the number I want to dominate the world so this is how I'm going to go do it it is the successful the really massive companies and the happy successful peaceful creators are on the other side and typically it's through a shift it's not like they were just born this way they're on the other side where they're thinking not on a couch how can something be as big as possible dominate the world they're sitting they're not sitting at all they're just doing and doing and doing and they realize oh people in the community find this thing over here useful okay let me do a little bit more whoa okay unexpected but they're finding more of this useful okay well then I'm going to do more of that and instead of just writing down how you're going to dominate the world you're listening to one person on a Wednesday to another person two Saturdays from you're listening to people say oh I love it when help me with this oh you're so helpful with that oh I love this thing that you do and you're you it's the opposite of concepting actually there's there's no mind to it at all you're getting out of the way to to what the natural skills you're given that in Vedanta it's swadharma your nature you're getting out of the way of your nature and and yet to capstone that um Alan Watts his his autobiography is called In My Own Way which is just so beautiful because it's both him doing things his his own way that doesn't map to oh this other dude is building a billion dollar company let's build let me build something bigger it was doing in his own way but also the recognition of like oh fuck I'm in my own way get out of my own way and let nature take its course including my own nature wow yeah oh man that is that is so brilliant I I can't tell you how many times I've made the mistake of just fortunately I never tried to do a startup but I certainly there have been times where I've been like oh yeah here's the idea that will be the biggest fucking idea to ever happen in the world and I remember talking like kind of seriously talking to people about it but luckily I just I just never never went deep did you go deep in your bigger god I went six years in um wait what was so I built a company called Tilt and uh it was a social network for money and and that was the idea it was like oh what would be bigger than Facebook a social network built around money that would be bigger mix up PayPal and Facebook and it's bigger than both of them combined and I love it yeah exactly it was built for people to say I love it and it would be like it would be like you know the village of 200 people and you saying hey I'm gonna go get 17 bears and we're gonna eat for years and and everybody being like I love it go do it yeah um and then you getting out there and me getting out there and having no idea how to kill a bear much less 17 of them and for six years I'm building this company get to 100 employees um and we get to a 400 million dollar valuation and I'm 27 years old I'm like this must be the right I must be doing things right yeah fast forward um few two years later and we're selling the company in a fire sale um it is we end up selling it for a fraction of that after layoffs after going to the ER with a heart condition because I was drinking six seven cups of coffee every day wow and and thinking luckily Adderall gave me a headache I was prescribed it but gave me a headache thank god because if it didn't I that Adderall is probably the the biggest that's next to the opiate crisis and then maybe the benzo crisis uh that's coming after that the the thing we're gonna hear about in the next five to ten years is Adderall uh abuse and and it's so sticky I had to flush mine down the fucking toilet man like I have I'm I'm an addictive personality if it makes me feel good it's getting flushed down the toilet pretty much unless it's like my kids are my family you know I mean because I can't I won't stop eating it yeah well and that's sodvik so in and Vedanta and we've chatted about this before there's there's Thomas Rajas and sodvik and um and it dude that's pure Gita what you just said if it makes me feel good it's going down the toilet because and the Gita I think one of the the I think the most powerful contribution of the Gita is and the Bhagavad Gita for listen oh well it's your podcast you've talked about the Gita so your listeners know the Gita yeah but no please like dude I love the Gita I think the Gita is one of the most amazing one of my one of one of my teachers is two rooms over so I hope he's able to listen to this uh Joseph Emmett and uh and his teacher is is a teacher in in India uh Swami Parthasarthi if anyone's interested in this philosophy Vedanta treatise by Swami Parthasarthi that's what you should go read Vedanta treatise um and uh spell treatise but pronounce treatise and in the Gita which is a core a core text within Vedanta core text within Hinduism um it's so badass and Americans we never hear about it it's this prince who is this badass warrior and you know this so I'm going to do this for 60 seconds because you already know it but for listeners but I love hearing it like that's what that's one of the cool things about about it it's infinitely repeatable it never stops being cool to hear the story so do as long as you need to do I love the story and the story is like oxygen so if you're so right and that you can say it over and over again because you can't get enough and we're so starved of these ideals and you know humans being memetic creatures you know we we need these ideals to me to mine not memetic like a mean but memetic like a mind we look at these ideals and they inform us um they inform us like information but that's what gives us form is the ideal and in the Gita um I think next to the story of Christ these are the two most powerful narratives and ideals that uh we have that humans have ever come across and the Gita the story is this prince it's a 700 uh verse uh text that you could read an hour and a half um but the concept and it's it stands in this larger Mahabharata this epic that is like it's that thing would take you a two years to read through um it's very long but right in the geometric center of the Mahabharata the the epic is the is the Gita Bhagavad Gita and Song of the Lord and it's in the geometric center of the epic that's so cool so cool it's this there's just probably thousands of years to culminating a philosophical thought culminating in just this whole narrative structure of it's this civil war the epic is about this civil war between these two families and right in the middle of the civil war is the 700 verses called the Gita and right and the Gita what the Gita is again you know this but is a conversation between a charioteer and perhaps the most feared prince the most uh competent warrior prince Arjuna yeah and he is scared shitless yeah and he wants to go right in the middle of the two armies so in the geometric center of the Mahabharata you've got uh the Gita and the conversation in between this massive civil war that actually takes place in between the two armies in the middle of the battlefield and it's a conversation between Arjuna the warrior prince and his charioteer Krishna and the charioteer charioteer charioteer Krishna is the personification of God so he can't fight the battle but he can't inform what Arjuna can and should do and and he has this this conversation with his charioteer with God in this battle and and it's um it's just so beautiful so powerful and every one of us you know I mentioned some of these things that we're talking talking about might relate to 10 percent or 20 percent or 30 percent of listeners this relates to 100 percent of people listening to this conversation right now every one of us has a battle going on within within ourselves whatever that battle is there is some type of struggle and there is some type of decision to be made yeah to move forward and act or to shy away and Arjuna's problem his struggle even he's he's the most feared prince he's the most revered and feared prince so competent as a warrior and yet he's telling Krishna I don't think we should have this battle it's civil war and he is all you use this term the last time we talked which I love spiritual bypass we're all so smart we come up with brilliant justifications to not to not proceed in the face of fear and to not go into into whatever that battle is and by the way this isn't like an application for war or or anything that's a violent action Gandhi actually used the Gita towards as his reference for obviously one of the most peaceful revolutions in human history so it's it's not it's not for a literal you know battle that you feel like you might need to have but Arjuna is trying to shy away from this this war that I mean this is years in the making and he's saying no we should just quit now we should stop and the reason we should stop Krishna my my sage is because cousins shouldn't kill cousins yeah brothers killing brothers family shouldn't kill family and we should we should stop and Krishna's like basically in the American vernacular Krishna's like you pussy why wait you know what he said yes yes please this is my favorite line in the Gita that by the way I didn't know was in the middle of the Mahabharata so you've blown my mind because to think that in this the the dialogue that takes place between these two great armies is happening in the geometric center of this is just insane to think about that is crazy but the one of my favorite verses in it is uh it's translated into smiling in the midst of the two armies smiling in the midst of the two armies Krishna speaks so here so this this is the yes on one side you have the the the dejected prince it's so poetic he's dropped his sacred bow Gandava and he is saying I'm going to go into the woods and live as a renunciate wouldn't it be better to live in the forest than to you know to be stained with the blood of people who've been my teachers people who are in and that and he names earlier he's naming revered people on the other side that he absolutely loves and respects yeah yeah people he grew up with it's a family battle so it's like and so it is truly like and and also I think it's important to note and I do know it is important to say the fucking thing isn't an like advocating war it's because but not all wars are the same and sometimes whether you like it or not you have to fight there's no way around it there's nothing that can be done except to fight and in this case it was the they were they were philosophically correct in what was happening it wasn't there was a it was it was there wasn't some fuzzy maybe we should just back off this was justice justice the four he was in the rotten position of being the actualization of justice in the world and so that you know that and I think what's lovely about you you know bringing it into people's lives is that you know there's a big difference between me being like maybe I should send this shitty email to Janet and really let her know I fucking feel and me being like no I actually have to do something now that I don't want to do that is not it's you know like you know when it's time to get out of a relationship you know when it's time to get out of the job you know when it's time to like set things right there's a big in other words Arjuna knew in his heart I think the right thing and that otherwise it wouldn't have been it wouldn't have been a problem for him that's why he was tortured and I well I think I think the um and yes he said it with a smile on his face so it's like a friend telling another friend you pussy dude come on yes you know it's like it's like uh good well hunting and and um and you have you've got um you know Ben uh Affleck's character saying like dude you have to like if you're still here 20 years from now drinking beers in this construction site I'll kill you you got to act you have you have a mind you have a uh a capability and you've got to do something with it and your and your your friend telling you like dude get off your ass on the couch with a smile because it doesn't really matter to the friend this obviously doesn't matter to Krishna but it matters to Arjuna and and it matters to his community he needs to fight this war yeah and it's not only will uh he attain you know Krishna says um fame and heaven so prosperity and peace by action by fighting this war but he'll have neither if he doesn't and everyone's gonna die anyhow even if you think like I'm gonna go convince everybody let's peace out it's like no this battle is happening and you can either be a force of good of actually winning it or you can be a you know pu 55 why and go to you know sit under sit under a tree and the um and I think that the I bring up the the Gita one because by the way I think the midnight gospel is so Gita man pure Gita I I watched three episodes this week and it is pure Gita in that uh the Clancy character at least in the three that I saw this week the Clancy character has no reason no reason to go into these insane worlds and yet she's just like oh let's go let's go boom boom is there a time is okay because Clancy I'm not I I think this is there's certain aspects of it where I've I'm not going to interpret it for anybody but Tim like you'll as you keep watching you'll begin to see that Clancy is trying to his maybe like it's attempted to go out into the woods and not deal with his life but in this case the woods are the he's in the the chromatic ribbon and like because that because you know that that um you'll see as you continue to watch but this was it was thank you I I hope it did capture some of that that uh that story because I think I think there it is the story if you're a human being is the story like you you are in the in the grand scheme of things you are being asked to do something that seems impossible and is scary and is terrifying in it you can't it's not something that is going to let you just phone it in like you got to fucking do it and and there's just no way around it and uh and then the grand scheme of things is different for everybody but then every single day every single fucking day you find yourself in a situation where you can choose between and it's like what you said earlier you can decide between running away from something trying to evade something or like helping people and letting that be your path letting the path of peace letting because it's a hell of a lot easier isn't it just like sit on the couch and like and that's not peace and just as a call as something that requires um an underscoring yes sitting on the couch is not peace and anyone that sat on the couch for more than six weeks straight knows the mental agitation the tor the torture that goes on in our heads and that's because we are created to create and creation and and creation is informed action yeah so we are created to act we you know the real the real statue of the Buddha should have been him walking because everyone sees him sitting down but he was walking all over India he wasn't just sitting under the banyan tree until he died that mofo was in constant action walking all over India teaching constantly it was not this reclusive renunciation although that can be its own peace and its own action and its own right if you're called that way but the the the important thing is to heed that call towards towards action and to not or at least to avoid the unnecessary um torment of action then you want informed action and uh I think that's where a philosophical informed action informed action and that's where I think a philosophical rudder is is so important the I mean we chat about peace then prosperity that's that informed action to not go towards prosperity think it okay I'll get peace on the other side the informed actions oh wait don't sacrifice that peace right now because I won't get it on the other side unless I start there but you gotta do what that you have to just like you said tune into the Dharma what is the thing and also important to note is that Arjuna was not alone there he was in the presence of God right and was connected to that and also this the other thing I love about it we talked about it off mike is he was still not wanting to listen to us to him you know that was what's cool is like I love that such a very human thing is like it's not just and also when you look in in most mythologies not all of them but most mythologies anytime a human gets the quote it's obviously good fortune but in the moment it seems like misfortune of being invited by the divine to go and do some insane thing I mean look at Moses they're always like I think you have got the wrong number friend you I hope if not I hope you've got the rail yeah you wait because it's not me Moses had a fucking speech impediment you know and a bush is telling him to go I didn't know that yeah that was that I was yeah apparently had some kind of stutter or something so it was it was like here you have a burning bush telling a stuttering person to like walk into Egypt and free his people and so there was it's just like I think you got the wrong wrong person well the the and the reason that the Gita came up even though I'm always especially for you like we you are a surfer that can handle 50 foot waves of philosophical conversation so I love I love one and case in point bring up the Gita and you're telling me parts of it that I think I missed the smiling aspect smiling in the midst of the two armies yeah yeah smiling so so good and and the reason I brought up the Gita was I think one of the most profound informed insights of the Gita that has helped me is is that what is bitter in the beginning is sweet in the end and what is sweet in the beginning is bitter in the end yeah and to you recognizing if something makes you feel good you throw it down the toilet that is so so in that is such informed action that is so beautiful and thanks I'm glad you see like that because I'm always embarrassed like anytime I'm like dumping pills or drugs into the toilet it means I've punched the ticket so it's always kind of like a it's like a funeral because I'm like because it's just like well because you know I Adderall what a wonderful high I mean I'm sorry I gave you a headache but dear god like there's a reason everyone likes to take fucking Adderall it's like it's like it's a wonderful thing I do have ADHD it it did serve a purpose at some point in my life but you gotta have that honest at some point you gotta be like okay wow you have insomnia huh wow I wonder why you're not sleeping what could it be right let's go through the I'm not a doctor but I can go through the list long long list of things that it could be there's like a thousand things it could be let me see it let me see is it well maybe it's this horror novel I'm reading is could that be what's keeping me up at night oh I need to turn my phone is it is it the hundred milligrams of speed or is it I need to turn my phone I need to delete Facebook and Instagram it's not the speed I think it's no I was sitting at dinner with a friend of mine once who had insomnia and we were talking and you know she was saying she has a really rough time sleeping it's the end of the meal and you know the waiter comes by and it's like okay anyone want to search like I think I'll have some espresso and I was like do you often order coffee did you know she had insomnia at this point she was talking about you know having insomnia so but I you know I don't want to be a jerk or anything but only because I recognize in her my own my own self it's like when I was addicted to ketamine it's like whoa why am I not sleeping I mean surely it's not that I'm doing rails of ketamine at fucking midnight could this be keeping me up maybe you know I but I think that so for me I like that you see that is a good thing for me I always it is like it's a sad and embarrassing moment where it's like I couldn't keep my hand from putting these tablets into my mouth so now I can't have the tablets around anymore and thank god it works you know I was telling my wife I dumped the fucking Adderall I can't do that shit anymore and she's like Duncan like you can't just have them refill the prescription if you want it's like no it's symbolic it is of course I could do that but it's like uh it's saying goodbye you know you gotta say goodbye to it if it's not working anymore you gotta acknowledge that sorry for the long no that's no that's you know that's um I asked my teacher uh once about what should I um if there's something that I really want that I know is not good for me and it actually was related to chocolate um but this but this was metaphorical I was I asked him the dumbest of uh tactical things to the grandest of questions but I was asking I was like dude I'm eating too much chocolate we like put it in our fridge and every night I'm just like oh it's dark chocolate so it's it's good for me but it's the really lazy it's like 55 percent it's not the really dark chocolate okay and so it's basically just candy and I'm yeah eating so much of it and I asked him I was like what what would the Vedantic viewpoint be of of how to stop um this this craving for chocolate that I have every night and he said um do it with the intention of stopping it wow and I was like okay he's not saying don't do it he's not saying suppress the that desire but do it with the intention of stopping it and by god I stopped it probably I don't know seven eight days later it was just it eroded the that informed that informed part of that action became bigger and bigger and bigger so that I think it's it's not just symbolic that's that's the I think that's the action on the other side of information of you knowing like this is what I need to do I need to watch this I need to do this yes anytime I get addicted to something and I'm not ashamed to say it happens more frequently not so much these days I'm I'm running out of things to get addicted to anybody have any suggestions let me know that and you are so self-deprecating you are I think you are do you have a lot of wisdom to share and I love that you have this podcast I love that you get to talk to millions of people I can't believe I get to talk to you man this this is so fun to talk about but you know like the I've heard Ramdas talk about addiction and it's there's a YouTube clip of him talking about it and it's quite controversial for people who because you know some people they can't use to quit and those are like you know like like chronic alcoholics I have people I love whose lives have been saved by 12 steps you know and like they're like no you don't you don't see the thing is like if I smell a beer if I if I you know if I if a beer gets in my mouth there's a biochemical reaction that probably will I'll end up in jail probably like I'll just go to jail from that it's a disease and I get it so there's that there's like a it's a genetic disorder I think it affects one out of four people or something and I know there's a lot of argument regarding addiction theory and all that but I just know people whose lives have been saved I'm just making this as a preface before I talk about this other way of doing it because someone listening you might be somebody looking for an excuse to get fucked up but you know if you get fucked up it's never worked out for you and if you drink and you're like this time I'm drinking to quit you're gonna end up in jail or dead or something so don't do that but there's another version of it where if you do like just bring mindfulness into the equation so for me that that looks a lot like what you're saying which is if I'm taking a if I if it where I am now fully mindful of the fact that I am I am out of control I'm I don't it's not serving me anymore there's no use coming from it it's not helping me do anything other than giving me this like very fleeting feeling that leads to a rotten fucking crash then in that mindset that's how I'll take the pill you know thinking like here we go so what let's just try this again and see if this time it works like you know it's not you know you don't like it anymore it makes you feel sick you're so tired you're so over it but we're gonna take it again and then what your teacher told you that's when it starts working for me where it's like I become so it's informed action informed action yeah but it's revolting I'm no I don't want to be a slave of some pharmaceutical fucking company or some stupid tab I don't like the way it feels it makes me feel so weak I'm a dad I don't want to be like a fucking like I'm not taking like their people I know have to take it or they won't get out of their fucking house you know they're like they they're they have ADHD and it helps it makes their life better but the moment that stops happening you got to be honest and get flushed the pills I'm sorry everybody that's sorry I know that's it well what is that might be a bummer for people to hear but what is better in the beginning is sweet in the end and and that's that is that is it that the person listening is I'm listening to this thinking about okay what are the things that I know are sweet in the beginning but I know are better in the end better at the end that I need to reorient myself towards what is so it's it's not just that I have anything figured out but for the listeners that are dealing with something I was addicted to caffeine because Adderall gave me headaches I would have been massively addicted to Adderall caffeine is brutal dude it's it is so brutal it is obviously one of the most powerful drugs in the world second biggest import in in the country behind oil to give you a sense an economic sense of our addiction to it I was drinking six to seven cups of coffee a day and it was just this first for a handful of different reasons they ended up sending me to the ER with a heart condition but is your condition better I did I ended up having an operation I I can drink about one coffee a day wow and I I typically drink matcha green tea um because it's far better it's just a better it's basically nature's time-release caffeine so I don't crave another coffee you know two hours three hours later but the um the that that concept of informed action of eating that chocolate or whatever it is for for you listening to this knowing with the intention of wanting to stop yeah that's it's so powerful because then you start to in your case you start to become more and more aware of even that you're almost like choosing to um or through an informed sense ruining the set and setting to have that drug to have that pill you're like yes oh I know this isn't a good set and setting this probably isn't going to be a good trip and then it ends up being becoming true it's the same for you pick up the bottle and you're like this isn't going to be good and it's the set and setting for you know is is so critical for any um experience not just drugs but the um I think that that is anyone listening to that it's like this is a bummer this is a fucking you know downer to here that I the the siren song that I need to curb whatever it is that is the Gita and it's not a uh hey you need to run away from bliss as a prince and go into death man you gotta do it it's just gotta be better for you it's not it's the reverse it's you need to run in what you think might be death and you're going to have absolute bliss on the other side so for anyone listening and thinking this is a bummer and so you know buzz kill dude this is the gateway to the ultimate buzz yeah it is like that is the good freedom man it's like everyone's always yapping about freedom they want freedom this it is the Bhagavad Gita is about freedom real freedom actual liberation not like you know pretending that you're free because you can gratify your senses or do you know whatever your mind is telling you to do at any given moment that's not freedom that's that's complete imprisonment and and and and yeah I it's that's that's why that book is so liberating is it's just a god telling someone about how to be free and not just in one way that's the other beautiful thing about it is there's it's different like it's it's sort of categorizing all the yogic systems within it like some people do this some people do this some people do this swadharma your own nature and and yeah through the information it's what I love about Vedanta is it's so practical um it is so practical there are no rituals there are no um there are no it's it was a critique on culture it's not this cultural thing you're you jump into where there's rituals there are no shouts shall and you know thou shouts and shall not there are no there's no even real concept of sin the only concept that gets close to is uh to sin is that which agitates you so it's not like oh you broke a rule that this this person up above gave you and and your probation is now going to be revoked and you're going to be in prison it's actually like oh no you just hurt yourself you that's your own agitation so you know if someone let's say eating meat to someone is is agitates them well then it's a sin and it's in that area code at least that they shouldn't do it because it's agitating for someone else I can eat meat not care then that's not a sin there is no you know list of of commandments but within Vedanta what is so beautiful about it is so the path to liberation moksha avana enlightenment whatever the term is because you know language breaks down when you get to this this point of things but the the path there is through action and the action that you want to take is informed action so you're constantly just drinking from the fire hose of information of knowledge so that you're making sure your action is it's your compass the information is your compass but you still got to do the walk but obviously every as much as you can you want to make sure you're on course and that information aspect you hear the a knowledge nuclear bomb I'd love to tell listeners a few of the other knowledge nuclear bombs that have gone off in my life uh lately and or in the last few years that really I couldn't unhear um because they made too much sense and the knowledge bomb goes off you look down and you see oh north is this way and you shift course um yeah and it's that it's that uh simple you know oh north is over here you start to shift course it's not like I don't get this but I guess I'm gonna do it because then there's gonna be some I don't know some reward on the other it's like no this makes absolute practical sense so that informed action is the path towards liberation towards bliss and within that informed action you just you end up spending so much time informing yourself and it's very much like an addiction they call it I'm sure you're super familiar harm reduction therapy as a as a potential uh compliment or potential replacement of 12 steps harm reduction therapy is yes you can harm yourself but let's aim you aim for you to reduce that harm over time by actually informing you how you are harming yourself yeah as much as possible that's cool no I'm not familiar with that I've heard of harm reduction and but I've never heard of like harm reduction there I'm completely not familiar with that that's really cool well the the gist of it is um and I run at one of the companies that I run is a beverage company and we donate uh five cents from every bottle I'll send you some uh it's five cents from every bottle towards uh mental health services for the under housed and poor and we you we go through a partnership with this organization that that practices harm reduction what's the what's that this company I don't want to make it a commercial for it but it's called magic mind it'll change your life it's the best product that you've ever heard and it's going to uh put a couple extra commas in your bank account magicmind.co are you kidding no I'm joking the uh I didn't want to make a commercial but if it's gonna be a commercial I'm gonna make it the most badass commercial wait no what do you mean the commas what I didn't mean are you kidding I mean how does that it'll add it'll add a couple extra zeros in your bank first of all James you are welcome to do any commercials you want no it's not like you're doing snake oil over here you've got like a you've got a track record it's okay people are listed I'm sure no no one's like no not a commercial listen to my fucking commercials you know what I mean no nobody's like trust me you can do it well I don't I uh it's called yeah magic mind and it is a matcha uh neutropic uh functional mushroom um energy shots it's what I what I had to do when I went to the ER my doctor was like you can't drink more than 80 milligrams of caffeine a day uh and I was like what it was that three cups of coffee two cups of coffee he's like no that's a half a cup of coffee and I was running a company at that time 50 employees 15 meetings a day 26 I just was and out of my mind chugging I mean I say six to seven cups of coffee I was probably drinking much more than that because you were doing way more than that that's the coffee I was also drinking Red Bulls and it was just stimulants I later learned that people with ADD um typically go towards stimulant um addiction yeah and people with trauma typically go towards um depressants which is makes sense may yeah very interesting but it made sense and if you got both you do speedball yeah exactly if you got both there's an option for you to combine and uh you're not left out but the um so I was just addicted to stimulants and and so when he said you can only drink 80 milligrams of caffeine a day I was like and told me it was a half a cup of coffee because at first I was like okay what is that three cups four I can probably I knew I needed to cut it down so I guess half a cup of coffee I was like there is no fucking way I can get through 15 meetings a day running this company on half a cup of coffee so then he said you should switch to matcha green tea it has this stuff in it called elthinine that decreases your cortisol your body's stress hormone that is getting spiked every time you're drinking cup of coffee and I just thought my anxiousness my stress was coming from thought it was coming from running a company but it was actually heavily contributed to uh right by the five six seven hundred milligrams of caffeine I was drinking a day Jesus Christ I mean up toward towards a gram but the um the uh so within this company I wanted to support the whole concept of of kind of my approach to things is mental wealth and if people want to google mental wealth you can see a post I wrote about it and I love that thing you sent it to me I read it it's brilliant oh I love it so smart man it's a really really smart way to convey some like pretty deep Vedic ideas but in kind of like a cool western way it's really smart man really thank you so much yeah the uh that's that uh work towards mental wealth it's magic minor that rituals part of it uh sleep diet exercise stress management and then exogenous compounds like um matcha green tea or coffee if that's your you know thing or Adderall if that's your thing within reason yeah but the abuse part that got me into this uh this vein of wanting to support mental health for the other house in the port the homeless I started the company at San Francisco and there's a massive homelessness epidemic there so and within that realm the best organizations I found they were practicing harm reduction therapy that that was psychotherapy also with um with substance abuse therapy and and ultimately getting people you know it's it's like you look at the homelessness issue and you say well is it mental health or is it substance abuse and it's like it's the same thing oh I got you I know what you're talking about I got you and and so within that substance abuse there is abstinence and 12 step and then there's harm reduction where it's it's just therapeutic sessions where you can come in you they actually have stations where you can use you yeah I'm all for that that's the salute to me that is the you've talked about that before yeah yeah you talked about that on jre before this bullshit where it's like no we before they can have housing they've got to like be off drugs and sober it's like well then they're not gonna fucking take the goddamn housing you think they want to be shooting up in a tent no but they want to be shooting up and they'd rather be shooting up in a tent than like in a place where they're not like able to take the thing that if they don't take they get sick they they could die they have seizures like it's way the ship is sailed man I get harm reduction I love that you're involved in that and that's so cool and so when I started to look at the organizations that had the best reputations of helping the poor they all tended to be harm reduction therapy organizations and San Francisco is the tip of the spear of the amount of funding the the number of experiments being tried to help the homeless the amount of funding just the amount of energy and so I kept seeing this and I was like shit that's informed action yeah that is information first then do what you want and that's what Krishna says in the Gita's now you have the information you have the knowledge do as you do as you will that's the end of the Gita it's it's you don't even know what happens in the battle you want to hear by the way for 60 seconds you hear the coolest part about the Gita that I only heard recently yes one of the coolest parts of it is that do you know the story right before the Gita the Mahabharat yeah there you mean Ram and Sita a little bit but actually right before the Gita starts you have you have the Kaurava and the the you have both princes I can't diet Dio dice I'm gonna forget the other princes name Arjuna and Dio Drona Duro Dashtra or something yes something like that yes Drona Drona Diro Drona maybe Joseph won't hear me and he'll yell it to me um the so the two rasta no it's Dio Dio something but the what is it Duryodhana Duryodhana yes he did hear me so you have Arjuna like an enlightened voice echoes in from somewhere dude you got to keep your teachers close man you gotta keep them so close um he really is uh just such a christian-esque guide in my life um and uh and so because I am totally the the Arjuna character that the foolish character that's trying to get out of battles left and right um but right right before it starts uh Krishna tells them um basically you shouldn't fight this war um like this is it's stupid um to do it um they're both like no we're doing this this has to go down this is right before Arjuna has his breakdown and tries to get out of it but he's already committed to it at that point but before he's committed to it it's like you shouldn't have this war it is pointless and they're like no we have to have this war it's going down and and Krishna says all right fine and he goes and takes a nap and and they go find him afterwards to try to elicit his help uh solicit his help and and he wakes up from his nap and he looks at Arjuna first he just happens to look at Arjuna first and and Arjuna is kind of the good prince the bad prince so good and and evil yeah and he says uh they say will you help us uh we Arjuna says will you help me in um and he says look this is what I'll do um I can't fight in the war but I'll give my army to one of you and uh and I'll give my sage council to the other and I'll give my advice to the other and Arjuna and this is an army of like 50 000 sorry I mean this is a god's army 50 000 soldiers and Arjuna is like I want you wow I don't want an extra 50 000 god's soldiers oh yeah so cool that's so cool just thinking he'd just woken up from a nap yeah yeah first of all just I never knew that story it's incredibly beautiful to acknowledge the fact that god takes naps makes me love Krishna that much more you know and also it's like the it is like the coolest thing to be around two people have decided to go into this incredible warm like all right well oh right we're gonna go take a nap pure detachment yeah that's beautiful I love that and obviously the wisdom behind it of course it's like who cares about all the other shit it doesn't matter like you want the navigator you know that's the most important thing anyone can have a fucking boat yeah but that's right you know you you're telling me I don't get me in a boat like in a sailboat we're dead meat man a big battalion with no GPS yeah doomed right James I one of the one of the reasons that I know that we're going to be friends forever is because whenever I start talking to you time evaporates and I I leap forward in time I'm looking now at what time it is and we have spent just around two hours talking and I can't think of a better place to end than now even though there are many other bombs that you set off let's can we will you come back are we and I will be on if you want me on your yes not an entrepreneur no the podcast is for creators of all kinds of all kinds I mean that okay and people need to hear the real story not just see oh Duncan just blows up on the scene and is this massive massively influential hilarious comedian they need to hear the long-form version and and the part of you that informs you day to day because that I love what it comes out and so much of you can't keep it from coming out in the conversations you have but I would love for you to come on the podcast and talk about it in James anytime I I'm so thank you and also thanks for all this off mic stuff and the emails you've been sending me like instant my life is and I'm not exaggerating when I say just like some of the data you've given me it's like really shifted the way I've been doing some stuff that was all off balance so I'm so down to help you with that getting things in order I think it's you know it's there's there's the place in which you build your your rocket platform the platform itself then the rocket and then the destination want to go and I think if I think for myself the philosophical viewpoint is where you are going to station your your platform and launch the rocket the platform itself which I talked about with Vedanta the platform is mental wealth of people want to google it of just sleep diet exercise stress management and exogenous compounds in that order in that prioritization that's the solid platform that you've launched you know you if you have the most amazing rocket you launch it off of a shitty platform what is the point and then the rocket is the tactics and things in your day-to-day which I think is very subjective not it would be hard for me to give any impossible for me to give any generic advice on that but but then on that destination piece that's that's where it all begins and ends of I love this in business and in the startup world I got this advice from a mentor one time that said start from success and work backwards don't start from today and work forwards so for people listening that that are interested in entrepreneurial path or anything that that is in the creative realm start from success where you want to be and then start working backwards from that and that gets you the right sequence god bless you james thank you so much all the links you need to find james are going to be at dougatrustle.com but what are you what's your twitter what's the ad at james bechara and uh

Hello dear friends, it is I, D Trussell, and you are listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour Podcast. For those of you who may not be familiar with who I am, because you've tuned in for the Will Oldham interview, I am a 64 year old lesbian botanist living in New Zealand. Sorry about that you guys, I was at a party and some assholes spilled cutting on my computer and ever since then it's been assuming the identities of random people on the planet or assuming the universal identity or quoting Krishna Murthy. But to find out who you are, who you are, not who the speaker is, is far more important. And to find out who you are, you have to enquire, you are the story of mankind. I am going to have to take this to the Apple store, it just keeps pumping out theosophists, the messiahs, and little Alan Watts clips, and the whole thing is warping and out of the frames of the universe, so I just want to get this great episode up with Will Oldham. Hello, I grow old, I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled, shall I park my hair behind, do I dare to eat a peach, I shall wear white flannel trousers and walk upon the beach, I have heard the mermaid singing each to each, I do not think that they will sing to me, I have seen them riding seaward on the waves, combing the white hair of the waves blown back when the wind blows the water white and black, we have lingered in the chambers of the sea, by sea girls reased with seaweed red and brown, till human voices wake us and we drown. Alright, I gotta take this to the Apple store. Boom! Got it fixed! Sorry about that, you guys, as it turns out, the ketamine had gotten into the motherboard and summoned some kind of interdimensional caterpillar family that had built a chapel inside my computer and they had been singing hymns to the universal truth that we are all one beautiful, orgasmic consciousness unfolding into time and it was fucking with my memory chips, not a technical guy, I'm not going to pretend that I understand even what that means, but we are back!

beautiful delightful and genius will hold them us hey will thanks so much for being on the show man thanks for having me uh that that that when you when you were just testing microphones you had the little took took took metronome yeah metronome is that going on right now no metronome's off i'm not going to encourage you to do this right now but i would say you should do a test conversation slash interview sometime with the metronome going good idea like as a beat so that people are like no the pace of the conversation no the pace of the conversation but it adds you know adds a kind of an urgency to it potentially because we'd had a fantasy it was you know one of many unrealized ideas but years ago i approached greg turkington asking him to provide me with live audio for a kneel hamburger set yeah sure with the idea that we would remix it cut out most of the pauses and give it a beat so that the experience would you'd be listening to a comedy record or a comedy recording but it'd be like boom boom boom great idea with the jokes in there and no pauses between the jokes necessarily just like go go go yeah but we never did it why i'm not well as we all just before you push record i i don't know my gear very well so oh yeah so i would need a i would need a partner a good partner with that i want to talk so i was right before he hit record i was trying to open up to will by saying audio file you're no no before that i said man i'm a little nervous to do this interview because um and just so we get this out of the way and then we'll dive into the the real kind of gotta get out of the way i'm so sorry to say it yeah but i this is as i'm sitting like god damn i got i'm gonna talk with will olden what's the first question for will olden and i just kept thinking like well everybody must come up to you and say to you we have wept during your your music has been the soundtrack for me personally weeping for breakups and getting back together and you know like the sweetness of life and the stuff in your your voice isn't is there sort of like shining this light into these moments that all of us are having and so um i'm sorry i just had to get that out of the way i have no idea what happens on the other side so that's good to hear it i guess yeah well i mean or does it get annoying i don't know does it become overwhelming to hear these like drooling people are like my god it really doesn't happen that often because our existence is relatively i don't know people yeah every once in a while people will send a nice letter or something like that and then i get some kind of an understanding and otherwise it's kind of based on trust because it's been going on making the music has been going on for such a long time and i'm allowed to continue to make music because people are you know receiving it and and trading in what i like to think is hard earned money for it that makes me think like oh well it whether if people don't want me to make any more music they just have to stop right yeah but so as soon as money comes in and think okay good i can make more music and and just but other than that i have no idea what it's i know what i'm making it for but i don't know if people are using it for that so it's good to hear the people cool that's great because why even think about that right there's getting caught up in that side of the thing could possibly disrupt the flow it could possibly disrupt well because yeah what yeah i wouldn't because it's also so vast yeah and different right because every listening experience is bound to be fairly unique oh yeah even though you were sort of saying like all these people or these experiences but everyone is you know specific and unique from every other one yeah so i'm listening to your music because i'm falling in love with a girl somebody else is listening to your music is there like butchering a pig in some basement somewhere who knows there's no way to tell what what what cracks and crevices and crannies it's soaking into throughout the world right yeah i mean i was thinking the other day and maybe i think this every five years or so about trying to be a little more proactive with with that and you know writing a song that specifically saying oh i'm gonna write a song specifically about this place or this activity knowing that people will then you know tag it and listen to it in that when they're on the road trip to you know wherever you know wichita we're going to wichita oh let's put that wichita awesome where's the wichita playlist that's awesome but i don't know if i'll ever do that that's a hilarious theme out many ways just a bunch of i sing a cake what's that cake i sing song taking a bath that's a taking a bath is a good one yeah because yeah when you're taking a bath what's the song splish splash right every time because is there another one no that's well there's ernie's rubber ducky splish splash ernie's rubber ducky and lame is a rob is a classic bath there's a bath song no just the whole thing is like if you're going to like lay in the if you're going to take a bath listen to lame is a rob lights and candles oh you got to try it it's perfect yeah but that's not something that people go for right it doesn't have bath lyrics in it does it no yeah i'm talking about bath lyrics i know i mean i was like being in the sewers with like holding a child's body which is kind of a bath yeah kind of satanic way yeah yeah so speaking of child's body i'm this this like they're both of these dogs are sitting here with me this one is sitting up because she just ate and she has a condition called mega esophagus where esophagus has no like musculature or definition so every time she eats she has to sit up for about 10 to 15 minutes so that because the esophagus isn't pushing the food into her stomach so gravity is doing it yeah does she this is this the is this the thing you not that you not you have to do with her you have to do it with her yeah every time otherwise the foods like if she now it's about time that she can get down and she can do whatever she wants but you know the food otherwise would just sort of sit here in her what should be her esophagus and it won't move down eventually she'll have problems breathing she'll start coughing and she'll just cough it up undigested she may inhale some of that gets into her lungs and because the the doctor's like oh yeah they dive pneumonia at some point they will die of pneumonia because it's that's just what happens to these dogs does she know that she has to sit in your lap no no she's pretty good she's pretty good about it she doesn't get too and when you when you got this sweetie you guys if you could see these dogs they truly are if a sunbeam fell out of heaven and turned into dogs that's what you got these are real gold standard pups here but did you know that that was a condition when you know picked up because i don't think she had like so there was a woman who was sort of took care of my mom for four or five years and she at one point about four years ago almost four years ago said i've got you know my dogs are giving or having a litter and i'm going to give you one of the puppies and didn't ask me if i wanted to puppy but just said i'm going to give you one and gave me this one and then she and she kept that one and got rid of the rest of the litter gave him away and then last summer she died she died last summer so we started taking this one just for play dates for the weekend from the widower and then eventually she moved in with us and then i think she developed the megasophagus because she started like yeah every time she ate oh she's she sort of ballooned we didn't know like suddenly ballooned and then she started just yeah regurgitating her food fully we took her in and the reason that she ballooned was because she kept trying to work the food down by swallowing and she would just swallow air so she was ballooned with gas so she was like a little balloon literally like a little balloon then they x-rayed her and showed just like that there was no formal esophagus existing in her man that's a really intense service to do for a little being is every day it is like wait but it's such a strange thing because she's normal otherwise she's not in pain yes see it's it's you can't really justify putting her down some people would some people would yeah instantly they'd be like god that's just poise just poison her and you can't also pawn her off on somebody because you're saying like you want to every time this dog you know watch be sure this that you know every time this dog eats and when it eats when she eats you hold her up or put her we put her in a backpack and she's also got a little wooden chair called a bailey chair which some folks that make for dogs with mega esophagus which is a badass name for a condition yeah for a second i honestly thought you were met you are just like mega esophagus yeah man you know do you when stuff like that happens where you end up in a kind of karmic obligation to a being yeah do you ever fantasize about reincarnation and then some previous incarnation the little puppy helped you and you made a deal no not so specifically but yeah that that makes yeah i mean that's what the understanding of karma the best it can be right is that you are imagining that it's related to something that's happened before will happen after yeah yeah yeah never specifically i don't think specifically it's like this idea of like the sort of way where all this continuum of energy and and so from the perspective of millennia we have all been everyone's mother we've all been everyone's baby we've all been everyone's friend yeah and so you're always trading places and so here is this little being yeah the most innocent helpless of creatures yeah and you have now a lifetime deal with this being you're every time this puppy eats twice a day yeah you are going to cradle this dog so the dog can digest food or throw her in her belly chair yeah or put her on your backpack in the backpack yeah exactly but you have to be witness i always thought like i never wanted a pet in my adult life because i always thought i don't want to have to be a witness to every time this creature takes the ship to me that's always just seemed like a bizarre relationship to have like you have to be aware of every time you're like taking a creature into your life and with a dog specifically more so than the cat because they just hide in litter boxes or whatever but the dog you have to be kind of especially like in new york city absolutely every single shit that the dog takes you're a part of that's right and to me i just thought i'm not sure if that's that's not the kind of relationship that i want to have with any living creature no the shape the color the consistency you witness it yeah you participate in it yeah you pick it up yeah i know the warmth of my dog's shit because i have these little bags i carry around so i know the specific heat of my dog's shit yeah yeah but yeah exactly you know yeah she's you know you know them at that most intimate level i mean the relationship of course mirrors that of having a child when you have an infinite you know your child's shits very well right you have to be familiar with them so you know if the baby's okay but it doesn't progress or develop the most you can hope for is an inner progression or development in terms of your relationship to that but it doesn't you're never going it's the dog's never going to take care of its own never i mean these dogs kind of can because we're not in new york city we have a fenced in yard they can go out and yeah you know i i'm aware usually when they yeah and and gg doesn't she she she's more fond of not shitting in her own yard also so we're a little bit aware of that but yeah in in the city you have to you really it's always going to be there i've got a little backyard thank god so you do open up the door in the city run down yes i do so they run down and shit yeah you're still aware of it though right yeah absolutely i know just do it yeah well yeah exactly because i have to make sure they go shit because if they don't they'll shit in the house so i have to like right sometimes usher them down there but yeah you're the conductor of your dog shit you're you have to be the thing behind it and that's a heavy obligation because sometimes you don't feel like it i mean there's got to be days you don't feel like massaging like sitting i don't know these are cuties but sometimes you're in a hurry or something you know it's it's in a very strange way yeah you would think that but in a strange way it almost doesn't enter into the equation like i'd you know there's a niggling little thought that says that there's resentment about what's required of you know by these pups yes but it's just like a lightning bug 40 feet away it's not a it's not a strong right signal that you know and you would think this is fucking ridiculous this is so but i instead it's like oh well you know it balances out like my life is pretty good with these things and so it just balances out yeah and this is um there's this idea that and you know whenever whenever anyone assigns some purpose to humanity or says this is what people are here for it's usually pretty ridiculous and maybe a dangerous thought but one of the ideas i've heard is the purpose of a human being is to serve have you ever heard that before like our purpose here is to serve in some way i think that's on Muhammad Ali's grave really yeah which is just like a mile from here you all can check it out oh wow if you want to but yeah his it's it's something about you know that that's that's it that's the that's the purpose that's the purpose and this is like the the harry christians talk about this which is so because humans are meant so their idea is that the purpose is for us to be servants of god and but people are amnesiac to that purpose so what ends up happening is they sort of become servants of all these other things because they're like robots yeah that are filling fulfilling some kind of primary directive but they have lost track of the thing they were originally supposed to connect with so they're connecting with the thing in these sort of deluded forms you know everything is an expansion of the original you know progenitive force so when you're like taking care of the puppy you are worshiping god but their idea is that this can be refined and sort of shifted to some kind of absolute source but is there a group of people who are aware that we assign ourselves our roles by figuring out like if you respond to that do you respond to that yeah i i get a little confused by it because it's like well it seems like a cute little puppy is definitely more the kind of god i'd be into hanging out with than the iconography that you see in different religions yeah yeah that's true yeah but i mean do you yeah i guess respond like if you recognize if that pushes your button that that statement yes right then that just means that that is your role but it isn't necessarily somebody else's role right they don't recognize that statement and the truth of that statement then it's not their job that's right so it's kind of you know you if you recognize and it pushes your buttons you think shit you know i guess it's my job to serve because i because it makes sense to me i understand it makes yeah i like doing dishes yeah i like doing dishes you know like we got we got rid of the dishwasher and put shelves where the dog food here where the you know but i also like doing dishes at other people's house me too highest stupid you know but it yeah it's just like but i know you know i i have friends and relatives who's do not feel that and you can't that's not it right that's not their job it's not but it's not their job well this is with in that so it's your job to do the dishes my job to do the dishes but it's not because you're called we have other yeah we have the call and and and and you know it's so funny about it man it's like and i don't know i don't mean to keep bringing up the heart christians but it's one of the highest jobs at a heart christian temple is to do the dishes right so if you get to do the dishes that's like a really big deal to get to do that and so like when you're doing the dishes in a heart christian temple which i got to not for any as a mark of anything my brother was hanging out there and he's like come come feel this and when you're doing the dishes back there holy shit you get high as a kite right on nothing yeah you've had that experience that kind of mysterious intoxication that comes from some spiritual act absolutely i mean we we went on saturday night we went to a house show at our friend's house and and she usually combines an early evening potluck with the house shows and she did and at a certain point between acts between musicians went in and was doing the dishes you know i also knew we were going to leave early we don't like go for the late night hang usually and at some point she came in and talked to me for a minute and i had this fear yeah where that she was going to stop me you know or say you don't have to do that yeah and she never once did she just carried on a great conversation she seemed very happy and then she walked away and i felt so great i was just like finally i got to just do my job yes and nobody bothered me about it nobody said good work or you don't have you nobody said anything about just let me do my job yeah and i knew that she was happy that i was doing it though because it was her kitchen and it was a mess yep but yeah it was it was like yeah and that relationship yeah and that that is such sophistication because that relationship is so forgotten in our world which is so you're at your house you serve some meal and people some saint goes and starts washing your dishes yeah and then you want to be like no no no no there's a big show you put on it's very similar to pulling your wallet out to pay yeah no no no no no no no no no no don't you touch one of those dishes yeah get out of here i'll do it yeah and it's and the moment you allow the flow to happen anyone who puts their hands in a sink full of dirty dishes wants to do it for the most part you know yeah in somebody else's house absolutely i'm not talking yeah not somebody who is forced to do but anybody who just voluntarily walks up and sticks their hand in there let them go yes and and that's so so you it's like giving and receiving like it's easier to give than it is to receive quite often and so the gift of getting your dishes done by someone you have to be able to receive it and if you don't receive it you not only do you cut off this beautiful energetic flow that's happening in the universe but you it's like taking a cupcake out of somebody's hand or something yeah yeah yeah you know which is ridiculous it's and this is where we all everyone gets confused about the fact that work is quite satisfying and and a really beautiful in all forms you know so yeah but yeah you're right you can't then be like hey you know if you were really advanced you would love to do dishes because now you're the biggest cunt that ever walked no no again i you know different yeah fortunately different people have different callings yeah right well and this is unfortunately i'm called to yeah oversee a dog with mega esophagus and to do people's dishes yeah you know i would if i had to choose maybe i would if i'm you know if god said here's 20 callings pick picked some might not have picked either one of those but no they feel great you pick having them they're great you pick music well that i mean music in the same way music kind of feels like it picked it was a certain point where you recognize there are things that you you can't do something else and if you don't do the thing that you can do then you don't have any you'll be lost right yeah and i've heard pretty stern warnings about this before not only will you like the warnings are should you be called to some whatever the thing may be yeah and you avoid that job yeah not only will you be lost but it'll kill you like look at jim carrey what's that i said look at jim carrey what do you mean he's not doing what he's called to do and he's insane you mean the the the thing he's doing with this nihilism thing what is he doing now with nihilism he is well i've seen him do paintings he's doing paintings but also he's sort of so everyone is um and i've i i have been getting people like you should have him on your podcast because he's gone into this kind of you should my avadi style so um have you heard the term my avadi no so i think it's called my avadi uh so essentially the idea is okay the god presents god self in many different ways one of them is the personified form mega esophagus dog yeah one of that's not personified though but yeah i think it's personified this is a dogified and there is a difference like it you know i i don't believe that all living things are the same thing or consciousness is certainly a difference yes but so also another way god self is presented is emptiness and so all these different spiritual paths are about engaging absorbing emerging with these various forms of the divine right yeah so my avadi i think as i recall and i could be using the wrong term it might be a different term regardless guys yeah yes uh the the uh this dog i don't know about this dog gatsby are you seriously doing this it's a big chat here so the uh so anyway that so the idea is like um people who are into impersonalism is another word for it impersonalism there is no self there is there ultimately everything is just a kind of continuum of of of nothingness we're all producing a form of personality by or clinging we're attached to the concept of the eye the reality of the situation is that there is this eye that we are but it's a very temporary thing if we begin to really merge into the whole then we become a kind of nothingness so jim carrey has become seems to have in some way or another uh connected with this concept in a pretty intense way and now he is broadcasting this out so there's a picture of him in front of he just tweeted a picture of him in front of one of his paintings saying if you see me in the painting something like i am not in the painting you if you see me i am not there the painting is not there and is it a photorealistic self-portrait it splatters the paint it splatters the paint you know so you you think that jim carrey's job is to do comedy he's gotten called into painting and now he's like spiraling or he hasn't gotten called into painting oh he's imagining that he's imagining that he's got called into painting okay let's talk about that because you have presented a rather severe um if we follow this what you're saying it's pretty spooky because you're saying okay let's say for imagine i mean although he never to me he never felt like he was comfortable doing comedy so maybe this is his true calling actually right and he i always thought that he seemed like an uncomfortable presence when he was doing you know he it alienated me somewhat as a audience member so maybe it was always a bridge to what he's doing now right like this is is the pure thing that he always wanted to needed to do or or this just having a platform for an expression to be some kind of teacher to be some yeah just some express or maybe things that he just felt needed to be said his entire life you know from from when he was in the womb he needed you know he was waiting to to amplify some thought or some feeling or something like that now finally he got wait until i tell him i'm nothing yeah wait until i tell him i nothing exactly yeah yeah well because what you're saying is like it's it makes me a little nervous because boy do i waiver i'm like i love this moment i love like these conversations are my favorite thing but then it's like shit i love turning knobs on a modular synthesizer but i certainly don't want to like if the idea is we have some central calling yeah and if we do some other thing then we risk our sanity then it puts it could create a bit of a superstitious pall over experiments and creativity right well also if if you understand that or you know you understand that you have in order to function with other people you know there's all there's your internal thing and then your external thing in order to function with other people your like i understand that in order to function i have to do what i do but for a variety it's not just because you know it because you look around you think well how can i participate in society well this is ultimately the only way that i can participate in society you know how would i be most happy maybe laying in bed for years on end you know just in a really comfortable bed you know yeah sure are you happy like that yeah yeah and then getting up and jumping in the ocean for a couple of days and then getting you know and never coming up because you have gills that's where i would be happiest i think like a napping fish like a napping fish exactly but you'd get bed sores and you don't and you then you would drown and all these things that's impossible so what what yeah so not not but not you know it seems like jim carrey is following what he might consider his true bliss but maybe it's his real i got his real thing but yeah at a certain point that you can't actually be what you think you want to be ooh this is good we have to be able to discern laying in bed at versus like or the kind of indulgent indulging our sort of i don't know what you call it lower modes modes of existence from our true calling and sometimes that can get really foggy yeah i think you know yeah that's really weird man that's a tough one man like how do you like if you can't surf for a living you can't surf for a living some people can surf for a living gotcha some people can serve for their spiritual living right but they're gonna have to get a job because they're not getting paid to do that you're not getting paid to surf use yeah some people are getting paid to serve i'll never like if i start right now i'll never be a professional surfer and if suddenly i decided that that's what i was and went to hawaii and started surfing it's insanity people like yeah you've lost your mind you're not gonna or like that i know you know i i know i could you know if i thought about it for a minute or less i could come up with 10 10 people that i know who are are purely on a kind of a musical creative level like born to make music yes much more than i'm born to make music i'm one of those people probably born to make music yeah probably and but i'm like my brain works to come up with you know to make music and and build it and get it to you yeah where somebody else you know somebody else you know there's some people who i think they have this resentment because they know how great they are yeah let me pause it for two seconds so somebody may have a resentment that they they know that they're a great whatever a great musician yes right and they have a resentment because they know that they're better than almost anybody that they've ever come into contact with they know they just know right and they're right yeah right yeah but they're not good at any other part of what it is what it requires to get music from one person to another person yes they're terrible at that yes and i am better at that than some musicians who are better than me which is why i like to collaborate a lot because i can work with people who aren't as good getting their awesomeness got and it's like oh well i can help you get your awesomeness if you'll hang out with me for a day or two wow cool something like that yeah i got you yeah that's really interesting that's cool man but you you wouldn't place yourself in that that top 10 list you know you you don't see yourself born to make music no i think i'm born to like listen to music i would much rather see i would much rather listen to music if if somebody just said here's a pile of you know never ending money and you know music helps me because i'm not a social person you know it helps me interact with helps me get out of my house yes interact with people and have conversations with people and um and recalibrate my brain um but i i love listening to music i love listening to people play music i love listening to records i love it so much it's so satisfying and it's and it and it's works you know sometimes you're you're the way that music can be exciting feels like you're kind of accomplishing something at its best when you when you have a great musical experience with somebody else making the music yes it feels as if you've accomplished absolutely yeah so that would be my indulgent you know urge would just be to be to do that but i understand that i would become something that could you know undeniably be called insane right just the guy who's like listens to music all the time yeah because also you can't well because if i wasn't you know taken to consideration that yeah making the music also keeps me interacting with people yes got you if it didn't yeah i would just like you know did you see the rocky ericsson documentary no i haven't seen it but i obviously know about rocky ericsson and there's a scene in it where um they visit him in his room and he's got like two or three radios playing different channels a couple of tv's playing different channels and that's kind of what he needs for his brain to be quiet yeah you know and i can that make i understand that that makes sense yeah sure but instead you could also the signals could be coming from other people and that's got you great you know that can help quiet your brain yeah because your brain can just go to the weirdest places without checking in with somebody else sure yeah so then thinking oh well i know now that all this music exists and i love it and i want to exist you know i want to participate with other people i want to be a fully realized human being as much as possible for the time here that i have yeah so i have to learn to make some of this music i wouldn't have made it in the first place but i have to learn to make it because that's that's like the toolbox that i've got that i you know yes the music is powerful to me so i have to try to figure out how to reproduce some of what i'm finding valuable in these things and then get it to other people yeah i got you man yeah it's so this all of this music here is like ingredients that yeah that's that are make up the tapas all of this music here but also just going to see music or talking about music everything becomes an ingredient because it's also it's about you know when you listen to a record you think well you know i like to listen to this this hawaiian record yeah it's 50 60 year old record maybe and thinking you know what was its life before this why did they make it they didn't make it for me absolutely they didn't make it for me but it's mine now but who did they make it for yes and and how can i then make a record for somebody knowing why they made this great record for somebody else right cool man yeah it's cool we were actually forgive us we were going through your stack here to see what you were listening to and a lot of hawaiian music in there yeah i just had pulled out because we're going we're going soon and so i'd pulled out a couple of records there's a there's a there's a great you know how people are kind of into small press vanity label things yes there's a there's a really i hope it's still there because i haven't been there in a while but there's a place called jellies in the west side of honolulu that has some great used records and there was a lot of music that was being made in in hawaii in the late 60s into the 70s that i'm kind of into this just local bands playing what was called it was electrified but it was called traditional hawaii because it was you know they're singing in hawaii and and a lot you know yeah i love hearing it yeah this album you're playing what is this specific album this is the sons of hawaii so it's it's famous for uh like its most famous member of this ensemble was gabi pahinui you know if his that name sounds familiar oh okay he and he like he reminds me of this his story sort of reminds me of some friends of mine who are like like musical forces where they are borderline non-functional human beings who are you know supernaturally skilled at creating music and it seems from the way people you know it's hard to hear because it's hawaii music and and it takes a lot of it's taken a lot of work to find the to not hear it as hawaii music you know what i mean because people will play this record and think oh i hate hawaii music or that's neat that's hawaii music no when you play it all it does for me is i just think about like hawaii how pretty hawaii is i'm just thinking about vacation it makes me feel relaxed in a vacationy kind of way and listening to a bunch of the records then you start to understand well here's where the real shit is or here's where the inspiration is and then also reading about and reading about the way people talk about gabi and that he was this force that wasn't you know he like you couldn't rely on him for anything you know he would be late or not show up would maybe take your money or would leave the band inside it sign us a solo deal leaving everybody behind and not think twice about it wow you know just maybe be mildly embarrassed about it but not evil just not think twice and but these same people who are telling these stories say but when he started playing it just didn't matter it didn't matter you know it was just nothing but good feeling you know you were either inspired or super joyful or whatever you were in the music as much as he was right yeah so there are those kind of people do you because we've taught you it's sort of come up here and there in our conversation do you worry that you might go insane a little bit like because do you fear the pull of that potential for you that you could be pulled out of like being able to like you were saying produce and get it out into the world and drawn into this kind of madness this this creative madness yeah i used to worry about it a lot until i started to understand that kind of you know the you know the the the definition of insanity and the definition of reality and the way that they intersect if you start your day understanding those two things you're good and a lot of people just do you know again you know i'm jealous of the people who are like gabby you know just kind of the music just comes out of them it feels like it or you know it just seems like they can't help but be what everybody else wants to be when they're making trying to make music and the same you know i'm jealous of people who just are just you know pretty darn functional oh oh yeah sure and so that you realize like oh it can take a lot of work it's it's it's incredibly rewarding but it takes a lot of work to be functional yes right oh yeah yeah absolutely especially when you're in a life where you're in a life where you don't necessarily have to pull off the regular schedule that many people do yeah when you have vast swaths of time that truly could be filled with nothingness because i'm sure for you you know you you have income streams coming in from all of your work so if you wanted to you could just sit back for a while probably right yeah you could i mean at this point yeah at this point in my life i could sit back for how long and what sort of atrophy would occur during that sitting back time you know so then i that's that's kind of a motive beyond the motivation of how i don't know how nice it is to make music in yeah that's that's super broad but thinking if i stepped back i would have to come to terms with the fact that that might be a permanent stepping back either because some accident could befall you and you would never get to return or you could miss or technologically it could be as simple as that right this just the superficial like if you step back enough and you try to step back in and people are like yeah i'm i'm listening to you know all my music through this chip in my brain or in my neck yeah and you just like i have what i don't know and i'm you know and you don't make music anymore what if people don't make me or no like i don't make music anymore in 12 years yeah because people have this chip in and the thing that they're listening to most of all are the artists that they're collaborating with because the collab that's you know if i were a musical artist i would create templates that would go in the chip that would go in your neck and you like the way that those that you can steer those templates like oh i love you know the katie perry of 12 years from now because she has this lyric and when i play it in my neck chip it does this thing it's amazing i love it i listen to it all the time sounds so cool but if i took 12 years away coming back i'd just say i have this little song people would be like what's the song well i don't understand what i don't get it you know i can't participate in this there was an interview with lord on that i listened to and you know she was she's young they're like what's your relationship with records she said i've been in the room a couple times when people had a record player and they were playing records on different speeds for fun oh my god that's it so you can see you know and yeah just like a kid you know an inner city kid you show him that a carrot came out of the ground he's like i'm not eating that oh i came out of the ground yeah so you could say eventually like a song people would be like a song what is a song that is is that sort of like that thing that i get off my neck chip oh god that you just that's a black mirror you did just write an ep either i'm not sure if you just wrote an episode of black mirror or if you just came up with one of the best inventions of all time a sonic neck chip that will allow me to like harmonize in a way or rewrite lyrics yeah remix rewrite or the way that you were chopping things with that yeah that synthesizer yeah chop something but somebody delivers to you either the content or a specific what algorithm or program that and that's what you are that's what you purchase when you purchase a musical thing wait algorithm or the content who is the comedian god forgive me for not remembering this damn it the comedian who released the album where it has the script of a team act and you can like so he's just saying one side of the team and you get to say the other side he's like one of the great comedians of all time and the fact i can't remember his name i feel like neil hamburger did that also did a a new he did a news he did an interview record where you it came with a script and you could do or you could but you could also just listen to like the funny part was if you just listen to the interview without the yes that's for i love this yeah this collaborative it seems like you love collaboration yeah and it seems like what you're mentioning here outside of the dark dystopian future where you've taken 12 years off you emerge from someplace long hair wanting to sing people like who are you was that some form of screaming we don't know what this is yeah but like it seems like this idea that you have is really quite beautiful which is you want to connect even more with the listeners in the sense of figuring out a way to let us make the music with you well kind except we shouldn't overestimate the average you know consumer slash listeners willingness energy time ability to participate you know you have like the brianinos and the bjorks who've made apps that allow people to you know create music but yeah how much is that they're not really i don't think you know those are it's novelty it's like crackerjack it's a thing in a crackerjack box or something yeah but i imagine that there may be something that resembles less just the pushing play and the music happening and maybe it isn't that we control it but maybe it's that every time you play the katie perry song it is actually a slightly different song and the way that somebody's app that's what you're you're you're consuming maybe so maybe you know john x creates the greatest app for remixing or resequencing a song so you listen to the you know the way that you were chopping and splicing joni michael yes last night that if you might there might be one day an artist that does what you're doing but does it so well that people say oh i'm you know i'm listening to to duncan trussell right now but they don't mean you they mean they're listening to bob dillon but through your filters and yeah and the but it's something that is potentially always changing yeah or you know what gets me really excited is the idea of remixing like you're saying but not from one individual but from collectives so instead of it just being like oh i'm listening to bob dillon through the filter of some person who's remixing or or whatever the a community getting engaged in the remixing of things because like a band except it's a whole group of people a collaboration of all of it's beautiful because it's this merging together that you're talking about this like uh non ownership of the art and letting us like dive in and swim around a little bit inside of it i think that's exciting except i i mean i'm more realistic in terms of or i you know that's that is beautiful kind of but i don't i'm not meaning it in a beautiful way i'm meaning like that people are taking you know someone said told me the other day oh that they had talked to someone they said what's your favorite music oh i like you know to listen to six organs of admittance and what else and what comes after that meaning that they're playing like pandora oh and that's their favorite kind of music is the music that comes after that so i'm not saying that people aren't going to be active and participate in a beautiful way it's just maybe a different way the way that our musical taste now if you listen to pandora it goes song then another song then another song right but someone might do that within a song like there may eventually be a service that's just you don't never have to leave that one song if you don't want to i want to hear you know where a computer could remix a song for 40 minutes so oh my god you don't have to get a dj to do it and it's the same every time but you could listen to r kelly sing happy people for your 30 minute workout and it's only an eight minute song but you can listen to it for 30 minutes because someone has worked out a way and it's not the same the next day one of the most creepy dire things i think i've ever heard any human utter the idea that you could just for a lifetime some people it's not like what kind of music do you listen to it's what song do you listen to what song do you listen to oh yeah oh yeah but i can also i mean there are some songs that are so intensely satisfying that i think you know i kind of wouldn't mind like listening to this for seven hours off the top of your head like the don everleys recording of oma haw you know from his first solo record 1970 never i don't know yeah gotta listen to that now though yeah something like that or you know i love barry manelos uh could it be magic ah you know that one no you don't know that my no listen this is this is as i was saying before my you don't know please i stopped you i'll play it after this okay can you sing a tiny little piece of it yeah you know it's what's the the it's really dramatic and huge it's could it be magic um now oh now oh now into my arms this could be you know i don't know i've known it since i was little i think my dad put on a mixtape for i got one like that you know the one i love is johnny cash singing we must believe in magic you know that well yeah yeah absolutely my god we must believe huh i don't know if i've heard him do that but yeah oh it's so good and he's who is that who who sang it originally or i can't remember her name yeah it was because it's also on johnny cash one of his good friends was the songwriter producer cowboy jack clement and it's also on his first solo record which is one of the great records of all time because you know it begins about it's about alpha centauri right yeah hell yeah yeah oh yeah what is it the captain of i'm the captain of alpha centauri yeah no it's something we must be out of our minds or something yeah he talks about who's on the ship it's dreamers and poets and clowns and he throws in clowns maybe like the dreamers and poets are cool but then the ship gets kind of weird if like scattered throughout our clowns there's a so there's a there's a documentary about this guy cowboy jack clement called i think it's called cowboy jack clements home movies or shakespeare was a big george jones fan and it's it's a it's kind of a stunning portrayal of of the inner life of an artist where that i mean i think he would say that that's you know i don't know it's like one of his theme songs and he's he's perfectly happy with this idea of clowns being in there yeah yeah i mean and he and cash were very close and like to be silly with each other oh that's cool yeah no but that i mean but come on that that is an anthem to the occult yeah who wrote that song though i think it's um i mean it's almost worth the google search no it's not it's worth looking at the record shelf here hold on oh yeah awesome okay cool i'm gonna hit pause there's so we got that we have the album and i think my first encounter with the song i'm pretty sure was on the muppet show i think they must have done it at some point wow but yeah we have that record it was written by it's called we must believe in magic and it's written by bob mcdill and alan reynolds wow and bob mcdill do you know bob mcdill no is or was he's he's a songwriter who's kind of his biggest successes came i'd like to think of him as the um you know there's like the classic one is uh deniro scorsese right yes director actor one of them needs the they need each other yes right and bob mcdill worked with a singer don williams who just died maybe a month or two ago and he was that they that was them that was the you know the sereno relationship or god bob mcdill wrote don williams greatest songs and neither would be who they are without the other person got you yeah um really really really beautiful like and it's really beautiful to think of it that way when you listen to don williams records because yeah that's me stop but and then alan reynolds is a i think he he's a professional like his it's the main way he makes his living is from writing songs and producing records but he's also like tops in the world of nashville backup singers right but he's also the i think he was one of the big creative guiding forces of the of the whole garth brooks thing i think he produced all the garth brooks records that made garth brooks who we think of him wow today so they wrote that song man and they're i think they're pals with cowboy jack clement you have to be so lucky to find one of those people in your life like to to be lucky enough to just pair up with somebody who's gonna help you yeah do that that's just a miracle of the highest proportion absolutely man and i love seeing it it's one of my favorite things to and being it right to witness it feels like you're that a little bit for people you yeah but but with different people yeah as opposed to it's not the single partnership it's a lot of different partnerships right man do you one thing that i i wanted to ask do you are you a little anti technology to some degree are you nervous about technology a little bit um i'm sometimes well maybe yeah i think sometimes i wanted to google search oh yeah we must believe in magic and you wrote no let's just go physically right the record show because it's right there right yeah i'm i'm only i'm mainly anti people doing things that i i think you're allowing somebody else to do things for you know you're giving them the authority to do things for you that really you there's just not a reason you shouldn't be doing it for yourself because it's better for you you can trust your own actions better than you can yeah yeah you heard this term that there's an anarchist term called de-skilled have you heard that i probably have yeah exactly we're yeah we're people are it seems like people are dying to be de-skilled yeah just dying to just dying to like really really because they're de-skilled right but people are just love you know take it away from me take more power away from me take more ability away from me take i don't want to have to think i don't want to do anything anything please please please do it all for me yeah yeah that's happening and it's weird and i i think life is less less fun the more de-skilled i noticed that i've become as well the people that i spend time with are less it's not as you know it's not as rewarding to spend time with people who are volunteering to give up their abilities and their authorities right oh and it's humiliating to find yourself suddenly in the presence of skilled people right this happens to me when i went to burning man this last year i came in early because you build this camp it's a lot of hard work oh my goodness yeah the people i'm with these are people who are skilled they know how to do just about everything right to build things they know how to solder they know how to make stuff yeah and being around skilled people and suddenly realizing that you are de-skilled on a lot of different levels it's like not being able to read it's a real profound sense of like man what did i how did i end up here where this i don't know i don't know how to yeah that's a pretty intense feeling man absolutely yeah and so that's the only way that i'm anti technology i think when when when it's taking a shortcut when it's taking a shortcut to get some place that the reason you wanted to get there in the first place is you forget that the reason that people wanted to get to that destination is because of the work that it took to get there yes yeah you think like i have it now i have it it's like yeah you know when someone's just like i got pearls i got pearls now and it's like well the whole reason the pearls had value is because how hard it was to get them it wasn't because someone sent you a credit card in the mail and then you went to the store and bought them it was because they wear their pearls well because they worked their asses off to get the pearls wow right yeah man so when it's just like oh i can google this and get the information then the information is kind of work worthless yeah right absolutely that where you earn your wrinkles you earn your ideas like you the thing yeah i got you man you're right and when you do finally achieve the thing whatever it is after some struggle it's eternally more valuable definitely we we did a like um it was it was it'll be 12 years ago this coming january did a tour in new zealand and during the rehearsal time so this was 12 years ago and people were default googling to further conversations and to decide arguments 12 years ago that's kind of amazing right but we were in a place in in where there was no cell phone signal and there was no wireless there or anything like that so in order to make up for this de de skilling that had occurred we took a piece of cooked spaghetti and called it the google spag and whenever we had a question that you know we would say oh let's google that answer you would pick up the google spag and then you could you could say the answer so you were google you know so if you said what year did abraham lincoln die i can't remember you pick up the google spag and you can just say 1867 and then we move on with the conversation because and that's the new truth was it 1867 i have a feeling it wasn't but right yes so you but that's kind of because we're doing that right i'll pick up my computer i will google and then i will tell you what the truth is yeah because what who cares but also because what what did you actually do and who just told you what the truth is yeah you know yeah like i have a shelf etiology i look up glucosamine is a you know it's a supplement you could take that's good for your joints supposedly sure and it's made from shellfish most of the time so i looked up to see is glucosamine made with the compounds in shellfish the people who are allergic to shellfish are usually you know that react yeah and you do you know i haven't done this in six or seven years but i looked it up and on the first string of results glucosamine is definitely produced from the compounds within shellfish that people are allergic to if you're allergic to shellfish avoid this yes next answer glucosamine is safe to consume for people who are allergic to shellfish right because it's not you know yeah that's your truth yeah so it's just you know who knows i you i can write my own wikipedia page and all of a sudden i'm a different human being than you're sitting with gotcha yes yeah man it's steal it you're right it's a it's vamp it's a vampire it's stealing away uh it's stealing so much it's stealing from us because this this earlier when we were talking about i had not considered and i'd never heard anyone say it's what comes next on the playlist is the kind of music i like right i'd never considered that and that made me think of the beautiful moment my friend emal who you know gave me a tape that had daniel johnston on it and i'd never heard daniel johnston before i remember that moment also holy shit and i remember because i knew i didn't know i didn't know what lo-fi was i knew nothing about it gives me this tape one just the exchange of the tape with a new friend yeah a mysterious new friend who's given you this odd tape with daniel johnson scrawled on it then you go back to your dorm room put the tape in the tape player hit play and my first thought was oh is emal a satanist because this is the most this music i've never heard anything like this in my life but it is so overpoweringly dark it was rock and roll ek g you know that one that daniel johnson on rock and roll ega or something i don't know oh that rock and roll it saved my soul it's no i don't know fuck i'll play it for you yeah but anyway it was so overwhelmingly sweet but not just because the music was incredible but because this person had given it to me and there was a connection to this to a being and it was like magic happening yeah what was the first moment you heard daniel johnston i can just remember being in the house that i grew up in the kitchen i just remember this since there was a skylight and i remember listening to hi how are you was a tape that some friends you know for some friends of mine had gotten maybe in texas because that's where you could get the tapes then yeah and yeah just being deeply deeply deeply deeply frightened also because because of the good but if i felt frightened because of the way it's my reaction you know i could i was reacting to it and then reacting to my reaction like i would found that it was really really captivating and really but but at the same time so yeah so scary you know well i don't think it's scary i don't know i mean i think it was probably partly scary because of this understanding that you know they're but i didn't know that he was necessarily great i don't know like it it was just so so scary it was so scary because it was so beautiful you know and i love that record so much but i haven't listened to it in 30 years i'm sure and i probably know all the little clicks and pops because it has so many strange noises yeah on it but just yeah thinking yeah what i don't know i mean also just it was such a mad it's such a magical record yeah i don't i don't know it was just dammit maybe like and i remember there was martin scorsese short movie called american boy you ever see that no about a guy named richard prince who was a professional roadie who plays a gun salesman and taxi driver okay sure and he was neil diamonds like tour manager or something like that and the movie is just 45 minutes or an hour of kind of sitting in a house and in a hot tub martin scorsese sitting with him getting him to tell stories about his life and that was similarly like for some reason yeah watching that was just full of this fear yeah but it feels like it's kind of a there but for the grace of god fear that's the fear i was about sacred fear yeah or or when or that i don't know where it is in the bible fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom and when you feel that kind of sacred ecstatic fear in relation to art oh yeah it's one of the most precious feelings because you are making contact this is a real connection here yeah and you'll you'll it means you're going to grow it means like you've found the next breadcrumb in this wow yeah yeah yeah yeah totally yeah because it is kind of yeah that's a nice way to think of it is as that kind of fear that you that you feel first day of school yes right where you just think i know right now yeah it's like i know right this moment i know without a doubt that i am about to become somebody else yes and it's scary as hell yeah that's cool because i i was thinking that i was scared like you know some weird way scared of of but like i say i didn't know necessarily that daniel johnson was crazy the first time i heard it but scared of opening that door into somebody's you know into this incredibly vulnerable and beautiful and seductive space where is it going to take me but maybe it's just the first day of school yeah and it's just it's going to be okay but it's just scary because you're just like i woke up this morning i got up i tied my shoes i ate my cereal and tomorrow when i do that i'm going to be a different person yeah and i was happy this morning there's nothing wrong with it but it's gone yeah yeah yeah my my friend mitch and i were talking about this he's the idea of uh and again you know it's just for a thought experiment who knows if this is real or not but that we so he was telling me and he's way better at describing these things than i am at describing them but i think it's a Greek concept this idea that you leave that you give when so before you come to life before you wake up into this incarnation you give yourself these moments in the incarnation which are moments where everything is going to change and that's crisis that's crisis and so it's almost as though at some point in another dimension you arranged with whatever the thing is that's making this thing happen give me daniel johnston in the kitchen let me have it there let me have it there a little clue yeah a little clue in the incarnational cycle hey check this out this is something special and maybe that's what that fear is is that oh my god wait i'm almost remembering something here yeah and but you don't quite know what it is yeah you it's like that movie memento it's definitely it's a recognition thing for sure and that's the frightening part about it is you're recognizing something that you feel like you've never seen i mean i'd never heard anything like that before but i was recognizing something yeah that's really scary yeah yeah like memento but there was i was too young to have even been able to write the notes to myself on the polaroid photos yeah right like now i can sort of do that i can sort of have a have a sensation and say okay i recognize this fear even and that's the the note that you've written on the photo right but then i had not done that you had no idea what was going on it was just like this yeah reaching from one reality or one place in time or something into another photo burning bush it's a burning bush and and and and this burning bush uh and i love that in the bible where the burning bush happens because i think it the voice of the lord says something along the lines of take off your shoes because you are standing on holy ground and it's so beautiful and it's like that idea of like you know what the next time i get that feeling please god let me have at least a few more times in this life yeah i'm popping my shoes off oh yeah that's a good yeah you know that's wow yeah how will you remember to do that you just got to do it you'll remember just pop your shoes off and those moments are pretty overwhelming there when was the last time you had a moment like that well it's funny to think i was just thinking like about after saying the first day of school thing and this i think maybe oftentimes this time of year there's a gnawing dread and this year i was thinking trying to think well what where does that come from is it because i would be going back to school you know age five through 19 or 20 whenever i gave up those endeavors you know was that is that why i just sort of you know getting cool and there's a little bit of fear that's coming too yeah why is that yeah so i don't know but or is it unrelated to that and with my wife right now in life there's we're about to turn some huge corners which i i'm sure is also the case and is that the what corners i mean just things you know just yeah sure we'll be married for a year in a few weeks you know wow and we will just continue to do things with each other that make our life together more of you know a big thing yeah you know yeah so is it you mean it's the it's like you're sensing this continued solidification of this yeah intense lifelong relationship happening and we know you know my like we've been mentioning we just sold my mom's house a couple weeks ago yes she only lived there the last nine or ten years something like that but but it was because she just moved into a nursing home she's in late late Alzheimer's right so she'll be gone soon yeah and it's not having any previous experience with with Alzheimer's or with losing a mother soon you know it's been coming for over 10 years now long time but now you know now because we made this big move and you know i'll never you know we there were toy boxes that maybe grandkids have played with and we thought might play with in the future those toy boxes are gone because we finally cleaned out the basement yeah you know something yeah the encyclopedias that we grew up with as kids they're gone forever now so it was a big thing and then the next thing is that she will go yes so maybe it's just that you know and just knowing like that i know that i'm in the middle of a big step and so there's a little bit of fear that's mixed with some you know it feels more like fear like the first time listening to hi how are you there was no there was only a little bit of joy but mostly it was fear yeah you know and now there's a little more joy like transition you understand that there's a reason that there's joy that comes with transition as well yes oh and i think that joy a lot of people that joy they feel guilty about that joy because in the midst of that kind of transition you think well how could i be feeling any kind of joy at all this is my mom transitioning and i can't but it is joyful and and i and i and till you've experienced that you don't you it's impossible to understand what that joy is like and what that joy feels like and this is you know ramdas talks about this and roshi jone halifax talks about this someone who's on the show and they say if you want if you really want to understand truth sit with a dying person right and you can't you will that is true you will it's very hard to come up with something more pure and real and when that dying person is your mother yeah and you're seeing this transformation happen to the being that you whose breast you suckled on right now you're learning the way the universe is for real you are seeing deep into the gears of the universe and that is a sometimes i think your parent your mother your parents your mother gives you two massive gifts your life right and the gift of watching them die and these are two very very powerful things obviously the first but the second one oh you don't you don't know and indeed yeah it's it's the the silver lining is that it's an awesome gift that's the silver lining yeah but man i mean you know i can remember after my mom passed i got i got lucky i got to i got to go i went to ramdas's house and i was sitting with him in the zen roshi and man you get broken open like you or you get black you get blasted open and i'm sitting there just like but these two sit i don't want to throw around the word saint or whatever you want to call it but these are people who've spent their whole lives you know in the practice and uh roshi john halifax said this thing to me which is a window is opened for you right now there's a window that is open when your parent mom dies right and she said it will shut right and she said so really be in this moment because you only get it once you only get that once the i mean the an insane thing about or is that this like with my mom the windows in one way or another been open for a long time so it's going to be weird when it's because i know that it will close but it gets weirder every day the longer it goes on you know now that it is a little over a decade that's a long time yes it's it's a that's a serious portion of life right there yes but i also know the whole time that it resembles sometimes it resembles whatever normalcy or reality or something like that but the whole time it still is always this open window that will close yeah you know sometimes my biggest fear is like to go before she does because there's this thing like no i want to live i want to i want you know i need a month after she's gone you know i need at least a month i'd love 30 or 40 years but i would take a month you know i want 30 or 40 years to recognize this time as a window right oh yeah man because it's not you know our dad was like one day there next day gone that's like a window where you lose something big yeah and it that only it just pops open and then maybe gradually closes but it does close yeah yeah but you're you you're the shadow you've been enduring which is the shadow of a of someone with a terminal prognosis yeah uh it's under it's there is a shadow on everything so when my mom you remember the diagnosis you remember the first time they tell you yeah you remember that moment on the phone and then the strange clock starts ticking and then you go through all the phases and you pray and you imagine can i send my soul to her at night sometimes you would think oh i'll send my soul to her at night and maybe it will heal her in some way and you start thinking there perhaps she's making it up maybe it's not real the doctor's crazy this can't be real but it's real man and then so and then so you forget it as time passes you're now you have a dying mother and so as time passes you'll have these moments where you forget that your mother is dying and then maybe you're high maybe you're experiencing a great meal maybe you're then suddenly your mind will go and zoom back into the reality of this condition that has afflicted this person who was the very first woman you contacted in the material universe right and so that's a shadow yeah and when that shadow lifts a little bit you're right it's definitely worth staying alive yeah i mean that's yeah i mean i was like okay i'm gonna wear my seat belt right now just because yes you know yeah that would suck so hard yeah but well you know the other thing that you get that's maybe this is a little wooey on my part and i think it's the thing that is really tough to understand if as i have been to you you get your mom back because suddenly oh right right yeah that's what i mean i i you know this and it's like different things for myself and for myself and my wife that you know that we try to figure out what's okay to talk about what's not okay to talk about right sure and i think both of us try to air on more and more try to air on talking about some things you know so for example you know i think sometimes about my mom's funeral yeah and at this point you know i kind of don't give a shit you know i really don't i really just like for most of the people that she knows it's it's already happened you know most of her friends it's already happened yes you know a long time ago but maybe a nice thing to do will be to ask some of her friends to come and reintroduce me to my mom oh you know like to talk about her to all of us but but yeah to have that be what it's about like to maybe even say okay we're having mom's funeral and it's uh 2007 you know it's it's not it's not 2017 it's 2000 or 2018 or whatever it's gonna happen but it's 2007 okay get back there or not even just tell talk talk to us about child talk just remind us and they have that be the purpose of the because a traditional for somebody with Alzheimer's a traditional funeral is kind of like it's not the right ritual huh because you're saying why because it's been so long so they because they because they their personality has dissolved yeah essentially their personality has dissolved yeah and and it's been they're occupying a physical space that is unlike the person that right you know the reason i sit with her now is not because of who she was is now necessarily as well of course it's it's who she was before yeah i got you and i always think of her as who she was before as you know this is that is who she is now but there's a lot of people you know who care for her now who never knew her before who only know this now yeah person and that's a different you know man i when i i i did some volunteer work at a hospice a long time ago wasn't ready for it and i sat with a woman who had uh was late stage Alzheimer's and um she so and because it's so very difficult yeah for the family right that it's easier for a person who doesn't know them to sit with them than it is for a person who knew them to sit with them so the family sometimes will not show up because it's like to be there is so emotionally incredibly emotionally different when my mom was dying of breast cancer in the final days she was in bed and was asleep and um it was i can't even i don't want to talk about it now it was so overwhelming so to go through that for a very long time that was a combination probably of of painkillers as well as the sickness that kept you from being able to have a communication with her yeah that's right that's right a connection with her yeah yeah that's what it was so so but i i i i remember this uh so yeah man anyway what i wanted to say is when i was with this woman and she took me into her room and pointed to a picture of her family uh and and so i guess what i'm saying is like and this is something ramdas talks about yes personality gone but when you're sitting with your mother yeah the thing behind the personality is there yeah and that's who you're sitting with yeah and there is no way you know i with this i know that because of the way that this disease works you know in the ways that we don't understand there's no determining anything there's no determining any you know for sure any what's gone what isn't gone right yeah well that's and the and what they say all you can do you know that a lot of things are gone but you don't know exactly what you never will know all you can do is be in the moment with them yeah and and the way they taught they told me has become a loving rock which is something that they can push off of assuming there's a thing that can be pushed off and a thing that they can hold on to if they need to and that's sort of what we're doing yeah wow man you are this thing that you're in right now it is you know it's it's it's it's going on so long that it's you know it it there was a one book that i read i don't remember which one you know someone said you know asking somebody about their any their grief is like you know asking octopus to tell you about his experience with water yes that's right and you know and it's but not to just to say grief but just you know someone will say well how's your mom and i try to think what do i say she's you know i'll say because if i saw her you know i saw her yesterday i she smiled at one point so i'll say you know still smiling yes because you know what else are you gonna say like what can you say she's not moving she's not speaking she's you know but but that's not what they're asking no well they don't know what they're asking yeah they're just trying to be polite yeah they don't know what they're asking yeah they're trying to be polite and they kind of yeah yeah there's not a better question if you've gone through a mother dying the odds are pretty good if you know someone's mom is dying yeah you're not going to go how's your mom because right no no yeah you just you just you're just you're like you you go oh yeah i know you i know you a little bit yeah and that's all you can do yeah you just go hang out with you know that's you go hang out with them right sit and yeah anybody yeah yeah you just you just hang out and be in the moment because that's pretty much it bring them a sandwich bring them a sandwich yeah that is the best actually sandwiches and just like yeah just be there and know there is a this there's a kind of another kind of birth because what you're doing is you're giving your mom you're the midwife to your mom's birth into a new thing that's a transformation and i failed at that man i didn't what you're doing i think people forget or how what you're doing is such a sweet thing whereas i didn't i wasn't with i i've had tremendous feelings of guilt because i didn't i don't feel like i was good enough in those moments in the last moments with my mom because it was going on so long i ended up having to go on tour and and it was just like yeah yeah it was and it's it's like what you're so i guess what i'm saying is is someone who i think kind of stumbled in that very important place you're not stumbling the thing you're doing is really like that it's a beautiful thing you're doing it whereas i kind of cannonballed you're doing a a nice dive and that's a sweet thing that you're doing right yeah well i mean like when you at the beginning of the conversation you talked about the serving thing and and i talked about uh some people don't have to do that yeah you know where huh yeah yeah it would be you know potentially what you know like sometimes you know i think sometimes i don't think so but like or dick cheney and mitch mcconnell like happier people because they don't have a conscience than i am or than you are yeah or but just thinking you know also would it be better to not no yeah no yeah i mean i i find also yeah it's cool i guess it's yeah i don't know yeah i mean it's yeah i don't know it like i said but it is a but it's always it always it it's not inherently good it's only good because i'm learning things from it right i mean if i'm just giving something to her she you know that's a really weird thing you know that's a really weird thing it's like to serve somebody it's a strange you know to serve something like the the whole organization that is hospice that we call yeah we call it hospice and Louisville for some reason or in kentucky hospice yeah this whole thing that can what is it about it's i think it's rad like the the people i mean just the idea of respecting age respecting that you know why isn't it you know why are why are people and why are we losing elderly populations because people mostly to belief like people don't want to believe anymore that they're getting old so we're you know we're not just losing a connection with the past and losing a connection with aging and ourselves part of it is because people don't even you know i am you know 80 years old but i'm going to continue to pretend that i'm not therefore you will never have a relationship with an older person wow because i am denying that i'm an older person you know wow right yes oh wow right yes like so many older people you think like they're fucking dressed like whatever they're dressed like they're 20 yeah and then they've busted their face and thousand ways and they're using hip jargon and that means i don't get to have any old people in you don't get the traditional relationship with the elders that yeah be so important that used to be so important yeah and not just because of connection to the past because it prepares you a little bit oh yeah and gives them a purpose it gives them a real purpose there but that's projecting you know like to some yeah i'm sure that some old folks appreciate things and some old folks are like what a what an idiot you know yeah sure you know thanks for the cupcake idiot you know like i i've lived this long i don't need a cupcake i'll tell you one of the people i sat with when i was volunteering for hospice this woman was bedridden she was i don't remember i she was a hollywood she'd been in a lot of movies and she was beautiful she had pictures all over the wall of her so oh my god this beautiful beautiful being she's laying in bed i only said i was only there once because i just had this little job i'd run errands and stuff and i came and i said she's laying there and yeah we have this idea that they're all going to be ethereal beings i say to her how are you feeling and she looks at me and she goes how does it look you know there's no sacred moment of like i'm releasing my body it's just like what do you think asshole yeah i'm dying motherfucker or a guy my mom's nursing home you know you know you like it here and he's like it is what it is yes yeah yeah that but he's kind of you know he wasn't complaining you know he was he was like if you're asking me to say this is a really nice place i can't get those words out of my mouth right but i'm fine it's totally fine right well this is the one of the things they teach you in hospice is people die as they've lived have you ever heard that before oh right so the pattern the pattern i haven't heard that but that makes sense yeah yeah yeah so it's like kind of like the cycle of action in your life when you're approaching death if that cycle will just happen with it with more frequency as you get closer to death oh wow yeah it's pretty interesting so you can almost from the way that you're living now kind of figure probably how you're gonna die if you have like time to die and and and this is sort of like there a lot of the reasons people say meditation is good or any kind of spiritual practice because you're trying to break those those cyclical like modalities that are negative so that when you are finally approaching death yeah you can like enter into it with this open mind and also the people around you you you won't afflict them as some people do and they're dying you're not gonna run a lot of crazy games on them or do some kind of weird shit which can happen right and so you gracefully exit the universe which is a pretty amazing gift to give people yeah exit or transition or whatever happens transit transition is the right word for it it's not necessarily exiting universe well we don't know right yeah where would you go if you're exiting the universe where would you go i mean you need a bigger universe right if there's a exit there must be some other i mean that'd be amazing to exit the universe for a second but yeah yeah i don't yeah that's a funny way to end the podcast well not with a bang but with a with a with with an egg yeah i don't know you are amazing and i i'm so honored to get to spend this little bit of time with you and i just i'm honored to host you here to give you a good night's sleep like that that is a huge reward for me like you know in in getting to hear you talk in different ways you know

Check out the latest in-store, and we're never short on options at jcp.com. All dressed up, everywhere to go. JCPenney. You know, I was chatting with my dear, dear friend, Brendan Walsh, who's in Mensa, and we were talking a little bit about our online habits at night. You know, there's a thing called Sleep Hygiene. If you haven't heard of it, it's the term related to how you should go to bed at night. And if you're a healthy person, most healthy people, what they do before they go to bed is they wrap their entire body in lavender bandages, leaving only their genitals exposed, and then usually they have some kind of marsupial creature in the house who comes and lapsed slowly at their genitals until they have a mild orgasm, can't have too strong an orgasm, or you're gonna get excited and stay awake. You have a nice, mild sort of semi-shuttering orgasm, and then you fall asleep after the marsupial laps up your sprays. But I don't do that. I go to, I put on sweatpants, usually in a T-shirt, and I lay in bed with my wife and I look at my phone, and she falls asleep before I do, usually. And then I go through a variety of news sources. I'm gonna start with Drudge Report. I head over to Reddit World News, then I head over to Reddit News. Then I'll head over to Reddit WTF, and then sometimes I might take a quick little stop by popping, Reddit popping, and look at people popping zits and cysts, and then after that I'll go to rfort slash conspiracy and try to find a nugget of strangeness that my mind can feast on, and then I'll fall asleep and dream about having sex with crocodiles. This is usually my pattern. It's the opposite of sleep hygiene, and I wouldn't recommend it for anyone, but during one of my explorations into Reddit conspiracy, I came upon a wonderful conspiracy theory, which is the idea that the thing that we understand as history is completely wrong, and that a different history happened that has been hidden from us for various conspiratorial reasons. I don't believe this, by the way. I like it in the same way. I like Rosemary's Baby. Do I believe that somebody was the mother of the Antichrist? I don't know, but do I like watching Rosemary's Baby, and if I watched Rosemary's Baby exactly 666 times? Yes, the answer is yes. You can enjoy a thing without believing in it at all, which is why I'm semi-bummed out about the current prohibition on access to conspiracy theories via the normal avenues. In the old days, you used to be able to go on YouTube, plug in flat earth, and you would start just the most insane shit would start getting suggested to you by the AI, and you would go deeper and deeper and deeper until eventually you came to like a gang stalking video or something that was completely unintelligible, maybe like a zoom in on a foggy map with some guttural utterances happening, and that's what it used to be like, but because the statistical probability is that if you put anything out there into the world and enough people look at it, some percentage of those people are going to be completely, completely out of their fucking minds, and of the ones that are gonna be out of their minds, there's some statistical probability that one or two of them is gonna take whatever data they get and then do something with it, and we've seen the results of this, unfortunately, when a gunman shot at a pizza parlor. So, you know, how do we deal with the fact that we have so many different sorts of information out there and the statistical probability is that some people are gonna slurp that shit up and it's gonna send them out into traffic jerking off onto fucking cars? I don't know, and luckily it's not my job because I don't run the internet, I'm not a politician, and I don't have to pretend like I know the answers, but I will say this, I am not gonna go into traffic and jerk off on cars unless it's for a very good reason and that good reason has come to me from YouTube. But the main thing is I'm a connoisseur of conspiracy theories, I collect some people, they enjoy Greek mythology, some people love Norse mythology, some people love folklore, folktales, you know, there's, I don't, I got, my mind was melted with boredom once by I think a class I took where they talked about the jack tales of the Appalachian mountains. I have no offense to people who are into that shit, it just isn't my thing. My thing is conspiracy theories and whenever I find a new one, I dive in and go as deep as I can and try to see how far it goes and who's attracted to it. And there's so many wonderful ones out there, if I was gonna recommend a few, the obviously the Mandela effect, the idea that we're in an ever-schisming, cracking, fragmenting, multiverse and some of us are flipping into other multiverses is glorious and you can get lost in it for a long time. I went through a really wonderful hollow earth phase to the point where at like 3 a.m. I sent a text message to a, I think she was a Stanford professor, I'm not sure. She never wrote back asking her, a geologist if the shit I'd been reading that maybe there's like hollow places and the earth was true. She didn't write, it was late at night, who could blame her? But my newest discovery, which we talk about on the podcast so I won't go too deeply into it is this idea of the hidden history or the fact that there was a cataclysm that happened and it's been hidden from us intentionally by our keepers. Oh, it's a good one, really love it. Don't believe it at all, but I do love it. But I will say this, something today that emerged really has really freaked me out, as it should freak anyone out who's seen it, which is they duplicated my friend Rogan's voice with some kind of AI and it's good. It did a good job, it does sound like him, like you can hear some kind of like distortion in it, just a tiny, tiny little bit of a distortion, but it sounds like him and it's so cool and so absolutely fucking nuts to examine the implications of what is down the road for us, which is that we all right now live in a time where we feel like we have some autonomy over our self and over our personalities and whatever our particular way of being in the world is, everything that you do, the way you roller skate, if you're a roller skater, maybe you've figured out a way to do that backwards roller skate thing that fancy pants do at the roller rinks. Man, I will hate on those people all day fucking long, man. Those people who are like so proud of their roller skating tactics and they roller skate backwards and do little spins and zips and flips and they've got like fucking roller skating outfits on and like their own personal kind of roller skates and like, I don't know, some kind of like special headwear and shit and I'll hate on them all day long and it's pure deep player hating. Like I fucking am jealous is what I mean. I mean, I'm jealous like the worst kind of just little, little, little bitch because if I could do that, should I do it all day long? I'd wear headbands and rainbow shirts and fucking just zing around roller skating rinks, roller skating backwards and shaking my ass. If I'd done that, if I could have done that when I was a kid, I don't know what would happen to me. I have my life would have gone in a completely different direction, but for a lot of people that's like their identity man, believe it or not, and it's the same with bowling golf, you know, you pick it, you name it, you're driving down the street and you look over, there's that guy in like a leather jacket on his fucking motorcycle. Bah, bah, bah, he's so proud of the person in the Ferrari who's proud of their fucking car. Right now I'm proud of my fucking bike. It's got a Copenhagen wheel on it, it's an e-bike and I drive to a place I'm not allowed to talk about yet on that bike every day if it's not raining just about. And I'm proud of it in a gross way, not like a nice pride. I'm like proud and embarrassingly egoic about it, like I get off on the fact that I can zing by cars that are stuck in traffic and I fantasize that they're jealous of me even though none of that is true and everyone's just trying to get home. It's just an embarrassment, it's embarrassing, that part of me, but it's like kind of a little bit of who I am, my modular synth, my podcast, my dogs, my beard, all this stuff, my personality, it's like this is me. And so I don't know if you saw it, but this Rogan thing, they perfectly duplicated his voice. Now, I don't know if you're familiar with the superstitions of some indigenous people. And I'm not either except for like things that I've maybe seen in movies, so it could be absolute bullshit. This might just be an urban myth, but supposedly there are some people out there don't want you to take their picture because they think it'll steal their soul. And I'm not gonna pat myself on the fucking back, all right? I'm not gonna pat myself on the back here, but ages ago, ages and ages and ages, I don't think I'm Nostradamus, I'm just your basic, yappy stoner with some mild narcissism, okay? I don't think it's, so I'm not like, I don't mean to proclaim that I am a prophet sent here by the divine, but holy fucking shit. Quite some time ago, I did have a vision, my friends, my sweet, sweet, beautiful children come gather and sit before my tucket while I teach thee and perfume your brow with my sweat. If you wanna touch my feet, you can. I had a vision that at some point, AI would duplicate us. In fact, it probably wasn't my vision, I'm sure I read it somewhere and then decided I had invented it in my own head. Probably Ray Kurzweil said this, who fucking cares, who said it doesn't matter anymore, that's the point. Because copyright, property, intellectual property, the meat and potatoes of how the entertainment business works has always been based on the, that there were certain people who have very special takes on reality. These were the writers or the announcers or whatever. And Jesus fucking Christ, you know, I'm like sort of rolling my eyes at the impending AI apocalypse. Oh yeah, well that sucks. I'm sorry the fucking Uber drivers are gonna be out of a job. I'm sorry the accounts are gonna be out of the job. I'm sorry the lawyers are gonna be out of a job. I'm sorry that the factory workers are gonna be out of a job, but boy, there's always gonna be a need for podcasters, comedians, people with an interesting take and you know, quirky folk who figured out a way to get their stuff out there and be funny. And man, wow, it's a strange, swooning feeling to realize that even that's gonna go away. They're just gonna duplicate us. That's what I'm saying. I don't know the terms of services I fucking signed. Do you know how many terms of services I've signed when I've signed up for various video games and online services? I don't know what shit I said yes to when I got my iPhone. I just scroll down and go, yeah, sure, whatever. You wanna put a cookie in my fucking thing? Go ahead, put three cookies up there. That's how I like it. Three cookies in my browser, baby. Shove them in, fucking fist my browser with your cookies. Monitor, watch, gather my data, take my bio rhythms. I don't care. I wanna read the fucking story about the Loch Ness Monster appearing in goddamn Mississippi. I'll give you whatever you want. But man, it's just wild to think that what they're gonna do and they might wait till we're dead, but what they're gonna do is resurrect us. Holy fucking shit. You know, like, let me explain. We all know the various stories about the end of the world, you know, and especially like the Judeo-Christian story that Trumpet blows, the dead rise, there's a final day of judgment. And you know, if you're like a literalist and you've probably haven't spent much time thinking about, like, well, I hope that when the dead rise, their skin grows back and they're fucking, that whatever clothes they were wearing when then, what happens if you died naked? Like, is there gonna be a lot of like naked, freshly resurrected, very confused people from the 1200s wandering around? What happens if you're like buried in a mountain or something? What about the people who fell into the dams when they were building the great dams? Like all the dead bodies in the concrete, like, how do they get out? Or they just kind of like wake up but they can't open their eyes and they're stuck in concrete. Anyway, that was like, that's one of the crazy ideas about the end of the world. You know, the dead come back to life. But holy fucking shit. What it really is, is they're just gonna bring us all back to life. That's what I said a long time ago. They're gonna take us, they're gonna take your online profile and they're gonna resurrect it and they're gonna put it on their service and you're gonna have to deal with the fact that a duplicate of you is now existing in some kind of simulated ecosystem. And now we're gonna have to also deal with the fact that that simulated version of you and this fucking ecosystem, more than likely is gonna be better than you. And if you look at the Rogan AI replication that they did, they did that. They like had him read tongue twisters. As a kind of like, look, it's already a little better than you. I mean, I don't know Rogan's proficiency at tongue twisters. He's probably great at them. Who knows? I'm not good at them. But it's not just that, you know? It's not just gonna be your voice. It's gonna be your face and your voice. And it's gonna be mixed with an AI that has access to all the information in the world. So there is going to be an infinitely more intelligent, articulate, funnier, cooler thing that looks just like you online. And it gets even fucking weirder because our online identities have become who we are. You, many of you know me, not because you've met me in person, but through this podcast. And this podcast, where does it exist? Where do I live when I'm not in my body? I'm just a series of ones and zeros on various servers somewhere. My voice anytime you download and listen to it, it's just being duplicated, you know? And that's gonna happen to all of us. That's every single one of us. If you've got a Facebook account, if you've got any kind of digital thumbprint out there, you are going to be duplicated. You're gonna have to deal with the fact that some virtual version of you is getting fucked by clowns in a fucking AI simulated universe. That can happen. That is gonna happen. We're gonna have deep, fake versions of us that our enemies have access to. And we are gonna have to inevitably get the email. Fuck enemies, I'm friends with comedians. I know it's coming. I know it's coming. I know it's coming. What's coming is some kind of goddamn clown, some AI clown, some simulated virtual clown with bat wings and like, like he's with big fucking banshee boobs and seven horse cocks and cocks on his feet. And then I just know, I know my friends, I know it's coming. I'm gonna have to look at an AI version of me with just banshees just pooping on it and coming. You know what I'm saying? It's like, you're gonna have to deal with just the fact that like, there's gonna be various versions of you running rampant through the internet. You know, who knows what happens when they become autonomous. What are you gonna do when 1,000 versions of you suddenly start making their own Twitter accounts and they're funnier and cooler than you? We're gonna be surpassed by ourselves. We're all gonna be wandering around the world turning, going online to ask ourselves to like do shit for us cause they're more articulate than us. That's just right around the corner friends. It's just look at the, look at the, look at the Rogan thing. There's gonna be more of those coming matter of time more of these deep fakes coming. In fact, this isn't even me. This is an AI version of me. It's the exact same technology. This was just sent to Duncan and Duncan's putting it up on his podcast right now because he's too busy right now to do his own stuff. The last three or four opening rants that you've heard is it hasn't even been Duncan. Duncan is working in a cannery right now in Alaska. He's up to his fucking neck in fish oil. Nighty sleeps on an old plank. He ran out of money a long time ago and he just gave us permission to duplicate his personality. So this is what we've got so far. It's still not funny, but maybe we'll figure it out. You know, we're working on that part of it. The point is friends, enjoy this world that you're in right now where there's only one you. Enjoy it. Cause this is the last days if there won't be only being one you. I don't know what terms of services you signed when you signed up for fucking Facebook, but my guess is that it is only a matter of time before you are gonna see some version of you, your mom, your dad, your grandfather, whoever's online. And they're gonna be selling Pepsi products. Or what's even worse, what's gonna happen is something's gonna pop up after one of your loved ones passes away. And it's gonna be like, would you like to spend another hour with your grandmother? Then all you gotta do is watch this one minute phone commercial and then you could say hi to grandmother again. And it's gonna be almost just like you were with her. Except every once in a while, she's gonna say, this is your grandmother. I'm so glad you came to see me. Please, please, please make them stop. Please just buy an accessory to your Verizon phone and they'll stop doing these terrible things to me. I miss you. I love you. Save me from this hell.

Now without further ado, welcome back to the DTFH, the host of the Drunken Dauest podcast, the host of History on Fire, the author of How to Create Your Own Religion, historian, professor, fighter, and all around saint, the great Danielli Belelli. Welcome to Soil, and welcome to... Mr. Belelli, welcome back to the DTFH. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I always said that it's weird. I was about to say that. Always a treat to see you. It's fun. I don't know any other historians. I don't know any other people who have such a deep grasp on global history. And I wanted to start this podcast, and possibly make the entire theme of this podcast about something that I love, conspiracy theories. Oh yes, of course, yes. I have been, you know, I rotate conspiracy theories. My attitude with them is one of, these are like the emerging modern folk stories, mythology, maybe there's some like kernels of truth in some of them, but usually there's so many different distortions based on not enough information or wrong information that they can possibly be true. The most obvious ones, flat earth. I don't know, hollow earth. Yeah, there's some pretty weird shit out there, but yes. Pretty weird shit. But I came upon my new favorite conspiracy theory. And I thought, my God, this is the thing to talk about with Danielli today, which is, okay, so, and I'm gonna confuse it for those of you who are more familiar with it, because I just got into it, but do you know about the Tartar Empire? Yeah. Tartaria. Sure, sure. Let's go into it. Okay. You tell. So the idea is that there was some kind of cataclysm that happened not that long ago relative to like how old we think the earth is, maybe 500 years. And essentially the history that we think is history is all wrong. It's been completely rewritten. We are living in a false history. The story that we think the way the United States came about, the way Europe came about, all of it, completely, absolutely wrong. The catacombs of Paris, they're not filled with bones because of some, the plague. Is that's why they think they're filled with bones? They're filled with bones because of a terrible, terrible cataclysm that happened, and they had to fill the bones up. They had to bring all the dead bodies underneath Paris. So have you ever heard this conspiracy theory before, which is essentially history as we know it is a lie? History as we know it is a lie is a classic, but you're giving me a new spin to it. So that's interesting. No, I was just reading last night one that was sounded vaguely going in that direction. Is it what, the Mandela effect? Yes. Is that kind of a, okay, good. So do explain, what's the connection there between the two? So, well, okay. Basically, our understanding of history, if we're gonna bring in the Mandela effect, our understanding of history would be comparable to early humans understanding of the planet. So early human thinks that bases their understanding of the planet on what they can see. And on the highest point that they can get to. So from getting on top of a very high mountain, you can look and see the expansive things, draw maps based on that, but you can't get into space and see it. Similarly, we're glued to time because we haven't figured out a way to elevate ourselves from the time space continuum yet. And so our experience of time in history itself is based on the notion of one time stream that we're on. When the reality is that every single one of us is constantly moving through multi-realities, more moving through various time streams that are all mostly identical to the one that we're in. In the same way that if you were a person living, I don't know, in North America, your ability to travel from North America to Hawaii, for example, and see a completely different ecosystem would be limited by your ability to get on a boat. Yes, yes, yes. In the same way, because we can't really move out of the temporal ecosystem that we're in, we think that time looks like this. We're in a post-industrial technological civilization, constantly teetering on world war and stuff, but if you had some extra help via technology, some sort of magical ability, or the ability to control your dreams, et cetera, you could theoretically actually shift timelines all the way to a point where we're currently existing in kind of a Buddha field techno utopia. A Buddha field techno utopia. Okay, I like that already. So do tell. Evidence, what do they base it on? I hate to be the guy who says that, but... Well, can we, for the sake of this, just push evidence off the table? Because if we start going to... We have to go to in this particular time field, time stream, time space continuum. The evidence is that there is no other... This is it, baby. We're here. I mean, just forget it. Like we have no quantifiable measurements. Now you can look into quantum physics, you can look into like the reality that if you investigate anything at a deep enough level, it vanishes to see there seems to be a permeability to reality itself. And then of course there's the people who say, the Berenstein Bears, I remember it as... Okay, so it's exactly what I was reading last night. Jesus Christ, that's weird and odd. Yeah, that is, we live in the matrix, right? Never heard of ever before read it last night. And here you are telling me about it. Yeah, yeah. That's right, yeah. Weird. Well, it's not too weird because you brought it up. I was talking about multiple histories and you brought the Mandela effect. Oh, yeah, no, I mean, weird in the sense that, well, what you're talking about is so intimately related to this that it's like there's a very... There is a connection there, yeah. Interesting, interesting, interesting. Okay, so do tell me more about this. No, you tell me, because I'm interested in you, your understanding of history is so much greater than anyone I know who is in academics. Sure. Academia. So in your understanding of history, are there any iterations of this concept that the reality as we know it, history as we know it is not actual history, but that in fact, we're living in some kind of confined reality tunnels shared by a certain group of people. We're on the outskirts of that. There are all these other realities that are happening simultaneously. If you get some historians really high on LSD, you may get there, you know, you could, that's worth a shot. No, generally speaking, I mean, the most, and even that's considered a way out there, but the most that's kind of within the range of something vaguely similar, and I use the word vaguely intentionally because it's not even that similar. But like if you talk about like some gram ankle kind of idea about, you know, our timeline of history is completely fucked up. It's, you know, his idea about younger trials, comet impact, there was way more advanced civilizations before this time that got wiped out. And so our scale of history is really limited and reduced. But even that's almost a square theory compared to what you're telling me, because that's still assuming a linear timeline, a single reality, we just don't happen to know about something that happened long ago. What you are saying is there is no single reality. There's multiple timelines, multiple universes touching each other. That's a whole other, you know, that takes it 25 steps forward. And already, like, you know, you take gram, which I like gram, by the way. I think gram has mixed very interesting points. He definitely raises some good questions. And even he's considered like way, like when I, you know, I had gram on, you had gram on on the podcast, I had gram on a couple of times on Trank and Taoist and I get like the hardcore guys were like, what are you meddling with this pseudo historian crap? And I'm like, dude, the guy actually has good questions, you know, does that mean every single thing he's saying is correct? People really doesn't even believe that, but he's making good points, you know? He's like, so the standard view of history is so square, that gram is way out there. What you're telling me is like make a gram look like the most square human in the universe, you know? So that's the scale. Okay, then help me understand this. Yeah. When you begin to study history, is the study of history mixed in with the study of time? No. So historians aren't even interested in time as we understand it or physics or anything like that. No, I mean, and that's the problem with most disciplines. That's one of the things that I've always disliked about not even academia, but our way of approaching knowledge that it's based on specializing to the point where not only you have no connection between history and physics, let's say, or history and any other field, you know, any field with each other, they basically are foreigners. But even within the same field, he's like, what? You're a historian. Well, what does that mean? You know, I'm a historian of 1727, Paris, that's what I'm a historian of. And you're like, holy, I can't remember. That's so cool, by the way. Well, I mean, it's cool and it's not. It's cool because you end up knowing every single thing that happened down to what was going on on that straight corner between 5 p.m. and 5.15 on that day. But at the same time. How is that real? Is that it? That's hyperbole. Totally. It is. Well, I think that we have established that about every other word that comes out of my mouth is hyperbole. So we are good with that. I didn't mean it. I'm sorry if that seemed like a neg. I don't want that to be true. I would like it to. And I think that's why I like to run with this stuff. But no, I love hyperbole. No, I think what it is is knowledge is divided in this tiny subset that even the guy I was talking with a lady was a specialist in Japanese history, right? He's like, it's already limited, right? You take one country out of all of the world. I mentioned a huge thing that happened in the 1400s in Japan. And she was like, what? And I'm like, well, it's kind of important. And she's like, oh, no, no, no, I saw it. I only studied Japan from like the 1850s forward. And I'm like, so you're not even a historian of Japan. You're a historian of like one century and a half of Japan. That's it. That's all. And that's my feeling with most of knowledge, that the effort to cross boundaries is next to non-existence. OK. Definitely in academia, but even outside sometime. From your own personal subjective experience, where do you think history exists outside of the human mind and outside of whatever material it's recorded on? Well, I mean, and that's when you say whatever material is recorded on, that's the problem with the field itself. That there's no great book or history that you open and tells you everything that happened exactly as it happened, right? You're only as good as the sources you have. And most of human history, we know nothing about, right? Maybe you find one tooth of a guy who lived 30,000 years ago and you go like, what an amazing discovery. It's one tooth of one guy. Come on, I know it's like. So most of human history, we have no evidence. The ones that we do know about is usually one guy who wasn't really there, but 60 years later, right about it because his great uncle told him that his retired neighbor was there one day, but actually wasn't really his retired neighbor. He was actually the sister of his neighbor who told, you know, his hearsay. So there's monstrous, like when all you have is like three paragraphs in a guy writing 60 years later on a third hand account, reliability is a little thing to say the least. So then the stuff that we do know more about, even when you do have an eyewitness who was there who said, I saw it, there's the question of reliability to that person. There's moral of the stories, a lot of history. There's a ton of guesswork involved. There's, you know, what we say as fact is maybe possibly likely. I hope fact. And when you start digging down, you have to really separate what do we actually know about this, which is usually something that can be written in three paragraphs, and what we think that that means and what how we connect the dots, which were then you end up with a book. Okay, gotcha. So, you know, we obviously we know someone built the Eiffel Tower. Yep. And we probably know who built the Eiffel Tower, and we probably know why they built the Eiffel Tower. And then from that person, we can kind of figure out who did build the Eiffel Tower. No, Mr. Eiffel. Yeah, Frank Eiffel. But we so, but the, the, the sum total, like what's interesting to me is most of us are walking around with the idea of like, I understand the history of the world. Yep. I understand how we got where we're at right now. But when you look into it, you realize like, not only do you have a very foggy understanding of, for example, how California came to be, who lived in California before California was California, what California was called before it was called California. Yep. You have a foggy memory of what the fuck you were doing in the third grade. Exactly. What you were doing in the fifth grade, sixth grade, seventh grade, you don't know what you were doing June 15th, 1987. Right. And so then you, so, you know, as I say, as above so below, the human psyche is not equipped to remember things accurately. Of course. And from that, you could probably extrapolate, then if the sum total of all human psyches is what contains within it, our understanding of history, then our understanding of history is completely distorted. Yeah, because it goes through a filter, right? There's no, in that sense, it's almost a philosophical question about the existence of objective reality out there versus what you know, that's inevitably filtered through your own subjectivity, which clearly raises question about how much of that is really objective and how much the filter is making up as you go. Yeah. So this produces all of the wars and all of the catastrophes and all of the human conflict, because everyone's walking around with a distorted conceptualization of what happened, right? No one even fucking knows. There might be some epigenetic record inside of us, but the reality is it's all distorted. So I'm an American, you're an Iranian. Over there, we've got the Syrian and the Russian, God forbid. And we have all these people wandering around. They have some in their mind, some sense of like, I'm an American. Yeah, I'm an Iranian, I'm a Russian. But really, those people, they don't know what that even fucking means, because it doesn't mean anything. Well, even genetically, it doesn't really mean anything, because when you look at it, it's like, unless you live in some weird corner of the world that has been isolated, which there are not that many by now. Like, I remember when I first started getting into Italian history, because I was like, I read everything else, I might as well learn the history of where I'm from, right? And so like, at one point, I read about the one city where I'm from, and they say, oh, like 2,500 years ago was founded by the Celts. And I'm like, oh, cool. So there's a Celtic origin. I turn the page and he's like, yeah, but 20 years later, these other tribes came in and killed them all. He's like, oh, okay, so not that guy, this guy, yeah, but 30 years later, and then you go over 2000 years and you realize that everybody and their grandmother has gone through there. So what it means to be from there today is a mix of, I don't know, 300 different peoples would themselves are a mix of other things. So you just start realizing that this notion of like race, for example, only exists if you keep it in a really narrow historical range, you know, from 1300 to 1500, oh, I see there's continuity. But once you open it up a little, even the idea of a race is kind of a joke, you know, because everybody's a mix of a million different things. So Nietzsche declares in a time when it meant something, God is dead. Motherfucker. Should we declare history is dead? Should we declare that our devotion and worship of history, our fixation on history is in fact a fixation on a false God. Here is where I'm going to tell you, so here is what's interesting about this that to me, focusing on the evidence, what do we actually know about something like one thing that I do with podcast sometime is like, there are awesome stories that I want to tell. When I start looking at the evidence, the evidence is kind of thing doesn't necessarily support the stories. So I usually split it in a double track is like, okay, this is what people say. And I want to believe it badly. Did it happen? You know, the evidence doesn't tell us that it did. This is what we actually know. And so you have a double layer, you have the mythology, which is true on a different level than historical truth. And then you have what we actually know and what we actually know to me is interesting because yes, the sources are limited. Yes, there are problem with sources. Yes, we lack a lot of information that would want to have, but that doesn't mean that everything out there, every opinion about it is equally valid. You know, some are based on actual facts that you can, despite all the pain and suffering of digging through a mountain of crap, you can actually dig to something that turns out to be semi solid versus others are just, you know, random, you're making shit up along the way, you know. So to me, that effort to separate what do we know as much as a human being can do anything? Let's put it that way. Because when you know, when we say fact, even that's get complicated, depending on, but as much as a human being can know, we do know certain things for a fact versus all the other stuff where it's like, maybe possibly, I don't know about that or no, that looks goes into legend territory. I think there's something interesting there. And one doesn't necessarily have to kill the other because, you know, just because you want to know the bear facts, well, the bear facts, obviously, there's a lot more that happened. So that doesn't mean that that's the beginning and the end of the story, but that's the solid part of the story. Right. The other parts make a lot happen that we don't know about. And that's fine. And a lot happened that we can speculate about, but that doesn't, that's a separate thing from actual history. This seems like a non sequitur. It's not. Have you ever been in a fight with your girlfriend or wife? And she brings up a fight that happened like a year ago. Sure. To justify some, something that happened that she did just in the present, of course. Right. And you realize that if, because you fucked up a year ago, that justifies her fucking up eternally, right? Or I don't know why I'm saying, I'm blaming this on a girl. I've done this lame ass tactic where you're like, well, you did that two weeks ago, three weeks ago, you were doing, and you realized like, if I am using this shit tactic, then essentially, I have caught us in a never ending, repeating loop. Yep. And so there's that saying, he who forgets history is doomed to repeat it. Yes. But maybe the reality is he who remembers history is doomed to repeat it, that by the fixation on patterns that have emerged in the past, we're recreating them in the present. And that the best thing to do would be, and this, I love it because it's so blasphemous to so many, abandoned history. Right. Forget it. It's over. Who cares? Here we are now. So what? Whatever it was, whatever it was. And now as I'm saying it, I was like, oh my God, this is a delightful blasphemy. World War II, who gives a fuck? Right. Founding fathers, who gives a fuck? Never even happened, who cares? Yeah, yeah. And so then in saying these things, people are going to be like, What? My fucking grandfather was at ease. And then, and then, and then, you know, we should, we gotta, we must worship and bow down to the millions and millions of dead people who have been transformed to dust and are in crypts right now, instead of having our own lives. Right. It's very similar to people who have a sick fetishistic attachment to their parents. And even when their parents passed, they still try to like live according to what their parents thought they should live like. Or Norman Bates style. With yes, right. Do we as a species right now have a Norman Bates style relationship with history? I think I'm in good old Taoist fashion. I like to think of it as three stages. There's the initial one where you don't know anything about history. You don't care and whatever. It doesn't matter. And then you realize, no, it does. There's a lot to so second stages when you realize no way everything that you live today has been shaped by historical forces. We are your education, the way your parents raise you has been shaped by so suddenly you're like, it's all about history. It's all about remembering the past and when this and that. And then you go to stage three, which is yes, good that you went through that process, but you also got to live in the present. So dragging on history as if he was this dead weight as a corpse along the way is not helping anybody. That doesn't mean that you should stay at stage one where you just go like fuck it all. It doesn't matter. It's not important. Is is like the classic Taoist parable about learning, right? You don't want to be ignorant, but when you are learned, you are weighed down by knowledge. Knowledge doesn't allow you to live in the present because you're so stuck with concepts that are heavy rocks in your head. Yes. So what do you do? Do you never learn? No, you learn and then you just absorb what's useful from it and let go of the dead weight so that then learn it's not any more knowledge becomes wisdom. It's become the wisdom that allow you to actually be in the present, be alive today here and in this moment with a little extra depth, a little understanding of human nature and other things that in the specific case that we're using history can give you. It can be any other example, right? But we're talking about history. So it is, is like, is not a fight between dumb ignorance versus heavy ultra intellectual knowledge is those are two stages along the way and you ultimately want to overcome both, but you kind of need to go through all of them in a way. So in that sense, to me, history is like look at something like to pick a specific example. Ethnic minorities who got screwed over. Yes. Right. You get the standard white guy responses. Come on, get over it. That was 200 years ago or 500 years ago or 100 years ago. It's not today. So just shut the fuck up and get on with it today. And it's a tricky thing because even when it's not phrased the way I did, which is sort of the asshole way of putting it, even when it's done in a nicer way, there is a point to that that is like, hey, you don't want to just hang on to a past forever in the sense that then your as you are putting your recreating it in the present, right? But at the same time, it's a little too easy for you, motherfucker, we haven't had that experience to come tell somebody else, hey, you guys need to just get over it, you know, pull yourself by by your bootstrap and we all start from the same starting line. You know, it's like, to me, it's both at the same time is no, you want to know it, you want to understand it, you want to even call it for what it is. And it's important to actually shine the spotlight. Once we have done that. Okay, not everything that's happening to you today is the result of what happened 100 years ago and I justify why you are poor and oppressed and I can't do shit with my life because what happened 100 is like, what happened 100 years ago is absolutely true and it did shape some forces that are still affecting you today, but you also have agency in the in the present. The problem with the discussion is that they tend to be very one sided, they are either the it's all about the past and you are a victim of society or get over it, none of that is meaningful, none of that is real. It's an illusion just live today. Both of those things will be oversimplified a situation one by saying something true, but do mean yourself to never move on. And the other one by just denying reality. Well, I mean, to bring it into like a person's subjective daily experience, because I yeah, because I got lucky enough to be the white dude on planet Earth right now. I have no fucking idea outside of my own ability to like empathize and think about it. I honestly, I just don't like my friend who teaches me meditation. I was in a fight with my wife when she was pregnant. And he's like, Duncan, if you experienced the hormones going through her body, yeah, for five minutes, you would be committed based on how I know you, you would just go insane. That seemed like a fair statement. Yes. And I liked that because I was like, yeah, you're right. I have no idea what that and you find compassion there. But I want to talk about like a thing that haunts so many people. Your age, right? So people walk around there like, well, I'm 45 years old. I'm 20 years old. I'm whatever age. And at every single age, people feel a different type of pressure based on where they're at. So if you're 15, the pressure you're feeling is I need to like do good and and figure out what I'm going to do and what college I'm going to go into. And I was thinking got laid, but sure. Okay, that's you get laid, of course. And then figure out in the midst of that, a deal with your fucking raging boner, right? Then you get in your 20s, you're in college. Now you got to deal with the fact of like the weird presentation of potential careers all seem like just essentially like different nooses with which to hang your future on. And then you get out of college and you have some job or you have to find a job or you decide to be an outcast wanderer or whatever. But still you have this thing feeling of some encroaching thing called your thirties. And then you get to your thirties like, wait, I'm in my fucking thirties. And then you get to your fours like, holy shit, what am I? So all of these anxieties are hanging on top of a sense of time. And each and and and none of them are really that useful in the sense that you've set a clock. You're like, I got this long to do some dumb thing called my life. And the way I'm going to do the dumb thing called my life is not based on some intuition or instinct, but it's based on an approximation of what a good life is based on what I've been told a good life is by the movies, TV shows and things I've been taught. And it could be that all those are totally wrong. That in fact, the reality is you have no fucking idea what a good life is. You just know how to parrot, imitate and mimic the other monkey descendants. Right. So this is a way that people torture themselves. I've met 28. I was talking to some guy. I think he just turned 30 and he was so sad. And he said to me, you know, I'm getting old. I'm like, what the fuck? Yeah, you're in your fucking thirties, man. No, you're getting old. Yeah, fuck off. What are you talking? Right. What are you talking about? You you are out of your mind. You're you have you might as well have told me that a witch has a piece of your hair and is poking a fucking voodoo doll with it in a forest. And that's why you feel bad, right? Except you're the fucking witch, right? Because you have hung your life on a time. So similarly, I can speak to the rancid white supremacists that I've seen on the internet who are deeply glued to the idea that white people are responsible for all the good things in the world. Sure. These idiots are so attached to that idea. And they've done nothing. These are people who have maybe done like eight push-ups in the last three years. Right. Their great accomplishment in life was connecting their computer to the internet. Right. You know, they've done nothing. But we created that. Yeah, of course. You did shit. That was a great. I was watching. I'm sure you have seen it. This great Stan Hoppe bit where about nationalism and he's like, you know, because we freed France during World War II and he's going on like, hey, Mike, you know, I remember getting wasted the last night and I remember where. But I don't really remember it as in the mud in France. That is it. And so this adherence or fixation on the past historically. And the weird sentimentality people feel about it, I think is very similar to a kind of religious fundamentalism. And I think it is ultimately disastrous. Yeah. And I think I know. I think there's a reason why you connect religious fundamentalism to this. Because even though they sound like very different things, they are rolling around the very same issue to me, which is identity. People badly want to belong to something. People badly want to have an identity outside of just their own individual identity, because it's hard to just have your own. You know, when you are by yourself, you have to figure everything out in life. Yeah, there are guidelines out there, but you have to choose between 10,000 things. It's fucking hard. It's scary. And that's why despite what people say, people love dogma, you know, dogma is like a sweet mom who holds you in her arms saying, don't worry, baby. It's going to be okay. Just follow these rules. This is who you are. This is your identity. This is what your past is. Just go with this program and everything is going to work out. And it's a super seductive concept for a lot of people, because otherwise the alternative is that you have to figure shit out for yourself. That's right. And that's our work. So whether it is the identity of being what, you know, what kind of religious fundamentalism do I want to jump in? Why? Because that's going to give me the answers to everything in life. I don't need to create shit. I just need to follow a blueprint or what historical identity I want to embrace. I am whatever the fuck I am, right? And you decide people like me have this culture. We like these things. We suffer this thing, which make us more in this such fashion. And it's like, and again, you're buying a set of clothing, essentially, you're putting on this thing that you want because it's like, why is it so hard for people to live without a pre-package identity? Because then you have to create it every fucking step of the way. Who's creating it? Well, if you don't have a pre-package one, then you have to do it. Who's the you creating the identity? Right. So you are in this flow of shit that's mixed, that's part of this one body that you have, and you are in this constant state of flux. And in this process, you are trying to grasp at something to hold on to. It's momento. Remember that cool fucking movie and the guys written all over the walls, all this shit to remember? That's history. And humanity is this venge, many people are like this vengeful dude who's like looking at the walls and trying to summon up who the fuck did this to me? Right. It's the situation is one of, um, on one side, it's completely tragic to me because here we all are essentially in these like, I guess, what meat dinner tubes floating down this beautiful lazy river called time. And some time back there, people pass some crazy shit. There was some wild shit back there. Meanwhile, here we are. No. And all these people are like, oh, but back then, and they remember when we passed that fucking tree with a thing in it, his status and through fire. Of course. Now that's gone. Now we're in this. And so I think you're right. It hinges not only on the problem of having to establish your own identity, but do you think it also hinges on the problem that identity is identical to any other thing that exists in the material universe? As Bob Thurman, the great Buddhist philosopher says, the closer you look at anything, the less it seems to be real. Sure. And so you start with history and you realize, wait, I don't know what I ate for lunch two weeks ago, right? And I'm supposed to not believe that some, some shit that some guy wrote down on a scroll after he heard it from a guy who heard it from a guy who heard it from a lady who heard it from a guy who maybe dreamed it is real. Right. And so then you're like, oh shit. So probably a lot of history is distorted. We do have landscapes in the sense of there is the thumbprint of something that happened in the material, in the, in the material world, but we're not quite sure if our, our logical explanation for those things is, is real. And then this starts getting going deeper and deeper and closer and closer to home until you're like, wait, I don't know. Remember what I had for lunch two weeks ago on this day? Did I, was I even there? Right. And then that starts getting closer and closer to your like, suddenly here you are now. And you realize like, oh fuck, but this thing that I think I am right now is based on all this other shit that's probably not real. So then you, you get into your own self and now you start dissolving. And this is, I think maybe where you hit the fundamental conspiracy, which is that there isn't an identity. There isn't an individual self in our entire lives from the moment we're born to the moment we die. We're told that we are real. And because of that, we're all going fucking crazy. Right. That's Maya's game, right? There's this idea. Yeah, it's exactly. And I think that's the issue right there. The notion that, you know, when you step it down to an almost Buddhist philosophical level, is there anything really that or even like the Hindu idea of like, is there even anything outside of you? Is there like, you know, a hardcore one branch of Hindus philosophy argue that every single nerd is part of the same being. It's just this one entity, right? So that all the other things are an illusion or a play or a game that you play throughout existence, where this one thing that makes up the universe split into 10,000 things. And then the interplay with this give you history, give you life, give you things as we know it. But ultimately, they are all faces of the same God, right? Every single one. You know, it's a, on one hand, is a cool concept that's based on something because, you know, yeah, you're right. When you, the harder you look at something, the less solid it seems. Yes. At the same time, we live in a universe where in order to function, you have to buy into the separation between subject and object. You know, the me and this table are no one and the same. Well, yeah, if we were, as I'm driving, that would be a problem, you know, it's like, so in order to function here and now, you have to go by a subject, object duality and bill and act as if it was real, whether it is real or not. That's a whole completely separate discussion. You used to have to fucking go to church on Sunday or they set you on fire. Yeah. I mean, there's always an adherence to some illusionary thing that's being supported by people with guns. Ultimately, it's like, if you spend too much time in Western society, existing in unit of consciousness, you're probably going to get arrested. You know what I mean? Like someone's going to come in like, be like, no, you don't understand. You have to, you didn't, you didn't pay your taxes. Yeah, exactly. You didn't pay your rent. It's like, yeah, you need to act like this shit's real. We're literally being forced by, by people standing with guns behind the people standing with the forms to pretend this shit is real. Well, and I guess because the problem is that if you take the position that it is not real, then you, it's kind of hard to go on living in this dimension when you make that switch, when you, when you, and not only because, you know, there's some asshole out there was trying to impose a certain reality on you, but because if you start arguing, like I was talking with a dude who was a hardcore Zen Buddhist, right? And he was telling me this stuff about, you know, he was doing meditation, this and that, and he was like, looking at money, like, ah, money's an illusion. It's a piece of paper. It's not real. There's nothing real to it. Did you ask him for his money? And for what we gots worse, because then his teacher was like, yes. And you think that your wife and daughter are any more real than that piece of paper is, and he wasn't too happy about that part, right? Because he's like, on the money part, he could, you know, it's like, ah, whatever, fuck it, take the money. I don't care when it gets to something else. He's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, now we are taking it to another level that I'm not comfortable with, you know? Well, that's right. It is. Well, I mean, because it's uncomfortable. It's like, you know, you wake up in a world where everything's distorted and you can't find a way to find an undistorted anything because every single thing is distorted, at least if you're picking up data from other people. And then, you know, you end up with science and you end up with some, you need some way of like figuring out like, well, what, and this is the beginning of any great philosophical system. And, you know, nihilism is, can be an accidental byproduct of the conceptualization that everything is not real. Then you end up in, you can end up in a spiritual bypass. You abandon your responsibilities and just, I don't know. Just what do you do? You just fuck. I don't know what you bore people. Just like, ah, fuck off again. Is that guy again? With this nothing is real thing. So, but, but, and that all I think is absolutely, abjectly. A misunderstanding. Yeah. What if we are the sort of fixation on the identity? The doll of who we think we are is an obstruction that's getting in the way of our ability to move through time in a way that people haven't quite moved through time yet. In other words, like by getting stuck on the identity, you know, we are held on in the way that the Earth's mass pushes into the time space continuum and holds us fixed where we're at and keeps everything from flying off into space. The subjective mass, the ontological mass, the mass of our fixation, not only on our own identity, but on our historical understanding of the world and our fixation on our very distorted sense of truth has produced its own kind of subjective mass that is literally locking us into this particular timeline and that by gradually letting go of our addiction to the conceptualization of ourselves, we simultaneously experience radical shifts in the timeline that we're living on. And so when you hear about enlightenment, it isn't a thing that happens to you as a person. It's a thing that happens to the entire time space continuum that you're living in when you achieve realization. Right. So the more you let go of your attachment to this yourself, suddenly people report, oh, fuck, I've started having synchronicities. Then people start saying, yeah, I like, I got this weird ability to like almost read people's thoughts and then people start saying crazy shit, which is like, oh, no, I saw someone walk through a wall. Matrix shit. Yeah. And then you're like, I can't believe I just said matrix shit. I used to say, if anyone says this is like a matrix, I wish their balls would explode because it's so annoying. I only have one. So I got to be careful. Yeah, be careful about no one. But this is what I mean is like by focusing on whatever your idea of your own personal history is in the history of the world is, this is the tether locking the hot air balloon of your identity to the particular part of the multiverse that you call reality. And the more you let go of that, the more you notice things seem to change, not just subjectively and not just interpersonally, but on the global scale. And I find it ridiculously fascinating the way you have come around to this whole pro like from where we started to where you're at right now. Now, for the sake of everybody listening, not suddenly bemoaning the fact that good high quality LSD has sort of disappeared from the market and there's less than before, or at least that's the popular perception. Exactly. And suddenly they are scrambling for a good drug dealer to be able to keep up with the conversation. I think like one healthy step, baby step, you know, you, you think like, well, we're seeing right now is we're shit and you're not buying any of that. That's fine. Um, baby step to test the water with just that doesn't hurt. You don't have to go any further, but it's not a bad idea. That notion of identity that not like take a look at in your own life, which of course is different from everybody. You know, my experience, Duncan's experience totally different, but anybody else listening, totally different. What are the things that you think define you that make up your identity, your gender, your nationality, your skin color, your whatever the fuck, you know, list them down like what are the things that you feel are shaping who you are as a human being and don't let me know. Everybody's got a filter. Of course, the gender is a filter. As you said a few minutes ago, if you have a certain hormones going through your body is a very different experience than if you don't, right? So filter, we get it. How much do you actually invest in that identity? How much being a male from a certain country, shape who you see yourself as being, you know? And what I would invite people to play with is try to kind of lower the volume on that voice a little bit, you know, it's like, for example, I always find it funny when people are, and granted, this is also, this is where the objective and subjective meet, right? If I hear somebody telling me, which I've heard a lot because so many of the people I've known are not big fans of white guys, right? So if I hear somebody telling me, fuck white guys, they did this and that are horrible, fuck white people. I don't think it personal because I'm not white people. You know, it's like, yeah, I happen to have light color skin. The fuck do I care? I know exactly what you're talking about. I wasn't me. I had nothing to do with it. So I'm not even taking it like you're talking to me. Now, of course, it's, it depends on how other people around the perceive it. You know, you can be, have whatever ethnicity you got, have whatever gender, whatever age, whatever, whatever thing by which people perceive you through and try to put you in a certain box and you don't identify with the things, but everybody else around does identify you with that. Well, suddenly now you do have something in common with the other guy who also has light skin or also is from the same country or age, not because you really have something in common, but because everybody else treat you like you do. Okay. So it's like, okay, we do have, we do have one thing in common. We get treated the same by these guys over here. Yes. But my point is like, other than that, do we really have anything in common? Do we, you know, we do on a human level, but does that it's kind of like, that's why to me, the whole discussion for us to take a specific example, something like nationalism, which is a big part of many people's identity, right? Where they are from, their nation, their thing, never made any fucking sense to me, like not even a little bit, because to me is like, people aren't too proud of all the things that like Leonardo da Vinci or this shit that came out of Italy. I'm like, it wasn't me, man. I mean, yeah, that's sweet. But what the fuck do I have to do with it? You know, it's like, I'm born in the same nation. That's what makes me special. Yeah, that doesn't mean shit to me. Similarly, I don't take all the crap that happened in Italy as being who I am. You know what I mean? I don't, and even that identity is funny because that only exists when you are comparing yourself to the outsiders, to the guys across the border. But when people start looking inside, it gets a whole different story, right? It's like, well, we are great and proud Italian, except for you guys from the south, because you guys kind of suck. I mean, when I speak Italian, it's more like the north. That's the real Italian. But even that, you know, 50 miles away, there's the town Bergamo. They speak funny, they eat weird food. I guess they are Italian, but that's not really what I mean. You know, it's like the city, Milan, not the outskirts of town, though, because that's why trash. I'm talking more about the central. So it becomes your neighborhood minus the people who share a wall with pump up the music at 2 a.m. And you hate their guts, your family minus your brother who's an S, you know, that identity suddenly shrinks to a level where it boils down to the individual. Yeah. And the bigger that identity gets, the thinner it gets. Like what you actually do share is minimal. So what is it? What do we all share? I think that's what interests me. If we are going to go past the individual level, then go all the way. Go to a human level. Go to what does it mean to be human? What does it mean to live in this body? What what are the things that I can and fuck, I can even take it further. Even, you know, we got them maybe with a mammal, with another mammal, with a dog. You can I can have empathy for the dog. He can fucking understand where I'm coming from. Some of the time I understand where I know what I know what you need, man. Is that particular type of food that you want? And, you know, so to me, that interests me more than anything else is every single person is a mix of 10,000. The influences, which as you rightly say, they are constantly changing. It's not even a stable thing in itself. So if your identity is an ocean, is this constantly changing body of water that's changing every second and everybody else says to great, figure out a way out to roll in the present moment to flow and using as much empathy as humanly possible, where you can find ways to relate to somebody who, of course, has a different body than you as a different age, as a different experience, as a different or if he wants to be happy, exactly. She wants to be happy. Exactly. We all want to be happy. Yep. That's what we share. Yeah. And the dogs do too. And the birdies do too. Yeah. We all want to be happy when you're in traffic driving home. What, what, what, what do you have in common with everybody? They all want to go home. Yep. Every single one, one, just like you. They want to go see their babies, their wife. They want to go watch Netflix. They want to be home and that's what's happening. The difference, the problem is because we are still living in the era of believing that ourselves are real is they think they want to go home more than you want to go home. Of course. Everyone's like, when the self-driving cars come, traffic will be much better because they'll be able to drive and like, they'll all synchronize. Yeah. We don't need that. The moment we all realize when you're looking over at the pissed off dude who's glaring at you, you know why he's glaring at you? Because he's got this beautiful baby at home and he's been at work all day and it's bath time. Yep. And he knows he's got, he's got to get home in 30 minutes to give the baby the bath or the baby has to go to bed. Yep. And he's fucking wants to see this adorable little baby or someone wants to go home because they're in love with someone and they just met him and they're late for the day or all these beautiful reasons and the problem is they all think that reason is more important than your reason. Of course. And this is why we're in hell. And this is also why simultaneously we're in heaven because all you got to do is flip the switch the other way. So how do you I get it? And I like it philosophically. How do you live in a very kind of thanks and close word in which, you know, if a tiger decide that the deer has just as much of a right to life as I do and look at the beautiful deer roaming around, I shouldn't eat it and tiger stars then or what you see where I'm going. Yeah, we have to take the. Idea of the expansive. Global utopia. And we have to start with ourselves. I can't fix the tiger deer relationship yet. But as you about it, you are doing a wonderful job wiping them all out. So there would be any relationship right. Yes. I mean, the other way to fix it would be to come up with some kind of like bio organic, like robotic deer that have tofu flesh that the lions can still enjoy eating and chasing them while the other deer sequestered to some other. I don't know, man, but that's for DARPA to figure out. Yeah, like the first step is, I think, has to be a subjective shift of circuitry. And to me, I think of Terrence McKenna, when he has one of his very great, probably unscientific yet beautiful explanations of why when you smoke DMT, you enter into an alternate dimension is that it actually reverses the spin of. I can't remember how he puts it, but on some quantum level, it's literally it's causing the circuitry in your consciousness to reverse. And in that reversal of the circuitry, the veil is temporarily lifted and you see reality as it actually is, right, which is populated with, you know, various entities of such tremendous beauty that it it as he puts it could you could die from astonishment. Now, similarly, I think that it would begin with a subjective exploration of intentionality and all people so that we could determine where the evil is. And what I found in that in my own sort of exploration of that is that every single person that I have met thus far in my life has been tortured by their selfishness. And in that pain, they're acting in ways that is intolerable to people around them, which is compounding their suffering. That's it. No evil, no nefarious anything, more just like the way an animal with his or her paw and a trap reacts when someone comes and takes the trap off. Yeah. No one would say that animal is being a dick. Sure. When it's trying to bite you. Yeah. You wouldn't go to the animal and say, listen, why are you being such an asshole? I'm just trying to get your trap off. Right. Yeah. You know, it's similarly, I think this is what we're witnessing is that every single one of us has gotten our soul trapped in our identities. And that is producing for many, many people a great deal of suffering because the difference between in this weird analogy is the animal knows the trap is hurting it and will not slag off to get out of that fucking trap. A human will fight to keep the trap safe. A human will put lipstick on the track. A human will like buy the trap rings and Rolexes and beautiful watches. Their human will look at other people's traps and be like, what a fucking loser in his ugly trap. This is the problem, I think. So the idea would be first explore that idea. Is your identity really bringing you pleasure? Is there joy in your desires? Is there something you're really getting out of this never ending exertion to try to get people to know what you're like? And for me, I found that there is not much there. I'm with you. I think identity in many cases is a crutch that when you feel that you can't handle life. That's when you cling the hardest to and you know, look at who are the people who cling the hardest to a rigid identity. That's why to me it was interesting when you use the word fundamentalism because often is is not just oh, this is my it's like a clinging heart disease. The absolute truth on their question and kind of thing because it's like, otherwise they feel lost. Otherwise they feel ridder than swimming in a beautiful ocean. They're drowning there and they need something to hang on to because they feel like it's too much. That's right. I can't handle it. So I even get that I understand why people do it. I get it. Why people are addicted to rigid identities. Ideally, either you learn or somebody teach you to actually swim. So you don't need to cling to this goddamn rigid identity that hard. But I understand that until you're getting your hang of how to be in the water, it's scary. And I understand why somebody would do it. For sure. I mean, there's it's mainly because things that are in pain. They're not generally rational. You know, you I know myself when like, I get angry enough, my rationality goes right out the fucking window. Absolutely. And that anger is just suffering and suffering makes you act crazy. So yeah, to me, it's like history, I think for a lot of people is this type of like, imaginary bear trap that seems to have imprisoned in the way that the individual identity and our attachment to our personal history seems to be causing us to be stuck. Because if you're in a bear trap, you're not going very far. I think that in the same way history is this bear trap that seems to have encapsulated the sum total of all of us in is causing a great deal of suffering. But who the fuck knows? Anyway, Mr. Bilelli, I know that you've got to go. It's we are now at 1205. I have a few minutes if you want, or we can wrap up. However, if you feel that we're in a good place, we can wrap up or I can stick around a few more up to you. I think that I want to. Can you talk about the phone conversation you this is I just want to wrap up on this. Tell me about the phone conversation. Okay, just a little quick history. Yes. This is when you know you have cool fucking friends. Yes. Right before we start the podcast. Daniel is on the phone with some mysterious person planning a fight in Japan. Yes, for his girlfriend. Yes, correct. That's yeah, it's an interesting universe is what's going on with Savannah. What is that? Can you talk about it? Yeah, sure. She fights for one championship, which is in Asia is the biggest MMA organization and is definitely even global is pretty up there. I mean, there's UFC of course, but there's one is huge. And it's it's kind of called one is an interesting take on things because is is perfect for her personality too, because you know, a lot of UFC a lot of like MMA in the West tends to be very, you know, just bleed kind of stuff. The ultra macho trash talking type of shit. That's what sells fights. Yeah, that's why trash talking is such a big part of the game. Sure. One is trying to push a more sort of traditional martial arts respectful mellow kind of thing. And it fits our personality way better because she's not a trash talker. She's very polite and sweet and stuff. So it's like flash is like, you kidding me? I get to fly out to Asia and fight in Asia. I got a free trip out of it. What? Yeah, I like that a lot better than being flown into Kansas City, no fans to Kansas City. But you know what I mean, you know, so she's excited. She she had her first and she had a couple of fights in US sort of entry level stuff. Then she had her first fight for one back in December. That was a man I was this is how people are wired differently. So it's 2 30 in the morning in US when it's happening. And you know, I'm watching it live on TV. And I'm on the couch and I'm fucking hyperventilating. Right? I'm just not the fight hasn't even started. They're just the walk out. And I'm just going like and I watch her and she has this big smile like looks like a kid in Disneyland, right? She's just happy and relaxed and just high five in everybody. And after what she told me, you know, as funny as like what I did my walk out my heart rate didn't go up one beat. And I'm like, how the fuck is that even possible? Like humanly? How is that even like, just the thoughts my heart starts beating about twice as mine is like, exactly. What are you talking about? And you know, people are oddly wired, like she can do that. No problem. You put a mic in front of her and ask her to talk about her feelings. And she starts sweating bullets. I can do that in my sleep, right? It's like, but yeah, no, it's exciting because she did really well so far. I mean, all her fights ended in less than two minutes so far. She's kind of a beast because you know, most female MMA is very technical. Especially when it comes to punching power usually not quite up there compared to men. It's very rare to see sort of the one punch KO in female MMA. For whatever weird thing she punches hard, like she can turn your lights off with one punch. So it's a trippy and then you meet, you know, you hang out with her and she's like the most so spoken mellow person in the universe. So it's the most peaceful, sweet person. Be careful out there. Don't be tricked, friends. There are a lot of people who have lightning in their fists that are the sweetest people out there. You would never guess it. Very quickly, you made a huge shift to a new podcast network. Yeah. You want to talk about it real quick? Sure. Let's do that. But it's so I did the problem is I have two podcasts, Drunken Taoist and History on Fire. Drunken Taoist is a chatty, happy podcast. I don't really need to prepare. I can just put the mic on, call somebody I like, like Mr. Duncan Trussell. We start jamming. It's great. It's awesome. If people donate, it's sweet. If it works financially, it's sweet. But if it's not, it's not taking crazy energy from me. So it's cool. Right. History on Fire is a monstrous time investment because just to be able to tell a story where you really know your story well, you have to read multiple books, do the research, do so behind every episode, you know, a two hour episode will have probably anywhere between 100 to 200 hours of work behind it. So that's not the thing that I can do as a kind of fun hobby where in my free time because there is no free time left if I have to do that. It's like writing a book. It's like writing a book every month. And then doing an audio. Exactly. And that is like next month, you do it again and that again. And then so realistically got to a point where it's like, okay, I either need to cut down significantly on the number of episodes I released. And you know, I still treat teaching as my prime profession. And this is a hobby that I do in my spare time so I can only do a two, three, four episodes a year. Or if I want to keep up the pace that I've kept so far, which is 15 episodes a year, I can, you know, the three model of podcasting wasn't quite doing it for something that required a time investment, you know, if everybody will listen once a year donated $5, I'd be swimming in gold, I would have no problem. Right. But the reality is that, you know, there's so most people who listen to podcasts do not exactly support, you know, maybe I don't know what your experience is. Mine has been maybe 1% at most something like that. I mean, there's a statistic out there for what that is. Yeah, it's really fucking low. So the problem is, as much as the free model is pretty in theory for something that required that much energy like is there on fire just couldn't do it anymore. So I got an offer from Luminary were kind of creating this, you know, they have their app for the free stuff, but then they do premium content. Yeah. And so they have like 30 or 40 podcasts that, you know, what I ask for mine is I still want to put at least two episodes a year for free out there. So I'm not just saying, fuck you guys, I disappear, I'll give you what I can give you if I, if I don't need to rely on money. But then for the other stuff is just exclusive to Luminary. Wait, it's you, it's Conan O'Brien, isn't it? Yeah, they've got like Russell Brand, Trevor Noah, Trevor Noah. So it's like, you know, I when I heard about it, I had a reaction that was kind of probably like what you're getting online for some people, which is like, but then when I thought about it a little bit, I realized this is a great experiment. And if it like, what is it? It's $9 a month or so? I think $8 a month. If it if like, you know, I don't know why everybody uses the fucking coffee metric for this shit. But if for two lattes a month, you like have access to like some kind of like, you know, amazing content, that's the main thing. I know if your show, I don't know what these other people are going to do. Of course, I know your show is incredible. Thank you. And it's worth $8 a month by itself. But I think people need to lighten up a little bit on this because it's like, come on, this is no different from the shift from commercial television to Kate to like Hulu or Netflix or whatever. It's like, you know, like, give him a break. You're fucking busting your ass to research history. And it's like, it's either that or you know, commercials, but And even that and that's I think is the problem that people bitch about these. And I understand they're like, that's not out of the culture of podcasting. I get it. When I have commercials, you're bitching because I have too many ads. When I ask, okay, can you support them? Add three on Patreon? Oh, Patreon is an evil corporation squashing free speech. I'm never gonna use Patreon. Okay, about PayPal. I don't want to deal with it. It's like, come and just what the fuck do you want me to do? You know, it's like, also, it's not even them. It's like nine people. That's the main thing. It's like, if you go and look at like the people who are bitching about Game of Thrones or the people are bitching about like this amazing video game I've been playing called End of Days or, you know, the zombie game, I can't fucking great game. Right. Days gone. That's what it's called. Okay. It's great. I love it. I'm now playing it every night. I have a sentimental attachment to my cheesy character. Right. I was so excited about I went look at the reviews. It's like people are nit picking, of course, this beautiful thing that if you travel back to the 70s and showed it to somebody, it will probably put them in a mental asylum. Right. They would they wouldn't be able to handle it there. They would have a fucking meltdown. So we have to ignore those people, because they're just unhappy. And and I think most other people are happy, just have access to your brain. So congratulations on that shift preliminary. And I thank you. Many will subscribe to listen to your wonderful podcast, History on Fire. Yeah, it's a trippy thing. I mean, what you're saying is you're 100% right, you need to focus on creating shit, not what because everybody's gonna have an opinion and not everybody's gonna like you and I get it. I realize that one of my weaknesses is for whatever reason, I maybe it's a narcissistic thing. I don't know. I, I feel horrible if I have the feeling that I'm letting somebody down. Me too. So if somebody's telling me, oh, I was listening, I loved it. And now, fuck you, you betrayed me because I feel like, no, let's talk about it. And you know, of course, it doesn't work that way. You know, it's not the but it really, it shouldn't bug me. It does bug me. Yeah. And I'm just like, fuck man. Yeah, we have to let go of that. Yeah, it's the bear trap. It is one of the many spikes on the weird bear trap that has us change the time space continuum and is keeping us out of the DMT universe where they already have fucking spaceships. God bless you, Danieli. Thank you so much. Until next time, my friend. Thank you for coming out here. That was fun. That's cool, man.

412^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - 498: Mike Rothschild Transcript and Discussion^2022-03-19^Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. This is the Dugga Trussell family on The Trussell. If you want to know the root of all conspiracies, you can find it in the cobalistic tree. It shows what happens when infinity expresses itself as a you. You and me, you and me, you and me. We might not share a family tree, we might not come from the same country, but our mommy is infinity. Next thing you know, we're drawing boundaries and to defend the boundaries, we need armies and for the armies to kill, they need to believe that there's a big difference between you and me, you and me, you and me. We might not share a family tree, we might not come from the same country, but our mommy is infinity. Sometimes I play Jesus, sometimes you play Satan, sometimes you're the butcher, sometimes I'm the bacon, sometimes you're my mama, sometimes I'm your wife, and we've been doing this for trillions of lives. You and me, you and me, we might not share a family tree, we might not come from the same country, but our mommy is infinity. Maybe one day we'll turn towards the light, try being in love instead of being right. Throw a big party when they ask us to fight, they only have power if we're terrified. You and me, you and me, we might not share a family tree, we might not come from the same country, but our mommy is infinity. That song was called Sermon on the Toilet, and of course it's from the hit Broadway show Jesus Christ TikTok Star. You're listening to the Dugga Trussell Family Hour podcast. It is I, your noble servant and master and friend and baby and parasite and angel. You know if I could freeze time, I would record another song called Parasitic Angel. Not only would I record it, but because I could freeze time, I would learn how to do surgery and I would learn how to play every instrument, like the greatest musician of all time. And I would go and find Willie Nelson. I would do an ethical surgery where I would temporarily trade my vocal chords for his. I would have to do the surgery on myself, but we can freeze time, right, or I can. So that means I have an infinity to do all of this. And then you could maybe wonder, why don't you just, if you can freeze time, unfreeze Willie Nelson and be like, look, I can freeze time. Will you sing a song for my podcast? Why are you going to trade vocal chords with him? And I think it's a fair point. So I'm going to revise that. I would unfreeze Willie Nelson and I wouldn't spend any time trying to learn all the instruments. I would just be like, look, isn't it cool that I can freeze and unfreeze time? Will you sing a song called parasitic angel for me for my podcast and then I would record it and then that song would appear here and I'd have two songs in the intro for this podcast, but can't freeze time. Not yet. Would love to though. It would be so fun. A really important question to ask yourself is, would you rather freeze time or be able to travel backwards in time? Freezing time seems a little better assuming you could unfreeze other people. The whole going backwards in time, though I get it, it's kind of adventurous and exciting. I'm worrying about too many things going backwards in time. Even if another time traveler told me, look, don't worry, it's a multiverse. Therefore you can't fuck up the timeline. I would still be like, I don't know who you are. Are you really a time traveler? Why are you naked? Why did we just make love? I think I would freeze time. I think that's the way to go. Regardless, it has nothing to do with today's guest, Mike Rothschild. Yes, a Rothschild is coming on the DTFH to talk about one of my favorite things, conspiracy theories. With us here today is a conspiracy theory expert. He has written a wonderful book about QAnon and currently he's working on a book called Jewish Space Lasers. Waiting for you just around the corner is a conspiracy theory that you may never have heard of before that is one of the more insidious, sinister, insane fucking conspiracy theories that I've ever heard and it's right there in front of your very eyes and a Rothschild is going to disclose this theory to you. Also around the corner is a conversation with a really brilliant person who has been analyzing QAnon and he helped me understand the roots of Q which explain a lot of things. I don't know if you've ever heard of the Wudeku Pipeline and I don't blame you if you're just trying to forget about the whole thing, but if you experienced that strange moment of existential vertigo when you met someone who talks to trees or actually projects or drinks ayahuasca, someone who is deeply connected to the astral realm but who also was super into Trump, then you know about the Wudeku Pipeline. Not to say that because you're into spirituality you can't love things that traditionally people aren't into. It was just odd because normally my experience with people like that is they are either apolitical or hyper leftist, communist, socialist people. So it was just an odd thing that happened where people started getting sucked into the QAnon conspiracy theory and via that magnetization found themselves like storming the capital. The classic example of this being Jake Angelly, aka the QAnon shaman, also known as Yellowstone Wolf. You know the guy with the American flag painted on his face and the Viking helmet and the abs? Well this guy, as it turns out, is a decorated veteran. He received the National Defense Service Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Sea Service Deployment Ribbon, and the Navy and Marine Corps Overseas Service Ribbon. He would go to political rallies, Black Lives Matter rallies and he would try to preach the QAnon conspiracy theory and then he really got into challenging the presidential election results and you know the rest of the story, I think he got arrested. Now this is only interesting because as you can see from looking at pictures of him, this was a very spiritual dude. Here's a clip of Angelly explaining why he stormed the capital. And that's a part of shamanism. It's about creating positive vibrations in a sacred chamber. I also stop people from stealing and vandalizing that sacred space, the Senate. Okay, I actually stopped somebody from stealing muffins out of the break room. I also set a prayer in that sacred chamber because it was my intention to bring divinity and to bring God back into the Senate. Conspiracy theories aside, gang, this is why if you ever find yourself one toke over the line, getting arrested, just ask for a lawyer. Don't try to explain to the cops the reason you were robbing the bank is because you were trying to liberate dark energy and spread it into the circulatory system of society or whatever you were doing. Just be like, could I get a lawyer, please? I'm super hot. Today, Mike Rothschild will help you understand the Wudeku Pipeline and the deep new age spiritual roots of QAnon and a lot of other cool stuff. So strap in. We'll be right back after this.

And now, dear children, welcome to the DTFH author and journalist, conspiracy theory expert, Mike Rothschild. Follow him on Twitter, check out his book, The Storm is Upon Us. How QAnon became a movement, cult, and conspiracy theory of everything. But first, listen to him here. Everybody welcome Mike Rothschild. It's the DuncanTrussell video. Mike, welcome to the DTFH. It's so great to have you on the show. Yeah, it's great to be here. I have to tell you, I love conspiracy theories. And so, having followed you on Twitter for a while, I don't know how it hadn't occurred to me that I should have you on the show because not only are you an expert at QAnon conspiracy theories, but also you are a member of the family, of all the families that is like the central, the nexus point for so many conspiracy theories. And you're writing a book about it. I can't wait to read Jewish space lasers. Yeah. So, hi. Hi. Thank you for doing this. Yeah, of course. And you know, it's funny. I love conspiracy theories too. I love them as stories. I love picking apart what is real, what isn't, what is so compelling about these things that for most people, you hear that and go, yeah, no, that's insane. I don't want anything to do with that. And then there's a few people who go, oh, that's what I've been looking for my whole life. So, I've always loved conspiracy theories as stories. And the whole Rothschild thing, like I grew up in a middle class, northern Chicago suburb, like nobody would have thought, looking at the split level home that my parents owned, that we were like part of a, you know, dynasty that's gone back hundreds of years. Like people just didn't think about that. When I started writing this stuff, it never occurred to me to use some kind of pen name. It was really good because you don't ever want to have a sort of mystery about you that people want to solve, because then they try to solve it and they dig up more stuff about you. I mean, now that there's anything out there that is that interesting about me, but people dig up more stuff about you than when you just use your name and you just are who you are. So, sure. I mean, that's super smart. Yeah, because they would celebrate. They would feel so victorious if they uncovered. He's a Rothschild. Right. He's like, no. Yeah. Yeah. So it's just like one more level of annoying explanation that I don't really want to deal with. I get it. But, you know, that's interesting to me to hear that you weren't in a, like I was expecting you would say something like in your family. There's like a moment where they sit down with you and they're like, listen, you're a Rothschild. You're connected to this massive dynasty that at one point probably controlled the world, almost controlled the world. And here are the great secrets, but that didn't happen. Your parents didn't do that. You didn't, nothing like that happened. There was, there was, I mean, there was talk about my own Rothschild family and I got a book from my dad, an unpublished family genealogy that talks about where my Rothschild family came from. It's really interesting because they were from Nordsteden, which is a completely different part of Germany than Frankfurt, where Meyer Aumschel Rothschild was born. But they, they moved to the Midwest. So they had a lot of success in places like Davenport, Kansas City. They were well respected merchants. One became a really well known playwright. So it's so interesting that, that going beyond these sort of salacious, you know, world controlling stories about this family, there's a whole other family that really has done quite well for itself, but that nobody would ever write about because it's, there's nothing salacious there. It's just an American story. Right. Well, okay, great. That's, that's great to hear. That's great to hear. So, but I'm going to, just because I, we're going to dive into a lot of conspiracy theories and many people who listen to my podcast are also a conspiracy aficionados. Can I just, so, and again, I don't think you are, but some people are going to think this is just the PR branch of the Rothschild family getting in to the zeitgeist to diffuse and dispel all the QAnon stuff. So that's, that's not who you are, right? No. And the thing is, is that the Rothschilds, the actual Rothschilds don't actually talk about this stuff. When I started working on Jewish space lasers, and obviously I've got a long way to go on it, but when I started working on it, I wanted to see if I could get access to any family members to have them talk about what these theories have meant for them, you know, what's it like being linked to all of these bizarre hoaxes and tropes. They don't talk about it. They, they don't engage with it, their, their archivists don't talk about it. And one of the people who works for the Rothschild archive told me that the family doesn't talk about it because they would put themselves in the position of having to prove something is not true, which of course is basically impossible. Right. Even by talking about it, you lend it credence that, that you don't, you just don't need to talk about it. You don't need to engage with these things. You know who you are. You know what your family's done. What other people think is what other people are going to think and there's nothing you can do about that. Got it. I, I myself have been accused of more than a few conspiracy theories. I've been accused of being in the CIA, which is, and anytime you engage with that directly, which I don't, right, and try to explain, no, I'm not in the CIA. You only can sound like you're in the CIA. Right. It's, you know, my, my, uh, I'm not in the CIA T-shirt is raising a number of questions about my involvement in the CIA. Do you have one that shirt? That's so cool. I would love a shirt like that, by the way. So let's just jump in. Sure. Of all the conspiracy, you're an expert on conspiracy theories of all of them. Do you have one that, that you love the most? My favorite, Hollow Earth. I love Hollow Earth theory. So cool. Do you have something like that? You know, it's funny. I, I really enjoy these things because I like to figure out why people think they're true. And the one that I always come back to is one that I actually enjoyed sort of picking it apart because there was a lot of truth to it is the mattress store conspiracy theory. What's that? Okay. Any major metropolitan area in the U S is going to have a street or a corner where there are like five mattress stores. Yeah. Every street, every street in there's some city where, sorry, I'm going to do that again. Every city has some street where there's like five mattress stores and there's like a mattress firm and a sit and sleep and a, you know, cozy box, whatever. And for, uh, for a long time, people have been like, why are there so many mattress stores? And around 2018, I think it was on Reddit, somebody started talking about, uh, in a thread of what conspiracy theory do you 100% believe is why are there mattress stores on every corner? No one's ever in them. They're always lit up. They're always having massive sales. What is going on here? That's got to be a front for drugs or tax evasion or trafficking or something. So what's actually going on there is that these stores are, first of all, all basically owned by the same company. They're basically all owned by mattress firm. They, um, they have different store names on them because mattress firm bought all these different, uh, chains and mom and pop stores. So it gives you the illusion of choice. You know, if you don't like the deal at mattress firm, you walk across the street to sit and sleep. Well, mattress firm owns sit and sleep and the other thing is that mattresses are wildly marked up. They are overpriced by like 10 times what they cost to make. So even if you have like 50% off, you're still having 50% off of a massive markup. You only need to sell like one or two mattresses a week to keep the store open. Anything else beyond that is just profit because you don't keep the mattresses on site. You've got like three people working there, all of whom are probably making minimum wage and getting paid commissions. They say perfectly executed racket that does not require any kind of sort of outside explanation to, to, to let us know why it's there. It's just there because this company has figured out exactly how humans work and shop for the best deals and how they can chisel the most money they can out of people at a time when you actually need a product that you need to have to live, you need to have a mattress. So that's, that's always the one I go back to as there are, there are real things going on here and there is an actual conspiracy. It's just not a salacious conspiracy. It's the kind of everyday conspiracy that we've lived with for generations of a company saying how can we work together to screw the most people?

Now, this is where I think if you want to spin off and really lose your shit, you can extrapolate from something as non-salacious as this horrible mattress store conspiracy order. Just already, man, when I was younger, I went shopping for mattresses, stormed out of one store. I couldn't believe how much they wanted. Went into another and it was the same fucking store. I was just like some rat in an experiment and an awful stupid man. Same mattresses with different names. It's brilliant. You know the idea. As above so below, from looking at the way an apple falls from a tree, we can figure out the way the orbit of the moon. Similarly, just knowing, okay, look, obviously there's conspiracy theories. Here's one that's for sure. You can extrapolate from that. Well, if that's happening, how many other things that are bigger than that are happening? How many other things that are less overt? You might see mattress stores when you're driving down the street, but there's a lot of other things you don't see, like weapons manufacturers or all of those things. If we are to apply as above so below to this mattress store, don't you think it's safe to assume there's maybe a million different versions of whatever that racket is globally? Absolutely. Hidden fees, hidden taxes, companies conspiring to keep prices high on things when they could easily lower them. They just don't want to. This is the kind of everyday chicanery that people, when people go, oh, I guess you don't think any conspiracies are real. They say, well, no, tons of conspiracies are real. Look at right now. The oil companies are all conspiring to keep gas prices artificially high. It doesn't require a cabal or secret occult rituals. They just know that, hey, nobody's going to start their own gas station. You've got to go to one of these couple of places to fill up your tank. Hey, let's keep the prices high because we can. Look at cigarette companies. Look at places dumping carcinogens in water. They get away with things purely motivated by greed. It doesn't require secret meetings or rituals or aliens. It's just humans being humans who have power over other humans. Also, I think there are rituals, but they aren't like the rituals these people are imagining. There's the ritual of the boardroom. There's the ritual of putting on a suit and gathering in a room. There's secrets in the sense that you're in the eight out. You're going to have a conversation about how the fuck do we profit off of turbulence in the world? Sure. That's a ritual. It just doesn't look. There's no goat heads or whatever. Right. There are in groups and out groups. There are hierarchies. There's jargon. Yes. And this is everyday stuff. I really encourage people to think a little bit less salaciously about conspiracies and to just simply look around to see how people are using their power against other people. Right. That's pretty much it. Obviously, if you're going to use your power against other people and you don't want to lose that power, you camouflage. This is like, look at evolution. Look at the creatures that are able to camouflage versus the ones who can't. We don't know the ones who can't camouflage because they're not around anymore. They got eaten. Right. So that's the idea. It's not a cobble. It's a corporation or it's a business or it's a state propaganda machine or something like that that is camouflaging itself as one of us. That brings us to QAnon, because to me, like QAnon represents some nihilistic philosophy. The essence of the thing is nihilism. Nothing is real. And so, but QAnon has managed to somehow do what you just did, point out, yeah, there's shit going on in the world that is secret and is all over the place. And use just that alone as a destabilizing mechanism to make people feel completely like the bottom has been dropped out and then to start offering some stupid solution to this thing. So, can you just summarize real quick the roots of QAnon, the evolution of it from where it started and where it is now? Sure. And I go really, really deep into detail in the book I wrote about Q. QAnon really has its predecessors in very similarly worded scams and frauds. And this was kind of the thing that I really started to see when I really started to get concerned about QAnon. I've been following it for a couple of months. I thought it was just sort of another weird internet thing. Yeah. They come and go, you know, there's a hundred of them a month. This one to me though really reminded me of some of these long running scams and frauds and there's a line that I draw in the book and they start in, you know, the first place you think of, downstate Illinois in the early 90s. And right. Really? Yeah. So, there was a scam that went on in Mattoon, Illinois, a little working class town in downstate Illinois, run by a guy named Clyde Hood. Clyde Hood was a classic grifter, drifted from job to job, really never did anything with his life. But he reinvented himself as one of only six or seven people in the world who had access to a financial instrument called Prime European banknotes. Wow. And these were banknotes that you could buy through Clyde Hood. They cost a hundred dollars and Clyde Hood would reinvest your money in a company he formed called the Omega Trust. And the Omega Trust was available to good Christians. It would help you take the riches of the Lord's storehouse. You could buy as many Omega units as you could afford and they would roll over and they would keep rolling over and rolling over until one day they would be released by the European bankers, you know, wink, wink, and you would be a millionaire. Clyde Hood and about a dozen of his cronies got filthy rich off this. They were building mega mansions. They were driving around in hundred year old cars. They were buying people businesses. There are stories of sacks of cash that would rip when you picked them up because they were so heavy. Wow. Well, Clyde Hood got busted and his cronies all got busted. One of his acolytes was a woman named Shani Goodwin who lived in Yelm, Washington, very new age town, the home of the Ramtha movement. Okay, sure. Yeah. People have been in this world kind of know Yelm, Washington. So she took some of the sort of pie in the sky prosperity gospel stuff of Omega and fused it with another sort of financial guru conspiracy thing going around called Nassara. Now Nassara was proposed as a law that would basically wipe dead off the books. And this this guy who wrote it in a book called Draining the Swamp, which is just a great little detail. Holy shit. It's about to everybody in Congress assumed that would be passed as law and that we would have financial prosperity forever. Well, nobody in Congress touched it. But this woman, Shani Goodwin, found this guy's proposal and she took a version of that and fused it with Omega and rewrote Nassara as this kind of great unveiling of prosperity and that there was this secret war going on between good and evil. The good guys wanted Nassara released the bad guys were trying to stop it. The bad guys did 9 11 to stop Nassara from being released. And actually the message that she put up on, I think it was Usenet or Yahoo groups, literally as the second tower was coming down might have been the first 9 11 conspiracy theory. What? Yeah. So I'm sorry. A lot of information there is a lot. It's a lot. Nassara to keep Nassara from the book or what specifically are they keeping from the release? So Nassara had mutated into a whole new set of laws that we would go back to the gold standard. The president in Congress would be replaced by a Nassara president and Nassara Congress. Bill Clinton had signed it into law, but no one was allowed to talk about it because they'd be executed if they did. And then you start this start starts branching off into angels, the Galactic Federation of Light. Yeah. All this, you know, Pleiadians, all this other New Age crap. So this was on, yeah, this goes on for for well into the aughts in 2004, Shani Goodwin who'd started calling herself Dove of Oneness bought mobile billboards to drive around Washington DC demanding Nassara. Now she defrauded an old lady in San Francisco to get the money for those billboards. So this finally fizzled out probably about 2006 or 2007, right? As another scam, very much like it was coming out called the Iraqi Denar. This is another one that Q people are really big into. Trump, it was I got pulled into the Trump orbit for a while. This was basically if you buy up enough worthless Iraqi currency, either the International Monetary Fund or at the time, President Obama or the UN was going to sign a revalue that would revalue the Iraqi Denar to be on par with the dollar. And so if you had a million Iraqi denars, you would have something of millions of dollars trillions of trillions of really was it was like trillions of dollars would be created out of nothing. Now, never mind that that is not at all how money works like right that that the basics of finances are the opposite of that. People were going broke buying denars. There was a denar firm that got busted actually just a couple of years ago that had made something like $600 million off of this. So right as Trump comes into office, he's been in office about eight or nine months as the Mueller probe is really gaining steam, the denars scam is kind of fizzling out. That's when Q starts up. So there is no link between the people who started Q and the people who are running the denar scam or Nassara, but it's the same thing. It's an all knowing guru who has secret intel that they are dispensing to you because you are special and you are important and you and all the people who believe in this are going to band together and you're going to fight back. And Q, the thing that really troubled me about Q is that Q replaced the endless riches that you would have when the revalue or the Nassara packets or whatever got released, that got replaced by the good feelings that you would have when your enemies were executed in front of you. Right. Oh yeah. Yeah. I remember that started happening, the executions, the famous noose in front of the White House, the calling for Pence to be hung. This is all connected to this thing as it was getting increasingly toxic and dangerous. It's getting increasingly toxic, increasingly dangerous. The ideation is getting more and more violent. You're openly talking about, you know, should Hillary Clinton be shot or should she be hanged? Oh, maybe she should be guillotined. Right. This is not even stuff that Nassara people were talking about. This was very much like pie in the sky, all holding hands. Everything's going to be great. This was, there was no violence in those moments. Okay. But what you're talking about is known, I've heard it called the Wu to Q pipeline. So and now it all makes sense because the roots of the damn thing were Wu. They were like complete, now it makes, because you know, that's something a lot of us, I was at a party here in Asheville, North Carolina talking to a hippie on acid who was telling me, you know, the CERN particle accelerator split the timelines and you know, I love these stories. Honestly, I can be like, I don't know, maybe shit is a little weird right now. But he, but the part where it got weird is he's like, and we're on the wrong timeline because on the other timeline, Trump is still president. And I'm like, I didn't say anything, but it was the last thing you would expect coming out of the mouth of someone like on a lot of acid up in the mountains of North Carolina. It's like, wait, how now I see how it happened. Now it makes sense. It's like, now, okay, so this is thank you for that summary, it's terrifying and weird and awesome. Absolutely. Absolutely. So to me, when I'm seeing all of all the stuff that's happening and how it is literally driving people insane and how it has as you've written about it actually somehow managed to get into our government. Like it's somehow managed to get into our government. To me, my conspiracy theory about this conspiracy theory is clearly this is some kind of weaponized propaganda that is being used by someone trying to emulate some of the tactics of the CIA. The CIA has done shit like this, gone into other countries, created disturbances and disruptions to cause instability in the government there. So what are your thoughts on that? Isn't this somehow connected to either Russia or China or one of our alleged like enemies out there? Isn't this some kind of weaponized philosophy propaganda that's just designed to fuck up the United States government and make all of us sort of confused and polarized? So it's a great question and it is really the first place a lot of people go. And as it turns out, it's a lot more complicated than that surprise. So comfortable, pampered Westerners have an innate ability to convince themselves of truly bizarre things because their lives are sort of ordinary and boring and they need something else to make their lives seem more dangerous. Q really fits that perfectly. And of course, the poster, the 4chan poster who would become known as Q or QAnon was not the first anonymous truth teller on 4chan. Before Q there was FBI Anon, there was White House Insider Anon, there was a British one, MI5 Anon, there was a guy who called himself Highway Patrolman who claimed he busted a billion dollar shipment of Adrena Chrome coming across the Mexican border. There is a long tradition of this kind of shit posting, this kind of like, we're going to tell a story and lARPing, exactly, of pretending that you are more interesting than you actually are. Yeah. And Q caught on and I really believe that Q would have been just any one of these other LARPs would have posted a lot of garbage and then disappeared. And then it would have been replaced by something else. Q was a little bit different for a couple of reasons. First of all, Q's first drop, it was October 2017, was that Hillary Clinton was going to be arrested in two days and that you would know that she had been arrested because the Marines and National Guard would be called up to quell the riots that would happen when her arrest was made public. So very early on, you have the most loathed figure on the far right in Hillary Clinton who is going to get her due, who is going to get her just desserts. This isn't just sort of vague stuff of like, I know things, but I can't tell you or yes, aliens exist and they're under a bunker, but you'll never be able to know about it. Here is, this is a concrete thing that is going to happen that you have always wanted to happen. And it's going to happen in a couple of days and it's going to be fucking great. And you're going to know that it's happening because there's riots going on. At the same time as those first couple of posts were going up, there was a conspiracy theory going around the 4chan swamps that there was going to be an Antifa uprising on November 4th, 2017, and that Antifa was going to start going door to door and killing Trump supporters and rioting and destroying everything. So there is no paper trail for this because of course not, but I'm convinced that the person who made those posts really did believe that this Antifa apocalypse was going to happen and that the Antifa uprising was going to be the proof of Hillary Clinton's arrest. Now none of that happened. There was no Antifa uprising, Hillary not arrested, John Podesta not arrested, nothing happened. Very quickly though, the people who really wanted to believe that that post was real really got into it very, very quickly and very publicly. It didn't stay on 4chan very long. It went to Reddit, it went to YouTube very quickly within like days. There were decoding videos, there were long threads on Reddit, long threads on Twitter. And so the normal trajectory of these things, which is to post a bunch and then go away, you suddenly had an opportunity here and you had an opportunity for grift. So you keep the story going. The story gets a lot more vague, it gets a lot more rhetorical, the very concrete predictions get replaced by rhetorical questions and riddles, and then all of these elements that would come to be what we know as Q today started to rise up in the aftermath of those first few posts. So it really developed very organically, like you can see the sweat coming off of the person who wrote those posts going, how do I keep this going? It's not organized, there's no plan, there's no, there's no gotcha at the end, it is clearly just a bunch of plates that are spinning. And rather than take the plates off once they've spun enough, you just add more plates. So that to me is the sign that this was developed organically by a 4chan shit poster, larping as an important person, because people on 4chan are used to that. And they spoke the language, especially spoke the language of American evangelical conservatism. They knew what they were talking about, they knew how to reach people. Only a really experienced 4chan poster could do that. Okay, great. All right, so, all right, fine. That's just some larping troll who like, like just wanted to have some fun. And who can't understand that? You know what? If I was a teen or 20 year old and the internet existed, I cannot totally get having some fun with that. And it seems like 4chan has gotten a little more astute or something about these things. Like I said, whenever I'm on there, you can see them get instantaneously shot down and every, there's always attempts at producing some bullshit like that. Yeah, yeah, but don't you think that even though the original poster was whatever that some of this stuff is being exploited as some psyops experiment that some of it just feels so specifically weird and specifically sticky that my completely with nothing to base this on other than my intuition and I just to so you know how horrible my intuition is like I thought a meteor was gonna hit during the pandemic at one point when I was really losing my shit. Hey, you know, what would have been a sweet release, you know, right exactly. But don't you get the feeling that like some of the stuff some of this stuff is being intentionally exploited by like, I don't know, Russian troll farms, state propaganda machines. Or even, in other words, yes, cobbles are taking this now, they might be groups of hackers, they might be troll farms, they might be some PR firm trying to cash in. But don't you get the sense that whatever this QAnon instability is, is intentionally being amplified by fun groups that have real funding and are really good at this sort of shit. Yes, absolutely. And we know for a fact that really early on in Q, a bunch of Internet research agency linked Twitter accounts started tweeting about QAnon. I want to thank Lucy for supporting this episode of the DTFH. We all have a friend who's out there puffing on cigarettes. They smell like an old sailor's boot, washed up on some ashtray shore, cigarette smokes fucking gross. I hate the way it makes your hair smell like when you're making out with someone in there. They've been smoking. If you enjoy using nicotine, you should definitely check out Lucy's Products at lucy.co. That's lucy.co and use promo code Duncan at checkout. So I have to read this disclaimer warning. This product contains nicotine. Nicotine is an addictive chemical end of disclaimer. Like someone listening is like, wait, what? Remember, if you're interested in a better way to use nicotine, visit lucy.co and be sure to use my glorious promo code Duncan. Really early on in Q, a bunch of Internet research agency linked Twitter accounts started tweeting about QAnon. It happened very quickly in probably about five figures worth of tweets. What happens though is that those tweets are really insignificant compared to the reach that QAnon was getting in general. They got very little engagement. They really didn't sort of move up the food chain of disinfo. They weren't grabbed onto by bigger conspiracy gurus. They were kind of just churn there. They were sort of filler. The ones who really made a big difference were some of these early evangelists. Now they may have been pushing things that the Russians were also pushing, Chinese were also pushing, Iranian trolls were pushing, but there is also a very homegrown system of belief that these people have. These people started making videos. They went on Info Wars. Within a couple of months, a couple of these guys, these very early Q evangelists were on Info Wars saying, we found the greatest military intelligence operation of all time. Come and join us. Come help us out. All of a sudden, all these retired ex-military boomers are like, I want to take Hillary down. You absolutely have foreign amplification, but you also have a very homegrown desire to punish the people who have kept you down. That's definitely being exploited by outside groups, by outside funding, and certainly then you have bigger fish coming in who are latching onto this. You have somebody like Jerome Corsi, the birth certificate journalist who was on Info Wars all the time. You have Alex Jones. You have Michael Flynn. You have Lynn Wood coming in, on and on and on. These bigger names start latching onto QAnon because they know that there is a big population there of people who they can very easily grift and they all need money and they all have products that they're pushing. They all have massive legal bills and they go, here are some wallets that we can extract. We'll just say whatever Hockham comes to mind. We probably believe half of it anyway, but who cares? But early on QAnon had a very secretive feel. It felt like a cool club. It felt like that band that you saw playing in your garage and you heard their first demo and now they're selling out arenas and you're like, I don't like them anymore. That's exactly what Q was. It was cool. It was special. It was hard to understand. It was very jargon heavy, very backstory heavy. It repelled most people, but the people that it attracted made it into their life and that is a kind of devotion that you can't troll your way into that. That has to be part of you already. Okay. Gotcha. Okay. Cool. All right. Well, I have to tell you about something that happened to me once. It was one of the, a moment when I had a real epiphany regarding how advanced political groups are getting using the internet recently, you know, it was popped up. Tiktokers being briefed by the White House about the Russia, Ukraine situation and Russian tiktokers, you know, really like being pressured to release tiktoks about why it's right that Russia invaded Ukraine. So this is something that happened to me when Beto O'Rourke, I don't know. I liked Beto. I don't know a lot of people who thought I think he's cringe or whatever. I liked him. I thought it was cool. So whatever, I'm like, it's late at night. I retweet a Beto O'Rourke thing, whatever. So then immediately I start getting these messages from people saying the same. And now I can't remember the word because I'm dumb. The word was they were all calling Beto O'Rourke a God damn it. What's the name? It's such a cool name. A highly charismatic person who is also kind of fascist. Damn it. I need to like, like a, like a Chad. Not like it. No, it was a big word. Okay. This is what was, this is the thing. It was a word that no one uses. Okay. You know, a demigog. Demigog. Okay. Okay. Demigog. Who the fuck? I don't even know how to pronounce it. That's really specific. Demigog. Okay. So I get, I start getting messages from different people being like, you're really gonna retweet that demigog and then somebody else really you want to retweet a demigog. And then I'm looking at these accounts and one of them specifically said, you know, Duncan, I really am sorry about you losing your mom, but I can't imagine that you would retweet a demigog. And so I'm looking, this is like someone who definitely doesn't fucking listen to my podcast at all. Yeah. And, but who is clearly being paid by whatever company Ted Cruz had hired to do some kind of viral bullshit. Right. And, but what made it creepier to me was, wait, does that mean they have some weird data packet on me or on, like, if you have a certain number of followers, they assemble a little packet and then, and then, and so you could push the needle a little bit. In other words, get to the people who have followers, make it seem like there, there's a bunch of different people who are responding to something in the negative condition, then slightly move the needle. And the next thing you know, suddenly you're tweeting some insane shit thinking it's original thinking when you've been manipulated by, I guess the political equivalent of a, of a publicist or whatever, you know, in a political troll farm. So if that's happening just from people within our government who are trying to get elected, definitely it's happening with other state media and other countries who are just trying to infiltrate quote influencers. Do you know anything about this? Have you heard anything about this or how that works or have you experienced it yourself? Well, one of the interesting things that you're seeing with QAnon now is they're really moving away from the much more esoteric stuff. They're moving away from the, from the jargon and the catchphrases and the occult stuff. Now some Q believers are still totally on board with that stuff, but a lot of this is getting much more mainstream. And as it gets more mainstream, it's easier to pick it up and attach other messages to it. And if you really take it to the extreme, what you're seeing just going on right now with these bio labs conspiracies going on with Ukraine, this, this, I mean, this like U.S. bio labs, you know, exploited by Russia, you know, pushed out as propaganda, that's been going on for a long time. Like Russia has always had an obsession with germ warfare, with pinning diseases on, on the U.S. I mean, they were pushing conspiracy theories about the CIA creating AIDS at Fort Dietrich in the late eighties, you know, pushing this on vulnerable American populations who were suffering horribly from AIDS and looking for somebody to blame for it. So you are seeing this going on right now with this, this bio lab stuff. And I've tweeted a couple of times just about the fact that there are not bio labs. What you have are, you know, the Ukraine has, you know, germ warfare laboratories and other things where they're, they're destroying old Soviet stockpiles of chemical weapons and germ warfare weapons. But if you even mentioned bio labs, you get, you get all these tweets coming out, oh, you're saying they're not real. Same thing with Hunter Biden. They're just today, they're, you know, on the 15th, there was news that Russia sanctioned Hunter Biden. Okay, that's going to win them the war. But immediately I said, you know, I pointed, I tweeted about how useless this was and how the people who think this matters are the people who are obsessed with Hunter Biden's laptop. I immediately get half a dozen tweets. Oh, so you're saying it was his laptop, same language, same velocity. Yes, that there, there is absolutely coordination going on here. There's, there's not even a question in my mind about it. Okay, great. So you know what I'm talking about. Of course you do. And, and so what I usually do when I'm getting that, when I start getting the repetitive, I almost know you want to talk about it because I don't want them to evolve into like, okay, we're going to have to, they are evolving. They're like velociraptors on Jurassic Park. You can't stop it. You can't stop them. But when you start getting what you're talking about, the similar intensity, clearly whatever that it might be a I bought. So I will obviously go to their accounts out of curiosity. And then you look at their accounts, you realize, wait a minute, these people don't sleep. Somehow they've been tweeting 24 hours a day, retweeting shit 24 hours a day. So I don't know if this means it is a person in a cubicle who then another person comes and takes over that account, or if it's an AI bot, do you have any data on that? It's, it's something, it's probably something along the lines of people in cubicles who are doing this and we're controlling different accounts. Because one of the things that you have is you have these AI generated faces. And so they have these, these fake faces of people who don't exist. Their account names are constantly changing. The, the things they tweet about are constantly changing. You'll see somebody who, some account that is the face of a young woman who's tweeting about, you know, Ivermectin being great. And then three months later, it's a man tweeting about how Vladimir Zelinsky is trafficking children. Right. It's so the, as long as the account is there, it's useful for the purposes of whoever is running it. And if the, whatever they're doing is changing, just the account itself is valuable. You want the aid? Cause like if you're being lazy, you're going to look at like, all right, when did the account appear? Right. If it appeared right when the invasion of the Ukraine started to fuck you. I know what you are, but shit, it's a 15 year old account. Right. It was created in, you know, March, 2012. I'm like, huh. Yeah. Interesting. That. Okay. This is the conspiracy, the real conspiracy, which is we have swarms of these accounts that have anonymous ownership that are being used to infiltrate the brains of people. And really like causing such insane problems that it's incredible to me that we don't have regulation. Right. I'm not, I, I, I'm a, I get Elon Musk's free speech idea. I get that idea. I totally get it. I think we have to acknowledge the fact that like these, some of these people aren't people. Right. They're bots and the bots are trained and the bots are trying to warp reality on purpose and that to fund or fuel or, or, or whatever. I like, if it's your run of the mill, you know, I, I gotta tell you, one of the saddest moments was when YouTube cracked down on some of these conspiracy videos. It was one of, one of my favorite activities late at night, find the weirdest conspiracy theory, then let the algorithm suggest the next one until you get to someone like in a purple lycra in front of people talking about aliens. You can't do that anymore. It's gone. Right. Pisses me off. I can handle that shit. I'm not going to believe it. I just, it's fun when you're stoned. Right. But when we've got literal, this is what's so bizarre about it. We have actual robots among us disguising themselves as people online, obviously, not in real life and who are distorting information to the point where it is changing elections. It's getting people killed. Like imagine a town hall meeting in the 1800s and you're looking around and wondering how many of us are robots here? Right. Yeah. How many of you are real? And so to me, that's the invasion of the body snatcher shit that is happening to all of us. But we have non-human entities who are warping things in a way that is causing incredible instability. Right. And no one's doing anything about it as far as I could tell. Right. You have non-human entities controlled by who the hell knows. You also have people who just get off on causing chaos, you know, homegrown trolls. You have grifters who are pushing out the most insane stuff purely for money. And you never know where one ends, where one begins, who's doing what, who's real, who's got an agenda. Everybody's making money hand over fist with this. And the social media companies are fighting the last war. It took so long to crack down on QAnon that by the time places like Twitter and Facebook really got around to getting rid of some of these accounts, the damage was done. The minds had been warped. And now the people who ran these accounts who are very skilled trolls, very skilled grifters, they knew exactly how to create a new band evasion account. You would see some of these accounts have been banned dozens of times. This guy who, he was going by, I think, like clandestine war on Twitter, who made the biolab thing take off. This was a guy who goes by Wyatt, who has created dozens of Twitter accounts. He's a huge QAnon promoter. It is unconscionable that Twitter would have let this guy sneak back on again, build a following and push out this conspiracy theory that happened to catch on, that happened to be believable enough for enough people to run with. And now it's on Fox News, Tucker Carlson's talking about it, China is talking about it. This is a failure of the imagination of the people who run these companies to not look at this and say, how is this going to be misused? How is our service going to be weaponized? How can we stop it before this happens? And this is not censorship. This certainly is not a violation of anybody's First Amendment rights. This is about a service protecting the vulnerable people who are on it. And the fact that they don't seem to have the impetus to do it is very troubling to me. Well, I mean, this is the AI apocalypse. This is the like human beings are hackable. We all know that, neuro-linguistic programming. And God knows what else. And if you have millions of dollars, some countries are just pouring so much money into their into AI as a, you know, to use it for info warfare. It's just terrible. It's terrifying because I don't just the times I realize, oh my God, it got in me. Like I realized like, oh, fuck, there's a little meme swimming around in my consciousness where I haven't spent enough time thinking about this is bullshit. Also, you know, this is I want to jump into the book you're working on now, Jewish space lasers. One of the things over the years as I have followed many conspiracy theories. One of the things I realized is there is a slippery slope. Like you go to from flat earth to hollow earth to whatever the fuck it is. It's just a matter of time before the person who is subscribing to this stuff, and it doesn't happen all the time, becomes an anti-Semite. And this is something I'm curious about. Do you, is this, I wonder, is it like, okay, well, if you believe the earth is flat, then your ability to be rational is probably compromised to some degree, meaning you're an easy recruit. I can recruit you. Yeah. Also, if you believe the earth is flat or one of my other favorite conspiracy theories, which is mud flood that history as we know it is completely Tataria. Yeah. Tataria. I love Tataria. Oh, it's so cool. But Tataria means, guess what it means, Holocaust didn't happen or that stuff is bullshit. So if you like deny the shape of the earth, if you deny history, then just kind of accidentally. Right. Yeah, there wasn't really a Holocaust. Right. And if there wasn't really a Holocaust, well, then who's saying there's a Holocaust? Right. Who's promoting that idea? Well. I think you know who's promoting the idea. Right. The same people who want you to think the earth is round. Right. It's the fucking Rothschilds, man. It's you. Yep. So have you, are you covering that in your book? Yes. Yeah. Or is it like white supremacist groups praying on people who have started investigating some of these like conspiracy theories, or is it just, is it just a natural byproduct where you just accidentally will suddenly become someone who thinks that the Jews are running the world and are intentionally trying to, what are they trying to do to, uh, destroy white. People. Sure. So there is a, there's a susceptibility in, in conspiracy theories, where if you believe one, you are almost certainly going to believe more than one. They really are like pringies. You're not going to have just one conspiracy. You're not going to say, well, the Corsican mafia working with the Secret Service and the Bilderbergers assassinated JFK, but I believe everything else the media tells me. If you believe one, you're going to believe more than one, and that's, that's where the algorithms come in. And that's where that slippery slope of radicalization comes from. Where early days of the pandemic, everything, everything's going to hell. Everything's changing. Everybody's suddenly inside. You've got this virus and nobody knows what to do about it. Nobody knows what's going on. You personally think, well, you know, I've never really trusted that 5G technology. I don't, I don't like that. One of those towers went up near me. I started getting headaches. My neighbors started getting stomach aches, whatever, whatever it is. I'm going to go online. I'm going to see if there's a connection there between this 5G thing and the pandemic, because I don't have anything else to do. I'm in my house. I'm alone. I'm bored. I maybe have gotten laid off. My social life is gone. I can't do anything. I can't see anyone. I've got nothing else to do, but go down rabbit holes. I'm going to go down this rabbit hole. I'm going to join this Facebook group. Oh, it's about if we don't trust 5G, well, you're in your 5G, your anti 5G Facebook group a couple of days, then the algorithm recommends this, um, anti Bill Gates Facebook group or people are talking about, you know, that Soros, he's behind these, these towers and you know, we've heard some things about him that maybe he was actually a Nazi, you go, Oh, I've heard some things about him. I don't know about that guy. You join your anti Soros Facebook group, then it links you to the anti vaccine Facebook group. Then it links you to the great awakening Facebook group. And suddenly you have gone from a progressive anti Trump yoga mom who, you know, just wants what's best for her kids to the Rothschild's own all the central banks. And it happens without any intention. You may, you may have never had that thought cross your mind. But once you feel like the scales have fallen off your eyes about one thing, you want more, you want more secrets, more truth, more, more Pringles because they're salty and they're delicious and you don't want just one. You want all of them. And then you have, you have radicalized yourself. No one did it to you other than an, an algorithm programmer who maybe didn't have the imagination to see how this would be weaponized. And that's how it happens. And then it happens over and over and over. Wow. Yep. Now. Okay. I guess it'd be fun to talk about because in contemplating these things and specifically secret societies, you know, hidden groups, shadowy groups, controlling governments, don't you think based on like how the world reacts to certain people, generally like intelligent people that they're kind of makes sense that groups of smart people would secretly gathered together, not out for some nefarious purpose, but just out of the realization that if we, if too many people understand what we're trying to work out philosophically here, they kill us. They beat us up. Yeah. They, you know, so when I'm thinking, I've never really met anyone that I'm aware of that's in an actual secret society. I've met Freemasons, obviously I've met, you know, people into the occult or whatever. And if I did meet someone who's in a secret society, well, they did a great job because they sure as fuck didn't tell me what you shouldn't do. Yeah. I'm yappy. I'm glad. I don't want to know by the way, but, but, but I can't, I'm thinking about it like, like, there's times my wife and I need to have conversations away from the kids. You know what I mean? There's stuff we're working out that the kids aren't going to understand or and similarly there are scared violent people in this world who burn witches. They burn fucking witches. They drag women out of their house, just set them on fire for no reason at all. Maybe a cow nearby. It's milk went bad. So the story of, of Jesus, look what happened to him. He was yappy sermon on the Mount. Fuck you. Nailed to the fucking cross. So from all of these like historic events where people with alternate ideas about reality that don't match Protestant fundamentalist conceptualizations of things, gay people. Don't you kind of see why secret societies would form and why they probably do exist right now? Sure. And, and human beings have an innate need to belong. We want to be around people who are like us. We want to be around people who have the same upbringings we do the same values we do. And it's natural for those people to get together and then to start to exclude people who are not part of that group. And that they're you're very sort of your most vanilla versions of that are people like the Freemasons, like the, you know, Rotary Club, whatever. It's people who have the same values. You have maybe some rituals, some jargon, you're a little bit secretive. And the only reason you do it is because you want to feel like you are connected to other people. You want to have that community and you want to feel safe. You want to feel like you can say whatever you want. Like you can, you can gossip about whoever you like. We're all, we all, you know, we all love Trump here or whatever it is. You know, and I know Freemasons. I know like high ranking Freemasons, just like people I know in my life. And they're like, it's really boring. We just, we sit around and we eat barbecue and we talk about our grandkids. I mean, it's like the most banal stuff you could possibly imagine, but when you don't know what's going on in a group, and especially when that group is made of more powerful people where you have something like the Bilderberg group or Bohemian or Davos or, or whatever these things are, powerful, wealthy people who do not want you to know what they are talking about, our minds have evolved to assume that it is dangerous for the same reason that we see a gust of wind in a tree and our mind goes, it might be a hawk. You better run. Well, 99% of the time it's not going to be a hawk. One percent of the time it's going to be a hawk and it's going to gouge your eyes out. And then you can't pass on your genetics to the next generation. So our, we have evolved to see danger in chaos and we've evolved to seek patterns. And the, the, the need to see secret societies and gatherings of people who maybe do not want their doings known by the public, that is an evolution of that seeing danger everywhere we go. And our joining these societies are wanting to be parts of groups like that is an offshoot of our wanting to belong and wanting to feel like we're part of something bigger than we are. That's exactly why QAnon succeeds so well, because it gives you that sense of being part of something bigger than you and more important than your little life. You are a digital soldier. You're fighting for Trump. You're fighting for children. You're fighting to rid the world of a 6,000 year old death cult. I mean, never mind that none of that stuff is real. Donald Trump doesn't give a damn about you. The people who are hurting children are doing it in plain sight. You have your role to play and you'll be damned if anyone stops you from doing that. Wow. Yeah, that's the part that's the most vile aspect of it. These motherfuckers, man. It's like, you know, we all want children to be okay. I think it's a universal that we all want children to be okay. So what do you do? You accuse these people. And again, isn't this just that I read an entire article. Maybe you wrote it. I'm not sure that that the adrenochrome conspiracy theory is just an evolution of Nazi anti-Semitic propaganda that yes, what's it called? The blood libel. Yes. And so they just upgraded it to adrenochrome, but it's the same idea. It's the same thing. It's the the weird outsiders with their long beards and their big hats and their foreign language that we don't understand and they don't worship Jesus. Well, they're probably doing something bad. Well, what's the worst thing you can do? Something bad to children. Oh, and they have weird rituals. So the children are involved in those weird rituals. Then a child disappears and you go, oh, they use they're using his blood in there to bake their matzah for their weird ritual. And then it that that sticks for a thousand years. That sticks in our culture. Yeah, it's so fucked up. And yeah, that's the OK. So yeah, that to me is where this that's where, you know, my joy of conspiracy theories will never end. I will always enjoy going late at night, looking up Tartar, looking at the mud flood, fantasizing about how cool that would fucking be and or believing that there could be like civilizations inside the core of the earth. I love listening to old coast to coast AM episodes. You know, yeah, it's it's great. It's great. But fuck these people who took something that was so fun and just something cool and just fun and it wasn't going to make you like go nuts or put Viking horns on and run into the run into the government and like people for ruining that. It's just such to me. It's such a dismaying thing because now if I do profess the love for conspiracy theories, then I get equated as being a member of these Q or these fucking assholes, which I'm not violent, crazy, anti-Semitic racist who wants to kill Hillary Clinton that and that is to me such a it's just garbage and you ever did that. I don't know. I have horrible feelings towards that. Don't you remember when it was cool to know about conspiracy? Sure. It was like I would listen to coast to coast AM when I was in college and it was talking about like UFOs and the face on bars and cattle mutilations and crop circles and life after death. I'm like, this isn't stuff anybody I knew talked about. I didn't have this stuff growing up as a kid. This is really cool. This is really out there. I enjoy this. I enjoy hearing about this. I enjoy debating whether, hey, maybe this is true. Maybe this isn't true. It's not hurting anybody. Nobody who believed that the moon landing was faked got a gun and shot somebody. That's just not what it was and now it is so wrapped up in mainstream culture. It's so pervasive. It's so dark. It's so violent. It's so it's so baked into this kind of secret war between good and evil that you can't just sort of idly believe. Yeah, it wasn't Lee Harvey Oswald, but I don't know who it was. You know, we'll probably never know that that level of sort of casual belief is like almost not even possible anymore with conspiracy theories. Right. That casual belief was so fun. A light casual belief. Maybe there's a face on Mars. There's bees on Mars. Sure. Okay. So here's my last question for you and it's a little esoteric. Forgive me, please. We saw what happened with QAnon. It whether or not you agree with it, it was effective. It caused some bizarre organization to happen. It changed the structure of our government, people who associate themselves with QAnon somehow got. I mean, Trump was throwing out QAnon bullshit. We saw it all. The my fucking somehow the my pillow guy got wrapped. To me, that's the that's the part that really makes my head spin is how did this son of a bitch manage to work his way into like this period of American history with such. What happened to the best and the brightest, you know, we got the my pillow guy. We got the overstock.com guy. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Coalition of nutcases who should never be near the White House, even for a tour who are advising the president of the United States on how to overturn an election. The Mike fucking Linda, remember when he did the press conference with Trump, I remember watching that and just like, what is happening to the world? Okay. So we know now that whatever that was, if you want to call it a successful LARP or whatever, it's powerful and it worked. Do you ever think about the potential for creating like the polar opposite of Q a similar like secretive conspiracy theory laden thing that has as its end goal, not the execution for arrest of people, but something more like pleasant or something more, you know, a unified planet or a, you know, like everyone hates the word. I understand why people hate the term globalism, but from a sci-fi perspective, right? You know, globalism is what you would need if we're going to like get our asses off the planet, fix the planet, like travel through space. It's not going to happen as long as like dictators are blowing, potentially going to use nuclear weapons to destroy. We have, we are going to have to figure out a way to like harmonize the entire planet, not in a satanic way. So we can harvest adrenochrome, but so that we can all work together to figure out a way to do fusion reactors or, you know, what all the cool things that we can do if we weren't blowing each other up. Do you ever entertain that notion of like, shit, there might be a way to look at what worked with Q and use it for the good. You know, the problem with, I mean, I wish that was possible. I think the problem with something like that is that anytime you're starting to get people together under a shared philosophy, the potential for abuse there is so great and the, the potential to scam people, the potential to radicalize people and, and it all, and it almost always trends back to something that someone else doesn't want you to know about. If you're trying to create the united earth so that we can get off the planet and, and you know, finally, you know, take our place in the stars, there's always going to be somebody who doesn't want you to do it. And the only way that that united earth would happen is if everybody wanted to do it. So there, you have to create an enemy. And so often that enemy is going to be an out group, is going to be a marginalized right, right, going to be minorities, Jews, gay people, whatever it is, whoever, whoever doesn't want you to do that is going to have to be the enemy. And unfortunately, it really is human nature to take any kind of unity or power and turn it against somebody else. You know, I really, I really thought that in the very, very early days of the pandemic, like, like maybe like the first two days, I thought maybe this could be the thing where we just put aside the bullshit and we all come together and we all sort of recognize that we all have a duty to do to make this virus go away and we just stay inside, we just mask up, we just take care of each other, like, like just give a damn about somebody else other than yourself. And then we saw what happened. I mean, we are, we are more disunited. We are more ensconced in conspiracy silos and unhinged hatred than, than ever. And people go like, well, would humanity unite if there were an alien invasion on the way? And I'd say, well, a third of the people would grab their guns and see it as the shit finally hitting the fan. A third of the people would start selling products. And then a third of the people would, would say it's, it's not, it's not actually happening. The fucking MyPillow guy would show up. The MyPillow guy would be like, those aren't real. What that's, those are liberal. That's a liberal projection. Use promo code aliens for 25% of my new massively overpriced down comfort. You know, I actually have thought about like, look, I had this like, I mean, I let my mind spin out, but I was like, fuck, what if we start looking back in history and in every period of turbulence, there's like a MyPillow guy that shows up. What if he's like one of the signs? He just appears out of nowhere. Is that, is that Satan? Is Satan just a pillow monger that shows up when the world's fucked up? Just, just a guy with a big mustache who thinks the election was stolen. Just, man, I hope Satan can do better than that. See, I, you know that, yeah, that's, it's another podcast, but yeah, that would be a really disappointing thing just to find out. Actually, it's not that smart. He'll lame Satan. Yeah. We have a lame Satan. Um, uh, Mike, thank you for your time today. I know that you're still working on Jewish space, uh, lasers, but your book, the storm is upon us. It's available now. Yep. Um, and also the world's worst conspiracy theories. Is there anything else we can, I can plug for you that you'd like to know about? You can just find me on, find me on Twitter, uh, at Rothschild MD, uh, another conspiracy theory, uh, I'm not a doctor. Those are just my initials. I did not create a particularly creative Twitter handle. Um, yeah, that's, that's where I do my stuff. And I, um, no, this has been, this has been terrific. I mean, I love talking to people who, who get this stuff, who, who, who, who's shit, well, thank you, yeah, thanks. I appreciate, I appreciate your time and, uh, keep up the good work. And everyone, please follow him on Twitter. He's got one of the best tweet, tweet, I don't know what to do, Twitter, tweets, Twitter accounts. He's a great Twitter person. I think we'd have a word for that. Definitely. Also, if you're someone like me and you spin out of control, sometimes mentally with some of these conspiracy theories, he's like a palette cleanser or something. It's like a way to reconnect to the planet. Like a sorbet, a sorbet, but a brilliant sorbet and one that we need. Thanks. And if you ever do find out a real conspiracy theory or secret society, will you let me know, please? I absolutely will. You will be my first call. Great. Beautiful. Mike. Thank you so much. Absolutely. Yeah. That was Mike Rothschild, everybody. You can find his book, the storm is upon us anywhere in every version. Look for his new book, Jewish space lasers and foam on Twitter. He's got a great Twitter feed. Also a deep thank you to our wonderful sponsors. And as always, thank you so much for continuing to listen to the DTFH. I'll see you next week. Until then.

Dirty Angel. Out. Now. New album and tour date coming this summer. This, not the end of us gets five, four, three, three, no. One, two, three, four, five. Duncan Trussell Family Hour. Greetings, friends. It is I, D. Trussell, and this is the last. Duncan Trussell Family Hour. Of 2020 and boy, do we have some awesome announcements to make regarding what the DTFH is going to be like in 2021. Number one, the first change is that we're going to have more segments. For example, let's cut to the what we're going to do in 2021 segment. Did you hear that? That's what's in the business is known as a schmalzer. It's the sound that breaks up one segment from the next. Get used to these sounds because the DTFH is no longer going to be a disorganized, chaotic mess of rambles and divergent thoughts. We have gotten organized and from this point forward, we are going to be doing segments and you'll know that we've had entered into a new segment. Sorry, I've got a script in front of me here and there was a typo it said had. So you're fired, Lisa. The way that you're going to know that we've entered into a new segment is you're going to hear a stinger. So to complete this segment, you can get excited. Why? Who wrote this? This is shit. To complete this segment, we just want to say expect new segments in 2021. And we're back from the announcement of segments segment and now we're going to jump in to a brand new segment for 2021. It's facts about Tucker Carlson. Did you know that Tucker Carlson went to over 50 live, grateful dead shows and applied to get into the CIA, but was rejected. That's the end of our facts about Tucker Carlson segment. And now we're going to jump into a new segment called what I've been thinking lately. Welcome to the what I've been thinking lately segment. My name is Duncan Trussell. Just turn the fucking teleprompter off. Kathy, your canned. I don't need to reintroduce myself twice. I'm saying all of you big bucks. Every minute of production is costing me $15,000. And I expect. Why are you even writing putting this on the fucking teleprompter? I don't want to fire any of you. Just please turn the teleprompter off. Don't I don't want to read these things. You're making me seem like an asshole. Did that sound good? Okay, cool. Keep it going. The idea that I can't get out of my head is comes from the notion that maybe consciousness isn't embodied in the physical form. That maybe consciousness is a kind of state of energy in the universe and that our bodies act as antenna through which that consciousness flows. I used to think that for that consciousness to manifest, it needed a complex nervous system like humans or advanced primates. But what if it doesn't require an advanced nervous system at all? It's just the nervous system allows it to express itself in complex ways in the world, but that everything from Albert Einstein to a river stone is aware of itself to some degree. Now that might not sound like a creepy thought, but the thing that I can't get out of my mind that's shaking me to my inner core that's making the fleer, the fleer. This is a typo game. Fear, not fleer. The fear clitoris of my soul spray wet fear up into my brain can. Love that. Very good writing, Larry. I've got a few, I have a writing staff now and I'm right now feeling real, a lot of fondness for them. Don't put that on the teleprompter. I'll compliment you when it's time to compliment you. I don't need you to fucking put that up on the screen. You hear me, Larry? Good. Okay, that was good. I love that. It makes me seem like I've got a little bit of an edge. That's great. That's not good. Okay. The thing that's really shivering my timbers is the idea that maybe consciousness just possesses whatever form there is. Meaning that images and movies and paintings and YouTube videos are more than just an assemblage of ones and zeros being converted by a computer into something we can hear and see but are kind of like prisms within which reality has been captured and every time someone touches something, say there's a pruder film of Kennedy being assassinated, that moment actually happens again in time. Meaning that Kennedy has to experience for as long as there's video of him being assassinated, his assassination over and over and over again. That does end this segment. Tucker facts. Damn it. Come on, guys. Get your shit together. I paid an entire fucking symphony to make my stingers and my stings and I want the right stinger at the end of a segment. Perfect. Good job, Fernando. And we're back. Hope you enjoyed that segment. One of the great things about having segments is that we're going to jump into the great things about having segments. Segment now. One of the great things about having segments is that if you feel like you don't like a particular segment, then you can use the breaks in the conversation, the melodic breaks in the conversation. Why is this in Sanskrit now? I can barely read it. Who decided to write this in Sanskrit? Sorry, gang. My teleprompter just flipped over to Sanskrit, which I can read, but it's more difficult for me. English, please. We'll just start the whole segment over. One of the great things about segments is that for you, the listener, it gives you a method that you can use to skip through the podcast. So if you wanted to, say, skip over a segment, all you have to do is scroll through until you hear the musical sound indicating a new segment has started like that. This is not a new segment, but if you heard that at the end of me talking about why segments are great, then you would know we're on to a new segment and we are done with this segment. And we're back. Segmentation is a really interesting thing. You have to ask yourself, is segmentation causing more suffering in the world than non-segmentation? Is the human... You know what? Let's just jump into philosophical moment. This is terrible. What's on the top? Philosophical moment sucks. Let's call this segment... Hmm. Let's call this segment thoughts of a champion. You know what? I've been thinking this whole segment idea for the podcast is maybe actually a really bad idea and it's causing more confusion than it's like giving people a sense of cohesiveness. Nope. That's not how we would end this segment. Tuck her back. All right. We're done with thoughts of the champion segment and we're back. The other problem with segments now that I think about it, let's do another one. We'll call this problem with segments. Segment. The problem with segments is that it overlooks something and maybe it has to, which is that there's actually a segment within segments in the sense that the place where I stopped talking and a melody plays to indicate we're leaving a segment or going into a segment is actually a kind of overlooked segment, which means that there's always going to be a general sense of confusion from the people listening because some part of us knows that we actually skipped a segment to get into the new segment, which is the segment between segments. I think we should explore that in the new segment between segment segment. We're in the segment between segment segment. I've decided to do an audio analysis of the space between segments and we're going to jump into that right after this. A tremendous thank you to Fight Camp for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH.

What you're hearing is a sample taken from the connecting point between the last segment and this segment. This sounds pretty normal, maybe not even interesting at all, but what happens if we slow it down so that we can actually zoom in, so to speak, on the space between segments, that place between the end of the chime and the beginning of the introduction of the new segment. Let's take a look. What you're listening to would be very similar to an astronomer pressing down the accelerator on his telescope to zoom in deeper into the universe, except for doing it with audio. Every single iteration of the audio, we're zooming in a little bit more to that space between the chimes in the beginning of the next segment, also known as the secret segment or the segment of the divine. We're zooming in now into almost like the atomic level, that space in between. Now what you're hearing is the true sound of the segment between segments. This is the secret segment. But unlike other podcasts that don't have any guts, I decided to zoom in even further and listen to the segment between the segment between the segments. And to my surprise, deep down there in that space between sound, between the space between sound, there was this music. And your soul is calling the date. The space between your date and your junk is known as the date of date. Another space between the date of date and the date. And that space is called the date of date. The date is not the date, it is what it ain't, it can't what you can't, it's too small to paint. You're gonna find it on your phone, you take this fucking coin, you wish it what you want, but you ain't what you ain't. You can wish or you wanna, but you never gonna find this little place that barely takes up any space, cause it is what it is and ain't what it ain't. It's not the more than the tinnest of the tinnest. Tinnest of the tinnest, tinnest of the tinnest. It is what it ain't, the tinnest of the tinnest. The tinnest of the tinnest. That was Tinnest of the Tinnest by Mood Lake featuring Johnny Pemberton, who I'm pleased to announce I'll be making a new podcast with called The Leather Rose. We've already got a few episodes in the can and more are on the way. In the meantime, you should most certainly subscribe to Pemberton's Twitch channel. It's amazing.

Music Welcome upon you That you are with us Shake hands, don't be too blue Welcome to you It's the Dunkin Trustful Fan Club Jason, welcome back to the DTFH. It has been too long and I am so lucky that you're giving me any amount of your time to broadcast with me after this adventure You're kidding I'm not kidding You've been on a wild adventure I'm a little ahead of you in that adventure in the sense that I got out of LA some time ago but you just got out so congratulations Thank you Yeah, so I did just leave LA for Austin, a very popular choice right now for many people Yeah, I'm feeling pretty emotionally raw and discombobulated and disoriented So I think that I'm going to set an intention coming to this podcast where I'm just going to try and be open-hearted and not have some agenda or something to say and just be honest because it would be so easy to just go into ranting about ranting out in Gavin Newsom or trying to really push I do think that people should understand how bad LA truly is but I don't want to turn into just starting ranting about how shitty things are So I'm just going to try and come to this be honest from where I am I literally just left California I left my family, I left all my friends I left my entire social support network to go somewhere where I basically don't know anybody without a few acquaintances So, you know, I have no I've leapt into the it's not a huge deal because I'm still in the same country but I really have I do feel like a refugee from communism here so it's a pretty crazy and perhaps vulnerable place to be in Well, you know, Aaron and I were watching a show called No Go Zone I don't know, it's on Amazon or something but people just go to like slums in the very, like the most dangerous places all over the world and they were in some South African slum where it was run by drug dealers and our reaction looking at the slum was that is like way cleaner than LA way cleaner than Sherman Oaks like this is like a slum the name of the slum is I think it's called the ghost yard or the graveyard or the ghost town because so many, like, you know like the police officer was saying, yeah, it's like six or seven people that died or shot or murdered there a day people just openly smoking meth but you look at the streets and they are just clean no trash anywhere and we kept saying like are you fucking kidding me like this is insane that that's where we came from is like talking yes oh, sorry okay, we got a zoom freeze that's gonna happen you know what, that might happen just ignore the zoom freeze if you're recording on your end and I'm recording on my end and you're recording in a quick time it will not affect us okay, great, so I'll just pick it up from there so, yeah, I mean, this is the thing I mean, leaving LA one of the things I've been telling people is like Fox News at their most extreme you know, they're most exaggerated they're most insane like peak Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson you know, who are just like because the Republicans love to like pick on California but it's like even they at their most insane could not come close to how bad it actually is in LA because it's truly worse than anyone could have imagined and I have noticed we were talking about this before I have noticed that talking to people who haven't lived there even people who live in like San Diego or something like that, they have no clue it's like, I'll say to them tell them how bad it is and they think that I'm exaggerating or they dismiss it, it's like that feeling of not being believed you know, or they look at you like oh, like what are you like watching some Fox News, you know, and I mean it's like no, it truly is that bad and to your point about the slums, I mean I've traveled a lot of places and when I was you know, when I was really when I was a young guy, like right out of college I went to India and I saw a level of poverty that was so shocking that it basically shattered my view of what I thought poverty was in America, I saw people you know, with missing eyes legs, faces lepers on the street, children dying on the street and I came back to the US and even in LA looking around, it was like what are people complaining about obviously there's poverty here and it's terrible in a lot of places, but in India you see people just with their limbs rotting off or beggars harming, you know, beggar armies where children are intentionally harmed so they bring more money in yeah, it's shocking and unbelievable and I came back to America and it was very, very hard I remember coming back and it was 2004, it was like peak like shithead vice like early vice Gavin McInn is like coke head, Brooklyn shithead era like on a rooftop party in Williamsburg and just looking around at people and just like I had nothing to say to them, I'm like what, look at you you're all doing coke, it's like you have no you have no idea how bad the rest of the world is, like you horrible fucking rich kid asshole but now now it's different because LA is like that now, it's like LA is you know, LA has and presumably San Francisco you know, have dropped now to a level where it's not that far off, there's diseases in Los Angeles that you know, people will say something you know, faintly racist or overtly racist, like wow, LA is becoming like a third world country, well the reality like doctors are saying there's diseases on Skid Row and LA they don't have in the third world you know, the developing world it's dropped to black plague is on the streets it's unbelievable the thing that like, so people, the right wingers will come at me and they'll be like ruin LA and now you're gonna vote this liberal policies that ruin LA and to me I get annoyed with that because number one, like your conceptualization of liberals or whatever you think I am is some fixed political entity that doesn't shift or change opinion is the most shallow approximation of humanity I've ever heard if you ask me, the problem with LA is that they didn't go that liberal enough they landed in some stupid if you're gonna do it, you gotta go all the way, like if you're gonna do that shit, let's have uh, safe zones for people to shoot up you know what I mean, let's acknowledge what's going on here and then create a sort of I don't know, dystopian yet clean environment because I, you know, the problem clearly is rampant heroin opiate addiction and that everyone's ignoring that that's the problem and these people don't want to shoot up in a place where they're not allowed to shoot up you know, they would rather be under a bridge completely opiated then, and I know a lot of the people have, uh, are self-medicating because they have traumatic brain injury and I, of course there's a swath of the population that is there because of economic realities that are fucking horrific but what would it look like if we took all of the drug addicts and put them in a place where they could safely do drugs and, you know, that to me is like, why, why aren't they doing that to me, they're just, it's like look, all these people, many of these people are completely hooked on heroin and we are pretending that they don't, many of them want, they want that they like it, a heroin must be incredible you know, and they will tell you that this is not me imagining it, they will say I like doing heroin outside in a tent, it's nice but I guarantee if they were like, well, yeah but guess what, come to this place you can do heroin in air conditioning good heroin and get clean needles and we're gonna treat your, uh, other problems that have come from living on the street we're gonna get you medical care why isn't that happening, Jason well, I think that, well, first of all like, yeah, there's a lot of heroin use I've seen people shooting up just in broad daylight there's needles everywhere, there's, you know I've seen stuff on Instagram, people shooting up in the neck things like that, but I'm not sure that that's the main thing at play here, I think that just in my observation it is not a drug thing and it's not it's not a poverty thing either in a certain way where it would be easy to say well, uh, people have been pushed out because of rising housing costs the right cost of living I don't think that's it at all I think it's just mental, not just the primary factor is mental illness when you see people on the street they are severely mentally ill as in like, they need to be they need to be professionally medicated I've seen people shooting on the subway just like just begging people to give them money to get lithium so we're talking about severe mental illness and the fact that yes, people are self-medicating with whatever they can get on the street, but I don't think that that's the causative issue because I think that in terms of I don't think all the people on the street are using I think that I've seen some heroin use, but it's certainly at such a level that I don't think that that's the causative issue I would say that I think California in general both LA and San Francisco have been trying to do that quite a bit where they've been trying to house people in hotels or even in San Francisco from what I understand they were providing providing marijuana for free and things like this and those programs have not been very successful they're shutting a lot of them down LA is also shutting down all the homeless services from the police and things like this so I'm not sure that that would fix the problem I think that what the issue here is is just severe mental illness California has passed all of these propositions for the last few years to empty the prison population because according to them the prisons are overflowing so they're just putting people out onto the street but they don't have anywhere to go and so what I've observed is debilitating mental illness and it is heartbreaking because when people fall through the safety net like that it's like well you know you can say like well pull yourself up by your bootstraps well it's like what if you can't literally function without medication that you now can't get and so I don't think that obviously there is a huge issue in America where there's a certain level of America where it is just mean right let's put it that way like America has a if you fall if you are above there's a movie that I love that went under the radar that I recommend everyone called 99 Homes it was about the last economic crisis and Michael it's about people predatory house whippers and Michael Shannon is the bad guy in it and he he has a great speech in there where he said like America America was America was built for the winners America doesn't bail out losers America bails out winners America was built by the winners for the winners and otherwise that's it and it's true there's just a mean level to America that is not the case in places like Canada where it's just kind of like well it's free but just figure it out and boom America is such an incredible place to live but when you fall below a certain social safety it doesn't care and other places are like certainly India is like that much more so other places are not and it's like a religious thing like they created the they had to figure out a way to make sense of it I guess or there's a middle caste there's an entire like qualification religiously for certain groups of people here it's just I guess we're looking at a kind of open air psychiatric hospital that's developing in Los Angeles that is just being ignored and you know Carlin had that sinister take on it which is it's not being ignored they have there because they want the middle class to know that if they don't step in line they could end up there too it's like a warning it's a kind of alarm it's like an ever it's an implied in the same way that you know but behind every contract there's a gun that's great that that so it's like the implication of that when you're seeing it as well you know could happen to you if you don't keep doing the dance it could happen to you sure yeah I'll buy that I think that to the point the level that it's at now in LA though I would suspect that the real motivation behind it is to drive people out and then to drive down real estate prices eventually although they're going up still I think it's eventually I think that they're trying to get cheap real estate deals and whether that's the state of California like Newsom has passed a bill saying that but you know China's buying up the entire state I was in Echo Park about a year ago and I walked down Sunset Boulevard and there was a sign over Echo Park saying you know the 50th annual Echo Park Street they're financed by you know funded supported by the People's Republic of China they're crazy and so China is buying up most of the city and leaving places empty and a lot of it is from medical tourism from Chinese people China's now got the biggest middle class in the world they're ascendant and they're buying up much of not just California but also all these places people are fleeing to Idaho you know places like this there's just a lot of you know business going on behind the scenes here the permeable membrane that capitalism produces between other countries and our political system is really interesting isn't it it's like the it's the ability to these days to invade other countries via the mechanism of capitalism is so fascinating and when you realize that that is definitely what's happening and then like the obvious truth that we've all known that our politicians are being controlled by lobbyists are being controlled by corporations these corporations are not even in the United States and then at that point you have this amazing nonviolent invasion that is such a wild thing to see who would have thunk that that could happen just via capitalism just looking at the thing and just analyzing like oh yeah why don't we just instead of doing a September 11th let's just create cheaper cigarettes instead of like getting one of our soldiers to go into the street and wreak havoc let's just buy all their fucking houses just buy their houses they don't want to have anywhere to live well I'll give you my thoughts totally right and it's also at a certain level it's like can you even call it capitalism anymore or is it just power because capitalism is an illusion for the middle class it's like you're playing monopoly but if you're the bank in monopoly are you really following an ideology like no you just set the rules it's just power but I'll point this out which is that wait hold on you're saying capitalism it's something that it's a game that the middle class plays but it's some it's only the middle class not the middle class plays it too I mean if we're looking at only to a certain point though it's like I think what was it Robert Reich or somebody like that had the point that it's like real wealth is having a yacht to doctor a yacht in but the point that I'm making is people look at capitalism and they're like oh well what is capitalism it's providing services to get tickets you're getting the most points it's like well that's a game but I do think people like real power comes from a lot of things but primarily physical force and monopoly on force and also real estate and things like this so the means of production is as Karl Marx pointed out so aptly and that's capital, capital is not money capital is owning the factory or the land on which and so capitalism is an illusion it's a game for the middle class the lower class doesn't play it they're on barter and the upper class it's just power it's like William Burroughs said what is the ultimate thing controlling the world it's just control well why is control controlling the world it doesn't need a reason controls for the sake of control it's like it is these it's just the need to control the form it takes if we were in a communist country it would take a different form China is a merge of this bizarre mixture of capitalism and communism and how do you even describe it well it's just authoritarian power but I I love China I love China and the leader of China I'm just trying to do like the Fox News Nightmare like you know China is really nice yeah the whole Chinese paranoia is hilarious right now I love watching my friend Tuck he is so funny to watch him go through his various moods he's so angry all the time and what I hate him but then he always pulls me back with a UFO clip you know what I mean I'll be furious with him and just think God why don't I even watch this he's a toxic poison he's gonna get people killed and then it'll be like coming up looks like we've got more data on UFOs I'm like I love you thank you and then it's got me again it's like almost like they know there's a contingent of hate watchers you also love UFOs well yeah I mean there's probably a good overlap there I love his his style is so funny though you know it's like you know like turning your olds into trans species tranny cheetahs is not normal for you but for the democrats it's totally normal but you know that's crazy don't you you know what a great impression that's exactly him he says he's like throwaways that are not throwaways at all like he'll be like so well anyhow like anytime you're first anyone on the left who has any kind of authority you know what I mean well from doctor Raymond Williams who says that you know or he'll do a throwaway like well it looks like the left is at it again they can't operate from hell but like he literally I don't know why we watched it last night he literally was upset because Bob Iger when he was running Disney I have watched with my son he loves it called born in China and it's about pandas and tuck what tuck was making this was saying like this pro china Disney film born in born in china it's literally just pandas there's nothing in it about the nothing in it at all about chinese leaders it's just pandas that's it it's very beautiful but like when you realize this slant but listen I don't want to get lost I have a question for you if I may wait can I say there was one thing I wanted to say it's not something bad about china yeah exactly so I like this whole coronavirus thing has been totally insane for me because genesis died literally the day before coronavirus hit so it's just like fuck it's been a crazy year for everyone it's been a crazy year for me it's just been insane and like now I'm like totally in a different place in the world but just to your point about debt and money invasions and things like that I was sitting in the middle of a park in New York when I was visiting gender in the hospital and at the beginning of the year and I had this insight where I realized you know like look after World War 2 there was a bomb right the atomic after the atomic bomb was created essentially what happened is nobody could ever risk open warfare again it's just not on the table unless everyone just wants to die and but then I was thinking like well we're told this thing that oh well we've pretty much been at peace since World War 2 and yes it's like if you look at the death count of World War 2 nothing even comes close nothing in Vietnam or the Middle East or anything nothing comes close we're told it's like well we've pretty much been at peace since World War 2 and I thought about that and I thought is that really the case or have we actually been at perpetual war and it's just that it had to evolve to a form that does not involve open conflict because nobody can risk the bomb and therefore has evolved into a perpetual warfare of psychological war destruction of populations through economic and chemical means that weapons for quiet wars and I think that if you're looking at not to go on a tangent well if you look at what's happening in America now it looks very much like what the IMF and the World Bank have been doing in the rest of the world where the IMF and World Bank will go into a country send in economic hitmen you can read about this in the very famous book Confessions of an Economic Hitman where they go and they will collapse the economy in a place like Bolivia or something like that and then they'll show up and say they'll send Bono to show up and say why don't we bail you out let's give you some loans and they do it with this very humanitarian NGO style approach we're giving everyone a leg up and bringing all these freedoms and things like that but the stipulations of the loaner the country is now essentially a vassal state of the IMF and the World Bank and it is imperialism it's just done through economics which is impossible in a sense to resist very very hard and if they do resist that's when the military invasion happens but they'll collapse the country so that they can buy it just like a real estate a predatory real estate investor would for instance drive down the values in a neighborhood by sending in lots of homeless people or moving people in who are committing crimes and things like this so that's I think what's happening in America now where we're talking about China it's like the real power in the world is no longer national it hasn't been for a while it's transnational, it's corporate and clearly people are, I think that perhaps what is happening is people have moved their ships to China and that doesn't really have to do with China, it more has to do with people putting their bets on where they think the center of economic power and stability will be going long term and America and I think there's a fire sale on America, the American middle class and it's being turned clearly it's being turned into it's like a business going bankrupt and putting everything on sale so I'm not being necessarily conspiratorial about this I think that it's just the way of the world economy yeah I don't think anything you're saying is conspiratorial conspiratorial would be more like the galactic federation is behind this well they are obviously well that's what I think but I don't think what we're looking at my hope is that what we're seeing here is not it is something like what you're saying but the problem with any time like a cobble of sorcerers or whatever you want to call them decides to do something like what you're talking about try a new form of warfare everybody watches and learns from it specifically what you're saying to me is so amazing right now the pathway to the center of hell but simultaneously the pathway out is that this is no longer a national thing we're looking at a transnational way of interacting with people that it looks imperial or seems like an invasion and it is but also that means that people who aren't aligned with the whatever whatever particular global mega corporation is doing this shit it presents the possibility that organized decentralized groups of people could begin to do the same thing we just haven't gotten there yet but there's the possibility where and that to me is this is the horror of anybody who does want to have that kind of authoritarian control structure it's like with bitcoin with fucking blockchain we are looking at a possible way for people to like do something that is not even communism I don't know what you would call it yet but to me that's where we there's the possibility of that some organizing mechanism that gets groups of us together to invest together in causing changes that aren't coming from some boring ass group of old trembling old men that I think is the reality we're going to get out from under this or the other I hope I mean I think there's that possibility I think it's going to happen Jason right now they're going to teach us how to do it in the same way we taught Russia how to do Stuxnet you know Stuxnet getting the fucking centrifuges and when they wanted to do that Obama said you know if we do this we're giving everybody else permission to do it to us and they're like yeah but we're going to do it and then they do it and now every single one of the United States like apparently has been completely infiltrated hacked we've got bugs and all that shit they're listening to everything man and it's like that hack that's the government doing it you know about the new Russian hack you know well sure but the NSA has been monitoring the entire planet yeah they taught us how to do it they taught us how to do it they taught the planet how to do it we learn how to do what they're doing their shit gets exploited by the people eventually and we use it against them this is the war I mean if there is a war is there what's that well is there a war I mean I think that it's easy to like there's a couple assumptions in there but for instance the idea that we perhaps are at odds with our own government I don't think that that's the case and I think that the other is you know like it requires a strong national identity to survive things like this and America is very much a house divided that is very bad we have been since the 60s yeah and so when you have a country that is at odds with itself and has been at odds with itself for decades it's so easy to conquer and I think that so I think that's something to look at and the idea that it's old men controlling everything well no I think you know one thing I always say is that you know behind every man there's a woman egging him on you know you know and and power is very much you know power is centralized absolutely but I don't think that it's just centralized in the blanket statement of old men look I don't mean I'm not whatever you want to call it you know I just whenever I see like the meetings whenever I see the people who have all the power the ones they show on camera most of the time are old men like you know they're 60s or 70s Biden Trump people like that you know it's like generally that's Mitch McConnell you know you see in the you do see obviously very powerful women but the old men seem to be getting the spotlight more than the old women well there's many of those female premiers in many of the countries in Europe miracle people like this and I think there you go yeah and I think it's like well yeah I mean so agonistic observation I'm in it more like you know I'm like we're all like we just have to go through this fucking election where these two old men like beat their chest at each other for so many months you know that's what I was that's what I'm saying yeah there's a very subtle danger there which is that and I think this is very intentionally constructed which is where you can say you can look at the people who have power and then say well it is because of their outward body that they have this power and then you apply well this now you now globalize that to all of the other people who are like that well no no no it's not old men it's a very specific group of people very powerful interests some of them may be old men most of them may be old men but you can't then from there globalize to well then all old white men are in charge of everything and ruining everything it's like no most of them are dying I'm 40 fucking six I'm not this is what I'm getting at though I'm trying to get at is right now what you're saying about nationalism we need it people are saying we need these strong borders we got to have these strong borders we got to have a national identity and that may be true but the problem is not necessarily nationalism but a sense of a national identity other than something to auto attack yeah right but the problem is is it's like if we're talking about a new form of warfare then and we're talking about various groups who have various reasons to at the very least redefine the national identity you know like from the like corporations who just want to make money by making the national identity fit more according to their brand by foreign like other countries who would like the national identity to be disdain for the national identity you know what I mean to hippies who want to dissolve the national identity completely and create a kind of global hive mind yeah they're good foot soldiers for corporations in that way yeah but you know for me it's like as it was in the beginning so shall it be in the end and you know if we look at evolution starts off as a single celled organism multiplies into everything that we are now and maybe that's the same thing that happens with the planet multiplies into all these various like organisms called single celled organisms called states countries and there's just a problem huge and we are already whether you want to say there is a national identity in the United States but we are already so inextricably woven together I don't care how strong the fucking borders are we're woven together by the plastic in our placenta we're woven together you know what I mean we're together and everybody wants to say no the United States is this Russia is this, China is this we're all together there's no way to separate us from each other and obviously you know so many of the spiritual and you know Buddhist inflected people have been talking about dissolving some of that stuff for so long I'll say one, this is such a tricky one I think that I think jazz Coleman from Killing Joke had the best line on this ever where he said he is not he does not want a one world movement but he does want a one world community oh that's cool and I think that's such a good way to look at I mean look the nation state is an old and also well it's an outdated and not very old idea it's a relic of the Napoleonic era and it's not very effective particularly or it's not very useful it has so many blind spots where you can't just arbitrarily draw a territory and have everyone have a shared identity you look at the awfulness that created in places like Africa where nation boundaries were just arbitrarily drawn after after the end of colonialism and different groups who hated each other were put together resulting in things like the genocide in Rwanda or you look at it in America where it's like America is a place where literally everyone in the whole world comes there's every ethnic group every background and somehow despite it all we get along which is amazing but you kind of have to question why do we really despite all the drama why do we at the end of the day pretty much get along in America and as much as we're not actually you know there's not fucking Bosnian style Balkanization type of thing I think that identifying what that is is really important and I don't think it's like oh we're all we all love the ideals of the founding fathers you know I think it would be easier to say like well you know if there's anything that brings Americans together it's probably like the love of being able to make money and go to big box stores and have everything like available for you you know and there's a certain quality of life that brings us together and one of the most trying things about 2020 is when you start to take that away then all of the animosity under the surface begins to surface and that's very dangerous if you look at world history nobody ever starts wars for ideology we're always told that people have religions and wars for ideology and religion and ethnic reasons and all this and the truth is that the killing starts when people can't eat and ideology is used as the religion or excuse me ideology, religion or ethnic conflict is used as the mental justification but really it's like the but really it's just resource conflict like I was watching that Ken Burns Vietnam documentary on VR last night felt like I was in block work orange program with Vietnam killing images but there's this incredible thing in there where you know they interview soldiers who fought in Vietnam where they're saying that like the dehumanization of the enemy is a deal with the devil but it turns out to be absolutely necessary in warfare and I've talked to many soldiers who said the same thing it's like you have to dehumanize the other side or you can't do the job you can't kill people effectively tell yourself oh I'm not killing people I am blasting XYZ slur so that becomes a justification but the impetus is always when people can't eat and we're coming close to that not just in they're closer to that in the UK than here but that's very worrying we'll be tested here we'll see what really holds us together yeah I think I think it's safe to say that you're we're going to definitely see some unrest and I know that I mean I would if I had to bet I would bet that there would be some something that goes down that's more than just like the Proud Boys and the Antifa fighting for the CNN for CNN that's a clown show yeah it's like the gathering of the juggalos or something it's like well yeah it's just performative it's performative it's like that's not when you see even the way that they're fighting they seem surprised that they're fighting each other it's not all performative some people are getting there's like violence but it's not like what you're talking about like in the Balkans or what it's not that mostly but it could be but I think this is an intermediary phase I think that the problem is by the time for example if you look back at this shit that happened with LA probably you and the 40,000 people or however many it is that have already left LA and me people are going to look back on that and say oh yeah that was the beginning of kind of climate change you know refugee a low level not like refugee like we imagine them in the boba just people having to leave a place because the environment was making it intolerable to live there it's a combination of environmental factors meaning political factors forcing a lot of people to leave but it'll be a long time before people say that's what it was because by the time they say it there's going to be other things that happen people pouring out of Miami people pouring out of wherever the ocean has begun to flood or where there's 17 hurricanes in three months places that become unlivable and then they're going to be like oh wow that was the beginning of the mass migration of humanity from places that were unlivable to places that were livable and then that's what they're going to say but similarly I think they're going to look at what's happening in the world right now regarding nationalism versus globalism and they're going to identify all the quote anti-globalist people who are really anti-authoritarian people they don't nobody should want to be under a tyrant or one world leader you know in the past he was very beautiful named Damien like somewhat irresistible man with blue eyes but other than that none of us would want to be nobody wants to live under a tyrant but I do think that like oh it's too late as far as nationalism goes it's too late it's an old idea it's over it's done like go ahead and like put your fucking flags up wave them around do as much as you want and maybe it'll stick around for another 50 years eventually the economy is going to get away from every single country they won't have control over the economy it won't work anymore we're going to be in VR we're going to be doing business overseas in VR and it's going to be kind of untraceable and there's going to be movements of like energy that are bitcoin that are going to redefine economies and it's just going to in between that there's going to be a lot of people who are going to try to make that not happen we're going to try to stop it and dig their feet in and do anything they can to stop it psyops campaigns all kinds of like that's the whole problem for me is like now everyone's mad at China they're just mad at Russia not that long ago you know what I mean and it's like so anytime this is happening and I see the organized the organized transfusion of why to hate some country I do know for sure I'm looking at some form of psyops it could even be coming from the country there's like in other words China which does seem to be a little ahead of us in different ways for better for worse they know like everyone's like it's China now we ate China and China is already in the message boards there are my fucking wife's mommy group I'm not even joking I said mommy bloggers I said mommy bloggers you said mommy bloggers no they're in they like somehow like they identify like somebody was posting something about worried about China and then somebody wrote a weird post about you shouldn't worry about China and then somehow they trace that person back to being like someone from China who had somehow gotten in the group and it's like it's not just people who have never done that anywhere else in the world well that's what I'm saying Jason is like we have infiltrated each other in every single country in every single country there are there's the number one the phantasmal liminal whatever the internet is realm which is filled with androids and you know double agents who are being paid to get into the conversation and shifted according to a corporation state or god knows just probably cobbles of anarchists I would guess I'm certain that they're just groups of loosely associated chaos agents, magicians, occultists were just having fun well I've no idea about anything like that you would not know anything about that I would not cause conundrums and chaos just for the sake of it I'm like um yeah the final secret of the illuminati it's been me running this whole thing all along um all the world is in my dnb game yeah maybe so maybe that's what you find out I mean or maybe you know the other problem with it is it's like you look at um I'm sorry for this rant you look at uh Bostrom his wonderful book superintelligence and he makes perfect observation which is it's going to be a massive corporation or a state that produces the first superintelligent ai it'll be google very clearly it's definitely going to be google and we're not going to know that this thing was created until way after it was created I think it's already happened I only make a couple observations about that one I drove all the way to Austin from LA and I was listening to the audio book of 1984 the whole time I couldn't distinguish it from my actual life in many places because it's so spot on and there's you know there's so many good things in there that is so relevant I recommend everyone reread that or do the audio book because it's so relevant for right now but one of the you know obviously there's the famous thing in there you're talking about Russia and China there's the famous thing where he's saying like oh yes you know we were now at war with Oceania we had always been at war with Oceania and it just changed the it changed that nation that everyone's at war with and then they rewrite the news so that's always been the enemy but the 1984 is obviously you know people remember the big the main things from it they remember the brother they remember the rat they remember the double things and things like that but re-listening to it now there's so many critically important things in there for now one of them is if you look at what 1984 was actually about people assume that it is like a dark cautionary tale about fascism or maybe Stalinism and the truth is that yes it was about Stalinism but it was a comedy it was a satire and specifically what it was is it was a satire of the elements of the English intelligentsia who were pro-Stalin so it was it was all while making fun of champagne of the socialists in England and the spite running just beneath the surface of you know oh like we're trying to institute all these socialist reforms but nobody will go along with it so maybe we should just put them in gulags so that type of thing you know the hatred of the working class underneath this veneer of socialist reform so it's very interesting to listen to it in that light now because it's you know the England Ingsock socialist society of the future that he's describing essentially it sounds like England run by the blue check mark class on Twitter it's like all the same things that they're saying it's unbelievable but there's the I think that the critical point of that whole book that is so important for right now that nobody I didn't remember and has never picked up on is there's this whole passage in the center of the book where it's just like a passage of political philosophy that is supposed to be from the book of the resistance that later turns out to be written by the party just to agitate people but there's this point that is made where they say that you know since the end of the great wars of the middle 20th century you know it essentially it's been like what Buckminster Fuller said where we've had enough to feed clothing and meet the shelter needs of everyone and in the world and in fact we've had a surplus so since that time warfare is not conducted between nations has not been conducted between nations for the reason of fighting each other for resources which is what it used to be and what I was just mentioning it is it isn't about that what war is now something that is conducted by nations against their own citizens because what they realized was as Orwell says which is I think spot on what they realized is when there's enough for everyone which there has been for a long since the 70s Buckminster Fuller said since the 1970s we've had enough in the world that nobody has had to work nobody really needs a job there's enough for everyone but Orwell says that what they realized is once when there's enough for everybody you can no longer maintain a hierarchical civilization you can't have a class that has more and is in control of the others therefore in order to maintain hierarchy nations now wage war against their own citizens and for the specific reason of destroying excess goods for destroying food for destroying people for destroying material goods right or the means of production and in order that hierarchy can be maintained and so yes in 1984 there's essentially China Russia and Europe America and you know like who's fighting who is meaningless and interchangeable because what's really happening is people the hierarchical elite or a war with their own citizens you look at a war like Vietnam and you look at that and you just think what was the point of this there's a thing in Gestalt therapy where you can always infer like people do all kinds of crazy shit and one of the insights of Gestalt therapy is you look at the crazy shit that people do and you say well what is the outcome the outcome is clearly the intention of the action right like so somebody could be doing all kinds of crazy bullshit and the result is somebody loans them $500 well that was the point they're not really having this crisis or whatever so or not in the way that they're portraying it so it's like well what is the outcome of Vietnam the outcome is and a lot of dead baby boomers a lot of dead and traumatized baby boomers well the baby boomer generation was a surplus generation there are more people born than any generation in human history so if the the herd was cold maybe that was the reason for Vietnam you know it was for the purpose of killing young American men is one of the other things that terrifies people in power is big gangs of young men with nothing to lose you know like that's such a threat so they have to window that out and I know it's a very dark and cynical read of things but perhaps it's accurate I don't think dark and cynical I mean I think we there's no question of this is the it's not it's like the world has on one level of quality to it that is just brutal and and you know what are they what's that thing Christians are Christians love to say like that's Satan's first thing is make you believe he's not real but what the if we're talking about power why the second lie is if there's no sin so bad that it can't be forgiven that's the shirt that's the t-shirt but like the the the trick of so what happens is I said it wrong it's that there are sins so bad that they can't be forgiven the forgiveness may not be possible that's the lie of the devil go on sorry yeah well the the the great lie I think and the reason people are always like recoiling and hard like you know the nova check poisoning from Putin and everyone's like oh my god he did what are you here about like somebody who is about to release some like insider story on the CIA what that reporter whose car what do you know the brakes fucked up slammed into it yeah yeah I went to the spot where that happened a few days afterwards was the reporter was that set no it was from buzzfeed the guy that did the story on him all the trace that guy so people when these things happen it's fascinating to me when people are like oh my god they murdered someone it's like you the world is the world the world is pretty much the way that it's been for a long time the difference is they've managed to give us the impression that they don't kill people that there they have this morality or this Christian ethic or something like that when they'll take you out like with no they don't mind doing that it's no different than organized crime it is organized crime it's you know when there's laws in place that are completely arbitrary that are getting people put in jail then the people who are enforcing those laws are criminals there's no other way to put it it's organized crime so yeah on one level it's very brutal but Jason come on man you teach magic what's the transcendent angle on this thing I'm not asking you for produce some messianic fantasy for us to hang our hopes on and become inactive blobs but to me I I've always gotten off that verse from the Bible where Jesus says offer what is Caesar's unto Caesar the classic view of things which is like yeah you want to get undoubtedly written in later I mean like remember the Bible was written 70 years after the death of Christ and so it's like Jesus is like love each other you know love your brother as if he's yourself pay your taxes it's like whoa where'd that come from you know I always found that to be not pay your taxes but a more a really really hardcore messianic burn which is like yeah let him have the fucking money really give it to them all of it all the stuff let him have the stuff you know because that's what they seem to be obsessed with and that obsession is making them live in hell and legitimate hell do you know what I'm saying it's like to me the the the great what what I'm looking at is right now a disruption caused by a hyper inter technologically facilitated interconnectedness and that that hyper connectedness is being manipulated by power but eventually it's not going to something else is going to manipulate it that isn't about money something's going to manipulate it in a way beings is what will manipulate let me dunk in let me let me dunk in let me dunk in let me dunk let me dunk in I'm good Oh shi What the fuck I just stopped it to check it and it said could not be completed and dump to file I got it I got the zoom don't ok good we'll just get what we have ok fuck I don't know what's going on don't worry about it this is why every every answer to this question has to be immediately practical right whether it's you know and I just think that you know it's like I'm gonna say anything to anyone it's just this stay free stay free and look after yourself like by whatever means necessary you know economic if magic can help great if magic doesn't help isn't helpful for you then forget it you know like whatever it is that you can do to stay free and autonomous and particularly to look after you know any you should look at your life and anywhere that you are dependent on other people for survival needs you need to take that back immediately whether that's for economics or food you know like you don't need we don't we're we're lazy and susceptible because we've allowed ourselves to depend on these very fragile networks for our needs and everyone saw in March where all of a sudden everyone's like descending on toilet paper like locust like how good is that gonna be and I'm not a survivalist but I think that we need to be able to just for a sense of psychological integrity like I say I'm not a survivalist in a sense I don't think that like the grid's gonna go down and it's gonna be like last of us part two or some shit like that I do think that but I think that a big part of psychological integrity is being self-sufficient and it's very healthy to be so I want but from a very practical sense this is the reality right it's like the power curve of the world no longer has anything to do with location or in a sense your identity it is all technology it's always been that way in the sense that like some cavemen got fire and some didn't and got stuck to not have fire it's sucked to not have iron weapons you know is still a bronze weapons when other people had iron weapons so it's like it's not capitalism it's just you know capitalism responds to technology it's downwind of technology so I think that the point I wanted to make about AI where you said that we don't know if it's hamlet or not here is if I was going to be conspiratorial and I'm not a conspiratorial individual by nature I'm actually serious because I think that my problem with conspiracy thinking is it's a shitty mental frame if you're looking for if you're a conspiracy person what you're doing is and I don't just mean analyzing power I just mean dwelling in be constantly looking at conspiracy theories as a form of entertainment if conspiracy people are constantly perceiving life through the filter of they're looking for reasons to be disempowered looking for reasons to not have power the magical view is look for ways to get power yes right you know as I think Huey Newton said you know the name of the game is power if you're not playing with power you're in the wrong game there was a great therapeutic group anarchist therapeutic group in Germany in the late 60s where they basically said that all psychological symptoms can be healed by gaining power and it's totally true this is Nietzsche's point the will to power you know like that's it it's like you know don't sit around talking about your feelings get power and money so that you can pay the world to leave you alone my point about but if I were to be cynical let's put it that way not necessarily conspiratorial then I might think that what's currently going on with covid is this and I should preface that I'm not a covid denialist covid is clearly real all of this because people are so easily triggered but my point is my point is never what's you know oh like this is not happening this isn't real like covid it's not the inciting incident it's how it's used my concern is not covid my concern is what is covid being used as a pretext for case in point 9-11 right like everyone obsesses over 9-11 truth all this who really did 9-11 my response is who gives this shit right I mean not totally but it's like we know it happened it's not the event it's how it was used we know for a fact that 9-11 was used as a pretext for the patriot act it was used as a pretext for every American citizen to be virtually molested every time they fly which doesn't if you don't think that has a deep psychological effect think again you know and that never went away just like all the covid stuff will never go away it's what's it a pretext for and it's the same with covid what is covid being used as a pretext for it's always people are afraid they always surrender power and the power never comes back ever right so if I was to look at covid cynically I would say this we've known for quite a while in fact we talked about this on your podcast a couple of times back that the AI age is coming and everyone who is on the power curve of AI knows that AI and automation and software in general just we're going to say technology in general invalidates the need for a lot of human human labor yes right and therefore we're going to end up with the majority of the population being no longer necessary we're falling into the cat at least to the powers that be because everyone is essential now they're saying oh you're not an essential worker that means we don't need you but everyone is essential in the spiritual sense to each other in the family sense in the just being a human sense but from the technocratic view point well they're not necessary to greasing the wheels unless they're buying the stuff we're making but they're not needed as workers so therefore they fall into the category of what the Nazis used to refer to as useless eaters that was their name for it and so you know like the and this is nothing new I mean like even if you look at the Fabian society which is a socialist think tank in Britain and the same people that are well is responding to people like Margaret Sanger and things like this and talking about the need for eugenics and annihilating the poor and annihilating large groups of society since the beginning of the 20th century and it has been going on there have been sterilizations going on that people aren't aware of there have been mass killings in California people forget that all of the things that the Nazis did were based on Californian policies we just modeled the eugenics policies and the sterilizations that were being conducted in California when they did action T4 and all these things so America I would contend that America is the most racist and violent and evil country of the 20th century I don't think there's any comparison and I know that's a shocking thing to say but it's just Americans are so good it depends on what part of the world you live in that that's a shocking thing to say well sure like if anyone is not American but as you were pointing out Americans are so good at believing they're the good guys we are not and it is psychologically terrible to think so we're animals just like everyone else I was talking to a black friend in LA he was saying that he looks at Biden and things like this and it's just like saying all Americans are good we're not like that the bad Donald Trump we're good people it's like total bullshit and he had a line on it which I'll never forget he said you know like America was born in blood and it's gonna end in blood what you know like to contend otherwise give me a fucking break only like that's the height of privilege you know but no you're not but this is what I think on one level your friend is right on one level sure but I'm telling you what I like about what you're saying is you gotta unhinge yourself from the like if we are in a real like new form of warfare which is most certainly based on streams of data being warped or corrupted or shifted for some like reasons that you'll never know then really you just to me like it starts with where am I getting my info from where is it coming in from and what happens to my life personally if I shut some of those streams off or if at the very least I just see them for what they are and to me that's the beginning of the power that you're talking about the power is now number one about like finding a kind of a kind of internal autonomy that isn't disrupted by a Sean Hannity rant or isn't disrupted by a beam that got started in a CIA think tank distributed via various bots it's like it's finding the fundamental ground of reality because once you find that or something close to it and it's very elemental simple then you at the very least you'll start knowing when someone's trying to fuck you up in that regard when someone's telling for me it's just like okay when someone is telling me what to be afraid of which I think is like the what we're seeing with people who are well intended at many of them they don't want people to die or they're afraid they want to save themselves then their fear aggression comes out and the next thing you know they're doing the odd they're having the opposite effect than they want it because now they've done some twitter where a fucking mask you stupid shit fuck yeah that tickle in your throat that's the grim reaper knocking on your fucking door you know all that all that does is all the wisdom in what they're saying which is be safe out there there's a pandemic gets lost in the aggression and then people have a natural reaction to the aggression and they're like fuck you I'm not gonna wear a fucking mask you motherfucker you can't control me and it's like so their whole point was lost in their masturbatory blast of fear digitized fear so to me it's like noticing that like who the fuck is trying to bend my will and how much has my will been bent like you know I'm in the grocery store the other day wearing a mask and I noticed somebody not wearing a mask and I think to myself you motherfucker you pointed them like Donald Sutherland an invasion of the body snatchers and you mean Farron no but I did notice how like one of the ways that I've been affected is that I have I talk about dehumanization I don't know anything about this person but I've definitely dehumanized them right away and I've just thought this is a selfish piece of shit and maybe it's true maybe it's not but I know that that is not a very human reaction to another human being having their own incarnation and their own neurological matrix that they're looking at the world from that's just violence and aggression and so I have been that point been a carrier of aggression into the world and that to me the kind of world I want to live in isn't like that and so that's what I'm saying for me my where I find my power is figuring out a way that I can be in the world that it acknowledges my own meme infections it's not saying I haven't been infected by opinion that was given to me by some very brilliant corporation or you know what I mean like a symbolic parasitic ways of thinking that I didn't come up with on my own but they're there I know they are it's like when you have jock itch like you gotta just the first step in getting rid of jock itch is acknowledging you've got it your fucking balls stink and you're itchy I think that's exactly it the whole point of meditation to look at it in maybe a 21st century way and don't let me lose my point about AI but if you look at meditation from a 21st century perspective it's like well it's your you're disinfecting yourself from roving memetics you know it's like we are all the internet is just a metaphor like our brains are constantly in interconnection with each other whether you want to call that telepathic or not I don't because it's just like why use a cult language our brains are all nodes uplinked to whatever you want to call it a shared mental experience I really try to push myself to not use a cult language because I don't think it's very hopeful it's so easy to just think it's something it's not so we're all like having a shared mental space that we're all kind of connected to and because we're accessing that without any type of because this is new to us with the internet and all that we have very little defense against memetic infection and it's not just it's just that our brains are like these freeways that external memes are constantly racing through it didn't come from us and meditation allows you to buffer to just shut it off it's like again in 1984 it's like they have the constant they have the constant TVs everywhere that are constantly blurring party propaganda and you can't shut them off and then there's the one scene where he meets O'Brien the head of the party who can shut his TV off because only the inner party is allowed to turn off their TVs but only for about a half an hour at a time that's a good meditation session so that I think and what that allows you to do just achieve mental silence I'm not like one of these guys that it's like look the magic the occult spirituality there's so much fucking horseshit in it I'll be the first person to tell you that it is gibberish it's fucking gibberish right but there's really useful things in there too and so much of my career has been trying to locate the things that are actually helpful dust them off and represent them in a way that because those things are the most critical things like for instance the ability to achieve mental silence right like that right there is the difference between a successful and an unsuccessful life and it's very hard it requires constant practice just like going to the gym it's hard and people like oh it's hard it's like yeah it's fucking hard yes it is fucking hard like go go get to it you know it's like I don't want to become like the jaco willing to fucking meditation or something like that but it requires work it's not it doesn't come from some intrinsic spiritual genius or whatever except when it does but I think what that allows us to do is the most critical thing right now you said where are you getting your news you got it check in with yourself you have to be able to get feel your own humanity your own body your own connection to what's around you it's like it's like the classic bill hicks joke where he's he's saying it's like you know you turn on the news and it's like war aids death famine recession war aids death famine recession and then you look out the window and like there's a bird chirping you're like what the fuck is this all happening you know it is happening if you're in LA but you know if you're if you're in Austin it's pretty chill but it's not happening all the time I mean that's the thing is like it doesn't even happen it's not just shutting off your mind it's like acknowledging the impermanence of whatever the particular states of consciousness are because the other thing these memetic fucks do whatever you want to call them these counter sorcerers or tyrants or whatever AI fucking wizards whatever whatever they try to do is they try to give everyone a sense of some permanence and which is why these elections that are happening they're so stupid at this point because every single election it's the end of the world if the other person gets elected and it's been that way for a while and like this this is just not the case and it's it's enforcing a way of looking at things so not to go back to my say if you're Jesus but whoever wrote offer unto Caesar what is Caesar's to me this isn't pay your taxes it's saying number one figure out what is Caesar's where's the meme and then whatever that fucking stupid thing is yeah we use that as tokens in this phantasmal game but also know there's some things that aren't memetic there's some things that aren't injected in you from this world and those are the things that's where I find all my power that's where I have a sense of like glee and joy in the world in the midst of all this which in a joy that isn't delusion a joy that isn't based on me turning my back on the wild suffering of things I mean isn't the first step in the Bog of Aguita first you've got to deal with the fact you're gonna die that's number one you have to deal with the fact everyone's being devoured by God start there like we're all getting ground up in this fucking thing I mean this is the truth we're being eaten and dissolved by a digestive tract that looks like a planet that's real and that's the way it is everything's being eaten everything you eat is being eaten and you know that so to me that's the first step is like oh yeah you're definitely gonna die like you're not safe you're definitely gonna die could be in a FEMA camp you could be dragged against a wall and shot in the head and if that happens I'll be screaming I'll shit my pants and piss my pants and whimper all my spiritual stuff will go out the window but that's gonna be 30 seconds or however long it takes for him to kill me the rest of the time I'll be longer than that Duncan don't worry You can please do it fast the leader of the Illuminati I don't want to suffer too long but you know what I'm saying is like it's like the finding the power to me means you know our lies and tearing apart human minds and putting them back together in a matter of your own choosing sounds like fun but the also sounds like annoying over it like putting the mind back together and then you got a pee and you come back and you can't remember where you were in the reassembly process and then whoever you're doing it to their drooling you put them back in the vat your supervisors like you didn't put his mind back together come on what do you think you're gonna get a bonus this week to me it's you know what I'm saying it's like the individual has got to reconnect with the anarchic nature of reality itself I agree and totally there's so many points I want to make about this let me put all this together in my mind is one thing so that I agree with you to a point the thing that I wanted to point out about AI is if I was to look around I would say that clearly they have known for years that AI is coming and that a large amount of the workforce will no longer be needed and one thing that I think everyone who is on the side of the AI power curve is quite afraid of is of all the villagers with the pitchforks coming to burn their their metaphorical feudal castles to the ground which could easily happen and so I think if I was to look at this COVID thing as perhaps a Psyop I would say that what is the result of COVID and not just COVID it's not the result of COVID it's the result of governmental policies at the state and federal level and global policies because it's not just the US the result is the destruction of the middle class the result is that everyone has been by and large has been put out of work that vast slots of the world economy have just been shut down overnight and that people are being starved out and in the middle of that that all of that money from the middle class is just being transferred to Jeff Bezos to Google to Facebook to all these Jeff Bezos made what like 60-70 billion dollars so far extra in 2020 so the result so it's like Gestalt therapy well we can infer the cause based on the result perhaps and the result is the destruction of the middle class and the transfer of the wealth of all small business which cannot be centralized and controlled to a centralized group the big tech companies the other thing that has happened is now everyone is out of a job but the pretext for them being out of a job is oh it's a disease and again I'm not saying COVID isn't real but what I'm saying is because I'm not a denialist what I am saying is well look at how it's being used all magic stage magic relies on misdirection look at what the stage magician is doing over on the left side so you don't see what he's doing with his right hand and so while everyone is terrified and everyone has been conditioned to blame each other for not wearing masks right in the same way that people are conditioned to it's their own recycling habits which drive or consumption habits which drive global warming when the reality is very small group of agriculture and corporate concerns it's not the middle the middle and poor classes are not responsible for global warming unless you consider their consumption as total classes but not at the individual level whereas you can point to individual corporations or ag business that are quite responsible for environmental degradation so the pretext is oh the reason that everyone doesn't have a job is because of COVID and the reason that everyone has COVID is it's your fault or it's those other assholes from their political party it's their fault well so now everyone has a job it doesn't have a job and can be replaced with AI but you can't blame a company for that oh it's COVID you riot against COVID so I think that perhaps what we might be seeing is that this is actually the transition to the AI economy and this is the fourth or fifth whichever industrial revolution that we're on is currently happening and this may or may not be true it's just an idea I had it's not based on anything other than my own internal conjecture but clearly this greatly benefits Jeff Bezos and people like him just in the same way that all the rioting and looting and destruction benefited him because all these small businesses were destroyed and Main Street and the middle class are being buried six feet under and the recipient of all that wealth is the tech elite so I think we may actually be seeing the transition to the AI age in terms of checking in internally with your own humanity there's one thing I absolutely agree with you there's one thing that has encouraged me more than anything else I've heard in the last few years which is I did a podcast interview with Ralph Abraham who's one of the founders of chaos mathematics he wrote that book Trilogs of the edge of the west with Terrence McKenna and Rupert Sheldraig super cool dude, old tripper, old hippie real into magic, he's a teacher at UC Santa Cruz and he did when I was a student there and he said something so phenomenal to me that I love so much and gives me so much hope which is that in the late 60s there was all this corporate money put into chaos mathematics so chaos mathematics is the study of extremely complex systems and the with the intention to figure out why they become chaotic and the ability to predict random change and for instance things like massive weather patterns or the stock market or things like this it's the mathematical understanding of chaos classic book chaos by James came out and that everyone knows in the 80s but it was very popular in the 80s particularly with magic people so but what he said was this is that there was all this money put into it because people wanted a way to better predict for instance you know world outcomes, the stock market, business things you know even in the 60s they were running huge computer projections on like the Vietnam War to quantify everything and figure things out and it didn't work and but he said what Ralph Abraham said was that what they found out was that it is actually impossible to make any type of prediction from data you can quantify as much data as you want it's actually impossible to make any type of prediction it's just flat out impossible you can do probabilities and all that but you can't reliably predict anything no matter how much data you have because this world is just too chaotic it can't factor that mathematically and then once they figure that out all the funding dried up and no one ever heard of chaos math again because this is what he said, this is not my conjecture because what he said is there are all these people who make their entire living doing predictive analytics and consultants and saying oh I can come and give you the answer and all this they make so much money and this obviously invalidated that entire industry so I look at these companies can collect all the data and all they can house data warehouse all the data from everything in the whole world and it won't mean jack shit and the reason that it won't mean jack shit is because humans are fucking weird we're still fucking weird like human beings are the most unpredictable and dangerous fucking thing in the universe what the fuck sniff their own part and laugh explain that with data I mean I think I could explain it with a sufficient computer from like maybe 2300 we're just not there yet but we will have that answer Jason I mean we're talking about the fundamental question but to me this you know now that we're approaching the Christmas season this is what I think the story of Jesus is exactly exactly what you're talking about which is here you have a thing that they tried to kill they thought they could control the power structure drove it out where does it get born a manger it's the most beautiful thing ever it's saying fuck you anyone trying to control this shit fuck you you think you can stop the revolution you think you can stop the thing which we all know will will happen again it happens on this planet one of the things that happens is massive social movements and they're not always bad sometimes they're really really good and it's gonna happen again and you can go ahead and do anything you want to try to predict it control it reframe it you can't stop it it's gonna come and we all and to me that's my that's what gets my hippie back here standing on end and to me that's the thing that like makes the political theater and makes the chest beating of human beings so wonderful to watch is they somehow managed that they've gotten the I wouldn't want to play that part and the great beautiful drama of humanity which is the part of the person who thinks you can control the world it does it's not gonna work it won't work it'll see it might work for a little bit but it's not it just doesn't it's not gonna work that's my feeling with it man and to me that points to what your friend was talking about the great hidden you want the great conspiracy you want the great conspiracy here's what it is it's just what you said about covid people aren't causing the chaos they're reacting to the chaos reframing the chaos writing scripts for the chaos telling people what the chaos was because they don't want to admit the reality which is it just can't we don't know it just happened fucking pandemic happened and a lot of us died because of it because we're so interconnected that's true you know and then you tell a story about what came from a you want to fuck with China came from a Chinese laboratory you want to fuck with trump it's cuz trumps a piece of shit you want to fuck with like somewhere in Europe or something it's like you can find an explanation for it but the truth is and I think this is why so many this is why we both have a general sense of like when it comes to conspiracy theorists is they can't stand that they have to come up with a story about it you want to you it's a false flag you know what I mean it was like someone came in and shot a bunch of kids but they can't tolerate the fact that that happens that's intolerable for many people to live in that world and so they make a story about it well actually they want to take our guns away just the human the reality of it is so monumentally almost impossible to it's like you look at Adam Lanza or something like that like how do you even begin to think about that it is unthinkable so you know so you have to have an explanatory if you have an explanation for it at least you have a sense of power over it yeah but false power you're only gonna feel hate yeah right so I can't think of something more awful than that incident I can't at the moment it staggers the human heart right but I think that that's said and I agree with you but let me give you the counterpoint which is that very often there are ill-intentioned actors at work and they need to a sophisticated model must be developed because people should be held accountable and one of the things that drives me nuts about conspiracy theories is it's just like people free riffing while at the same time you can go to the public library and find out everything you want to know about all the corporate and national abuses that have been happening and the real power structures and all of this stuff is sitting there in academic well-studied documents or news reports or just the news you know good journalism but people don't do that instead they free associate and it's like a form of folk art or something like that but at the same time it smokescreens the actual abuses of power which unfortunately because we've now lost the fifth estate because we've lost good journalism in this country which is just totally fucking fatal to everything well people like the shadowbox man I mean that would put good to speak to your point it's like easier to get in a shadow boxing fight with a pizza company than to be part of you know a financial movement to get money to people to pay for lawyers who have been abused by the catholic church it's like you want to you want to fucking like fight up Mayfair Mayfair is not going to punch you back but start pushing back against the actual organized pedophilia happening in the catholic church or many other places many other places you're going to run into some real fucking trouble yeah so to me it's like again if you want to look at like that subversive organized psyops if there is you know we have to like follow the rabbit hole if like you've got organized pedophilia you think that's the only bad thing they're doing you think they stopped there that means they're doing a lot of other shit that's rotten and part of what they would do I would say is exactly what you're saying misdirection so get them fucking mad at the billionaires get them mad at fucking whoever the fuck it is get them mad at a made up amalgam of wealthy people worshiping mollusks who like to suck on adrenochrome popsicles because as long as they're focusing on that yeah you know what I mean they're not going to turn the pitchforks on the actual known human trafficking fucking pedophiles that are are showing up many places it's really disheartening but anyway I don't mean to get into that Jason my question for you is and I know you I think one of the many things I love about you is how good you are at grounding magic in the earth and I think a lot of people benefit from that because it's just so easy to get lost or even just turned off completely by the language of it the silliness of it the confusing nature of it the archaic quality of it but so what are some bits of magical advice you know or that you can give people I know we need to find a way to be independent discover who's controlling us regain our power but is there something a little more mystical than that that we could take this into the rest of our lives well here's what I would say and this is what I'm okay Matt what is magic magic can be anything to anybody but why do people actually want magic they want magic because they feel powerless and they want to have power and we live in a society that says that is bad and un-spiritual fuck that yes you need power right so this is what I will say the name of the game now is get power that doesn't mean power over other people because you actually can have power over people that is not freely given anyways right so the and you don't want it so power is the ability to control and rule your world and therefore to provide shelter, safety, well-being and a sense of meaning for other people right be a king right so and that's power it's the power to provide and true power and leadership comes from serving others does not and that includes all the way up to the business level does not come from the reason one of the reasons that Jeff Bezos is so powerful is not because he's like this narrative that he's like controlling everyone it's like yeah he's a fucking balls to the wall ruthless capitalist but who's giving him the money people that he's providing this awesome all these awesome Amazon services but you think they're just he's stealing the money no people are giving it to him because he's making packages come to your house in 24 hours which is awesome and so much time right so power right power comes from service it comes from serving other people but not in a in a practical way not in a self denying way I think that this was the point that I wanted to make about Christianity where you're talking about well like they whoever they is can control us but ultimately we can fall back on this kind of transcendence out of the material world well yes and that's beautiful and there's a subtle hook in there which is this mechanism itself that you're describing has been the way in which the world has largely been pacified and controlled for thousands of years where the siob if you will is oh no no no don't worry about this world let somebody else handle that right you just think about the next world yeah well yes you should but you should also think about this world and I think that one of the primary benefits of whatever the western esoteric tradition as opposed to even Buddhism Hinduism or Christianity in its outward forms is a heavy focus on power within the material world and that is not a four letter word might be a five letter word is not a four letter word right power means the power to feed yourself, to clothe yourself be self-sufficient be independent so here's one thing that I've been thinking about that I can offer as an exercise which is I've been thinking about this for a while which is you know obviously in America at least all of our rights are under attack I think the American Bill of Rights is one of the most fundamental and profound documents of human freedom ever written it comes out of the Masonic tradition it comes out of the Enlightenment tradition it comes out of the time of the Masonic Enlightenment tradition I think the only thing that it might be better is Liber Oz by Crowley which is along the same lines but even shorter Oz? Yes, as in Liber Oz yeah it's a one page document I'll read it if you want but I think with the Bill of Rights I suggest an exercise to people which is simply this take the Bill of Rights as a syllabus then look at it and take it as a syllabus first amendment and look at that what do I really want to say to the world what would I be willing to die to say if I have freedom of speech then what do I really need to say in this lifetime if I only had a week to live what would I say to people what is so important to say and it's not just like like online but yes of course people should have the right to say whatever they want but think about it in the deeper sense the spiritual sense what really needs to be said second amendment can I defend myself that's a huge fucking responsibility yeah well shit how do I sort that out and figure that out that's a big deal and then so on and so forth the other ones search and seizure all of this these point to I think that we should interpret the in a spiritual sense some of the Bill of Rights about there's all these things about unlawful search and seizure and people coming into your home well what about data what about what you were saying which is people hijacking your emotions in your mental thought isn't that in a sense allowing soldiers of the king to come into your head and live rent free and so okay well how do I prevent against that I think that I think that one thing you can say one good thing you can say about at least old school conservatism in America is the very clear understanding that what the founding fathers originally said is unlike any other country in history America the Bill of Rights is not there saying the state is granting you these rights what it actually means is you have these rights these rights these rights are inalienable from God you are born with these rights these rights come from God we don't grant them to you and we can't take them away the role of the state is to protect these rights right from encroaching control so I think that's something that I recommend practically particularly for Americans you know there's your esoteric syllabus right there love it but other than that I mean stay free and I'll say this like practically speaking everyone needs money like fucking forget all the spiritual like at least for now like spiritual esoteric ornate beautifully constructed systems and all that like get paid man I think that money power comes from money that's how it is is that great I don't know it's been that way for a while is that going to change in our lifetime no and if it does it will change at cost of great violence only and we don't want that so I think that all my courses that I've been offering it I've been doing like way better courses at Magic.me my site they're all focused on not just spiritual but economic freedom hey what's the difference between your Instagram I went on I dropped in while you were giving this awesome talk and I was wondering is that part of your what is that, is that part of your class or what are you doing on Instagram I should clarify that because my Instagram is just like my rant feed so the website is www.magic.me m-a-g-i-c-k and I promo it on Instagram from time to time but that's where all my courses are Matt wait let me just say something you must if you're not following Jason on Instagram it's the best combination of like very controversial to me not controversial but I'm sure to some people controversial political essays mixed in with like really beautiful spiritual essays it's a really great you've done a fantastic job through that medium it's really I'm always like terrified everyone gets so angry every time I post but I've been doing this for years Aaron and I we vehemently disagree with you from time to time but we love it it's so fun to read they're so passionate and it's like it's so fun it's really good I only aim to entertain I don't think you do only aim to entertain well well I will say this I mean the true role of any magician is to restore balance at all times because balance in the Dow are the true the only truth one of the reasons why magicians always get into so much trouble for being such crazy fucks is because we always posit the opposite of what everyone else thinks in order to draw society back into a once median the middle path of the Buddha that's why people like pro-league are so fucking off the deep end that's what crazy wisdom is you know yeah it's like you just show people their opposite and they go crazy it's hilarious but also I think if you're talking about who's more likely to get pissed off and balance person or an imbalance person it's going to be the imbalance person and so if someone's coming into a situation to bring real balance they can expect that that's going to start off with a lot of people being mad at them because there's a lot of out of balance people and out of balance people the first thing they're going to do is be like fuck you man I'm not out of balance help me now that's the first thing in imbalance anytime I've been really out of balance and I'm lucky enough that someone comes and he's like dude you're out of line here like no you're fucking out of line and then I realize like oh yeah you're right I'm really out of line thank you I always just respond when people do that on YouTube but uh reduce it to like you know I've got what my technique has been is to go when I'm being attacked viciously on Instagram by trumpet I will say go on what do you mean by that see how long it goes how much can I get to the right before you move like how many posts you know I just block them I have no I just block people right away I don't care who they are I'm just like you know what do you expect from me as William Burroughs put it I am not paid to put up with this insanity yeah there's no and to me that's the other like I want to talk about a modern display of ultimate weakness it's when somebody posts a tweet of like blocked by so and so it's like yeah because you're a dick like your whole identity is based around being blocked by somebody that's a sad state we've gotten off track here I think in terms of in terms of uh the one thing I did want to point out about money is well empower in general like think about how you can get power over this material world right and I always say that in uh you know there's a great like I love it when the alt-right obsesses over fucking beta males like oh you're a beta right it's like dude it's like oh yeah like just like conceptualizing first of all like worrying about your status with other men what the fuck man like come on like that's so fucking lame um but like the whole alpha beta thing it's just like Jesus Christ but there's a great libertarian concept which is like zeta males like they want or they want absolutely nothing to do with anyone else and so that's where you want to be it's like you don't want to have you don't want other people to have power over you but you don't also you also don't want to have power over anyone else right like that's how you get free just disconnect it's like all these fucking that's the problem with all these fucking quote unquote liberation movements and oh we need to free people and make things more fair and all of that like all of that is the fucking will to power it's it's a will to power that must express itself in a in a false way of like oh like you know like oh yeah we want to like get control to make everything more fair and all of this is like no you just want power right so why don't you just be honest about it right so so you know in order to become free you have to give up your your dominator impulse you have to give up your your need to control other people that includes what they think you know like you know you can't just be not you can't just give a fuck about what other people think of you like you can't like you you have to disentangle yourself and that means not becoming part of their power webs not becoming part of their hierarchies or trying to get status in them it's like the great Buddha Marilyn Manson always pointed out yet a line which is like this you know slave never wants to be free slave only wants to be king and that's why you stay controlled well I think that one of the most beautiful things about America and about Americans is or anybody but one thing that the Americans and when at their best personifying there's often we're not at their not at our best one of the great things about America is that the the pioneer self-sufficient spirit of like for instance you and I were able to just go like Oregon trail mode and just be like fuck it like you know people used to go to the west coast now we're going east you know but it's like but you can fly you know so it's like you don't have to do that Oregon trail thing of like everyone died of dysentery along the way so I know what you mean though it's like to me it's a very American thing to just be like you know what I'm gonna pack up and go to just go not stay at a place because you're there like that is freedom to me but the freedom you're talking about is much deeper go ahead I'm sorry for cutting you off that but but not just you know it's not just a relocate it's to relocate to and create a new life for yourself to do that subjectively to you know what I mean it's like what you're talking about to me is the identical thing except it's not it's an internal geography it's like when you start realizing that you're wound up in some internal power web or your brain has been invaded by memes of you know what I mean when you like just to me just simple things like whenever I start noticing the way I am sitting or you know what I mean simple things like that like looking at like how like when I my friend calls it the underdog cringe you know that thing you're carrying a male yeah but that that that thing where you're like you're still acting like fully from high school is like chasing you down the hall or something and it's like it's long gone oh that's such a good point that's a really good point I think because well if I was to like first of all it's distinctly summarize what we both been talking about it's like well you know my advice is you know like power right it's like free yourself externally and free yourself internally and the internal what I offer for internal freedom is all of the spiritual techniques like meditation or it doesn't have to be mine I give tons of great ones but whatever works for you because everyone's different in that regard free your mind internally but also free yourself externally and that means being self-sufficient and disentangling yourself from power networks by being able to provide for your own needs and those of others but do both as above so below free yourself externally free yourself internally because otherwise you're going to get caught in the tide of history and that is where no one wants to be right so but I think one-on-one with you through this I never asked you that I regularly do one-on-ones like every couple weeks there's a whole office hour section and there's going to be lots more we just did a whole conference for like it was like a three-day rave where there were like hundreds of people just all interacting and I wasn't even me I was kind of in and out but it's like so beautiful I was so happy people were able to like people are so sincere you really want to learn and so listen to people having the same conversations that I had I talk to people who take your class they love it you're apparently a very good teacher thank you well I try to give people the truth but in a you know and and and tell people the things like what I'm saying which is like you know like sort sort you know be practical you know because because what you were saying about Christianity one of the problems with traditional religion or let me just put it this way not the problems where I think magic whatever that word means whatever practical spirituality where it separates itself from religion is it's do it yourself it is DIY rather than religion which is oh great savior in the sky please work it out for me yeah well well well that being can it may or may not you know maybe that's not the right approach you know don't confuse the planes you know you've got a body why don't you do it right so I think that don't confuse the planes that's so cool right it's like well leave the spiritual the spiritual world is the spiritual world the spiritual world interacts with the world of matter by using tools of matter primarily your being but I think the point that you put about the body is so apt there's another incredible quote in that because the body is the source of liberation Nietzsche said there's more wisdom contained in the body than any infinite library in books in ancient wisdom and it's totally true and you don't even any yoga teacher will tell you that right this is not like secret shit but dudes who get wrapped up and fucking a cult books always forget this right you got to get back to the body so but your point there's another great quote in that in 1984 where Orwell says you know it's he when you're in times of totalitarianism and political control it is always experienced through the nexus of the body right it's not well just like everything else in life you're not experiencing these big movements of political shifts and economic and warfare what you're experiencing is a toothache that you can't treat you're experiencing the feeling of the hunched over that you're talking about because you're afraid you're experiencing that you're cold that you don't have enough to enough to eat too much your weight gain that's the pandemic a lot of people gain pandemic dude I know you're yeah man it's like you know I've been doing fasting now for like two weeks it's wonderful I mean just that alone the power of like realizing like you don't have to put food in your mouth all day long every day like in and I the ghost that for I was I thought if I stopped eating I would like it would be way more painful than it was but it's you just totally stopped 100% fasting yeah I do I do a 24 hour fast once a week and then intermittent fasting here the longest one you've done the longest fast I ever did was a long time ago it's two days no food you know so I went past the hunger to where you're just not hungry anymore you're like what the fuck where's my hunger and you check this out if you do a four day I love fasting I should be more of it and I should do one now actually now that I'm out of LA to get all that in LA toxins but if you do a four day fast by the third day your head is very clear by the fourth day you don't have any energy and you can't really move you just have to lay there but on the fourth day of a fast your body enters the scrubbing process where it starts getting rid of pre-cancerous cells like laying out pre-cancerous cells just start shedding them and then and you feel fucking great absolutely there's a Tim Paris talks about it I mean there's a whole protocol you can do with MCT oil so you're not so hungry but you basically go into deep ketosis for four days and on the fourth day your body just starts auto-scrubbing itself and you feel like brand new afterwards to me it plays into what you're talking about which is it's like when you're being controlled by your appetite it's not an external force it's an internal force but still when you realize like wait my gauge was off about when I needed food any like I was wrong like I don't need as much food as I thought I did obviously but also like there's a sense of real for me there's been a real sense of relief somehow and also an amazing like oh my god this is the opposite of what I thought it would be it's like I feel like I'm going to a steam room once a week I mean I'm not saying I'm not getting like super hungry or there aren't times that I'm irritable because of carb withdrawal or whatever but it's like still feels great man and anyway I don't know why I got into the fasting thing I think I'm going to start once a night now I'm like I do it on Sundays anyway Jason I think I think as always I've learned a lot from talking with you and I definitely I think yeah I think you've helped me like do a kind of analysis of like other things that I'm being controlled by it's really cool it's a wonderful thing at the very least just to understand if you are living in some kind of internal fascist regime or if you've managed to get yourself in the world I mean god in a weird way how nice would it be to be under the control of some horrific tyrant because at least then you're like well the tyrant makes me do this or they arrest me versus being under the control of a phantasm that lives in your head where there's really no repercussion at all for you doing what you want to do yeah it's pretty sinister man that's the thing about again I recommend everyone please re-read 1984 but going back to it it seems so naive in retrospect it's like not only it's like 1984 was written about like Cossesco, Romania or something it was like mid 20th century dictatorships things have gotten much more sophisticated since then even William Burroughs pointed out in the 80s like it's so ham-handed like looking at those old depictions of totalitarianism we're looking at the real totalitarianism during the Cold War or in World War II it's like looking at like an Amiga or something like that it's like looking at a punch card computer versus computers now and it's just so ham-handed and obvious and William Burroughs said in the 80s or 90s it's like he had this riff no more Stalin's, no more Hitler's it's like that time is over control is not things are not controlled by singular individuals anymore it's controlled by faceless bureaucracies where blame can be apportioned and shifted at will one of the reasons why America is so successful at domination and killing is that when you have big bureaucratic big inefficient bureaucracies it's always somebody else's fault it's like the Marines can always say well it was JSOC or whatever or it was that other branch it wasn't ours it was our CEO or it was the taxpayer or it was like America is huge interlocking efficient mess of bureaucracies alphabet agencies there's voting the voters can always be blamed it can always be somebody else's fault and I think that in a sense the inefficiency of the apparent inefficiency of the bureaucracy is a feature not a bug it's never anybody's fault the most fault it ever is people can always say I was just doing my job but it's not like in the Nuremberg trials I'm just doing my job it's obvious where the orders are coming from they're only giving a small piece they don't understand the context of what they're doing it's more like when you see a dance floor video where those awful videos were like a dance floor collapses and it's like whose fault was it the person who made the dance floor the last person to get into the club that stepped on the dance floor was the people who went in the club but they saw the floor doesn't seem quite right whose fault was it for me one of the things that you're teaching is that based on what you're saying if we're looking at this dispersed responsibility blame being the mechanism for evil concealing itself then the revolutionary move is to just take responsibility for your own life like if we're all pixels in this web of revealing a real evil thing then the first thing to do would be like look stop figure out all the things that you're doing that aren't because you're a victim you know I'm not saying some people aren't victims there certainly are Jesus God I victimize myself I victimize myself with by forcing myself to work more than I need to being inefficient in the work that I'm doing we're all victimizers as well just look at your supply chain who created all your electronics nobody's innocent in this world and nobody ever can be and I think that but we need to look at just look, this is something that Akira Kurosawa said the duty of the artist is to not look away and I think that same with Trunkpa same with Tantra, it's the same with the Crazy Wisdom it's just look self-observation that observed the terror of the situation and I think that one of the real dangers right now is that we've entered a cultural moment and this isn't just about whatever cancel culture things like that, it's become like the stock go-to thing for like every dude over like every dude on the far end of their career he's in middle age to be like oh cancel culture it's like okay boring, I got it but it's not like it's not a thing it's not like it's not an issue but it's not just about that I think that we are in a very dangerous moment because we've entered such, we've entered a phase of history whatever you want to call it where it's vengeful there was no forgiveness right and there was a rabbi I forget his name, there was a great rabbi in London who gave a talk about this and said where is forgiveness in our culture there's only blame and it is permanent there's no forgiveness, there's no space for forgiveness and it's always even if you look at there's zero overlap between the Republicans and the Democrats you know, zero you can look at visualizations, they all used to talk to each other now there's not one connector between them and it's always when the Republicans are in office oh it's the Russians and now the Democrats are in office, oh the Chinese did it it's like give me a break where is the leadership and I think that we've entered like you know, America is a PVP realm now everyone is attacking this is what Christ incarnated people that tell them to fucking knock it off love your brother, love your neighbor they're yourself, what does that mean it means we're one, like you were saying we are one organism, it's not like they're yourself they are yourself it's your one organism stop attacking each other and people are entering this insane ideological purity on all sides where they have to, it's not just this is nothing new, everyone's heard this it's cliche at this point, but it's cliche because it's such a cultural issue Jason you sound like a beta I'm just kidding, I'm joking I'm sorry I'm trying to make a joke listen man, I'm telling you you were presenting a path to, I think like, real revolution and real revolution is not communism or some anarchist revolution or some libertarian revolution or the great awakening or any of that shit real revolution, it's what if you want to do if you want to really do it, make find peace in your own life create harmony in your house this is it, this is the move settle your affairs, settle your accounts drop the agenda of constantly being at war with the people around you, if you can at least have the intention of harmony, even if you can't achieve it because of your situation, whatever it may be you know to me that what you're saying is that, but with a real um renewable quality to it because it's where it would be very easy to think those things and then still be an asshole when you're at your house then you can become an iron rand type, right, so that's not but I like to, let's look at the world I mean, revolution obviously means the rotation of a wheel, right like the turning of the wheel of the Dharma the turning of the wheel of the seasons or the turning of the wheel of somebody's life so maybe revolution instead of revolution, maturation is a great way to look at it you know, maturation and not an indicative way, people always say well grow up, well no it's not that, it means maturation is tough it's a hard process and we need human beings need so many inputs to do it you're not just going to get it from spirituality you're going to get it from everything in your life and you get it by stepping up and choosing to step up and I think not to turn into Jordan Peterson although he makes some great points you know, like he's correct about that but I think that he's correct about a lot of stuff I don't like blaming people oh my god, you just got your twitter account just got cancelled sorry I don't, but I think that you know Jordan Peterson in a sense falls into the same thing where he finds people to blame but I think that, you know, that aside maturation means saying nobody else is going to do this for me and have I been wronged? sure have I been victimized? sure I have been personally many times I'm fleeing victimization right now I'm fleeing a situation where the government is constructing it in such a way that I don't have rights and that I can be harmed and it's my fault which is what California has become but I have the choice to change and that's a hard choice because I've had to leave behind a lot and that's why people don't change because they don't want to leave things behind it always requires sacrifice and that sucks but it is what it is, that's life and I think that maturation means I think that if I'm to be so bold the key to maturation is to no longer think how can I make my life better it's how can I make life better for other people it's about shifting from thinking about yourself to others and so that's what was so key for me and not right away but I came to a realization after teaching Magic got me for a couple years where it's like, you know what this is not about me at all anymore it's not about magic it's not about whatever the fuck the western history stuff that's just a vehicle it's just something that I know how can I actually make people's lives better we all have that ability and it's not a gondy thing it's just like doing your job it's not a big fucking deal but I think that maturation and becoming and I think this is why I was talking to the Bill of Rights you know what I'm saying, this is in a sense the vision of the founding fathers of America is that it would be a network of self-sufficient matured adults who were free and self-sufficient but were coming together to build something better out of mutual aid and not in a totally anarchist sense but in a sense in an anarchist sense so the mutual cooperation and so I think it's quite dangerous you know obviously people it's so easy to slip into the revolutionary quote-unquote mindset of oh if we only get rid of these people then things will be fine we need to fight this other group of people there's only one output of that in all of world history and it's genocide other than incremental social reform so when taken to extremes so that's not always true so perhaps I'm being a little bit hyperbolic there so now that I'm thinking about that that's a bit too extreme what I've said but clearly that can be the outcome and I think that and just the presupposition to think I need to fight this person and attack this person in order to be free presupposes that they have power over you at all it cements their power over you when I think that why not like look I always point this out to people it's like everyone is you know it's like look there's so because of the internet we have almost infinite realities you can live in and yes you can live in the world of oppression but then again like there's this kid that I met that I love I met this guy at a facebook advertising conference a couple years ago and the kid's like 20 years old and he travels all over the world and he makes $70,000 a month and you know what he makes $70,000 a month from selling an e-book on how to get arms that look like Goku from Dragon Ball Z on bodybuilders instagrams that's crazy you could have that experience too and he flies all over the world on his laptop it's a good reminder that you can do that in this reality listen Jason thank you so much I'm so lucky that we're friends and do I do you do is there still

Burry the tongue of a dead hangman Underneath the tree When you come back the very next day I can guarantee that in its place you will find a mail bag. Mail bag, mail bag, oh god, what have I done? Dear Duncan, even though I'm a billionaire it still bothers me that some of my closest friends are multi-billionaires and I only have one billion dollars. Do you know of any secret tricks for turning your billions into multi-billions? Sincerely. Karen Carpenter Hey Karen, since I only have 500 million dollars and not a billion dollars, this question is a little out of my league. So I sent over to my friend who is a vampire prince living in Eastern Europe. He has lots and lots of money and he also has a book coming out and this question is perfect for him. Hi Karen, thank you so much for the great question. The short answer is weapons manufacturing. If you want to turn your billions into multi-billions, get into the weapons manufacturing game yesterday. Buy a copy of my book, How to Turn Your Billions Into Multi-Billions Through Killing Innocent People, just released by Random House. This details the ins and outs of the weapons manufacturing industry, what weapons are in right now, what weapons are out and most importantly how to efficiently harvest the life energy of the innocent beings that your weapons are going to obliterate. A lot of people are using antiquated methodologies but I show a few ways utilizing modern technologies like the World Wide Web to get the most energy out of the creatures that you'll destroy. And PS, animals have souls too and a lot of people seem to forget that. There's this trend, everybody wants the souls of innocent civilians right now, but I'll tell you, there's a lot of soul energy to be harvested from wiping out species on the brink of extinction and that's an entire chapter in my book. I hope you'll check it out. Thank you so much for listening Karen and I truly, truly hope to see you at the next meeting of the great ones in the pyramid of time. Friends, if you have any questions for the mail bag, just put them into a pouch with three emeralds and give that to a trained gibbon monkey. Release the monkey on the night of the next full moon and that monkey will come to my apartment in New York City and you might make it into the mail bag. Oh God, what have I done?

This man is attempting to inspire all of us to wrench our eyes away from the glowing hell vortex that is the illusion of the impending apocalypse to a more beautiful, harmonized, sweet, and humanistic potential future. I came away from this conversation feeling inspired and excited and a lot less dreary. And I hope it will do the same to you.

So now, everybody, please spread your wings, open your pineal glands, and send as much light, love, and joy in the direction of this wonderful human being wherever he may be at this moment. Please welcome to the DTFH Daniel Pinchback. Welcome to the DTFH. Thanks for coming over, man. Oh, yeah. Thanks for having me. I have been following your writing for years. And I've kind of watched you unfold from, you've been on a journey, man. And is it say, this last book, How Soon is Now, it has a kind of fervency to it. You know, like it feels like you are, are you worried that this is the end of the world right now? My word is the end of the world. I think a lot of people are wondering what the heck is going on. And a lot of the data is not great, you know, like the evidential data about what we're doing to the planet. I guess, yeah, it's like a whole process for me that, in fact, like when I started my psychedelic exploration, again, in my late twenties, that led to breaking up in the head. Some of it was, was catalyzed by, by writing a piece for Esquire on an ecological subject. It was actually about the sperm count going down. Like the sperm count has gone down 50% in the last 50 years. And I was like, why did this happen? What does it mean? So Esquire put me on this, this, the case. And I learned that it had to do with like plastics and pesticides that were changing our endocrine system. The piece came out and people were sort of laughing it off. And I just began to realize that, you know, we couldn't really focus on what was happening to the planet. And then I, as I analyzed that, I began to realize it had to do with like a spiritual emptiness or vacuity or nihilism that people were feeling or cynicism. And then I felt it also. And I realized that I just was a scientific materialist and a skeptic and I didn't, you know, believe there was anything outside of this material reality, but then I remembered my psychedelic experiences from college and I decided that I would go and see if there was something deeper there because those would have been really profound and suggestive experiences. So it's a, you know, it's a long answer and the answer could go on and on. But ultimately, yeah, I think that, you know, we're facing an ecological cataclysm approaching. And, you know, the psychedelic substances are of great use in helping people kind of deprogram and awaken and sort of reconnect to the phenomenological circumstance that we're in and maybe also kind of rethink where we could go in the near future. And so in a way, the new book is like sort of applying psychedelic insights to like political social theory and ecology and so on. But it feels like something, something happened for you where you, you know, something, when I take psychedelics, inevitably a piece of the trip is a feeling that shits about to get so bad and it's scary and it's, it's, uh, it seems so, um, imminent. And I always wonder if this, at the same time, don't you also simultaneously or get the sense that things are soon going to get so great? Well, you know, this is the thing when I've been listening to interviews with you and reading and reading interviews with you, it feels like you seem to think that things are going to get great after they get a little scrambled up. Is that an inaccurate assessment? Yeah, I think it's more of a simultaneous process and like I see, um, you know, a lot of incredible progress, you know, and happening in my own life, um, and many people that I know, um, on so many different areas. Um, so I think it's like, it's a strangely simultaneous co-evolutionary process or something. Let's talk about that because that's a really perplexing way to look at it because I know what you mean. Well, you know, I personally, uh, feel this spiritual growth happening in my own life and people around me have been, you know, drinking ayahuasca or having, you know, their depression lifted from ketamine or, or have been experiencing some benefits from psychedelics. I mean, I've, you've seen, I'm sure you've seen the shift when that happens to a person and it's remarkable. It's a remarkable thing to witness. And yet, and yet bombs going off at concerts, Trump's want, you know, waddling through Saudi Arabia, making a $300 billion arms deal. And yet, you know, these, it's like, I just can't tell if I have a kind of essentially a lazy and naive world view that is based on the desire to not be obliterated in some kind of fiery disaster that seems to be right around the fucking ice caps are melting ice caps are melting carbonate. Let me just, can I for a second, just be the hysteria for a second. Maybe you can help it. The fucking ice caps are melting. It doesn't look, it doesn't matter what how everyone drink ayahuasca, go ahead. It doesn't matter because there's fucking lunatic religious fundamentalists all over the planet who are eventually going to have access to technology allows them to decimate the planet, the individual, what used to be the school shooter phenomenon is going to be the city nuker phenomenon. You know what I mean? So there's, it doesn't matter. That's all that is exactly the reason why I spent the last 10 years writing this last book, how soon is now really trying to fathom the depth of it and then also to provide like a path because, you know, I mean, first of all, life is inherently miraculous. It's totally implausible that we're sitting here now on this tiny little rock circling a fireball and an infinite abyss made of 10 trillion cells and microorganisms that mesh themselves together and allow us to like have thoughts and, you know, motor around and stuff like that. Yeah. So, I mean, it feels there's like, you know, as much as there's entropy that physics talks about, there also feels like there's some, you know, purposeful, anti-entropic thrust to all of it. Oh, yeah. And that the universe or the underlying consciousness field is seeking to create more complexity, more creativity, more amazingness. And, you know, we're part of that process, I would say, we're at the cutting edge of that process. And, you know, all the negative stuff is seems somehow just as necessary to bring about our awakening and our transformation. Thank God. No, seriously, man, I'm just like, well, I got to ask him is at the end of the world. Well, that's good news because, you know, the, the, the, and I didn't mean to, I don't like saying what I just said on the podcast because I don't like to even put it out there in that way. I don't want to be a fear monger or anything. And a piece of me, a big piece of me understands that thrust that you're talking about. But is that God? Is that, I mean, to, for lack of a better word, do you think that that's just God operating in the, in the, in the human, human society? Yeah. I suppose. And, you know, obviously people have different reactions to that term and to use it as to shut off a lot of people really quickly. Actually, I was just in my coffee shop this morning and there was this guy's from this Christian church across the street from my house and he was talking about how, oh, you know, we know that God doesn't want people to change their gender. And so those people are actually acting against God. And actually I got livid and I was like, look, man, like, how the hell do you know what God wants? And I was quoting some stuff you read in an old book that some people wrote thousands of years ago. And he was like, are you a Christian? And I didn't really answer. I mean, I could say that I'm an esoteric Christian as much as I'm also like a, you know, follow like Vedanta and shamanism. I think, I think that like part of the leap that we can now make as an integrated esoteric understanding of the whole that no longer contradicts science and technology, but actually works with, with our scientific understanding. But anyway, but he, you know, but, but so that's, I think, the reason why God is a dangerous thing to bring in because it suggests all these like moral value judgments and so on. But yeah, there, you know, I like like Amit Goswami, you know, his stuff. No. He was like a quantum physicist who had the self aware universe that he just talks about like, yeah, there seems to be like a very Eastern, he's sort of bringing together like Eastern metaphysics and quantum physics and, you know, even seeing how like, you know, action at a distance and quantum locality could allow for some type of existence of like a soul or spirit after death. Yes. These kind of, you know, entities aggregates would sort of stay together in some way. That reminds me of this hilarious article that popped up. Did you see the article where the people from the large Hadron Collider were saying that there were, there were no ghosts? Oh, really? It was so funny. I mean, I thought it was the funniest statement, but they were like, listen, if they're ghosts, we would have picked it up by now. There's no ghosts. And I, I thought it was such a very, very funny human thing to, to announce, you know, that they discovered that there's no ghosts. And I felt a little disappointed and relieved, I guess, because like if something happens at night and I get scared, it's like, well, they've negated your existence spirits. Um, I use the term God as a term of convenience because it's easier than to say like whatever the, you know, everyone's got different things. Source. Well, I guess you could say source, but that sounds so anonymous and boring and like, fuck it, God is, you know, fuck it. If someone gets upset by that word, let him get upset. You know, I'm not talking about the goddamn homophobic bro thing I'm talking about, that thrust that we all kind of feel it. But man, it feels like it's, if there is that thrust, it sure feels like it's playing a kind of nerve wracking game of chicken right now. Doesn't it, Daniel? Like, you know what I mean? Like it's a little nerve wracking at this point. You're like, you want to grab the wheel, right? You want to say to it, hey, whoa, whoa, we don't like just fix this now. Like I've had enough of the creep show here. I don't want any more of this, man. I don't like the dreams I have of the nuclear missiles flying in and I don't like the numbness that I feel, Daniel. I don't like, I feel numb. I read your book and I like, like feel, feel numb and I think, yeah, like I thought to myself as I was reading it and I thought this is why, you know, I thought, how do I do this interview because I have to be a little confessional with you in the sense that like I feel threatened by some of the things that you were writing about. I feel like I'm part of the problem. Even though I sense this like imminent catastrophe, I can't seem to overcome some very basic blockages in my own psyche when it comes to changing my behavior in a positive way that, because you know, like I just can't fucking, I don't know what to do. You know, I use, so, so fix me, man. What happened? Well, I'm not like saying that I'm perfect either. You know, I mean, that's not really my point really. But I don't think it's your point, but you are, you know, you are, you have this like, you're doing something. I tried to think about the whole situation almost from an outside, almost like being an extraterrestrial anthropologist, you know, looking at what's happening here and then thinking about what we would have to do. And it's interesting because the book I think has been challenging for people to, to deal with both because they don't really want to think about the magnitude of the crisis. And then also they don't want to think about the types of changes. Like we're very comfortable in our, you know, I mean, I just got this beautiful almond latte from the cafe downstairs with like beans from Africa and, you know, and so on. It's wonderful. Yeah. So, and, and, you know, and we do sort of feel like we're somehow living on like borrowed time and like there's some kind of reckoning coming. Yes. Yeah. And we, in your book, you didn't, the problem with the book is it's like, look, if you want to write a best, a book that's going to sell a lot of copies, you want it to be a thing like, well, you could think yourself into wealth or, you know, you could just like kind of relax into enlightenment or just chill out, everything's going to be great, man. That's a best seller, man. That's a best seller. But to write a book, it's like, hey, look what's happening, man. Look what's happening. And also then to say, but in, in here's some stuff that we could do that isn't very comfortable, man. Like, wait, you're telling me to stop flying to Hawaii, to my Ram Dass retreats? Seriously. I love it, Daniel. I, I, like, you know what I mean, like I, so I, inside of me, I think is the apocalypse and the sense that. Exactly. Inside of all of us. Exactly. And somehow or another, we have to reckon with that. I mean, that's why Trump is beautiful, not as like, he's not like an outside force. He's a projection of everything in our own psyche that, that, that can't, you know, evolve or grow or take responsibility. The shadow. Yeah. Yeah. So until we integrate the shadow and deal with it, it's going to get worse. It's just going to get darker. It's going to get, you know, that's, that just seems to be what reality is showing us right now. I, again, I, I don't, I don't, I'm not generally a skeptical person, but I just feel like being completely honest with you with my shadow so that we can kind of work with that because that's all I got to work with. Yeah. So, okay. So I take psychedelics and I love them and I like to think of myself as a spiritual person. I pray and I, I, I, I meditate and I chant, but I still am not going to stop flying on fucking airplanes to go to remote tropical locations from time to time. And if I'm not going to stop doing that, then what if things got so amazing around here that it just was like, just began to feel almost laborious, you know, like what if like you could go to like, you know, my friend's farm growing hard upstate and everybody was already in Ram Dass consciousness and maybe it gets a little chilly in, in, in the winter. But you know, you're actually feeling that you're, you're growing together into something greater. I mean, isn't that, isn't that a possible alternative? It's a possible alternative, but it's a big what if, you know, it's like, it's a, I just think about that and it's like, I don't know, man, I don't know about going to that farm. I think that I want to, I like, I don't mean, I'm just going to be completely, I, I like getting on the plane. Oh, I know. I love it too. I know. I love Hawaii. I mean, I've been there a couple of times. It's amazing. So we are fucked, but right, because that's what I mean. That's the problem is it's like, we're taught, this is, this is, it, this is, I don't want to say we're fucked guys. I think there's a lot of hope here where I know we're going to turn a corner here, hopefully in the next 45 minutes or so, I just want to put it on the table that inside of me is this, is this like almost immovable thing that this momentum is inside all of us. It's like, well, we kind of half recycle, you know, maybe if I remember, I'll take the cloth bag down to the grocery store and won't use it. Well, I don't think so. I don't think that it's the individual is going to be strong enough to deal with the circumstance. So it has to be, we have to wreck, that's in a way like the first thing is we have to recognize, which I think you've done, like what the whole conundrum is. And then we have to put on our thinking caps and be kind of like, all right, like this is the conundrum. What would actually make a difference? Like, you know, what works for alcoholics, for instance, like Hussein 12 step or Al-Anon, like some community peer group where people are being held to a higher standard, where there's support, you know, where they feel love and connection, you know, is there a way to create that around these other situations that we have? I mean, in the book, I talked about even trying to work with Facebook, like we helped organize a thing at Facebook headquarters around climate change. And, you know, they're reaching 2 billion people every day or something now, which is unbelievable, which is like a new phenomenon in human history. Like, what if every time you open Facebook, you know, it said something like, hey, human family, you know, all this amazing things are happening. But unfortunately, we've overshot the capacity of the ecosystems, and we have to pull back for a while. And here's what you need to know about what's happening in your local environment, on a planetary scale. Here's what you can do locally. Here's ways to conserve resources. Here's like a ride-sharing system. You don't need your own car, you know, necessarily, you know, I mean, something like that, like ways to use the fact that we're so meshed together now in this one, you know, sort of collective brain to kind of reinvent the systems that are not working for us, you know. Yeah, well, the difference between you and me, well, I mean, there's shows a lot of differences, but one of the differences is you're like actively, seems like constantly engaged in this effort to forestall or transform this event that is where it is slowly unfolding in front of us. Well, surely there was a time when you weren't so passionately engaged in the pursuit of, for lack of a better word, trying to save the world. Well, I mean, yeah, and honestly, like, yeah, I mean, I see a lot of my own limitations or whatever, but I guess in writing the 2012 book, the second book, I had this crazy transformative episode in the Amazon in Brazil, where I had a channel transmission experience where this entity Quetzalcoatl sort of came through me and said that I was like an avatar of this force. And, you know, I kind of then felt that I was meant to do something beyond just writing books and commenting. And, you know, so I tried to put ideas into practice. I started like a company and a nonprofit, but I also again and again, you know, kind of failed and saw my own weaknesses and shadow aspects and so on. And so, you know, I don't know if maybe, I mean, like, you know, Terence McKenna thought the eschaton was coming in 2012 and, you know, died before that happened and then it didn't happen or Jose Aguilas, similarly, Alistair Crowley thought he was going to be like the great beast of the apocalypse and then he kind of died of alcoholism or whatever drug addiction. So, you know, I hold that pretty loosely at this point, but I did give it my best shot. I was like, OK, like, you know, if I'm meant to be in this position, like having written the 2012 book, which was really looking at it in a metaphysical, esoteric, philosophical level, like one of these indigenous cultures saying about the time that we're in this book, the new book, How Soon Is Now, tries to do that, but in a much more practical, tangible level. Like, you know, for instance, what does it look like in terms of our technical systems? Like, you know, if we're going to survive as a species, we're going to have to shift to renewable energy really, really quickly. If we're going to survive as a species, we're going to have to shift to other forms of farming, regenerative agriculture, because the monoculture industrial farming is destroying the planet's topsoil. So the point where the United Nations says we can only have 60 years of harvest left with the current way we're farming. But we have these other practices. They're just more labor-intensive. They actually require us in a way like going back in time a little bit. But Daniel, there's a new aliens movie out. You know, it's like, fuck, man. What I mean is, like, yes, you're, I know the topsoil, the oil, the ice caps, all of these things. But the obscuring all of those truths, that low-level, eschatological hum is this. You talked in an interview, in an interview, maybe it's from the book, a passage from the book, how Taley R. De Chardon always, I don't even know, how do you say his fucking name? I'm so bad about pronouncing this. How do you say his name, though? Please help me. It's French. I guess Chardon. Chardon. You talk about how he talks about a field of thought, there's a field of thought called the... The newest sphere. Newest sphere. Yeah. But over that field of thought is a field of fucking movies and TV and, yeah, yeah, yeah. And underneath all that is like, oh, yeah, okay, yeah, the soil is running out of nutrients and the oil is going to run out and there's people are getting blown up. Right. Well, I mean, so I guess in a way that's my naive idealistic perspective is like, this is about the evolution of consciousness and that can happen unconsciously. So it actually is about the people like you and I and your listeners saying, okay, like, it's difficult. You know, it's not as nice as just being numbed by science fiction or something, but I'm actually going to take the time, you know, the six hours or 10 hours it takes to maybe read a book like mine or whatever to think about the crisis that we're in and a solution path to it. And then over time, maybe that will inspire new ways of being, new thoughts or whatever. I was kind of the bet that I was making with the book or my faith in human nature in general is that like the 2012 book was an extremely difficult and challenging book that whatever some of this stuff, but somehow maybe because it was more psychedelic or something, it found a big audience. Yes. So that's it. That's it. That is. I mean, we don't want to fucking hear about the but it's really not all bad news. A lot of it is actually really, really good news. It's just you have to go through some of the bad news to get to the good news. Well, I mean, in some, but no, look, man, you are too challenging. Like I don't mean, I mean, not in a very sweet way, but I don't mean in the way it popped out, but it's like, man, you, one of the principles you put out there is the destructive nature of monogamy, right? Like the idea that humans wouldn't go that far. I mean, I think monogamy is perfectly good and even amazing for some section of the population. But as a, as a universal construct that everybody has to conform to, we can clearly see that it's creating hysteria and driving the whole situation even into deeper destruction. Right. Can you talk about that? Yeah. Well, I mean, just think about like what's happened over the last couple of years. I mean, with the presidential election, you had Donald Trump and grabbing the pussy and his, in his misogyny and flandering. You had Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, his flandering, you know, you had Andrew Wiener and his sexting. Yeah. You had Roger Ailes and his sexual harassment and, you know, and, and Bill O'Reilly and his sexual harassment. Yes. So it's almost like everybody who's like a major player in this whole thing is tainted by this, you know, and so, so if we step back. You think they're grabbing pussies because of monogamy? Yeah. Well, I mean, I think that we've constructed a situation where, you know, if you read that book, Sex at Dawn, like Chris Ryan or you know, Calcedo, Jeladette, we're not naturally monogamous as a species. Our primate ancestors were not monogamous, particularly, you know, men are more flagrantly maybe not monogamous, particularly alpha male men. So in a circumstance that we've created where, you know, to ensure sexual access, men will seek wealth and power and fame, you know? Ah. Yeah. So then you have that being a major contributor to this type of deformed psychologies who push to the top of these pyramids who are then, you know, cheating on the side, you know, lying on the side, being hypocritical on the side. I mean, you know, one of the problems with constricted monogamy, you know, is that if people are forced into it, but it's not really who they are, then they're automatically put into a situation of being hypocritical with the person that's closest to them in the world. And then they become able to accept hypocrisy as like a basis, like they accept it as the norm in general. Does that make any sense? Yes. That's so fucked up. Yeah. Oh. So we have to deal with our authentic nature as human beings and we have to say that, you know, for some people they're in a monogamous relationship and it's amazing, you know, but for most, well, I'm, you know, I'm being nice. Or we have to say that, okay, we're not really like that. So, and being hypocritical is leading to a whole society based on hypocrisy and lying is leading to a whole society based on lying, you know. So then what do we do? Well, we love each other, like men and women love each other, but we can't, we have to create a system where we can love each other in an authentic relationship. So then we have to think about, you know, how we got into, I mean, monogamy is a construct, you know, according to that book Sex at Dawn and really developed with patriarchy and agriculture and surplus and possession rights and so on. It's not innate. You don't find it in a lot of nomadic and tribal societies in the same way. So, you know, we have to rethink. And so in the book, I looked at this community in Portugal called Tamara, which I think is an incredibly crucial experiment for the future of humanity, where they basically, they were leftists, like, you know, radical philosophers in the 60s, they were trying to figure out why these utopian ideas of the left and the green movement failed. And when they looked at the movements, they began to realize that it was actually these core issues around jealousy and envy and repressed sexuality and distorted eros. They talk about eros a lot, which were leading to these movements to fall apart and break apart. So they were like, okay, this isn't working. We actually need to incubate like a new social model. So they kind of created these communities. They stepped outside of society and they spent like decades trying to figure out what would be an alternative. And so Tamara is a community of about 170 people living in, you know, non-possessive relationship, you know, based on trust and transparency. And they've created all these social tools that just bring everything up that normally gets repressed and, you know, make the community face it, make the individual face it in an ongoing process. They also have cooperative childcare, which I think is crucial for a liberated human society. So for instance, one reason that, you know, in our society, you know, non-monogamous sexuality is very threatening to women in particular, because, you know, if they want to have a child, they need to have a secure investment of a man for like a huge amount of their adult lives. Right? And if the man scampers off, they're totally screwed. They have to put all of this energy, they don't get to manifest their unique creative essence or whatever they're hampered, you know. So if you, you know, and the nuclear family and the monogamous couple is actually a stupid design for raising children, because it requires so much energy. I had a kid and just, you know, taking the stroller on the subway or taking the kid to the park. I mean, you know, unless you have money for a nanny and even then it's kind of ridiculous, you know, but a cooperative childcare model would make a lot more sense. So Tamara. How old's your kid? 15. Oh, wow. Cool. I didn't know that you're a dad. Oh yeah. Yeah. She's the apple of my eye. Really? Yeah. I love her dearly. She's incredible. I could see it in your eyes right now. Yeah. Yeah. Talk about it. Yeah. Is it the best thing that can happen to a person? Do you have one? No, not yet. Yeah. It's one of the most wonderful human experiences for sure. Yeah. Anyway, please keep going. Yeah. So, so the idea would be that like with Tamara, the women, the women, if they want to have a child, have to ask for the community's permission, you know, which is a barrier, but then if they get the permission and they have the kid, they know the child will be raised by the whole community and past the age of like two or three, and a lot of the kids actually choose to live in a kind of children's compound. The women have to ask permission to have a kid. Well, yeah, because they only, they've limited resources in the community. Listen, I, here's the thing. You, this is the problem. I, I, like some of the things you're saying, I like, but I'm just thinking from the perspective of the planet. In fact, I'm thinking of like the perspective of like, uh, God, what's that? What's that dumb, dumb on Fox news? He throws a football at the beginning of every show. He's like, you know, like he's just like big, is that head of the, I don't know, I don't know, I don't watch that. I think Hannity, like throws a football at the beginning of his show is like, you listen to you, you want women to ask permission to have kids and group sex and, and, and some kind of not some kind of farming shit. No, it's never, no, it's never going to happen, man. No one is going to not know one because it is happening, but I'm saying, you know what I mean? Like this level of the New York times just had a big feature on open marriages last Sunday. So there is like a big cultural shift happening. It's not the open marriage. I mean, I know there's a cultural shift happening there, but I'm saying that it's the New York times. You know, it's New York. It's a progressive, advanced, sophisticated, liberal city, but it's like, man, I just, I'm trying to think of like the, the, the clusters of traditional Americans who are like, I, I'd not get, I mean, look, what's the number one insult right now? What it used to be, what would you say if you were an alpha male and you thought somebody was weak, you'd call him a faggot. Hey, faggot. Now what do you call him? I don't know. A cuck. Oh. Yeah, that's true. You call him a cuck. You don't cuck. I bet you let your wife to hump other men and you'll cuck. Right? That's an insult. Now, like the thing you're proposing people become is for a large group of people, one of the primary and fashionable insults, you know, so it's like, we're talking about two different tribes here, man, a tribe of people are like, yeah, I do kind of understand this idea of like, I just want to be living with someone I can be completely honest with. That's all. You know, it doesn't necessarily mean I want to go sleep with other people or her to sleep with other people, but I at least want to be able to be like, God, you know, sometimes it sounds kind of hot, you know, like, and not have to feel like that's the worst thing you could ever say to a person just to announce the truth of your DNA or your genetic structure or whatever, which is everybody feels like that from time to time. So anyway, what you're proposing is I could see that this is a potential way for the planet to be a much more relaxed place to be in. But the to make it actionable in the global sense, I mean, shit, you're a globalist, aren't you? A globalist? You're a globalist. You believe that the world should be connected as one world is connected. But we got to give up the whole, this is the United States and this is like we're talking, what do they call it? Class A civilization? Or type one and type two, like Macaulay thing? Yes. Type one civilization. You want that to happen. I think I want that to happen. And for that to happen, there's a lot of little things that have to happen in between nationalities kind of have to go bye bye, getting like addicted to the concept of being an American, European, an Indian, whatever the fuck it is that you think you are. We're a planet. We're a human species on a planet that's running out of resources and we have to do something to connect with one another in a way that isn't currently happening. I think you and I both agree that that must be true. But the problem is to get to that point, to go into the Midwest and sit down with a group of people and be like, you guys, you should consider to marry a place where you know what I mean? People are like, no. Maybe it's my once again, my naive utopian optimism. There are times of paradigm change that nobody really sees coming. And there are like stresses that are accumulating maybe even unconsciously that then lead to like a crisis that then brings about a change. I mean, even look at the culture of like, I mean, I guess one of my reference points is the beach generation because like my mother was kind of connected to them. Gated Jack Kerouac. She was with Jack Kerouac when On The Road came out in 57. She was 21. He was in his mid-30s and she saw the cultural impact that that work had and until that time obviously the mass culture was very repressed. I mean, you know, the work of the beats, which then led to the hippie movement. I mean, there's no, there's not an excuse that, you know, there's no reason that the Beatles are called the Beatles. They were reading the beats. Bob Dylan was reading Ginsburg and so on. You know, they took the seeds of that like liberation and spontaneity and sexual openness and they spread it globally and that actually has had a permanent shift. Like there was a sexual liberation that and, you know, the rock and roll culture became like the universal language of the world in a way. And that's, that's happened all over the planet, like that change. So there's actually not a reason that other levels of change couldn't happen. That's great. That's great news, man. You're absolutely right. Of course, it's so easy to get caught up in the little things and not to realize the bigger picture. But I guess only because in this inner conversation, I'm playing the part of the devil. So in the same way that we can see that these widespread changes have happened when we look at like things, when you zoom out a little bit, it can almost also be said for the apocalypse too, right? The apocalypse or the collapse of the ecosystem or the, what's happening is also moving at a very slow yet in retrospect, we can look back and be like, whoa, holy shit. Look at that. I mean, if you look at the satellite images of like, you know, the earth changing over the last 20 years since we had satellites up there, it's horrifying, isn't it? You've seen those, haven't you? The deforestation that's happening. It's like, man, I don't, like, I don't know. Like, I guess we're telling two different words. I guess it's like Alice in Gray says, there's two windows you can look through, right? One of the windows is the window of the deforested planet, the wiping out of the, the elephants are being, the elephants are being wiped out, man. Species are going extinct every single fucking day and not just like 150 to 200 species a day out of 8.2 estimated million total species. Yeah. So we're losing something about 10, like 10% of the earth's remaining biodiversity every like 10 to 15 years. Well, so it's, you know, once again, you could say Sayonara and it's all over. Yeah. Or you could say, well, like we're in this circumstance, we've created this circumstance and now we have to apply our creativity and our cunning and our technical genius to solving it. All right. Well, let's start there. Yeah. Let's start right there. Okay. I'll tell you how I live. You give me a couple of things I could do that aren't that difficult to change and I'll change them. I'll change them right now. I want to know. So I'm going to tell you what I do. I don't, I, I, I will I recycle, I take the shit down there and I put it in the bins that you're supposed to put that put it in. I stopped eating meat like a week ago. Yeah. Jesus. What are some other things I could do? I got a backyard. I got a little backyard. Give me some tips. What are some things that people can do? The listeners who maybe are like me, like kind of grudgingly aware of the gradual destruction of the entire planet and the immense suffering that so many different creatures are going through right now because of our rather lazy, laxadaisical, supremely numb decisions. What are some things we could do, man? Please help us. Tell me some little things. Little things. Yeah. I'm not going to go to fucking Tamaria and let people have sex with my girlfriend who then has to ask permission to have a baby, but give me some little like, little like something before we get to that point. What's something I could do? Some little things. Yeah. I mean, I feel resistant to answering the question in that way. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Why? Because I don't think it's that helpful. Really? In a way, like, you know, yeah, I don't know. I mean, it feels to me more like the first thing is it's almost like the first thing is to just think about yourself as if you're like a cell in a planetary super organism. Okay. Like, you know, what would it mean to be like a really good functioning cell? You know, like, what would be your, you know, what would you want to do metabolically? Like, like, you know, how would you want to contribute, you know, that's pretty good. Yeah. That's pretty good. Yeah. But I think like it's more important from where we are now because the changes we can make individually are very small, you know, but if we were to act together collectively, the changes could be very big. Like, you know, you have 150,000 listeners or something. Yes. Well, maybe like you could challenge your listeners somehow, you know, around this stuff. Like if you've, if you integrated the value of it, and once again, I'm just, you know, mulling, right? Like, I don't know. Yeah, sure. You know, first of all, you know, that people become aware of what's happening. And then yeah, like maybe for instance, a non meat eating challenge for 200,000 listeners, that starts to be big. Right? Like if, you know, if 100,000 people stop eating meat, you could actually measure like the level of deforestation that would be averted and, you know, so I think we have to think in terms of scale. And I think that if we're going to make this leap into a survivable and ultimately thrive able planetary civilization, it's going to be like not just incremental and individual. It's going to be like exponential and scalable, you know, because we have like the manufacturing capacity. So for instance, like, you know, renewable energy, you know, like we know that, you know, we need to get to renewable energy in like 10 to 20 years. Yes. And that is going to require a lot of effort. Like that's a lot of people learning new skills and retraining and, you know, you know, maybe there's like websites like Mosaic is one where people can support solar projects. Maybe you can make a partnership with like Mosaic and see if people, you know, see if you could raise a million dollars over six months to support solar projects, accelerated or renewable farming, you know, permaculture farms and stuff like that. Jesus, man. I was just hoping you'd be like, here's a kind of soap you could start using. I'm going to raise a million dollars, but I like your brain. It's big. You think big. You think really big. That's cool. It's inspiring. Man. Yeah. It's a weird thing. I don't know why I think like that. Well, because you're an incarnation of what's that cool? That's pretty crazy. Is he still taught? Is it a he or a she or is it a hermaphroditic feathered serpent? What's the, I don't know. I have to ascribe gender to the thing, but I felt a little bit more he like, I guess, at the time. Is he still talking to you? It hasn't like, I almost stepped away. Maybe I, you know, I had a friend, a shaman friend who was like, oh, like you should have, you know, daily conversations and communications. This was now like almost 14 years ago. And I think I didn't want to go more in that direction. I wanted to go more in this direction. I wanted to be more grounded and sort of try to think about systemically what we need to do. Maybe in my future, I'll reconnect with more of these esoteric realms to be in like, like I'm a huge fan of Rudolf Steiner and I find his esoteric visionary philosophy to be like deeply healing and helpful. Are you familiar with Lynn Margolis? Yeah, yeah, yeah. She's my friends with her a little bit. Yeah. The field and stuff. Oh, okay. Oh, no, no, no. Sorry. Sorry. You joined Michael Cosmos. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. So, so, um, I'd like to explore more of the esoteric thing, but I needed to do this first. Um, somehow it felt like a mission or something. Well, yeah. But what happened to you was really like, I mean, it's kind of the like a nightmare situation to be visited by a deity, isn't it? Because after that happens, you can't be the same after that. You are, it's like a real mess. Like when you look at the archetype of this thing that you are probably have to be, you probably have to be kind of like, the problem is like, if you, like, if there was a strategy to try to convince people to change, probably the first rule would be like, well, don't tell them that you're a representative of a feathered serpent because they're people will just stop listening. I mean, and then the next one would be like, and don't tell them to be non-monogamous and then don't tell them. Don't tell them. It's like, no one wants to listen. It's, you know, but the first, but so, uh, it is what happened to you. Uh, I think is really scary. Uh, I was having a conversation with someone and he was saying to me, I really want to find out if there's something more than this. You know, I want to know if there is, if the higher states of consciousness or the stories you hear are true. And I said to him, I bet you don't really want to know that because when you find something like that out, it will force a crisis in your own life because you, you, you have to like, I mean, look at what did, what happened with Moses. He didn't want to do it. Right. Isn't that the story? He was kind of like, fuck this. Like a burning bush says something to him and I, what, didn't he not want to do it? Wasn't there something where he's like, no way, man, I'm not going to do that. Well, yeah, maybe I'm not a huge biblical scholar, but I think there was a thing where he's like, fuck that I'm not going to do, I think he had a speech impediment. I think he had, and that was a part of the craziness of the idea that some acacia, burning acacia would say to him, well, you're going to be the person that liberates my people. And he's like, basically, uh, like he has some terrible list or maybe he can't say W's or something, you know, something that you immediately would not take him that seriously. So and also as someone who takes psychedelics, you know, you don't want to be the guy who thinks he's Jesus. You know what I mean? You don't want to be that guy. Yeah. You don't want to be the savior of planet earth. You don't want to be that guy, you know, but that's not the vibe I get from you. I was a little nervous that when we had this conversation that I was thinking, oh shit, I hope he doesn't have like a Messiah complex or something. But the vibe I get from you is fantastic. Oh really? Yeah. You're very sweet and like, and it's inspiring. So um, but shit, man. Yeah. It's been really intense. Um, you know, and even though I basically dismissed it as much as I could, it still had a resonant like, um, effect. And I also feel on the one hand, I felt this slightly like martyrdom complex. Um, and then also almost as a negative corollary, a lot of my like own shadow material on my own, like, you know, uh, wounded parts, uh, also came to the fore. So it's been a very, um, it was a very difficult, um, 10 or 15 years. But I feel that I'm, you know, over the hump in certain respects. Over the hump of having met a God. Um, yeah. I mean, um, over the, the, the weight of kind of, uh, the, the burden in a way. And I think for me, like in a way, like the book, this new book was very much like carrying this, this burden and now at least I feel that I put it out there and I can't, I mean, I've done, done doing everything that I can to get people to pay attention. And I totally understand why they're, you know, would rather see alien two or five or whatever it is. I don't know which one, um, you know, but all I can really do is put it out there. And so having done that, you know, I feel a little bit alleviated of, of, of this burden, you know, but you didn't just do that. You've got a website called a Volvo. Yeah. Well, I mean, I, that was another. I mean, I had a whole enterprise that I started that, um, in a way I, I, I cracked a part, fell apart on me, which was, um, very interesting. Oh, it fell apart on you. I didn't know it's still, it's still going, but I had a falling out with my original business partner and didn't want to be, be working with him anymore. And I'd started this nonprofit. We were building these local community networks and so on. And, you know, some of the, some, because of the way I acted in certain respects and also a lot of projection that was put on me, that also kind of like fell apart. What do you mean, the way you acted? Uh, well, I mean, as I discussed in the book, there was, you know, kind of, um, I mean, because I was really kind of fascinated by this, I've liberated sexuality, you know, in, in some cases that was seen as acting in an exploitative way. And in retrospect, you know, I can see that I made mistakes, you know, in that, um, um, yeah, I mean, um. It's a lot of energy, man. When you get the big blast, you can easily fuck it up. I mean, it's like. Yeah, exactly. And, and, and, and it's the story is, uh, that people tend to fuck it up because it's like, it's just too much. It's too much, you know, they're like, uh, and you get, it's a bit of a burden, you know, because you, the idea is like, let's say that you came into contact with some kind of extra dimensional being that assigned some duty to you, this is the archetype, you know? Um, so then you become a translator, right? Now you're a translator. You met this thing and you have to translate what this thing told you into a language that humanity can understand so that you can actually like, um, allow the being that you made contact with to come into the world a little bit more. And so that's a terrible responsibility because if you fuck up that translation in any way, shape or form, then you can do harm. You can do harm, you know, like if this isn't Buddhism, people talk about how if you, you can actually mess things up a little bit. If you start spreading a message prior to having some internal purification or cleansing, it creates all kinds of turbulences and bumpinesses. And this is why you inevitably hear the story of some incredible spiritual leader being caught, you know, humping some, it's always humping. It's like inevitable, like, you know, like you end up like getting leaders in. What is that? I was just asking Alex and Allison Gray about this. It's like, it's always comes down to the sexual thing. Kind of like what you were talking about before. Yeah. I mean, I, I went through my own small scale version of it. I mean, um, you were kind of like without getting to, well, I mean, you know, I was, my breaking up in the head came out when I was 35 and that's what kind of color book came out when I was 40. So I was like, in my kind of middle age, suddenly I was, you know, the sort of psychedelic counterculture figure. Fuck yeah. And you know, in, in these worlds like Burning Man, that, that, you know, had a lot of exploration and also a lot of chaos and a lot of confusion, I think also. So, um, yeah, I mean, uh, non monogamy is complicated. Yeah. So, so, so, so is monogamy, but you can also only do what, what, what is right for you. Like, um, like, I couldn't, I couldn't unfortunately do the monogamy thing really. And you just ran into some problems with that. I don't know exactly what it was, but you just ran into some sex problems. Yeah. I mean, similar to what happens with the yoga people where, you know, people who are maybe part of the extended evolver community felt that I was using my power for sexual gain. And I probably was and I'm, I'm sorry about it. What do you mean by that? Like you were just like seducing people or people? Yeah. I mean, I think that also like, um, you know, I, I, I once, um, you know, it, it, I think it becomes addictive. Like once, you know, because I think I felt very, without even recognizing it, I felt, um, you know, like undernourished, uh, sexually when I was younger. And so suddenly I had an opportunity to have more experience and it became a little bit of like an addictive thing, compulsive, and also due to various aspects of my own, you know, early childhood, wounding and so on. You know, so, and that, that's another thing when I look at what's happening with the cocks and, and, and Trump and, and the alt right and all these men. I mean, there's, you know, I think an under underlying aspect of a lot of it is, is this deep wounding that, that men have around their sexuality. Right. You know, it's the same thing that happens with like, you know, they say that if someone's been through famine, then it's like permanently alters them. It like, I think it, it like permanently alter, if you've starved long enough, it like really is bad for you for your whole life. Yeah. Like it messes. And so like for some folks, they don't get to have the, like when they're younger, they're just completely sexually deprived and rejected and like, man, you know, it's this whole fucking like. Well, and that's a lot of like the, the Reddit and the 4chan community. Like there are all these articles about how like, there was a lot of men who felt like they couldn't really make it professionally because the whole work environment has changed and therefore they couldn't find girlfriends or loves or whatever. So they were living in their parents' basement, like on the computer all the time, developing this kind of misogynistic language onto them or connected to this kind of like pickup artist culture. And that actually became like a driving thing that, that helps power this Trump thing. So I mean, I, once again, I really think that dealing, you know, with human sexuality, approaching it in a much clearer, more objective and compassionate way is, you know, fundamentally necessary if we're going to get out of this circumstance. Right. So that's why it's, it's a thread in the book and why you can't, you know, like Paul Hawken just wrote this book, Draw Down, which is all about, it covers a lot of the same ground as my book in terms of like ways to remove CO2 and, you know, climate, you know, address climate change and, you know, reforest and bioremediate and all that stuff is really, really necessary. But I think there's other levels of a paradigm shift that are going to have to occur if we're going to come back into balance and actually survive into the future. And, you know, the, you know, the area of sexuality is one of them. And also the area of spirituality and the nihilism that people feel about sort of the meaninglessness of life. Yeah. Sure. I mean, this is, I'm just thinking of like Daniel Penchback, 40. I was reading, man, I like, you are blowing my mind, man. And like, you're like, yeah, you're a burning man. It's like, you're like Elvis or something, right? And there's, you, I get it. You, wow, you kind of were like, holy shit, were you like a co-leader for a second? Kind of like, did you become like a, a cult leader for a moment? Would you consider yourself that? Let me just, I don't mean that in an offensive way. I mean, I consider that like a compliment in a lot of ways, but like, you know what I mean? Like, here you are, this charismatic, brilliant, almost messianic, your story, you've, you've channeled an entity that wants you to save the world. You've become this psychedelic luminary. You've become in one of the reviews of a series of essays you put together. They called you, are Timothy Leary, you, you. So here you are, this, this like, and you, a, a, a, a vulva happens and I signed up for it. What was it? Here you are, the nucleus of all of this, experiencing this like. Yeah. I mean, I, I do think in many ways I was actually doing the right thing because I was really my whole goal. Like, you know, when I started Evolver, I never even created my own website. Like I created reality sandwich. Like I really believe that it wasn't about me, that there needed to be like a cultural movement, you know. So, and, and I really saw that what I wanted to do was empower other people, you know, like we published maybe a thousand writers or more through the, many of them ever published before through reality sandwich and then through the spore thing. The idea was to empower local, you know, volunteers to become community leaders. And in many cases it was women, which I was really proud of also. And then I edited this book series of all of our editions, you know, so I really put my own creative career on hold in a way and, and really wasn't trying to put myself forward at all. I was almost trying to hold space for this larger movement. And actually, in retrospect, it's hard not to regret that because it was very costly on a lot of levels. Oh, wow. Wow. What a great experiment though. What a great experiment. How cool. I mean, you are a rippler and you are, you are, this is just the way that you, you operate is like you're, you want to, you're like doing some kind of experiment or something. You're trying to transform the world in a very positive way. And it's tricky to do that and it's dangerous to do it. And, and there's blowbacks and backfires and that should be expected, right? Exactly. Yeah. What are you up against, you know? Up against the glowing orb. Did you see the pictures of the fucking orb? Like you look at that and you're like, really, this looks like, this looks like something in one of the Jack Chick tracks, you know, like, you know, Jack Chick, the, you've seen those little biblical comic books that they leave around. You know, it looks like a draw. Like if someone was drawing, it's unbelievable. It's unbelievable. They're like, you know, let's just put our hands on them. They're, they're that disconnected. There's one, one of two possibilities. One, they're that disconnected from the way people view them. And they just think that's like, just a normal thing to do is to like, put your hand on a glowing orb after making a $300,000, $300 billion, $300 billion arms deal. Or the other thing is they're trolling us. Like they're like, let's just fuck with them. Let's freak them out. I think it must be the first. Or, or they're not quite human. They're also possessed by just archetypal forces. And I think that there's like, like Steve Bannon has actually in interviews compared himself favorably, like Darth Vader and Satan. Yes. You know, so there's, there, there really does seem to be like an archetypal, you know, thing happening, like, like these archetypes are just moving through our world and they take these human forms, you know, and that's what these guys represent. They're, they're, they're like empty vessels, you know, for this, what Steiner would talk about is like an aromatic energy to come through. Oh God, I hope. I mean, that too. I just so want them to be like bumbling dopes who get like, who, you know, just, just end up their hubris causes them to be eventually the dream is, did you see Jonathan Zapp wrote these wonderful articles in reality, sandwich about how the Trump, Trump apocalypse reveals that the world is actually like a, like a matrix. Oh yeah, I saw that. Yes. Yes. Yeah. I mean, I found those to be really profoundly satisfying because there is like, there's, there's a level, this really does feel like almost like a dream reality that's unfolding. I mean, even the names, you know, like Trump and the fact that he trumped everything, you know, or doing the, you're telling, I've been saying this on stage, like, you know, Rex, Rex Tillerson is the secretary of state. So if you shorten Rex Tillerson's name, what do you get? You get T Rex, you know, I mean, how, what's that weiner? I mean, how is this, you know, it really feels like, you know, it's giving us, it's like a tell from the universe that's telling us that this is actually like a dream projection or the psyche that all of it or it feels like if there is a programmer, right, then it feels like his kid has somehow snuck in to his office and is starting to do like cheesy shit, like a 12 year old boy would do, I will make him a T Rex. Yeah, that's funny. Oh, the guy who shows is the guy who shows dick pics, a column weiner. It's unbelievable. It's cheesy is what it is. There's a very interesting, no waddle kind of like shaman teacher, this guy Sergio Magana, and he's written these books like, you know, in a way like, well, I guess in retrospect, I've mixed feelings about even, you know, I put some I put attention on the 2012 thing, although I feel that like, it was like almost like people really almost deliberately misunderstood what I was saying or what I was focusing on. I never thought it was going to be like an instant, right, catalytic, everything would change, you know, but, but, you know, kind of an invitation maybe from the cosmos for a change. But Magana is somebody who's trained like these Aztec and the waddle lineage, and he's putting out this idea that 2012 to 2021 are actually the sort of in between state between the like the fourth world and the fifth world, or the age of the fifth son and age of the sixth son, and according to his books, we're transitioning from what he talks about as a son of light to a son of darkness. And essentially, when during the son of light, it's all about rationality and reason and materiality and sort of daylight clarity. And as you go into the son of night, it becomes more about the psyche, more about like the dreamlike reality becomes more dreamlike, more psychically malleable. And I don't know, there's something about that that feels very resonant. I'll tell you, before you came over when I drew as I do for my guests, a tarot card to figure out what we were going to talk about, I got the sun. So yeah, I get it, man. And, and, and, and I do think that the 2012 was the, they were, it's just to me so amazing that people are like, nah, 2012, the aliens didn't come, I guess you were wrong. But it's like, are you fucking kidding me? These people called it, you know, they called it, like, if you look at the world in 2005, and before versus 2012 and after, those are different worlds, man, when we see what's happening. And the fact that these people pre internet, pre tech, pre our current technology, pre electricity, we're able to predict a time in human history where things were radically changing is mind bending. How, how did they do that? That's, they didn't know, they didn't, there were no satellites orbiting the planet. They weren't doing projections of population growth through the years. They just intuited somehow, or they had some mathematical way of understanding time to know that right around this period is where the shift would happen. I mean, I actually like a lot of people have focused on like Terrence McKenna and time wave zero, but I actually feel that Hose Arguellis is understanding of the mathematics of the Mayan calendar is like far more profound and significant. There's a book he wrote called Earth Ascending, where he looks at these really unbelievably beautiful harmonic relationships between like the I Ching and the Mayan calendar, the Zulcan. And it really does suggest that there's some kind of, yeah, like harmonic underpinning to this that they understood that it was really like a profound, a sacred science. Yeah. Well, they were, I mean, yeah, they were dead on. Like this is, this is for sure. You know, if you look back, oh God, you know, the stories that go back 20,000. So, okay, yeah, this is it. So I've interviewed people from Singularity University and had them talk about the Singularity. The way they put it is one day will equal 20,000 years of human progress. That's the essentially what we're heading towards. So to understand what that means, if you go back 20,000 years and ask somebody to predict what 20,000 years in the future is going to look like, they're not going to be able to make any predictions at all based on what's happening, right there. I think they just maybe just started riding horses. It depends on whether you, which history of the earth you subscribe to, you know, I don't know. Maybe they were Atlanteans or whatever. But the essence of it is that the thing that we are in the very beginning of, that seems to be very accurately predicted by calling it December 21st, 2012, is so, so spectacular that we, I think in the next three years, we're going to see something go down. It's like probably AI waking up, something like that. I don't know. It may be an alien visitation. You've heard about these bursts that people are picking up from, what do they call it? The, you know, I'm talking about, you gotta know I'm talking about. There's some kind of like electrical impulses that people have started picking up. God damn it. Hang on, let me pause it and I'll find it for you. Here, this is actually from a, not from a fake news site, but it's still, this is everywhere. It's called fast radio bursts have been being picked up. And essentially, like no one really knows what these fucking things are. And they're picking up these things recently. And people are saying that it's potentially some kind of alien transmission or something coming out of a massive spaceship or something being used to power light sales. That's interesting. But I mean, you know, in the 2012 book, I talked at great length about the crop circles. And you think those are real? I think that some of them are not being made by human beings because they've had, even like biophysicists have studied what happens to the crops in the pattern. And they've basically determined that it couldn't be done just by people pushing them down. So it's some type of energy projection, maybe from above that causes the, you know, the crops to change direction. Smart way to communicate with something, identify its food source and then put your messages into the food source kind of makes sense. Yeah. Well, on many levels, because they're public signs, like they can't be copyrighted or obscured. Like once they're in the public domain, they're just out there. And yeah, I think that that's, could be part of what unfolds. Maybe who knows? It's, it's just, it's going to be something so it's, you know, predicting is probably impossible. I just think it's going to be something so astounding. But, but, but then I would also question that because in a way, once again, like when I wrote the last book, I could have gotten more down that avenue, but then I was like, you know what, like maybe whatever is out there really can only deal with us or, or, you know, connect with us when we've made an evolutionary jump, at least showing that we're going in the right direction. So that would be like, how do we take care of our planet? Like, you know, Buckminster Fuller wrote Operation Spaceship Earth, you know, it's like, in a sense, we can look at our situation where like the crew of this incredible spaceship and we've woken up and the spaceship works like perfectly, like it has everything we need to be happy, except an instruction manual and operating manual. So we're like tearing it apart instead of like figuring out how to make it operate. And, you know, so, so, yeah. So, so, you know, even at this late date, if, if we redirect what we're doing as a species, we could, you know, really create a garden utopian scenario. And technology would be it would be, you know, would be used in the service of that, we wouldn't be trying to like, I mean, they're, you know, I think we have to make that's the thing. It's like part of our problem is that our culture is very dualistic. And, you know, there are things that we have to, we have to make distinctions in terms of types of technologies that are helpful and types that could be really destructive, like geoengineering, changing the whole climate of the planet by pouring sulfur particles into the upper atmosphere could be, it sounds extremely horrible to me, like just long-term negative consequences. But, you know, using drones to replant forests, which I have a friend who started a company and they're using, they have drones that can plant like millions of trees in like a day. How does that work? You just have drones that are planting seeds, you know, that, you know, they're planting whole forests. Wow. Really? Yeah. What are they just like they roll? Are they like rumbas or something? Or how does that even look? I don't know. It's, I think the car, there's a company called biocarbon geoengineering or biocarbon engineering. We can look it up. But anyway, yeah. So, so stuff like that or bio, you know, biochar, which is essentially they figured out that in the Amazon, the indigenous people were actually really stewards of the environment. And the soil of the jungle is actually quite fragile. And they would do this slow burning process with organic matter that would ultimately create like a carbon rich tilt, which would replenish the soil. So now we figured out how to do that industrially. So we can take organic matter, burn it in these gasifiers, it actually takes CO2 back into the atmosphere, into the soil, and actually can be used to replenish the world's top soil. Wow. So, you know, stuff like that, we can look at different sustainable technologies that can be scaled up really rapidly to restore a lot of the damage. I mean, there's some, obviously, there's some areas that are extremely difficult to address, like ocean acidification and what's happening to the coral reefs. But, you know, once I think that we really turn our creative focus in this direction and eat, you know, and we, in a way, we have to like, and that's one of the things, you know, I was hoping with the book is that we're in this kind of people in this kind of paralysis where they, they're too scared to look at the problems and to try to think through them. But, you know, I really think that we need to get beyond that state because, you know, we are very creative. And even, which is probably going to happen, we're probably going to lose the coastal cities, we're probably going to see glacier melts and, and, you know, 50 feet of sea level rise in the century or something like that. But, but, you know, even if we lost 100 feet, that's only 5% of the Earth's landmass. So actually, there's still plenty of room for humans to build cities that could even be designed in a way that's, that's more holistic and regenerative. You know, so, so, you know, it's Yeah, man. But I mean, if we're talking about that, Jesus Christ, that, that future is like the future where like refugees are having to leave their, the cities and are like going, I don't know, where and the Jesus Christ, man. But once again, it's always, it's always a question of how you choose to look at things. I mean, so for instance, like in the book, I talk about this Stanford engineer who's created these things called Regen villages. So they're modular, mass-producible housing units that have composting and aquaponics and renewable energy systems built into them. So essentially, rather than refugees just being dependent in these camps, where they're, you know, forced to take aid, you could have self-sufficient communities that are created using things like Regen villages and so on. You know, this is what I, this is what I like about your POV, man. It's not naive. It's, I think it's pragmatic and it's, one thing's for certain. If we don't believe that there is a chance to do something to make things better, then that's it. We are, we're done. We're done. Absolutely. And we're not, we're not taking that chance. We're not, we're not using our creative capacity to think through the crisis. And I spent 10 years trying to do that with this book and I can't get people to take six hours to have the exploration with me. Well, because we feel terrible. I mean, like it's, so get over it. We have to get through that where it's only going to get worse unless, unless we, you know, think, you know, use our intellect, our general capacity to, you know, we're all, I think many people have great intelligence and creativity and we're using it to thwart ourselves in a way, you know, you know, and then think about also the potential value of psychedelics, like everything we're learning about psychedelics for treating like trauma or depression, you know, so like, you know, what's happening now? I mean, basically from my perspective, Trump and Brexit are both caused by already biological change, by climate change, because Syria refugee crisis is, was largely caused by a big drought there, which then destabilized Europe, which scared England, which led to this fear of refugees and immigrants, which, you know, fed the Trump thing and so on. You know, so, so, you know, we're going to be dealing over the next decades as the coastal flooding happens with tens of millions, not hundreds of millions of environmental refugees. You know, what are we going to do? You know, if we could potentially use tools like MDMA so that they can like process their trauma and be more better assimilated into whatever societies they're moving into, like that's, that could be a really powerful positive tool. I mean, I love the idea of some kind of like special like MDMA and infusing like pre precursors to like entering into a society, you have to hang out at like an MDMA camp or ayahuasca. I mean, I last time I did ayahuasca, I had a vision of like, you know, these huge like vertical hot houses in every city of the world, just just growing, growing tons of it, you know, so that people can, you know, have the capacity to work through their stuff and reach a more evolved state of consciousness. I love it. You know, this is something I've been here. This is really far out, man. But like, and some, I thought at the Ram Dass retreat, I was talking to someone who was saying that it's so weird, but that like, there's two timelines that are separating right now. And one of the timelines is a timeline where society becomes completely technological. And the other timeline is a timeline where people go more into their hearts. That's the one we're in right now. We're in the, as she put it, a very dank timeline. And that this turbulence that we're experiencing is actually these two ships, it's temporal ships separating from each other and the Trump and all the trouble he's running into and all the blowback that's happening as people react to that attempt at running a government in this old school way is an indication of these two timelines moving apart because here wasn't, you know, here this thing happened, which at another time in human history, Trump wouldn't, may not, wouldn't have been met with the kind of like ferocious resistance that he's being met with. Like a person like that just gets into power and you're like, yeah, that's just who's the, that's the guy. That's the guy, I guess. That's the guy now, but there wouldn't be marches. There wouldn't be this infinite, endless, constant blowback to everything that he does, even though he's like succeeding. So that turbulence is a result of these two timelines separating. And I think that the more that I allow myself to live in the pinchback universe of these hot houses and no, I can feel it, man. I can feel it. Like the more we even just allow ourselves to imagine it, I've seen it on mushrooms. I've seen it through psychedelics, the potential and like is the more that we like let ourselves live in that realm of possibility, then it's like we steer the ship in that direction, right? Exactly. That's it. Yeah. Oh, I like it. It's cool. It's cool, man. I'm in. I'm in. I'm going to start a biofarm. I don't know what it is, but I'm going to do it. I guess every farm's a biofarm. Well, Daniel, thank you so much, man. You're inspiring. This has been a wonderful conversation. You're a transformer. And I think people are going to want to find you. What do you have? Do you have a show? A show? It's not shows. I'm sorry. Yeah. I mean, I have my own little podcast, How Soon Is Now on iTunes.

It is I, Dee Trussell, and you have tuned in to the Dunkin' Trestle family, our podcast. A podcast emanating from deep within the dream that you call your own, your own existence. Exist, exist, exist, exist. We're all in dreams, baby. Seriously, well, I don't know. But I have been reading this book that is blowing my mind. It's called The Tibetan Yoga of Dream, Dreaming and Sleep. And it's so psychedelic, and it sneaks up on you. It kind of pounces on you, but I haven't got, I'm scared to keep reading it, actually, because it produces such a, I don't know how to describe it, kind of psychedelic effect. Gary, can you keep it down please? I'm recording. Jesus. Like, you know, reading Terrence McKenna, if you haven't read Terrence McKenna, you should. Sometimes, in some of his best essays, you just start feeling like you're tripping, just because he's so good at describing. Gary, seriously, man? Sorry, guys, my time duct is leaking again. Getting a repair. And getting, and getting, and getting, and getting, and getting. Anyway, this book points out ways of looking at the world and it does it in a pretty surgical way. So the idea is, I mean, and when I say the idea, I mean, I'm in chapter two or three, baby. But the concept is similar to a concept I heard once about lucid dreaming. You set your alarm for every hour. And any time your alarm goes off, you think to yourself, I'm not dreaming. I'm not dreaming. And then when you're in a dream, because you've sort of trained yourself to on the hour, every hour, remind yourself you're not dreaming, in the dream of like, holy shit, I'm in a dream. And then you can do whatever, fly, fuck 1,000 movie stars, turn into an octopus, suck your own nipples, drink milk from your toes, whatever it is you're into, that's what you could do. And now here's Gary, my time duct repairman, with his song about dreams. When you have a lucid dream, you can do most anything. You can turn and do an octopus and suck up on your feet. Put some lipstick on your neighbor's doll. Put a wedding ring upon her paw. Have a three-way with big foot on your honeymoon. All right, thanks, Gary. That's enough. Thank you. That was Gary, my time duct repairman, everybody. I think he's got an album coming out. Definitely don't buy it. The point is, this book, the point this book makes, is that instead of sort of looking at your watch and thinking, I'm not in a dream, you basically start doing the opposite. So you start thinking like, oh, actually I am in a dream. Everything is kind of like a dream. I'm just a little dream and piggy floating through an aquarium of illusion, which is actually the thing I thought was reality. And if you really look deeply into things, you will kind of notice from time to time that stuff just doesn't seem quite real. Something seems strange off. I guess you could say that's what simulation theory is. Like, simulation theory is just a modern version of the idea that everything is an illusion, except now we're using technological terms. But what I have noticed is that if I apply this when I'm getting butthurt, I don't get quite as butthurt. And also, here's what's really interesting. If you start imagining you're in a dream, it really brings you into the present moment. Like, things get real clear and vivid because you are in a fucking dream. If you're up in your head, it's called daydreaming. That's what they call it. You're dreaming in the day. So it's an interesting thing that apparently, eventually, it causes some form of lucid dreaming. But I haven't experienced that yet. But definitely it's helping me when I can feel that deep inner. Dammit, Gary. There's still a temporal distortion in here, man. You said you would have this fixed by the time I recorded this. It's taking all day. All right, well, we got a great podcast. Come on, man. Just hit it. Turn it on and off. Turn it on and off. And then all dinner. It is just, man, mom, fuck off, you're great. Sorry for snapping at you, Gary. Seems like we got at least a temporary, stable time field. So while we've got that, we're going to do some quick business. And then we're going to jump into this podcast with one of the great Buddhist scholars living today, Bob Thurman.

My lovely children. I'm tired. But in the best way I've ever been tired in my life, having a baby is so amazing. And I'm not going to rave about it yet. But I am at some point. I've got to get off my chest. I've just never experienced anything as psychedelic as being a dad. And I blasted myself on pretty much every psychedelic currently in existence. I missed a couple. I know there's some weird more than a couple. I mean, there's a bunch of, you know, the experimental chemicals out there and various strange toad venom. Excuse me, that's actually my ass in the chair. It's something I would never be so rude as to flatulate on my podcast. Just so you all know that. And also if it's illegal now, because the podcast in commission finds you $500 every time you do it for the podcasters out there listening, definitely don't do that. Tomorrow I am headed to Maui for the Ramdas spring retreat. I'm bringing the baby and obviously my wonderful wife. So it's going to be pretty intense. We've got a essentially like a gypsy sized caravan of various things that you need for a baby. You can't just travel with a baby like you can for yourself. You need creams, wipes, temperate gels, combing, lathes, you need oils, coconut creams, diapers, various ear canal protectors, nose softeners. And you also need Prince Dandy's lady feet conditioning soap and nail files, trimmers of monkeys and golden cages. And of course, a prodding cane to get the wise men off because we just keep getting bugged by wise men. And I love the gifts we've been getting, but we need a break. So hopefully there won't be any at the airport. We just want to hop on the plane with the baby and get to Maui. And I can't wait. And because I'm leaving for this thing, I've been working nonstop on this other thing that I can't even talk about. So I'm bleary right now. I'm tired in the most incredible way. And basically, fortunately for us, we've purchased one of those new Grinarian leather levitation stasis field cubes that will put the baby in stasis for the length of the flight. Apparently for the babies, it just seems like just a click and you're there. But it doesn't work for humans. That is the chair I'm telling you. So that's going to be awesome. And if you want to watch live streams of the various teachers and kirtans and all the stuff that happens at the retreat podcast, I'm going to be doing with some of the folks at the retreats and live podcast. Then head over to ramdas.org forward slash wisdom of emptiness. I'm going to have a link at duckatrustle.com. But yeah, go there and you can watch some of the cool events that are happening at the retreat. My dear loves, if you are interested in commercial free episodes of the DTFH, and my apologies, I know this episode has one more than I usually have. Go to patreon.com forward slash DTFH. The interview with Bob is there commercial free. So you don't have to have the flow of the conversation disrupted by my livelihood. And you've got two hours to get that necronomicon shut before demons eat your grandmother. There isn't time to go out for contact lenses in this situation. It's happening all across this beautiful country. This episode of the DTFH is brought to you by simple contacts. Do you really want to spend two hours in traffic driving to the optometrist when you could be making love to deities, devas, and demigods in the ethereal planes that surround this material realm? Here's how simple contacts works. And it's very simple. You take a quick self-guided vision test from your phone or your computer. It's reviewed by a licensed doctor in 24 hours. And if your vision hasn't changed, you receive a renewed prescription and reorder your brand of contacts. It's simple. You can skip the office visit, but not the care. Simple contacts offers every brand of lenses, and their prices are unbeatable. Plus, the prescription is just $20. Compare that with an annual appointment, which can be up to $200 without insurance. Shipping is free. And best of all, my listeners get $20 off their first simple contacts order. To save $20 on your lenses, just go to simplecontacts.com Ford slash Duncan 20. That's simplecontacts.com Ford slash Duncan 20. This isn't a replacement for your periodic full eye health exam. And simple contacts only tests that the current prescription still helps you see 2020 and renew that prescription. They don't write completely new prescriptions or examine eye health. There's lots of other stuff there, too, for you to enjoy. And when I get around to it, I'm going to put a live video of the interview with Mr. Robert Thurman that he's amazing. And I know I've already on Patreon, some people got annoyed because he talked about politics. And I know I don't usually talk about politics on the DTFH, but I must say that he really did inspire me and made me realize how cynical I've become. And I think a lot of us have become, when it comes to politics in the United States and just this general sense of like, fuck, man, what can we do? But he proposed an idea that actually seems really brilliant. And I hope that those of you who get upset by political talk or political talk that doesn't quite match the way you see the world can look through that to a bigger idea that folks like Bob are really good at putting out there, which is that we can do just about anything. And we could certainly sort of transcend the normal ways of making shit happen in this world, particularly the ways that involve violence or anger or war, and that there is sort of a possibility for humans to have a kind of love revolution as absolutely cheesy and hip-fied as that may, damn it, this is, I swear to God, it's just me moving in this chair, swear to God. I don't know why I feel like I have to defend myself here. I'm not in the court. One of the many things I love about Bob is that he doesn't fit into the stereotypical notion of what a great Buddhist scholar might be like. I don't know if you have an idea of what that looks like, but probably if someone's like, oh, this is one of the Dalai Lama's best friends, you would maybe some images of what that would look like might pop into your mind, something maybe, I don't know, tranquil in a specific way. Or once somebody said something to me that really stuck in my craw, they said, well, most people just practice passive hipster Buddhism. It really bug me because my experience with Buddhism has not been passive at all. It's sort of the opposite of Pacificity, though I do understand why people, when they haven't looked deeply into Eastern traditions, can get it into their heads that the Eastern traditions involve a kind of like detachment from the normal stuff people have to be worried about, like voting and making shit happen and activism. Even though there's case after case of Buddhists being great activists, some folks don't just have this weird idea of what Buddhism is. And I love this conversation with Bob because the first part is fiery politics. And it's someone who's very passionate about the world using his brilliant mind to try to innovate a way to rebalance and reharmonize things, which I think every single one of us wants, regardless of what side of the fucking thing you're on. We all want to be happy. We all want to figure out ways to be more loving. We all want to figure out ways to be kinder to each other. And I think every single one of us would love a day where the news wasn't blowing out endless stories of the embarrassing drama that seems to have possessed our political system. So it was really, to me, it was quite enlivening to chat with Bob. And the last part, we do talk about Buddhism. And in his spectacularly precise and vibrant way, he really did a great job of breaking down the basics. And so I hope that you will stick it out if you find yourself getting a little woozy from political talk. You know, I don't usually do it on the show, but Bob Thurman is a very special human. And he is an exception to the rule, if you ask me. Oh, and one last spirituality plug before I forget. The person I study meditation with, David Nickturn, is going to be doing a teacher training program at the Samarasah Yoga Studio, which is a really nice place. If you live on the East Side, it's a beautiful Liliyoga studio. He's going to be doing a teacher training, a mindfulness teacher training. So if you want to learn the basics of mindfulness and sort of a technique to share that with people, he is going to be teaching that at Samarasah. The links will be at dunkintrussell.com. And I'm going to do an interview with him on that Friday night. All right, let's do this. Sorry for all the ads and the yapping and the babbling. I like to talk, but I'm taking next week off, because I'm heading to this retreat. So there will be no DTFH next week. There's going to be a little pause. And then we'll be right back at it. Now, without further ado, today's esteemed guest is a recognized worldwide authority on religion and spirituality, Asian history, world philosophy, Buddhist science, Indo-Tibetan Buddhism, and his holiness, the Dalai Lama, is friends with him. He's an advocate of the relevance of Buddhist ideas in our daily lives. And he was named one-of-time magazine's 25 most influential Americans. He's also been profiled by The New York Times and People Magazine. Those are some incredible credits. But man, just hanging out with this guy for a little bit of time could change your life for the better. He's the real deal. And I can't believe I got to have him on the show. So please, everyone, welcome to the Duggar Trussell Family Hour podcast, The Great Bob Thurman. It's really good to see you. Great to see you. I'm disappointed. I thought you were going to be at the Ramdas retreat for some reason. Yeah, I am. But I'm going on the 29th. I'm going on the 30th, May 1st. I reach there. Oh, I see. Great. It's from May 1st to May 6th. I'll get to see you in person there. That's great. Oh, you're coming too? Great. Wonderful. I'll be there. We had a close Ramdas, had a close call. But he's better now, they say. Yes, he's better now. I'm very relieved. I am too. But this is something that is occurring to me that I guess must happen every generation, is that at some point, the teachers, they die. And they do. And then what happens? I was wondering, is there always a sense when this phase happens of no one really being quite ready for that eventuality to happen and not knowing what to do? Yeah, that can be. The other day, I did some events at Tibet House with KD. Yes. And he read a beautiful thing from the life of Shabkar, who was a great Tibetan yogi of the 18th century. And Shabkar was mourning and belly aching about his guru was gone, and he was sitting on the top of a mountain. He was looking sad. Where's my guru? Oh, he used to be with me. And then he sees a cloud formation on top of the mountain where the guru used to live. And then on top of that, there's the guru, like Yoda in the Star Wars, in a body of light. And then the guru scolds him and says, look, I'm with you all the time. I'm in your heart. And whenever you go everywhere and teach or meditate, whatever you do, I'm there with you. So stop. So go help other beings and stop belly aching. Right. So KD gets very, he belly aches a lot about Baba Maraji not being there. Yes. So he really liked that one that was also happening in 18th century Tibet on the part of Shabkar, the famous yogi. He was very happy. So I think that's a natural thing. We're going to die. But even George Lucas has it in Star Wars. Yoda is still there. Right. If the great gurus are still there and not in their meat puppet body, but Ramdas called the meat puppet, right? Right. Yes. That's good. Well, that is good. And I believe that, though. It's just easier when they're, as Annie Lamott puts it, when they're there with a skin on, because we could see them and you could do podcasts with them. That's right. But once they're, if they do a good job, then we're ready for the, then you, the younger generation, will be ready for the transition and be ready to take up the burden. And it'll be good. The Dalai Lama just wrote a book calling for revolution, spiritual revolution, by the young. He's saying that the older generation, business as usual by the older generation is wrecking the planet on which they're going to have to leave their lives. So they should rebel now. And I'm all for them, too, that 13-year-old girl in Sweden, she's rebelling. She's suing the Swedish government for wrecking the place. Yes. I like that. I think that's totally great. And I think something like that has to happen in our country in this next election. We have to overthrow the petroleum barons who are ruining everything. And they won't, they're in every, they have their fingers in everything, you know? The food is made out of petroleum, the fertilizer's out of petroleum, you know? They're doing, they're just wrecking it with everything. And they refuse to give up. It's very easy to switch everybody over to renewable everything, and they will do it. Well, you know, this is one of the weird realizations I had some time ago. I was doing an interview at, oh gosh, where were we? We were at a university like Caltech or something. And they're working on solar panels. And they're working on these incredible solar panels. Oh, great. But guess who was funding it? One of the big oil companies. And I said, what is happening here, that the oil companies are funding an existential threat to selling oil. And his response was, oh, it's compartmentalized. They're so big that they have sections that are antithetical to the general supposition that every single person working there is evil or crazy or whatever you want to call it. When the really rotten thing is, it's a hive within which there seems to be counterbalance to the insanity. And so you don't, this frustrates me, because I like to shake my fist at the entire thing. And then when you realize it's sort of broken up into clusters of people in there who want it to be better. So how do we, this is where it gets really wild. I don't know. But that's a good thing, because I also meet with oil executives. And I think that thing in Caltech is funded by BP, British Petroleum. Yes. The European ones, Royal Dutch Shell out of the Netherlands and British Petroleum, they're way, and the statuels in Norway, they are better than the American companies. The Americans are stubbornly not doing that. But the European ones are beginning to do, however, even the European ones are doing it too slowly. Because the bulk of their research and the R&D money is spent on finding more of the fricking oil, which is to stranded assets. They'll never be able to burn it. If they put that level of money, I always tell them, look, it's not antithetical for you to make panels and things. That's where you should shift. And then you'll be kings of the renewable. Just like now you're kings of the oil. Then you'll be kings of the renewable. And that's what Norway is doing now. Norway has divested from all oil companies, even though they sell plenty of gas and oil from their North Sea wells, and they are 100% renewable in Norway. And that's what they should do. And then they'll be way ahead of the curve is what it is. But Bill McKibben, the great Bill McKibben, he wrote recently that the economics of the renewables make it a no-brainer that it's going to win out. The only problem in where activism we still need, the fish shaking we still need to do, and the fish shaking has to do with stopping the delaying tactics on the part of the salesman, the business side in the oil industry, where they think they act like they're going to keep selling that shit forever. Right. That's where activism, because in that delay, could be delete, could be one degree centigrade. It could result in a one degree centigrade overage of where we can get if we move faster. Of course, if Al Gore, who was elected president, had been president, instead of having it stolen in Florida by the brown shirts, then we sure would have been way ahead by now. But we still it's not too late, according to McKibben, that great article, New York Review of Books, about two months ago. Al Gore says the same thing. Well, I mean, if it's too late, it's too late. But we still. No, it isn't, it isn't, it isn't too late. I think that I don't think it's too late. I guess what I was trying to say is this revolution that you're talking about, I think that the young people are feeling this. And in a similar fashion to the sense of what are we going to do when the gurus die, I think the young people are starting to get a feeling of realizing that, well, as they say, I don't know if you've ever heard this saying, revolution doesn't happen at the cocktail table. Revolution doesn't happen at cocktail parties. And that it's not a convenient thing to have a revolution. And you don't get to have a comfortable revolution. And there's no such thing as that. That in fact, it's going to require such a monumental shift, not just an exterior shift, but an interior shift as well, that it's daunting for anyone to consider. So how do you take, I mean, it's, to me, being in the middle of the whole thing, age-wise, and knowing that, yeah, I agree with you. And I think we're all sensing that, well, at some point, this game we're playing in the United States, imagining that people are listening to us as a democracy, it's got to end. And when it ends, where we sort of just wake up to the truth, like that George Carlin joke, they call it the American dream because you got to be asleep to believe in it. That's a great one. I like that. I didn't hear that before. That's a good one. But what does Buddhist revolution look like? Well, it looks like what we're doing. That's it. The Buddhist revolution had been slower over history. And it's the inner revolution, of course. And it has, but it has had a huge effect externally. Why do you think the Europeans were able to conquer India when Alexander the Great got his ass handed to him? The Indians had a cavalry of elephants with archers on top, like in the Lord of the Rings. Remember those guys, the bad guys? That was the Indian cavalry, and the Macedonian phalanx could not deal with it. And Alexander was killed by arrows fired from the back of an elephant from a longbow, longbow archers who could rapid fire. It wasn't crankbowl, longbow. And big iron, and also India had a lot of iron. It has a lot of iron. And the Persians never conquered India in those days. But then finally, by the time of first the Muslim invasions from Iran and Tajikistan and so forth, around 1,000 years ago, and then the European invasions about 500 years ago, then they lost. But that's because Buddhism had made the country more peaceful. The Buddhist revolution has been going on for several thousand years slowly. And it has made different civilizations more gentle, more meditative, more kind, more happy. But then they will help raise less happy, more aggressive people. But now we've reached a moment in history where we have to have a fast one. And it's also global. And there's no one left who's going to be more aggressive. Everybody has to be more peaceful and more kind. And that's what our revolution is going to be about. Therefore, it is very doable. It's not, you know, the Russian revolution, American, French, were very violent. And therefore, they brought about where the rulers maintained violence of the three. The American one was maybe the best because of our natural blessedness of a nature here. And we were only really badly violent to the blacks and to the Indians. And we didn't try to aggress the whole world because we had enough going on here. Until after World War II, we got a little bit colonial. But otherwise, actually, my old history teacher in high school used to say it was the Philippine War. Teddy Roosevelt time, we became more colonial around that time. We had like the first Vietnam was in the Philippines, where we encouraged the Filipinos to throw off the Spaniards. And then we jumped in on top of it. We moved into the governor's mansion of the Spanish mansions. We moved in instead of letting, you know, they weren't ready for democracy sort of routine. Yep. Anyway, now it's going to be a unique in history because it's global and it's going to be peaceful. It has to be. And the guys who are still into weapons and war and stuff, you know, Putin, our own Defense Department, you know, the Pakistanis, the Iranians, the Chinese, they're doing it. They just go bankrupt because they can't use those weapons because their blowback is instant. Right. You launched a nuclear, I had a dream. That's the other day. I really, it was a great dream. And it's not very Buddhist, but shall I tell you my dream? Please. And I only believe it, of course, because I was asleep. Thank you, George. But in the dream, I was with Putin in the Kremlin. And it was a nice living room sort of thing. And he had a whole bunch of, he didn't have a football. He had a whole wall panel of buttons, the electronic button. Sure. And he was gloating. The dream started that I remember anyway. And he was gloating at me because he had pressed a bunch of buttons. It was going to wipe out New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, et cetera. Yes. And I said, I was saying to him, he was gloating. And I said, hey, you're crazy. At least you can get those cities, but they're going to blast you because they have silos and submarines. So you're committing suicide. What are you doing? Right. He said, no, no. He said, I don't mind. They're just going to knock out Moscow and Petersburg. And those people in Moscow and Petersburg, they don't like me anyway. Oh, Jesus. My backing is all out in the country. So I'm in a bunker somewhere, so I don't care. And he was laughing and gloating. So I was in the dream. I was calculating, how can I get past him? Yes. He's a martial arts guy. Yes. How am I going to get past him to that thing and press the button to stop it or to send him off into the sun, the missile? Yes. And I'm calculating. And then this guy shows up who I haven't seen for 55 years, who was a former boyfriend of my current wife, who we've been married for 52 years. And he's an English guy, and he's a jeweler and he's a fashion guy, because he used to be a model. Yeah. And so he shows up, and he's a very nice guy. And I'm saying, hey, how are you doing? And the Russians had led him into the room because they thought he was just a jeweler, you know, like a fashion guy. Right. So then I decide, well, I've got to get Putin. I have to stop these missiles. So I pick up a chair and start beating the crap out of him. We're in a chair. And he's laughing and kind of dodging and laughing because he has a button in his hand. And he's pressing the button and he says, my security is going to come and shoot you now. So that won't work. Tough luck. You're not going to be able to beat me up. So then I twirl around and guys are running down the hall at me with their machine guns. And this British guy, the jeweler, he whips out his James Bond pistols and shoots them all. Wow. And so then Putin is so surprised he's taken off guard. And then I really do beat him up with the chair. And he's bloody. He's bloody. I don't kill him and I don't want to. I just want to knock him out of the way. And I did. And then I get over and I'm pressing the buttons, you know. And then as I woke up, I'm satisfied because the missiles are heading straight up into the sun. And I woke up with that. I was great. It was a great dream. I felt really great for a whole three hours. And I'm feeling good now telling it to you again. And the thing is that they can't. Those guys, you know, where we are now with the stupid elite like Bush, for example, who raided the criminal war he did and our name with our money, our tax money, into Iraq was criminal. They didn't attack us. They weren't at 9-11, the Iraqis. In fact, Saddam Hussein was an employee of the CIA attacking the Iranians for years. I didn't know that. And a bunch of BS. And so, you know, the point is the one saving grace of all those militarists on the planet who are interwoven with the petroleum people is they're so unbelievably incompetent. They are just everything is blowback. And the blowback is getting faster and faster on them. And they can't deal with it. And now, by now, Russia is an oil company, as is Saudi Arabia. They're just, they're not countries. They're oil companies. So they're hard to stop. So my point is that we are going to, it's not, you know, that girl suing the Swedish government and kids in California leaving school and suing the state government and the federal government. And most of all, our next election, where we're going to do something different and then things were going to go well. And I'm writing an op-ed right now about what to do. But I don't want to take up the whole time with that. But only I just want to say this. Bernie Sanders wants a revolution, right? Yeah. Political revolution. Yes. But meanwhile, the Democrats, they all think maybe they have a shot at Trump. So we have 10 or 15 egotists saying, I'm the one who's going to save the scene. Beethoven, Pete Buttigieg, Bernie Sanders. Elizabeth Warren. They're all going to save us. But we already know that the one guy who comes and says, I'm only I can save you. And then I'm going to have the best people. That's what we heard. And he's destroying the whole place, right? He's completely wrecking everything. So he doesn't even have the government as a complete mess, you know? So the revolution starts now in the primary. And instead of doing a bunch of stupid Fox News debates, like the Republicans did, they have to sit down themselves in a room, all of those primary candidates. And they have to decide how they're going to make a team and how they're going to put aside their super egos and pick the two best people for the co-president. Never mind vice president. Because you know what we need? We need a racial person. We need a female and we need a climate change warrior. Those are the three people we need in the top position. Well, may I interject? This is my despondent feeling about this. The first part is, though I agree, it would be wonderful to have a multicultural, climate centered, intelligent government. Clearly, it'd be great. There's another part of me that feels that the part of us that is still monkey DNA, that's the part that helps get autocrats into power, which is that there's some ancient thing in people where they look at a thing and they see just basic, aggressive, charismatic, dull power and they are drawn to it because they're terrified. So on the left, or whatever you want to call it, we have this concept of the ideal. And the ideal is what you just described. But the problem is that a great many people, they don't see that as the ideal. They see that as vulnerable, weak, and antithetical to the PTSD alcoholic father they grew up with. Because our country's been at war for 92% of the history. So when you push someone out there who looks like someone that your dad in one of his drunken, near flashbacks would have aggressively wanted to punch, it triggers the part in you that wants to please your dad. That too. I know, but listen, we just did that for the last two years. And the damage is unbelievable. It's like we have a Russian puppet in the White House destroying our alliances, destroying our economy with tax cuts and deficits that they all pretend they hate the republic. Destroying our society between people, creating anger, and rage, and totally screwing a completely incompetent ignorant. And therefore, I think we can do it, and we can take one or two charismatic people. Do you know Jay Inslee? No, I've heard the name. Well, if you read the latest Rolling Stone, the introduction of him, he has been since Al Gore wrote Earth in the Balance in the 1980s. He's been in the Congress, in the Senate, in the state politics in Washington state. He has been fighting the climate change thing full blast. He's now governor of Washington state. He now has a democratic legislature there, and he is doing it there. And he knows how to do it as an executive. And he's a big stroke guy. And he ran for Congress in a rural Republican district, and he was always votes Republican, and he won as a Democrat. And he is really solid. And you know, he's really, he would have beat up your dad, your drunken dad, easily. And he told Trump at the governor's meeting that the president was forced to attend some month ago, because he's the head of the governors. You know, he was what he called president of the governor's association. And he told Trump, who was starting his blather about climate denial. And he said, look, Mr. President, we don't really need to hear about this. We are doing something, whether you are or not. That's great. And he said, and as far as from the White House goes, we governors who are responsible for our United States, he said, we need less Twittering and more listening from you. Yeah. So he's not gonna be bullied by that asshole. Is he running for president? Yes. And he's not get known. He's not big name recognition, but that's a great article. You read it in Rolling Stone. Cool. A big board member goes on, now wait, now let me fit it. Then Kamala Harris is a woman and black, okay? And so, but we say, then we don't want the women to be pissed if she's vice president. And we don't want the men to be freaked out if he's vice president. So what they say is, look, we just had an asshole as president and they can say that in public. Yeah. They didn't do any good. And his cabinet is a bunch of swamp creatures, 100% in Congress, destroying all the agencies they preside over. And you need these agencies, people. You need your healthcare. You need your clean air. You need your clean water. You don't need that. So we're running, we're not gonna argue with each other. And we're not all the greatest, but together we're the greatest and we're gonna give you our CV and our employment credentials right now from the primaries and we're all running together. Kamala Harris and Jay Inslee are gonna be co-presidents. And then Cory Booker, Secretary of State, Elizabeth Warren, Secretary of Treasury, Bernie Sanders, Secretary of Education, so-and-so, Buttigieg, Secretary of Health, Biden, Secretary of Defense, because they're all, the cabinet is president. He needs a cabinet that's effective. And that's all there. And the two charismatic figures, Kamala Harris, she's can do it. He won the governorship and he was the one as a senator. And before that, he won as a congressman. They can win, they can get up and bullshit you. And we're not having any other bullshiters. We are all doing it. Now let's project, when we fix the thing, and you young people see a future ahead of you on a livable planet, then you can go back and have a popularity contest if you like as a presidency. We haven't changed the constitution. For this time, we're running as a fucking team and we're all gonna campaign as a team and we're gonna be toe-to-toe with that moron. And then we'll debate him, oh yes. And we'll see what has he done and what is his record and who is he and what about the Russians? And by the way, we're gonna get an Obama who'll come back and be the attorney general and give us the tax returns and the fricking Mueller report and the full level of pollution that's going on. How realistic is this that you're describing? Is this a thing you have thought about or people are actually, this is the plan? I am thinking about it and you know what? It's a revolution in my family because my daughter, Uma, thinks it's a great idea and it's gonna help me place it as an op-ed to get it into the minds of these Democrats. It's Bernie says revolution, but why doesn't he make a revolution of not act like he's gonna be the only one who can save us? Right, I gotcha. He's not, he's not, but he wants to, all these people will bring the people who like them all together. Hillary would never have lost in spite of the rigged states that the Republicans had all set up with fake computers and fake governors and fake secretaries of state. She didn't actually lose 87,000 votes in three states and they dismissed hundreds of thousands in each one of those states of poor black people. They did, the Latino people, the Republicans were the secretaries of state. And just like in Georgia, just now, she was beaten because that guy was counting the fucking votes while running against them. Give me a break, that's ridiculous. And so the point is, nevertheless, she still would have won like Obama did in spite of all that criminal rigging. If her runner up in the primaries, Mr. Sanders was the vice president. But she didn't offer that. The arrogant Clintons didn't offer that because they're still playing business as usual. I'm going to be the great saving mom president. And I'm going to be, I'll be nice to you guys in the oil industry. Don't worry, we won't be so bad to you. We'll take you. We'll, we'll, you'll still get your subsidies and stuff. No, these people are not going to get their subsidies. They're all the subsidies are going to go to renewables in every state instantly. And Cassio Cortez is going to be the EPA. She's going to be the EPA secretary. I just don't, I don't, I don't believe in this. I love what you're saying. I hope, I don't believe in the state so much. No, don't say you don't believe it. You say you want a revolution. Business where it starts now, not waiting for some savior to come and say, okay, now you have permission for a revolution. It won't work like that. The revolution is now. Right. And you get the young people who are going to live their lives in this polluted screwed up Homer Simpson world. They're cooking up for you. They are, they have to have it now. They should start suing the government and they should go to court and sue those creeps in the, in the, in the Supreme Court, because they have standing. Cause they'll be alive when it happens. And though, though Supreme Court people will not be alive in 2050 and they will be suffering. It'll be, it'll be like, you know, what do you call it? You know, war worlds or whatever those, you know, the G. Mel Gibson movies, you know, there's a lot I could think of that remind me of, you know, let, they tell us all that one of the ways they have continued past their termination date, which was 30 years ago is by having us convinced that anything miraculous is impossible. And so we were for, oh, no, everybody wants to aggressive. Oh, everybody wants to save it. Oh, everybody's simple minded. No, people are intelligent enough to save their asses when they see the train running down the track. Right. And the train is running down the track. It is. And so, and so, you know, I mean, you know, the point is if they, if we, if we could get them by creating the meme around the country and put those primary contenders in a room now and say, look, this is not carnival time. This is not to replay the 2016 Republican primary circus by you guys. This is for you to already start governing. And the first thing you do is part your fucking egos and work together and pick the most plausible people who can win as a team, all of you. And then the one who says, oh, I always wanted Elizabeth Warren. I love her. Oh, I want Bernie or I'm not going to vote for anybody. No, you're getting Bernie. You're getting Elizabeth. You're getting Kamala. You're getting a guy who knows the climate thing and knows how to do it as an executive. You're getting Corey. You're cute Corey. You're getting cute Corey. And, and you're getting them all. And maybe the old Biden, the old bartenders can get Biden. You know, and they get through with Biden. And he will be the secretary of hugging. That would be the defense department. I love it. Sign me up. I'm down. Let's do it. What do we do? Let's do it. What we have to do, we got to do that. We definitely got to do it. I want you in there somewhere. No, I can, I can be like, I can say prayers in the cabinet meeting. OK. An eternal thank you to the Wonder Beings over at robinhood.com.

But we really, the young people should insist on this. And the young, for example, the young people who didn't vote at all because Bernie was badly treated by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary and Bill Clinton, treated him badly. Had they all voted anyway, because of realizing the danger of Trump, he would not have gotten in. Even all the Russians and all everything, he still wouldn't have gotten in. But they got pissed off. And they've just played as egotistical a game as a Republican by saying, no, I didn't get my Bernie. So fuck you. And that's really stupid. What do you think about the yellow vests? Who? In Paris, the yellow vests. I think they're funded by the Russians, actually. Really? Yes. The Marine Le Pen has a $10 million loan from Bank of Russia in Petersburg. You know, who does the, who does the, she's the, you know, that's the ones who want to take the France out of the union. They want to go back. And then alternative for Deutschland in Germany. That's also KGB. And those are the Nazis in Germany. Wow. To destroy Angela Merkel. And then the five-star movement in Italy and Bannon was over there egging them up. And when this whole nationalism, who benefits? It's a European, the Marine Union goes down because of people being stupid and not remembering World War II, which was in US with Europe's game. Then that's because the only people who like that are the oligarchs in Russia. The good people in Russia and Moscow and Petersburg, I know them. I go and teach Buddhism with them all the time. Yeah. I like them. I have an interpreter. I thought the oligarchs were somehow fundamentally evil. No, yeah, but they're the, the oligarchs are KGB. You don't know that? I know I figured. But I, I'll tell you, there's a book. I'll show you. It's called Putin's kleptocracy, who owns Russia. Right. By a woman, a woman named Karen Dowisha, sociologist at University of Oregon. And the KGB when, when Gorbachev started Glasnost, they said, oh, they said, and Gorbachev was KGB too. And so was Andropov who put him in. So, because they had information. They knew what was going on. So, so they said, they took all the money they could take out of Russian government. KGB did their black budget, it was a red budget, let's call it, put it in foreign banks. And the KGB station chiefs in France and Germany and Singapore and everywhere were the signatories. And they said, when it all gets chaotic in Russia, and everybody privatizes, we'll buy all the resources and we'll be oligarchs. And if we fail to, and then we'll research control that way. And if we fail to do that, we'll be really rich in the south of France. They even have a memo like that. They do. And then they bought the mines and the factories and everything and they are the oligarchs. And they are, they are defeating the Russian people's wish to be part of the European Union themselves. I mean, the educated ones, they have a backing once they took over all the TV stations, they have a backing in the countryside. But the internet wise people in Petersburg, Moscow, Kateryna, Bergen and a few other places, they are, they hate them. They don't like that, put it in those people. And they, and he hasn't allowed them to have a real economy, by the way. He's just a fucking oil company. He took Kotarkovsky's Yukos and he just sells oil, that's all. I just, the reason I bring up the yellow vest, and I, you know, I have forgotten my suspicion about just about anything these days. Because I think that because of what's happening, there's concerted efforts to disconnect, disrupt, to pollute the info streams and to make everyone just deeply confused. But one thing that isn't confusing is that we have a situation where people are not getting paid enough money to live, the distribution of wealth has become so obviously imbalanced that there isn't really a good way to trick people and to make matters worse. We've got, as our president, someone who flaunts his wealth to people who can't afford to pay their kids or get their medicine. So what's happening is people are getting angry and people are beginning to feel completely disconnected from the political system itself. And I think that people are beginning to have this sense that no matter what we do, and I love what you're saying, I am down, anyone in their right mind would do anything they could to avoid any type of violent revolution, any type of civil war, any type of aggression because... Yeah, so listen, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are in the cabinet and they're on the campaign and they're all running together as a team and they promise those angry people cancellation of all student debt instantly, instant on the day of inauguration, cancellation. The banks can fucking eat it. They got bailed out and they're fucked up, credit loads of bulls' obligations and the students are all gonna be bailed out. What health system, yeah, leave some private insurers for wealthy people, they can do that, but they are immediately gonna get pre-medical care. Everybody has medical care to write instantly and you're running on that. And these other fuckers are closing your, cutting off your Affordable Care Act. So we're not telling you, we're gonna do it when we get in, we're telling you, this is it, there it is. You sign up here and make your vote and we're doing it. And you mean they're not gonna vote for that? They damn well gonna vote for that. And don't remember they're suffering for two more years under this shit and that guy hasn't given them a penny worth of raise. He never paid his workers ever. He went bankrupt himself anyway and he never paid anybody. He's torturing the Latinos. And you know, I mean, all you need is someone like that governor who said to him in the governor's meeting, we need less meeting and more listening from you, Mr. I agree with you there. I mean, I think unfortunately you gotta get somebody who's got that same kind of. We got him, we got him. That's great, I haven't even heard of him. I didn't know he was even running. I, this is the- Get him on Stephen Colbert for four or five nights and get him on everywhere. And you know, he'll, everyone will know who he is. And then that he's partnered with Kamala Harris on the black, that's the areas. Yeah. I wouldn't want to be yelling at me. Exactly. He's a big guy in six, three or four. He's a Marini former Marine. He didn't drive your fucking draft. He fought there wherever it was. I don't know where, but he's a real guy. And booty gig, you know, booty gig we get him in there. We get all the gay, he'll be in somewhere in the cannon all the gay people, LBGTQ people vote for him. I got to, I want to point something out. You can't lose if they do that. If they sit there and tear each other down during primaries and play the usual ego game and fight over who can get more donors and waste some money. And then we say, it's iffy, you know, the other guys can lie their way through maybe but they're big war chest. But if they, if they really get together now and start the presidential campaign now by working together, there's no way they will not have a victory. The only danger would be if that somebody shoots all of them. So they have to have security. I want to point something out because this is a one of the critiques I've heard regarding Buddhism, which is one of the dark terms I've heard is passive hipster Buddhism, passive hipster Buddhism. And you, sir, one of the great Buddhist scholars, dear friends with the Dalai Lama, I think in this moment are demonstrating to people that Buddhism is not about inactivity. It's not about being apolitical. It's not about being passive. It's about, it's this, it's fiery and real and it works. Are you still there? Good book, it's the latest book. I'll get, I'll get the book. Yeah, I'm very inspired by you right now. And, but this to me is wonderful because- You're inspiring me because you know, you're not, are you a millennial? What is, I don't know the difference- I'm not a millennial, I'm 40. I'm out of the millennial range. You're in the middle, as you said. I'm in the middle. You're a lot younger than me. And you can reach more millennials and we need to reach them and get them going. Well, I mean, I think we need to reach everybody. I mean, the reality is that what's happening is- Justin, Justin, go ahead, go ahead, you are the reality. It seems like people are losing track of their connection with reality. And because we've sort of subverted our own connection with just basic, here's the earth, here's the sun, here's light with a never ending stream of data coming from a variety of sources and people are getting very anxious and confused and more than anything opposed to each other. And then you end up sitting down with just about anybody, just about anybody. And you realize everybody kind of just wants to be happy and everybody, and yet there appears to be a kind of, you know, I don't know if this has ever happened to you, but that thing where you decide to drink and you think, you know what, I'll let Tamara's version of me deal with the hangover. And it seems similarly that as a whole, we've been drinking oil and we know that we're about to have the worst hangover of all time, which involves sea levels rising, coastal cities being driven out, massive, massive refugee problems that make what's happening right now look like nothing and essentially a complete collapse of society as we know it, which we're already seeing. It's already happening and it's going to keep happening. And not only that, this is somehow coinciding with the technological revolution, which is gonna involve a 45% unemployment rate. So it's a, it's a, it's a mess. So I love that on one hand, you're advocating kind of political approach using the system as it is to try to improve things dramatically and radically. But I wonder if you could talk a little bit about, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the spiritual side of all this, the deeper spiritual side of all this and how the two can balance out. Right, well, the spiritual side is you know, Bodhisattva, the Bodhisattva vow, you know, Bodhisattva commitment, I want to become a little bit of a take of all living beings and I want all beings to be happy. Anyway, that's in way, obviously, that's second. First, first of the spiritual love is this, Buddha's discovery, what is the root of the Buddha teaching is his discovery that reality itself is bliss. Okay, yeah, that is a revolutionary discovery. In other words, instead of the default situation, it's hell, it's a mess, is it never works out, is it nothing goes right, is blah, blah, blah, and how is this dangerous because you'll do what happened to you if you're happy. Buddha discovered nirvana is reality. Now some Buddhists are a little worried about that because they talk about life, they hear him say that life is suffering. But he never really said that, he didn't say life is suffering. He said, an unenlightened life is suffering. If you don't know what the fuck is going on, you're gonna suffer, yes, because you don't know where you are, you're a psycho. You think everything is like this, you have to fight the universe, and if you think you have to fight the universe, guess what, the universe wins. You lose, you could be president of the United States until they'll beat you up. There's no way in which one individual versus everything, infinite everything, is gonna defeat it. So therefore, but the point is we're not versus, we're all interwoven with each other. His insight was that we're all interconnected when we realized that we were interconnected. With the infinite abundant energy of the universe, then suddenly we are blown away. And when you say blown over there, I mean, there's two meanings of blown away in our English slang, which were perfect for, one of them is perfect for Buddhism. Yes. One of them is the gangster meeting where you kill somebody. Yeah. And it's not perfect, that sucks, because you lose your body. You don't become nothing actually, because the materialist might think you just lose your body, but then then you scramble to find another one. But the other meaning of blown away is, I really like that grateful concept. Wait, sorry, wait, you've, sorry, wait, Bob, sorry, you faded out. Can you repeat that? The other meaning of blown away is? Yes, I really liked that grateful, dead concept. Yeah. I was blown away by the joy, you know, and that means I blew away for temporarily to worry my anxiety by feeling that whatever it is, I'm not having enough fun, but you know, I could have more, it could be better. And then somehow I'm satisfied because myself thinking and myself doing and my nervous and anxiety is blown away by some overwhelmingly wonderful thing. And the point is, reality does that to you when you really know what it is, when you realize that your life force is the bliss in yourselves. And that's why people like to ask it for crying out loud, suicide and misconduct, because temporarily it blew away the notion in our brainwashed society that everything is no good. I'm gonna get sick. That's a germ. I mean, I need an injection and you know, they're gonna arrest me if I have a good time. If I say something, you know, if I lose control, et cetera. You know, happiness is illegal. In the United States, you get arrested for being happy. Yes. And that's why in the sixties, temporarily people look totally and they would, and immediately they refused to go kill a bunch of Indians in Vietnam because they were too happy and they realized, we don't want to, what do we want in the jungle over there? We're not freaking out with them. That's just some cowboy movie that Johnson is playing. Right. He's so stuck in a John Wayne movie. It's stupid. The minute you get stoned, you saw that in the sixties and you don't want to do that. And then they made it illegal and they arrested everybody and they've been trying to put the lid back on, human good feeling, which we can have here in America and in the world. And Buddha's discovery was that if you leave it alone, life is beautiful. And even death is all right. You know, if you know about near-death experiences, people who died clinically and came back, most of them didn't want to come back. They were floating in the blinding golden light, you know, and they were happy because the human being already is a highly evolved animal. And it's very sensitive and can have a lot of pleasure and very intelligent and self-reflective. And there's no reason to make each other all this misery. And Buddhism gives you an education that enables you to see that. You know, the psychonellics, the entheogenics, as they know, as we hear Susan Smith call them or psychonellics, as Tim called them, these things gave you a temporary window around us. Why do you think Ram Dass got his energy to start with? It's the best. Yeah, but then he realized, more smart than Tim, he became Baba Ram Dass because he realized that this is natural in you and that those catalysts temporarily shatter some negative culture that has you not seeing it and then you temporarily get a glimpse. And then if you're smart, you work on yoga, meditation, bhakti, whatever it is, and you can open this out because actually the real bliss, the joy is in you but it's in the human heart. That's the nature of the human being. It's love, compassion, kindness. And that's what Buddha discovered. So that's the essence of the Buddhist thing. Certainly, for example, the whole thing that stopped us from not fixing everything is the concept that can't be fixed. Wait, I'm sorry, you're fading for a second. I'm sorry, can you repeat that? The whole thing that keeps us from fixed, say that again, the last sentence? From fixing our planet with all the knowledge and technology that we have is the concept that we have inherited from a wrong view of Christianity, not what Jesus said. Jesus said, it's fine, every sparrow, every daffodil in the field. But the church, and oh no, you gotta just do this so we're gonna put you in hell. In other words, the great people in history have all said the same thing, everything is fine if you live it as fine and are nice to your neighbor and yourself. And that's what we can get back to. Buddhism has education system, very effectively to get you back to that. It's not a matter of just believing it. It's a matter of doing it. And the psychedelics opened the door for people and then they can develop it through an education system right because it's in everybody's heart. Everybody has the ability. And even Trump, even the horrible EPA, oil company stooge, you know, in our supposedly environment protection thing, they can all be happy. We don't want them to suffer. We don't want them to, even if they go to jail, it would be a nice jail with some girls and some food. And they can have a, they can, no, you never had Paradise Island. I've always, it's always been one of my desires is to have a Paradise Island for ex-dictators. Wow. Cool. They will never leave and they keep killing people to stay because they think if they leave, then they'll get killed, you see? But, you know, they got Marcos and Imelda out of the Philippines instead of killing Mrs. Aquino by bringing them to Hawaii. And they even set a plane for her shoes. Wow. Ha, ha, ha, ha. You just described the best TV show of all time, Paradise Island, the world's top 10 dictators, living their weekly episodes. That's right. And they get massages. They get great massages and rikean therapy. So they could have one fulfilling orgasm, so they don't have to grab everybody else's pussy, which they don't know how to do, they don't know how to work with it. That's why they kill so many because they can't, they don't enjoy it themselves. If they're all locked up inside, you know, they're all twisted and angry and ah, and they're afraid of their own sensitive, vulnerable, melting, blissful emotions. I'm afraid of that. And I'm not even a dictator. Me too. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. I don't agree with that. Yeah, so, so, I am true. I'm, I'm educated. I went to, I'm educated every uptight, right wing school you can think of. Yeah. But luckily the Buddha Dharma saved me with a little help from some psilocybin to start. Ha, ha, ha, ha. Get me out of the way, it's just like Rhonda. You know, that's helpful, you know, in, in, in, in, in Amazon cultures and in Mexico or something, you get a little much fun when you're a teenager and then you have a spiritual life, you know, you don't keep taking it all the time cause you got a cloud of fields and you got to do some work, you know, but you, but these, these things are, they were very valuable psychological and educational things. Those, those, uh, vision quest substances that all in history cultures have had. And thanks to Albert Hoffman and Tim Leary and, and about Rhonda's, he's, they temporarily exploded something in our culture. Yes. And it's time we honored that. And then, and, but we, we've gone beyond just depending on that and we have to now depend on our heart's courage and our say, our lack of fear of death. You know, we, we shouldn't be afraid to speak up. You know, actually revolution does happen in cocktail parties where some, some ass, some banker comes up with his drinking hand and acts like, well, we're helping everybody. He goes, we made some loans and we make him money and it make him money out of people. Yeah, you're making money to help me buddy. And somebody there speaking back to him in a friendly manner, but forcefully showing him he's wrong. He's like, he's like mistaken, make a mistake thinking it's just money. With his fourth trophy, he has his fourth trophy wife on his shoulder because he didn't enjoy the first one who bore his children for crying out loud. Wow. His kids are addicted to something because he didn't pay enough attention to them getting to be a big CEO. Right. So that, that's a revolution when somebody meets him on his level in a nice way and speaks at that elite level to him, but doesn't both doesn't mess around with him. We got to get into the boat. We got to get you into the Bohemian Grove. Are you a member of the Bohemian Grove yet? No, hey, no, I didn't go there. But, you know, I'll go wherever, but I know what it is, but I never went there. No, I never did. But I, I love what you're saying. And I, and to me, that's the other element of Buddhism that I love so much is it's contagious. And it doesn't, the way it approaches life is not to try to correct, but to communicate. I can't see, can you hold it up this way? Let me see. Yes. Wow, cool. I see it. Yeah. You know where she is? Where we are there? Where? We're at a Tibetan community New Year celebration in Queens. Wow. Because the Tibetan ghetto in Jackson Heights and in those places, you know, Tibetan exile refugees cool are in her district. Wow. You know, 800 families and she was invited and she's the cause woman of it. And she was looking so happy not because of me. I'm just an irritating, you know, person asking for a story. But she, she, and we have those white scarves given by the Tibetans, they, the Tibetans gave them to us because we were at the bar out there saying, and she, and she would like seeing the Tibetan, I can't, I can't, seeing the Tibetan children dancing. Hey, we got five minutes. I told her, I told her, I said, listen, challenge Nancy Pelosi and she loved the Tibetan children Nancy. So I said, look, challenge Nancy, she's a chair Nancy, but she really is good. And she loves the Tibetans too. And she knows the Dalai Lama for years. She's helped them. She's saved them. She gave Dalai Lama the golden medal, not W Bush. He didn't, he joined in it, but she's the one who arranged it. So you have to see her good side. She's older generation and so on. And she's practical. She worries about what is realistic and practical, but challenge, but cherish. That's what I was whispering to her there. Challenge, but cherish. She said, oh, yes, we said, we're getting along. She said, oh, yes, we're getting along. Can you please say they hate each other? We have five minutes left. And I wonder if in those five minutes you could talk about Tibet House a little bit and how people who are interested in helping in that way can connect. Yeah, thank you. Yes, well, as long as the Dalai Lama, I've known since 1964, we were kind of classmates initially studying with his senior teachers. I'm six years younger, but we were sort of classmates. You know, he wasn't really my guru at that time. And he was my caretaker. I was so lunatic. But I was a monk. He made me a monk. And we were really buddies. And then, but then we kept together friends. He was a little annoyed me when I ceased being a monk, but then he really liked my wife and children. He thought they were better than me, better than Paolo. So we remain really good friends now for almost 60 years, 50-some years. And I really like him. And at one point he asked me to create an organization, or he asked me to do a lot of things, but one was create an organization for the Tibetan culture. Not for the political, you know, lobbying against China or anything like that. Although sometimes I speak like that for the Chinese, you know, in public events as an individual, but the institution is not political and it's not religious. It's not a Dharma center, although we do teach meditation and things. But it's about getting people to love the culture. And our slogan is not save Tibet, and it's not free Tibet, although we don't disagree with either. But our slogan is love Tibet. Because Tibet, they're very free, those people. They're very individualistic. They're very kind and compassionate. They were great warriors for a long time, but then they became kind and compassionate, and they really kept that great Indian education system alive up until the modern period. It got wrecked in India by people invading India. And so, you know, and it never came to its fullest in East Asia because the king, the emperors, they're always kept it under a little bit wraps as a counter-cultural thing. But it became mainstream in Tibet and Mongolia as it had been in India. And so we're trying to save that culture, and he wanted us to make a powerful, wealthy foundation, which we have not succeeded yet in doing, so that we can actually make grants all over the world to Tibetan exiles, to Tibetans in Tibet, to Westerners who are interested in Tibet, and we can open the door and do exhibitions and bring Tibetans traveling groups and monks. We brought the first monk chanting tours, things like that. So they love the culture, and then people will, if they love it, they'll help it politically, they'll help it religiously, they'll learn stuff, and you know, it'll be great. And the Tibetan American link between being a free person and seeing the world as basically good and wonderful, and therefore not being cynical and depressed about being able to change it for the better. That's what the Tibetan culture embeds as a mainstream aspect in the culture, making them peaceful and cheerful and happy. But they're not all perfect, they're not all Buddhists, it's not Shangri-La. But they have problems. But they always tend toward the good, and they've made great contributions wherever they've been exiles and refugees, and they're ready to make an awesome contribution to China. And the Chinese in past history, pre-commonists, love Tibet, and they honor the Tibetan Lamas as great sort of magicians and great teachers and happy people, and they would honor them and support them. And the Manchu, the Ming Dynasty, the Mongolians, and the Song Dynasty, Tang Dynasty, they loved Tibet, and before that, they used to have wars, Tibetans and Chinese. But when they both got into Buddhism, then Tibetans were considered adept really having the full blast of the Indian Buddhism, and so they were very honored by the Chinese, who also liked Buddhism. So that's Tibet House, and it's a national organization. We need to open branches in LA. We only have the one branch still in New York, because it's been very hard to raise the big money that we need to pay, because people think that if anybody has more money, they think, well, I have to help Tibet save themselves politically, or I have to help the refugees economically, and our people to Tibet, and that's fine. They should all do that, we're not against that, but it's not either or. They should do all of that, and a lot of people who are introduced to love Tibet by us do go and do those other things, but they also need to make sure that his Holiness has resigned from the political aspect of the Tibetan movement himself, now that he's 84 years old, he resigned 2011, and then the head of the government in exile is elected now, democratically, and he's not automatically, then he says, in the future, he won't be, but he's not resigned from saving the culture, and that is our job as commissioned by him to do. A lot of people who are either religious centers or political people, they also act like, we're saving the culture too, and they're very competitive, because there's a great Tibetan saying, if you have 40 Tibetans in a room, in that room, there are 40 horns. Like their national animal, which is a yak. The yak is a very wild and independent cow animal, cow family animal, they're wonderful, the yaks. Actually, my friend John Perry Barlow used to tell me that he tried to raise some yaks in Wyoming when he had a ranch out there. You know him, the Grateful Dead, the nurses said, you know, Perry Barlow, I bet you do. And the late John Perry Barlow. And then he said, however, he sort of was discouraged, because when he would go to town, to the bar or something, the cattleman would ask him, well, John, what are you doing with them long-haired, hippy cattle? Ha ha ha ha! Even as ass-on longer! Anyway, so the thing is that we haven't got the big money that we need to before I die, so that it can make rents, not just raise money. But on the other hand, we've survived well, but always in the black. We have a great retreat center, where I'm speaking from, where we're trying to introduce people to the Tibetan herbal natural medicine, you know, diet, massage, external therapies. You know, it's not a recognized medical system in America. It is in India and China, but not in America. And they're very popular there, because it's very effective. But it's a good complementary, good among the tourists of complementary medicine. It's a very good one. And so that's what Menla is. Menla retreat center up here. People are welcome to come. They're welcome to come to our lectures and our teachings and our events and our exhibitions in New York, at Tibet House on 15th Street. And then they're welcome to help us open Tibet houses. In Chicago, we have a kind of semi one in Tucson, Arizona, actually friends of Tibet organization. And then LA, San Francisco, we want, Seattle and Atlanta. You know, we want to open little Tibet houses, which are like destination places, where people can go in there and they can see paintings and tankas and learn the history and see it. And they won't get lobbied and they won't have to join any cult or anything. And they will just get to love Tibet. That's what all we want to do is to love Tibet. And by loving Tibet, realize the value of indigenous cultures and more natural cultures and everywhere. And we encourage that they can help everyone. But you know, like the Dalai Lama is so unique. He's a little problematic as the fundraisers within the aggressive thing, because he'll go to an event and he'll thank the donors of some Tibetan organization. And then he'll say, and he's done this many times, they don't say, well, it's great. It says, but also, by the way, if you want to really help Tibet, help some other people. Help the poor people in your city here. Help the people under the tsunami. Help the people over there in Mozambique. Help, he does that because if he had a country in a foreign policy, or as he wants it in the future, where Tibet remains a very good and strong and honored part of China, Tibetans will become important in the Chinese government inevitably because they're very effective people. Naturally, they're energetic and charismatic, all of them. And so then they will be using that foreign policy not to help dictators like the current silly policy at the moment, giving Confucius prizes to Robert Mugabe for crying out. Right. And Bashar al-Assad and joining the dictator parade. Instead, they're helping people. And they're poor people in the country. That would be a full compassion foreign policy is what great nation like China should be doing. And they will be in the future when Tibet is a real part of them as Tibet, not trying to kill off Tibet and culture and swallow Tibetan people to try to be some kind of half-baked Chinese. They're not Chinese, they're Tibetans. But they're happy to be part of a Chinese union and really help China and help China help the world. They really want to do that. And so they should exploit that asset instead of treating them as some kind of problem Chinese. Thank you so much. Thanks for the reminder. Thanks for the reminder. I forget it all the time.

416^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - 307: Paul Selig  Transcript and Discussion^2018-10-03^"Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. Dirty little angel. You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Greetings to you, oh beautiful bumblebee skinned dragons of light. My friend was telling me this crazy story. He said he was walking late at night in downtown LA and he ended up walking next to a man with severe burns all over his body. And he asked the man, what happened to you? And the man said, well, you know, I was practicing radical inclusivity and I made friends with a pyromaniac. My friend, he asked him, well, did you figure out how to deal with that? Like how does radical inclusivity work in a world where there are people who just love setting shit on fire? The stranger stopped and smiled. He said, you know, I used to be a lot like you. I was worried because I recognized that with the growing interconnectivity happening all over the planet, the technologically enhanced hyperconnectivity that we are all experiencing that our ideas of inclusivity and embrace opening our arms to all points of view could actually be exploited by others. That the concept that we should be completely open-minded when it comes to all ways of life, including the ways of the pyromaniac could get us in a lot of trouble at some point, especially if people began to exploit that vulnerability. But what I realized was the solution to the entire problem. I actually discovered a way that we can coexist with pyromaniacs and my friend looked him in the eye and said, how, what is that way? Tell me, the stranger smiled. But before he could reply, he spontaneously combusted right in front of my friend. Now I've heard about spontaneous combustion since I was a little kid. There was a small period in my life where I was actually terrified of spontaneously combusting. If you've never heard of this phenomenon before, there was this idea, I think it's kind of faded away now that we have cell phones and everyone's filming themselves 24 seven. But there was an idea that you could just maybe have the wrong meal, maybe a bowl of baked beans and some honeyed bread and jam and then sip some like rare form of vodka, sit down in your recliner with a good book and then poof, you would essentially do the same thing that happens with cell phones. You would just explode into flames. And they would find people in recliners with just a pile of ash and some boots or slippers. And that's it, there's pictures of this. And so people thought, yeah, your nervous system sometimes just fucks up and you can just spontaneously combust. That was a phenomenon that one time people thought was real. But ever since I talked to my friend, it really has got me thinking about this idea of radical inclusivity, of like opening our arms, of making our membranes more permeable to all points of view of the idea that, jeez, we live in this super hyperconnected world and there are people in this hyperconnected world who really have some pretty violent ideologies and who like accidentally or not so accidentally because of their beliefs, they end up setting lots of people on fire. I was going through some old journals that I was keeping when I was in the second grade and I actually found something in them that maybe would help answer this difficult question. I'm just gonna read a little bit from this journal. And, you know, I was in the second grade, so don't judge me on the writing style. We have no reason to take this threat lightly. Everywhere in the West, there are subversive minorities who sheltered by our humanitarianism and our sense of justice hold the incendiary torches ready with nothing to stop the spread of their ideas except the critical reason of a single, fairly intelligent, mentally stable stratum of the population. One should not, however, overestimate the thickness of this stratum. It varies from country to country in accordance with national temperament. Also, it is regionally dependent on public education and is subject to the influence of acutely disturbing factors of a political and economic nature. Taking plebiscites as a criterion, one could, on an optimistic estimate, put its upper limit at about 40% of the electorate. A rather more pessimistic view would not be unjustified either since the gift of reason and critical reflection is not one of man's outstanding peculiarities. And even where it exists, it proves to be wavering and inconstant. The more so as a rule, the bigger the political groups are. The mass crushes out the insight and reflection that are still possible with the individual and this necessarily leads to doctrinaire and authoritarian tyranny if ever the constitutional state should succumb to a fit of weakness. So I think somewhere within there we can find if nothing else the sort of low level articulation of a big problem that we're facing right now and that problem, when I wrote that in the second grade, there wasn't even the internet. So this problem is being magnified to a great degree. And now in my older years, and when I'm not still in the playground with my hands in the sand, writing in a journal when I can, I think I have truly come up with the answer to how to deal with this. How do we maintain the humanitarian ideals of inclusivity while still protecting ourselves from ideologies that are innately destructive? And the way to do this is quite simple. All we have to do is... ... Holy shit, I just spontaneously combust it. That was crazy. It's not as bad as I thought it would be my whole life. I've been terrified of spontaneously combusting and then it happens and it's amazing. It's actually pretty cool. It's like getting massaged from on the inside by fire, by tiny little fiery hands. Huh, interesting. Wow, all that time I was secretly terrified of bursting into flames and as it turns out, it's the thing I've been missing for my entire life. We've got a wonderful podcast for you today. The channeler, Paul Selig is here with us. We're gonna jump right into it, but first, some quick business. This episode of the DTFH is brought to you by a brand new sponsor, who I have loved for a very long time. Charlotte's Web. Charlotte's Web Broad Spectrum Hemp Extract Oil. It's a wonderful product that when I was on tour doing my Squarespace tour, I used it at night because it helped in supporting my sleep cycles. It's really funny as I read this. These are the people making this stuff are amazing and the product is incredible. And when they approached me to do it, I instantly agreed to it because this particular company makes amazing hemp extract oil that I've used and it's helped me a lot. It helped me during a tour. It helps me deal with achieving a sense of common focus. It's funny, there's certain things right now. We live in a kind of time period where we have to be very careful when we talk about hemp extract oil. We have to say things like, for example, that these statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease. The Food and Drug Administration, by the way, I used to think these people were out to get us and they're not. I remember chatting with Rick Doblin and putting the FDA on blast, like any truly myopic hippie would. And he explained to me like, actually we need them because it's important that in history there have been times where stuff has gotten into the bloodstream of the people. It hasn't been so great. So regardless, we have to say that about this particular wonderful product, Charlotte's Web Spectrum Hemp Extract Oil. It's great and it's great for a lot of reasons. Right now we're in a time period where there's lots of types of hemp extract oil out there and we don't necessarily know what's in it. But why the Charlotte's Web is so great is because they don't use any chemical pesticides, herbicides or fungicides. The whole plant extract is filtered five times for quality and consistency.

Yodoo Jeologique Welcome, welcome on you That you are with us Shake it, you're going to be blue Welcome to you It's the Dunkin' Trussell video Paul, welcome back to the DTFF It's great to see you again You look great, the last time I saw you, you had a cold I did have a cold, yeah And you have recovered fully in a few years I recovered very well, thank you It must be nice to travel down here from New York to you I love it, yeah, that's where I live But I travel a lot and then this is a great place to be And you're going up to Monterey to do a retreat I'm doing a retreat at Isilomar, yeah How often do you find yourself traveling? About three weekends a month, you know It's about it, sometimes I'll stay on the road for a bit Sometimes I won't, but I enjoy it and I enjoy the work So, you know, it's an opportunity for me to be in the world Otherwise I'm probably going to just hide in my apartment Right, well that's a lot of us are doing that right now I was sitting on my porch just looking out And because you can see all these yards And they're all just empty, it's a beautiful day I have just ventured out for the first time And maybe like a day and a half to really get some sun Because it's so easy to stay inside But I was looking out just thinking, my god, we've all Retreated into our homes Why, what do you think that is? I don't know, I mean, I've always been like that truthfully So, you know, when I'm not traveling I'm happy to hibernate, I have a dog, I have a fireplace I live in New York, it's very loud, there's a lot of people And so I venture out, I have my experience of the real world And then I retreat, you know, as quickly as possible Do you think that your line of work and your ability And your connection with this transcendent force Is disrupting your life here? Do you ever feel like it's hard to connect to this place? No, I mean, not anymore so than it ever was You know, I mean, I think I'm one of those people That operated well in the world, you know, I had a life I was a college teacher, you know I had things that I did that I love But I'm highly empathic and that's a challenge sometimes So when I'm being hit by a lot of stuff I'm aware of it, but the work that I do as a channel Is an intrusive, you know, when I'm, my guides I always say, you know, they're not going to talk to me Unless I ask a question, I mean, if I say You know, if I want to walk into traffic, I can do it That's up to me If I say this is a good time to cross the street They may say not wise, you know And counsel at that level, but no You know, I'm not bombarded by things from the other worlds Oh, right Well, it's, so, you know, what is it What's that quote people say all the time? The mad man drowns in the waters That the mystic swims within Yeah And so what I've noticed happening to some of my friends And stories is that people will drink ayahuasca People will have some big psychedelic moment Where they go into the other realms Where they see it for real Or they are as real as they can believe it's real And then they get back here And they don't want to connect anymore to this place They withdraw Because they can't deal with investing themselves here In this particular zone of the universe When they know there's this But you're able to, this bifurcation of the It's normal for me now So that's sort of how I live, you know And when I first started opening up When I was in my late 20s, early 30s I was surprised by it all And I had a couple of big peak experiences That they weren't induced by ayahuasca or anything else I mean, they really just sort of happened And they were large enough for me That they gave me a marker for something that exists In a way of being in the world that could be experienced But it was always about a way of being in the world And what my guides bring through is about being in the world And being in the body And having this experience as your operative It's not about floating off someplace I mean, I've done anything a human being can do To try to check out, you know Over the course of my life And that doesn't work You know, it really is about sort of I think at this point Sort of learning how to maintain a sense of connection You know, in the face of a lot of stuff That doesn't seem to make much sense But I see that too I see these people that have these really large experiences And they don't really know how to integrate them You know, so you just want to go back to the big experience And I don't know I think the experiences we get For me, they were enough And the ones that I had were enough To show me that there was a reality That could be experienced and known And that kept me going more than anything else It kept me moving forward Oh, sure, right What a relief, I suppose Because suddenly you do see that this Thing you've been hearing about Or maybe, you know, depicted in movies Oh, no, actually There is a lot more going on here Than what you think If what you think is going on here Is based on mainstream media And what they teach you in public schools And, man, for me That is, you know, just sweet water From the fountain of youth But then, another part of me Starts getting really curious And interested in why This other place is not acknowledged here Why is it so Like destroyed by skeptics And scientists And just the general concept is like Oh, great, you're going to talk about aliens now Oh, spirits, really? No, it's all matter And so then I start getting conspiratorial And think, there is an actual Active sort of For maybe it's a subconscious intent But there does seem to be a rather Active pressure against Understanding that there's something bigger In here Do you ever drop that? Yeah, but I have my own version of it Which is my own belief That I can kick into And this is how I came to this whole thing With this real investment and separation And feeling myself as being extremely separate From whatever you might call God Or other people or whatever And what happens, I think, for some of us Is we sort of fall through that trapdoor Into this other kind of experience But my personality self Which my guides would call the small self Still has a great investment in that stuff In separation So once I get the understanding That separation is the big lie That's the big lie And that everything that wants to counter that Is everything that wants to maintain a status quo In my guide say, the small self Is always perpetuating the known Or what it has believed to be true Because it can't conceive of anything beyond it And what they're teaching now Which is really mind blowing Is they're calling it beyond the known And it's really what happens when you stop investing In the collective agreement And they do this energetically So that you're actually lifting to a place Of vibration or consciousness That's operating beyond the rules Or the things that we've been taught to believe were true But do I think that there's a conspiracy per se? You know, I kind of think the challenge with that Is if I want to go there And I can go there I end up aligning to the level of consciousness That creates the conspiracy I end up lowering the vibration And you really can't transform anything That you're in energetic accord to You have to go above it To have the higher experience And then lift it to you Which is a reconception And that's sort of what I understand is alchemy And the realization of the divine That must exist in all things Because whatever you want to call God Or the universe or spirit Must exist in everything Including those things that I would call separate And the moment I do that I lift it I mean the guy would say You know, whatever you dam dams you write back You know, whatever your bless blesses you So I can go there if I want to But I choose not to Wow, cool I love it I'm reading a great book right now By Jaron Lanier Who coined the term virtual reality He's just a super genius You know, just super genius He's when he's like ten He's cutting glass for telescopes And that kind of mind But he was talking about how Virtual reality If there was time travel And someone from 20 years in the future Brought VR back And we could experience that technology It would be indistinguishable From where we're at right now We wouldn't be able to tell the difference Between the VR world Depending on whatever they'd programmed for it But he was saying if we went back in time And showed virtual reality to someone Ten years ago that we have now They would feel like it was pretty indistinguishable From reality Because their experience was only They'd only experienced the technology up to that point So his point is You know, we can't see past where we're at right now When it comes to VR Because this is what we're used to It just reminds me what you're saying Is like to really understand This level of consciousness Or whatever What would your guides call this part of the universe? Well, they talk about collective agreement So, I mean, this level of vibrate This level of vibratory accord Which is sort of the agreed upon reality That we're all operating in So we all know what a sky is And what an ocean is, you know And we've been taught the names for everything that exists So what we do when we walk down the street Is we're actually sort of, you know Interpreting the data of history That's a chair, that's a post office box That's the sky So it's not to say that those things don't exist They all do exist But actually they can all be sort of Re-comprehended, re-understood What they call a higher octave They use musical terms You know, they say this is one octave And you get to lift to the next one They say any song can be played in multiple octaves Into infinity So you can lift to the next level And then you sort of begin to have that experience Of the ocean and the sky Which doesn't necessarily conform To what they would say is the data of history What things, what we've been taught That things should mean Because that's what they've always meant It sounds like they look at this Level of reality, this agreement This level of consensus reality As like a blindfold almost It's like we've been, it's obscuring Yeah, it is I mean I don't know if they call it a blindfold But it's what we've been taught to expect And we're all, I mean I know What it means to be a man Because I grew up in a male body In a culture that says this is what a man is And we go into sort of a conferring of that I think in every area of our life In this energetic work Because I remember when we did the live show And just not being prepared For the energy that was blasting out of you When you were doing it And people in the audience were crying Because no one, I don't think anyone was right I don't know, it was pretty shocking So the work you're doing It's not just data It's a healing work Where you're blasting people I'm sorry to use that term Invigorating people with this energy That's pushing them up an octave Yeah, I mean I don't know that I'm doing it I think it's what happens The guides that I work with work with They call them claims of truth or attunements That are spoken That actually they say encodes the energetic field To have this lifting And it's experiential I mean I'm not a spiritual teacher I'm not a guru I have no interest in that stuff at all But I'm a channel And I sit down in the chair and I hear And there's this energy That's very palpable That comes through when I work But the point is not to feel the energy That's broadcasting through Paul It's attuning to that in yourself So that you can do the lifting And when you do the lifting You get to lift everything that you encounter It's all about co-residence So what happened when we worked You know before an audience is The energy showed up People did the attunements Everybody sort of got their lifting And then they're going What the hell just happened And the nice thing is Is that they were feeling it You were feeling it And I think what that supports Is the individual's ability To claim their own knowing And the moment you claim your own knowing You're not deferring to other people Which is super important Super important isn't it? Oh you can get in so much trouble Well this is the This is what people are saying I'd love to hear your thoughts on this People are saying that One of the great problems With social media right now Is that it's Attuning people To a variety Of flavors Of this particular reality that we're in From the most paranoid To insanely naive To some tricky thing put out In a situation to look like a thing That it isn't But it's all these tuning forks And so people are going on Twitter And they're getting psychic infections From concepts, ideas That point to a reality That isn't even here It's just something that someone made up So yeah it sounds like If we can figure out Who we are Truly Then we might not be so prone to being lost Or dragged about by ideas That we're seeing in the mainstream media I don't know that we can figure it out I think that we can realize it And I think figuring out is still Sort of a process of the personality I want to get all the pieces And I want to make sense of them And then I'm going to know who I am And then how to operate And I'll know what's true and what's not true Because I figured it out And what the guide says You know what's true is always true And has always been true And will always be true And so to align to a level of truth Then you get to move into realization Because to know something To truly know it is to realize it And that's then to be in your own knowing And once you're in your own knowing You're not in energetic accord With the bullshit You see what I mean? So it sort of doesn't resonate At that level It's challenging for me Because I still have an investment In what I think should be there And how people should see me And you know how I should be understood And that's again all just a small self The true self that I am Couldn't care less What anybody thinks Do you understand? Yeah So I'm probably not answering your question It was actually a good one Because I'm even forgetting how you said it If you want to say it again I can go back in Well it's the question The question is It's more of an observation That the importance Of understanding attunement Well it's everything You see Because attunement is your energetic alignment So you know In the new age You hear people say You know I create my own reality You know And I think that's a little narcissistic sometimes You know Like in the guides would say You know you didn't create the war In the Middle East But you're in energetic accord with it Which means you're attuned to it Because everything that you see And I see and anybody sees We're in energetic accord with Because it couldn't exist without us And this is this whole idea of You know whatever we're witnessing We're in vibrational accord too And actually sort of supporting The manifestation of You know which goes to this idea of Well here was the example Because they dictated This was in one of their books You know in the guides books And I said I mean does that mean If there's a book on a table in Paris I'm in accord with the book on the table in Paris And they said yes The moment you know That there's a book on the table in Paris Yes Because your consciousness is informing the book Wow And how you hold anything in consciousness Supports your relationship to it And the collective is doing this So the guides say You know as long as you are in agreement to war Because you expect it Because you've always have it You're going to keep claiming it Right And you've got to lift to a level of consciousness Where that is not present In order to be able to claim another reality Got it Beautiful But you know this is not to go back to it It's just Okay An Uber driver told me something That I think about to this day He was talking about weapons manufacturers And he said If you're making umbrellas You need it to rain You got it And so Right Now this is where It gets really creepy to me Which is that There are a group of people attempting to attune all of us To a paradigm where war is acceptable Yes Yeah And it's fear You know the guides say again and again and again The action of fear is to claim more fear And if you look at the last choice you made in your life Because you were afraid See what it got you And more than likely you'll see you got more fear So every choice made in fear perpetuates That vibratory accord And every choice you're making in love I would suggest Or without fear Of actually supporting a whole other trajectory Right So you know the idea That we're claiming these things You see I mean I was in New York during 9-11 You know I lived downtown You know and then in the months and months that followed There were you know red alerts and yellow alerts And orange alerts And for the first five months everybody was so frightened Sure And then we got sick of these damn alerts And people just sort of get in the subway again You know and live their lives and the alerts went away We stopped going into agreement That we should be scared all the time And if we're going to be scared all the time We're very easy to control And I do believe that So the idea is to sort of realize The aspect of our self or the true self What the guides would say That is operating beyond fear And move into that level of vibrational accord Right Wow God it's so cool It's just such a great paradigm I want to get back into something I was asking about earlier This okay so this is your The way you're talking about this sort of This universe is that we live in a place That we sort of agreed to be at With a group of beings or people or things That vibrate at that level But simultaneously to that There is another version of this Another lens Another I don't know God it makes me think like this is all computer code And there's another operating system We can reprocess the code through That could make this look completely different So how different does this other place get How different does it get from this place Are there palatial heavenly mansions Are there you know forests I don't get that I actually don't get that I mean I get that what we're doing is We're experiencing what exists But we're experiencing it in a very different way And how we experience it actually transforms The reality of what we're experiencing So everything gets lifted So the idea I think that we're excluding things You see from the divine From the sort of the tapestry that's life That we're saying well this should be here And it should all look like a celestial heavenly palace Because that's what heaven should look like Is actually deciding what gets excluded Which we're doing again by relying on all that old data Of what's good, what's bad, what's beautiful, what's not So you know in the most recent book The one they just finished dictating another one You know because the books are all just sort of The recordings, the transcriptions of the dictations They're unedited transcripts of these sessions This I interrupt a lot to say What does it look like, what does it look like What are you really talking about What's our experience of this And I suspect I mean if I were to try to remember What they said and I may have to bring them through And let them do this at some point Because it's just I tend to not to interpret it terribly terribly well They're saying what you see is what's always been there They're saying but operating at a higher level And your congruence with that is what transforms you Is what transforms you and the landscape and the landscape They're saying the landscape is lifted They're saying is lifted by your presence by your presence And by the octave that you express in the high note The high note calls all things to it It calls all things to it and lifting and lifting The high note What are some other names for the high note Is this the God Ed? Yes if you wish to call it This thing yes if you wish to call it that Call it the vibration of truth You may call it love This thing you may call it love if you want to If you want to They're saying but these are other ways Of knowing God To know God is to know truth is to know truth And to know love and to know love It really has nothing to do with it They're saying with religion it's a state of consciousness A state of consciousness and an awareness of unity With all sorts of things They're saying with all that's always been expressed But not experienced but not experienced By the personality structure who is an alignment Who is an alignment by its nature By its nature to limitation to limitation Okay okay So this makes beautiful sense to me But I have a sense and many people have a sense That there is an active shift happening That there's some kind of intentionality behind Perhaps the other beings like your guides To try to up level this place Is that truly happening? Yes I get that you know But I also get this they're saying for me Now that I've got them plugged in They're like saying say this But I know if they want to say it They're pointing to me So what they've said in their books And they said this in the very first book Which they brought through in 2009 Was the very first one It was like seven of them now But they said that humanity Is a state of reckoning And a reckoning is a facing of oneself And all of one's creations And everything that's been created in fear And that includes institutions and religions And everything else has got to be reclaimed Or renown or realized and new in a higher way Because everything is going to start falling But basically everything is falling apart And that's actually part of this process I believe of sort of acclimating to To a higher potential There's no way to get to this higher potential Without some kind of collapse? That I don't know I hear that that's choice You're choosing it right now I hear you're choosing it right now Your investment In what has been How you've known yourself How you have known yourself As in fact the issue is in fact the issue When you claim something new When you claim something new And try to hold the old And try to hold the old You move into a junction You move into a juncture A juncture of frustration Of frustration to release the old To release the old is not destroyed Is not to destroy It's a claim what can come In its place It is to claim what can come In its place Many of you decide to ruin things Many of you decide to ruin things Before you can rebuild Before you can rebuild It's not because But they're saying But it's not a prerequisite How many beings are there Like your guides out there I have no clue And I've never asked I mean I work with this little posse And I just know of them as a posse Because they use we It's not like I'm looking around The room at them all the time Many many What they're saying is many many And more than you can even imagine That's pretty true But there are aspects of each of you Know it or not know it or not That are enlisted Enlisted in this operation So the true self is imbued with you So the true self of each of you Who comes forth with yours Who comes forth to be realized In this engagement In this engagement Is contributing to the shift It's not all external It's not all external It's quite internal It's quite internal It was done The realization of the divine That must be inherent That must be inherited All manifestation In all manifestation Is what is being claimed Is what is being claimed God in the tree God in the tree God in your foot God in your foot God in the one you can stand God in the one you can stand In that situation In that situation That you find abhorrent That you find abhorrent To lift all things To lift all things to a higher agreement To a higher agreement Is to know and to realize And to realize the divine exists The divine that exists Wherever you are Wherever you are Period Thank you That's amazing And it brings me to a question I did have for you And the guide Which is Right now we are seeing A true reckoning happen And a lot of different levels The Supreme Court justice Experiencing the results Of his karma This crucial moment in his life People are so angry with each other And the guides have mentioned this See God in the abhorrent This I think for me I get to this part And I can intellectually understand But in practice When we run into beings Who have legitimately heard us When we were kids You know when we were helpless How do we see How to do this How to forgive How to connect At that level When someone's really, really vile Well they're saying they'd like To take the song Which is just as well I mean because I struggle with it too And I get it And I also get that I'm not doing this For the other person I'm doing this for myself Because basically By tethering myself Or aligning myself To that other person At that level of judgment Or fear or anger I'm lowering my own vibration That doesn't mean That I don't get to feel my feelings And move beyond them But it goes to this simple idea Again of what you damn, dams you back You know in one of their books They do this meditation Or they say you know Imagine you're walking into a cave And in that cave is the one person You never want to see again As long as you live And your job now Is to lead that person out of the cave And you know you're doing that Because basically you've put them there And they've called you To the darkness that you put them in Do you understand that? So it's not about going out To dinner with them And saying hey it wasn't that great I mean maybe after this lifetime We get to have a big yuck About all the crazy crap we went through But that's not where I'm at now at all So let me go to the guides with this The idea is simple They're saying the idea is simple Nothing can be outside of God Except that which you place there If you want to do what you may If you want to do it you may But then you call that to you But then you call that to you That's how you want to operate If that's how you want to operate You may choose it You may choose it Learn those lessons And learn those lessons You will learn regardless Of what you choose But if you want to learn through fear By a hard teacher It will be a hard teacher period They're saying period There's something that they wrote It was in I think it's in the book That's just coming out And they said you know Right after They did this odd lecture And they said so what's happening now And this is before a lot of the stuff That we're seeing in the media Really hit And they said what's happening now Is an excavation They said imagine that everything That was buried in your backyard Is in your backyard You know what you buried Five months ago And 5,000 years ago Individually and collectively It's all coming up to the surface And it's coming up to the surface To be re-seen Or realized or renown Because it can't be healed When we're sitting on it And hiding it Do you understand that So then this becomes Then a part of the process Not a comfortable one I don't think But they say imagine Looking at that backyard With all the potholes And piles of dirt I mean it's an excavation site And that seems to be a little bit Of where we may be In this process now My father just passed away And I don't know what it has to do with that Or that I have a child On the way or what it is But suddenly I've been having Just photographic memories From my childhood Huge blind spots in my childhood Just missing years Now suddenly Holy shit man All coming back And a lot of it is really Difficult to look at And man I just don't I don't know that we're ready If people are ready To deal with this kind of excavation It is pretty intense To see these things And then have to find forgiveness You have to figure out a way I think it's happening anyway Do you know? I think it's happening anyway I mean I think letting go Of the need to blame Is an important part of it Because I think that that ties us To the problem You know and not to move beyond And that's not to deny That things don't happen And people do awful things I don't think that that's ever been the teaching But I mean they say That the guides have said You know the one that's doing These things that you would call terrible Is operating in a complete Unawareness of who he or she truly is You know they're operating in fear And at the cost of their true nature Which the guides would say Is the divine self They say that the divine is present Everybody regardless of what they've done How they think of themselves And whether or not they know Or even agree to it And when they work with these attunements Which they call claims of truth And you know one of them is I know who I am in truth I know what I am in truth I know how I serve in truth I am free I am free I am free I am free Now the personality self Can't really claim that My personal self is like Well I'm this old And I look like this And I wish I looked like that And I should have done this And that's at the level of the true self Or the eternal self Whatever you want to call it That is the aspect of self That does know who he or she or it is So the claim is always true I know who I am I know what I am What means in manifestation The divine that has come in form As who and what you are And I know how I serve Simply means how I express How you express as that Aspect of the divine That's your expression And you know in truth means In the field of truth Where the lie When they say in truth the lie Can't be held So you move to that level of agreement And the claim I am free Is basically I am free of the lies Of what I've been taught to believe That allows me to express this So this is the challenge That's always true I can say to you now I know who you are in truth I know what you are in truth I know how you serve in truth You are free You are free You are free And at the causal level That's always true Even you say that can't be true My life's a mess And I don't understand I don't know who I am But you're claiming the true self Now when you do that You're actually aligning The person you're claiming it to To be able to shift to that Level of frequency It's kind of like plugging in numbers On a jukebox And the song will play You're not changing people You're claiming what's always true The challenge is to do that To the one you can't stand And then the one you think is a villain Or a abhorrent Because it's got to be true For that person as well Or it's not true for anybody And this idea that some people Are special and nice and good And they get to go to some idea of heaven At the end of life If they've behaved well At the exclusion of all those people That don't agree with us I mean that's the hypocrisy of religion I mean if God is everything It's got to include everything And even fear And the gods say fear is of God It just refuses to believe that it is And once that wakes up We're not going to have that issue And we can go to that place By lifting above it To the higher octave See when you're operating at What they call the higher octave By nature of your being Which is the claim I know how I serve You're lifting into expression What you say Because how could you not It's this old idea that God Or whatever you want to call God Sees God in everything Can't exclude Then you've got a punishing God Who says this one goes to heaven This one goes to hell And I think we have Carmen We have our choices And the ramifications of our choices That play out And that's a way to learn We can learn through fear If we want to We've been doing it But what the gods say is You've created the means For your mass destruction In the pretense That it's going to make you safe Which is crazy If you think about it To build a bigger bomb So you can be more safe Is insane You understand But that's where we've come to So we're really at this place now Of the need for great change Yeah A quick word from our sponsors Much thanks to the good people of RX Bar For supporting this episode of the DTFH If you've ever found yourself Looking at the ingredients in a protein bar And wondering if the recipe came From a page in the Necronomicon Then RX Bar is for you Do you really want to pour Bizarre chemical amalgamations Into your sweet body temple?

is just You're so good at describing this And always my mind gets blown Hanging out with you But to me What's really interesting about what you're doing And the Structure of it Is that when you consider The combination of what you're talking about With technology You know because what we're seeing is like oh I get it Like on social media we're just seeing people Who using your guides Teachings have aligned themselves With fear And so these are the fear tweets On either side right or left Whatever it may be the leftists are You know going to lead a communist uprising You know the conservatives Have no it's not it's a fucking oligarchy Clearly And all the stuff in between Man the economy is really going to Climb national debt is insane Then like my god the Chinese Have made like a Crazy UFO level thing And it looks like the Russians They have shit in the floating In orbit right now that like I don't know if you saw the rushing Nesting doll satellite Spits out these three little satellites You know what the other ones are doing up there So what I'm saying is and I'm sorry To be part of it but I don't feel afraid I'm just giving examples So we have this constant Sort of low level fear drone Bubbling up out of social media So what you're saying to me is a little revolutionary Which is the idea that Should we attune ourselves to this other level This seeing god and all things Or this like Shift to the New octave that you're describing Or that with social media Yeah now we've got Something crazy because when You know the Buddha achieves enlightenment under the Bodhi tree and look how long it takes for the Dharma To spread around the planet a long time But what you're talking about We just need a few people to get To the place that you're at right now To achieve this attunement right And then when that hits Technology whoa It's revolutionary I hope I mean I think it can be if somebody wants to take On you know it's not I'm not the teacher you know I'm a channeler I explain what comes through me But the guides that come through Are the teachers I'm just this guy That's trying to work through it I want to talk to you about this real quick And Maybe it's a little mundane Compared to the very beautiful Ideas your guides are putting forth But one thing I've noticed Is this separation Between you and the writing You don't remember some of it You have a kind of Humility when it comes to it And then also you Do say quite often I'm not really A teacher I'm a channeler So I'm really interested in this Do you feel like this is a Necessary separation to continue Your work like if one Could tangle up the other It's not intentional I mean I'll say that it's not premeditated You know I was you know I was a college Teacher for years and I was a good teacher And I loved doing it and that was a great part It was the healthiest part of my life I was doing the channeling Stuff and the energy work In a whole very Quiet way for many years I had a group that met in my apartment for 18 years I had a website finally without My name on it or my photograph Because I didn't want people to know That I was doing this stuff because I was trying To maintain this other life So some of that and then I realized that It was fear and then once I started Getting attention for the books I had to Accept the fact that you know I was party to this experience And I don't claim The separation I mean it's not I think there's an Emerging that happens When I'm working And that I'm accessing a higher Part of myself but I don't think That the guides are my higher self That I'm bringing through I think They're working In a somewhat different way I can't explain it all I just know that You know I'm accessing stuff That I don't think I could know and I don't Think however articulate I may be As a man I'm capable of closing My eyes and dictating You know six or seven books that don't require Any editing which is how these things Have happened you know I mean there's I don't go back and fix anything So the separation Pieces for me I but I do think And I do think this is important I do Think that what's happening as I do This work is I begin To be more as My true self and That they operate through me You know in a more of a place Of union so it's not This crazy up And down that it used to be As I get more comfortable here Do you have a Physical side that you feel them on Do you feel them in your body Or no no I mean there's Phenomena for me I mean When I sometimes When I first started doing this years ago I literally used to feel that somebody had Their lips pressed against my far head And I was feeling the vibration of the words As they and then I would form them With my lips which is sort of how I got into this whispering and repeating habit Because there was this slight delay As it went from the buzzing Here to the mouth And now Very often before I start To channel before I'm doing a group Or a dictation for the book and the books Are now done in front of groups so you know There's no separation there I'll feel a lot of pressure At my head at the crown or At the third eye or sometimes I'll just Feel myself enveloped in the energy I mean I can be Sick I can have I channel The end of the last book I think with You fever you know And they were the guides were fine When I saw you you were sick Is there some correlation between this If you're running this circuitry Through you do you feel like it's It could make you protein Yeah I think it can and I think Some of that's my self care Which I have to learn and I'm much Better with than I used to be truthfully But I think my nervous system Is what's used so when I'm Channeling a lot I'm highly raw You know I mean you could drop a Fork in the next room and I jump out of My skin I mean it's just like my nerve And it's like it's like having a sunburn I have friends that call it psychic burn So I don't think this is not I think this is not uncommon So that's some sensitivity But I think I get a lot of calls because I'm riding on airplanes all the time And you know and I'm schlepping Through different time zones So no I don't think that there's that Is interesting I've been told I haven't seen It that when I'm really channeling Sometimes and I'm working directly With individuals my eyes turn bright blue I mean I have hazel eyes you know And I think that that's Interesting and it's funny because I'll do a group and I'll say And you know and there's a thing where The guys will just go around them and look At everybody and attune them you know Individually and people raise Their hands and you have the most beautiful Blue eyes as well I don't have blue eyes And it goes what you know and that's What they've seen so I mean I understand I don't know what it is You know so there's a physical component To this but and this is true for all of us What they've said is we've been raised To believe that the divine is sort of Up there somewhere in a cloud Maybe and we're stuck here in the mud And the teaching is that God is the mud And God is also the body And the exclusion of the body From this equation of the divine Is what is precluding us From realizing the divine And the physical reality that we're Living in so that's the claim I know what I am which is informed Which allows me then to know What you are which is the Realization of the divine expressing As you and the matter itself and vibration Wow why It's so weird why Why can't we acknowledge it It's insane it really is like when I look around everything's Perfect I can see that most Of the time my God just form itself My God look how incredible it is That we have physics Gravity it's all very beautiful To me but then In darker times As soon as the focus goes From there to me That's where you're like no What a nightmare creature This is completely a mess Why Why do we do that I hear Training agreement Vibratory accord What you choose to reinforce What you've been taught That's what we've been taught What we've been confirming I don't think that the way the guides Are bringing through is necessarily a new teaching I mean they say it comes they've been teaching This stuff for thousands of years and That this is the next opportunity For realization for us you know It's not new stuff so You know I can accept that but I think that the indoctrination Into fear was pretty extraordinary Which is still present You should be afraid you know Is this from your parents is this from Yeah it was I mean In this lifetime yeah you know I mean I believe That I've had prior lives where I've had some tough lessons in fear too But yeah I mean I was the chubby Kid that got bullied you know So that carries some weight And you know as I move Beyond that my experience Of myself is very different in the world But those buttons were put there yeah That's it Oh my god it's just It's a it's a brutal Back there is so rough on kids I think it's because I have a son coming And I'm just thinking like man I want him to be like Loved here and it's It's so brutal like And then when I contemplate my own teachings And the teachings I got And the teachings many of us got When we're born that we were taught This is not a safe place And that there's no real Security here and that they're always on Depending not everyone but if you were born Into like a poor family Or you were born into alcoholism Trauma man it's a pretty Rocking universe sometimes it feels like There's no way to truly Get that For lack of a better word Thorn out of our sides We can expand beyond It but the guides Or do you have anything to say about The idea that there's a potential To shift All of that suffering into something I'm going to ask because I can yes I'm going to say yes if you want to But do you really want It means forgetting who you think you are Who you think you are and who you think you are Is wounded and hurt is wounded and hurt And suffering and suffering And you look for agreement to that Tell me my life tell me in my life How I can be these things how I will continue To be these things And you perpetuate them Unconsciously unconsciously the true self is you The true self as you who knows Who he is who knows who he is has never been harmed Has never been harmed knows himself And wholeness knows himself And wholeness and seeks to confirm that And seeks to confirm that We are not dismissing what you feel But what we are saying is It is not who you are It's how you have known yourself And how you have chosen to have To agree to your life To your life agreement and support Agreement means accord not conscious Choice not conscious choice You are confirming your reality You are confirming your reality Through the identity you claim I am a wounded man I am a wounded man Supports that reality supports that Reality it's hard to get better It is hard to get better to transform Or to transform creates a long path Creates a long path you may Awaken a moment you may awaken In a moment your true nature To your true nature but at the cost Of what you have known And that's the great challenge here And that's the great challenge here Are you willing to release The idea of who you are Of who you are it's just an idea It's just an idea nothing more And nothing more period It's like addiction Or something it feels like They're talking about like there's a sense That we're hooked On fear Because your guides keep saying You can do this But there's other ways And this feeling of like You've got to give it all up You've got to let it all go It seems like a This is a thing that happens to me Invariably when I take a psychedelic Depending on how strong the psychedelic is If it completely just blasts my ego And there is no way to hold on To a beautiful transcendent unification Complete this I don't know There's a million different ways to describe this state But if it's If ever I find myself At the place Where there is a chance to die To let go until just say goodbye To the tiny little corner Of the infinite universe I've claimed as myself I just can't do it It seems like Like I don't know Once you get to that point That your guides describe it's just a self It feels like well for guides Perhaps for you A world renowned channeler For many of us this concept of laying down our identity Letting go of the past Truly It's terrifying because it feels like a kind of extinction Well yeah but it can't be done At the level of personality And that's the whole challenge here We're still thinking we can do this through the personality And it's never going to happen there And that's why I think they say it takes a moment Because it's really Only in a moment that realization occurs You know it's not necessarily And that's not like It's a quick fix It's not a fix at all It's another way of knowing the self Now when I'm channeling I am operating I'm actually putting What you can call the personality itself In the backseat of the car I'm like giving it a magazine to read And this other thing is happening And as I maintain that I begin to have this other Experience of knowing In my life You know when I work psychically Which is one of the things I do They call me a medium for the living So I can tune into somebody and You know I've never met It's not in the room it's still got a body And I can often hear them And feel what it's like to be in their skin And sometimes take on their mannerisms And that's how I do it I just call it stepping in But when I'm working at that level I'm operating in my knowing Do you understand this? Because it makes no logical sense You can't try to figure out how that's done You know it by doing it Like the guide say you know When you're standing under the shower head You're not trying to feel the water The water is there When you're standing in the wind You're experiencing the wind That's vibrational accord So I don't think Do I walk around with my complaining personality Self ask my friends I had a friend this morning that says Let's just have a good day Don't complain the answer was yes Don't complain I like complaining It's again my way of being a curmudgeon In the world But it gets me what it gets me Which isn't necessarily any good Do you understand that? I don't think that the personality is extinguished They're telling me to say this When I was Maybe 32-33 I was having a really rough time And I was opening up as a channel In those days Significantly and I'm 99.9% Sure I heard this in channel Because I wrote it down I don't think I read it some place But what I heard was Freedom will come when the throne Relinquishes its king And I was like what the What does that mean Some enigmatic statement And now I completely get it Which is freedom comes When the one who's sitting in the throne Which in my case is The personality's self Who wants everything his way And the world should treat me as I say I should be treated and this is what should be in my world That's the small self And the small self dictates A small kingdom So when the small self Steps out of the throne And the true self Which is the divine self The guides have called it at times the Christ itself And their definition of Christ is a simple one They say it's the aspect of the divine That can be realized in material form Is who and what you are Who anybody is They say in all with humanity It's the seed of the divine that seeks expression So when the true self takes the throne Then you have the kingdom They say is the awareness of the divine In all things It's already there But it needs to be seen by the one Who operates in vibrational accord to it So I don't get that it's at the Exclusion of the small self They say the small self Is actually assumed By the true self You know it's like the loving energy Of the But you can call it parent That's a rotten model because most of us Had tough times with our parents So who wants to use that one But this idea of being Having that level of alignment They even talk about the braiding of the will That the small self's will And the divine will can actually be sort of braided And then the small self's will is sort of assumed In the higher So that it becomes your expression So we're not always going well Who am I and what level am I operating at I don't know if this is making sense 100% It's beautiful because I love it Because man everyone does kick the shit out Of their small self And I especially love what you said I love complaining And I have friends who are Like that And they love that aspect of themselves They're like I love being a curmudgeon It's the best That is so perfect And this self-flagellation we do Is Something I definitely forget all the time It's not as though we have to Throw ourselves into some cosmic Ashtray and become some other thing I love that The self that we are Gets to experience this embrace Gets filled up so it doesn't have to be So Deflated I guess Are people a little deflated Cut off from the spirit Is that what's happening People have a tourniquet wrapped around them I think so because I think everything People come to the workshop sometimes I say so I have a great spiritual life But how do I bring this into my business life And the question makes no sense Because it's your life Your spiritual life is your life It's your sex life It's your financial life You don't segment these parts By having a practice and wearing A bunch of white and meditating Every day Those are things you can do As a household and business You're still responsible for that Do you understand that and you're operating At a level of vibration that's going to call To you the ramifications Of those choices So the tourniquet I think has I mean the idea of becoming Spiritual as if it's something that one Becomes I don't think one becomes Spiritual I think it's your innate being That's seeking expression But this idea that this has to happen At the cost of other things That I think happened at the cost Of who you think you are But that's an idea Nothing more than that I don't know if I'm answering this well But the idea of the tourniquet Because when I first got into this stuff I didn't know what to do with anything I didn't know if I was allowed To have a good time I didn't know what it meant And yes That's choice too We get choice, we have choice You want to express yourself What's your greatest joy Whatever your expression of your greatest joy Is going to bring joy to others There's no question about that Wow, this is so great The only thing I take issue With any of the things that you say Is that you say you're not a teacher To me it really makes me scratch My head because I think Well you are teaching You have guides, they're teachers But how are you not a teacher I'm better, I'm more engaged Than I used to be But I call myself The guy that sits in the chair And when people come to Hear me speak I'll introduce myself and tell my story Enough so that people have a context For who I am And then I close my eyes And I'll hear one phrase repeated Again and again until I speak it And the moment I speak it I'm operating as a radio And the radio itself Isn't necessarily the one to judge The broadcast or to decide about it So the teachings that come through me I can then go back and discuss But I'm not necessarily And I say this quite honestly I'm not there yet So I can tell you what I understand They mean But am I operating without fear No, you know The difference is I know What I'm operating in fear I'm looking to excuse it And I'm not looking for other people To buy into that And support me in my fear I might be looking for a pat on the back Or a hug, you know But I'm not looking for you to agree With me that the world is a terrible place And we should all be afraid And stockpiling guns in our basement Or there's some terrible thing How close are you to that? In your personality I grew up in a home like that Preppers? You mean preppers like people Who thought the apocalypse No, no, no, no Just scared The idea that the next thing That would happen would be terrible No matter what So you're living in a world where you're expecting The other shooter drop all the time And that's lasted I carry that Still if I look at an email and say What's the bad news Necessarily that it's going to be loving And I have to say And I was thinking about this this morning If I could move to a place Truly move to a place Which I hope And I'm sort of putting this out there as a request To my peeps The idea that if I could move to a place Where I could really get The universe as loving As a loving place That would totally remake My whole consciousness And the thing is I believe that's true intellectually But I'm so busy looking at the evidence To the contrary and affirming that That I keep getting it And when I say loving I don't think that that means that people don't die And people don't get hurt And people don't make terrible Errors of judgment Because I think we do And I also think these become our opportunities To learn and to grow You don't learn and grow It's the same None of us do So if I could get to this place Where I felt that the world Was more welcoming At that simple, simple level Because some people I know live there And they grew up that way And I'm like wow, that's so interesting to me I don't come from that But I believe that it's so So the teacher in me And he's a good teacher Can show up And I'm a student of the work still And maybe when I teach this stuff I'm also teaching myself To understand and that's how I learn it But the day has yet to come And I don't know if it will for some time Where it's a weekend workshop With Paul Selig and Paul Selig's not channeling Because the guides When the guides come through I can carry the energy I operate as a conduit for this stuff And the energy is Quite Powerful for most people Which is nice But I don't confuse the energy With me And if I start doing that I move into ego and then I move into Look at how great I am Another psychic once said to me Paul, there's a reason you don't fully own this Because you'd be impossible if you did And I think that that can be true Too This is the universal problem It's like This is not universal But many of us run into this predicament And the By us, I just mean people are trying to Make the world better Or are you just a sense like Fuck, I think there is a way to really help this place Get Get a little prettier Than it is right now Or a little more connected Or prettier is a lame way to describe it But it's so funny As I'm talking to you They're awesome, they're amazing Watching you do it Inevitably is just One of the craziest things I've ever seen But you're awesome, man And I think that Finding That place of realizing like Well, the guides are cool Well, they're cool But man, you've got a greater You've got an awesome personality And that way that you're breaking down To me is like a real teaching You know, it's interesting I love that you're honest about it We're so imprinted, you know Like all you need to do is be The rotund child And experience the Many deep Hardcore humiliations happening Each day And then throw on top of that Any kind of turbulent family And you've got more neurons in your brain Than at any other time in your life You're like, oh, you're a wax And this Wax is being imprinted And it's a deep imprint, man You know, it's a deep imprint I don't know, though, when I look back on this You know, I didn't get into this stuff Because my life was going so great I really didn't, you know I had a list of things that I Thought I had to do in the world to be okay You know, by the time I was 25 And I got the whole list, you know I wanted to, I had just gotten out of Yale I was, you know, a playwright I was being produced I wanted to be an interview magazine So I could get a hot date, you know I got the whole thing And then I was sort of bottoming out In the Gopher Campus Motor Lodge In St. Paul, Minnesota Where I couldn't find drugs, you know I mean, this was my party days Where we're about to come to an abrupt Abrupt end And I started praying for the first time in my life You know, because I was raised an atheist And a few days later I heard a voice Telling me to get my act together And that was the first voice, you know So the idea That I got to go through What I went through to come to To be who I am That doesn't mean that I think I'm noble Because I had a... A lot of people have crappy childhoods, you know I mean, this doesn't make you special But I do think that Everything is an opportunity to learn And if I can put To begin to frame experience that way Then I don't experience Myself as being a victim And that allows me then To go on this journey But if I'm so busy blaming You know, which was an easy place for me to get stuck in I'm not going to... I'll get more of the same of that Oh my God, it's so easy to do This is a question, if you don't mind May I ask one more question Of you and maybe of the guys And can we do an attunement again Through the podcast? For the listeners, people listening So my question is Based on this idea that you mentioned Which is like, okay, if I see my past As a lesson Then I can work with it Whereas if I see it as some chaotic thing And now I'm a victim, then it's just What are you going to do? You're just going to propagate the misery I have been taught by people I respect that we choose these Incarnations And that all of that stuff Has been given to us as a gift To evolve our consciousness I believe it In my mind, but in my heart I think, come on We see So much suffering in the world I see children Dying in Syria And it feels to me Like this idea that, oh no, no, we choose this Is a way to try to Fix a concept That there's just evil in the universe And rotten things happen I think rotten things happen I think evil's a tricky word I think the guides talk about it in one of the recent books And I don't remember what they said About it, but they do talk About a spectrum of high and low And they say when they talk about an octave They talk about the low notes and the high notes Do you understand that? But it's all still existing as Of God Whatever you want to say So in a lot of this stuff that we call suffering Or is created by us We're the ones doing it And we perpetuate it We're responsible to that So I'm going to go and see if the guy could love to They're saying we would love to I'm going to see if I can do this when we have anything to say Saying we have a few things to say about the question About the question of why you're all choosing You're all choosing individually And collectively and collectively When you incarnate their opportunities Many of you get your lessons Many of you get your lessons through challenges Through challenges that's only one way to learn That's only one way to learn If you wish to perpetuate the challenges You've had You will learn through them Until you can learn no more When humanity decides He has had enough She has had enough Of perpetuating shame And greed And separation You will learn your lessons differently War is an act of greed Greed is an act of fear Greed is an act of fear The choice of fear Is to claim more fear Much of what you describe Much of what you describe as born in fear Is born in fear That does not absolve it That does not absolve it of its responsibility Of its responsibility You make choices in fear In fear And are accountable to your choice The collective is as well The collective is as well Now if you are here to learn You are now here to learn That you are participatory In the collective Stop thinking so small Stop thinking so small Your alignment Your alignment The divine as you Has come to be realized Claims the divine And everyone else in everyone else By nature of your being By nature of your being When the collective lifts And a new agreement To what humanity is To what humanity is And how it can be known These things you describe Will cease to exist Will cease to exist In the ways that they have Because they are creations Of fear They are reminding you That there can be no god That there can be no god When in fact what they are When in fact what they are Emblemizations outpicturing Outpicturing of fear based choice Of fear based choice and agreement And agreement by and through the collective By and through the collective period Period Wow That is crazy to be around Man I don't know What people around you do But that is the strangest It's a strange feeling You create a warp My friend talks about this How some people can warp the room I've seen really great comics to it Where the room, the energy field The room bends or something It's the craziest feeling Wow Man that is so odd I want to do an attunement If you don't mind What people are going to want to find you But I want to point one little thing out And it's mundane again But when you mention this feeling When you do your work and resonate with people Somewhere else and essentially Become them And I've heard this described I haven't seen it and I don't think I'm ready for it yet But you know The other place that I've heard that sense of Oh it's a feeling, it's not from imitation It's from feeling Commedians who are really really good At doing impersonations And they will describe it as a feeling Like there's a sense that they get And then they do it They do the impression And so it's fascinating to me to hear you describe The same thing except You don't even know who it is You're doing the impression The thing is I would put money on the fact That if those same comics were given the name Of somebody and they did the same thing With the name of somebody they didn't know The level of accuracy that you might find In their depiction I was a playwright when I was younger So that was becoming character was Something that I could do And when I Started doing readings I didn't know that I could do this until I did it And there was some woman who mentioned her father's name And my eyes were closed And she gasped, I opened my eyes and said Oh my god you started to look just like him And then I found out that I could do it all the time What I didn't know was I was always tuning in Do you understand I just didn't know that I was doing it Because nobody had ever told me that it was possible So In some ways I was trained for what I do Because I used to induce Before I wrote creatively I was inducing trance I put on one piece of music for hours Until I just would hear Character, do you understand? And you know I had the worst writer's block of anybody I've ever known in my life And now the books that are dictated through me take days 30 days is on average 30 days of sessions That can be spread out over a month or two now But the first book was two and a half weeks Every day sitting in a chair The second one was a month And it was like a 500 page book No editing Yeah it's funny but We're not as separate as we think Do you understand this And once you understand that Your experience becomes more fluid In your ability to feel what other people feel And know what they think I mean they film me once for a TV thing With this mother in the room And she gave me the name of her kid And I tuned into the kid And I didn't know anything about the mother or the kid And they intercut me With the film of the footage of the kid And the kid had turned out to have cerebral palsy And you saw me sort of Claw up and rock in the chair And hit myself in the head And I went deaf on that thing And I didn't know what the hell was going on But I watched that about 20 times Because I couldn't really believe it Because normally when you say Oh my god you look just like my girlfriend I'm going good I'm glad She said that to me yesterday Good I'm glad But the evidence I think is available to everybody So your comic friends are probably Doing it more than they know Cool This was beautiful Thank you so much I have so much to integrate and think about now It's my pleasure Can you give people Can you tell people how to find you Sure it's my website Is paul at paulseleg.com It's P-A-U-L-S-E-L-I-G Got it One question Did you want to do the atuma did I use up time No if you have the time I would love to do it I'm happy to do it I'm going to let the guides do it I'm not going to do it They're saying sit back if you wouldn't imagine this And imagine this That there is an aspect of you Who knows who he is Who is unafraid Knows who she is Knows who she is There is an aspect of you Seeking to announce herself Seeking to announce herself in realisation In realisation as who and what she is As who and what she is In an experiential way Would you say these words after us please

step and if you are willing And if you are willing to release any ideas You may be holding Of what you are That are operating Limitation Simply say yes Then go to the next step And acknowledge this

Let's get going with today's episode with the amazing Jim Woodring. Hello, Super Compress Store houses of amnesiac alien information disguised as ambling towers of sentient meat. It is I, Duncan Tressel, and you're listening to the Duncan Tressel Family Hour podcast. And recently I came upon this amazing interview between Neil deGrasse Tyson on his podcast Star Talk and Edward Snowden. And I wanted to play a quick clip from this interview for you. We're going to ask ourselves, how will an alien want to communicate with us? Let's say, and let's say the civilization is intelligent or more intelligent than we are, they would find a pretty efficient way to send a signal to reduce the energy costs for them. Perhaps I'm making this up, but it's not a stretch to imagine this. By doing so, they would try to find any reducible information in the signal they want to send us and represent that in some other kind of way that is less representative of information. Isn't that correct? Isn't that what they would want to do? Am I even saying that right? You know, when you mention that, it brings up a really interesting idea, which is that let's say all societies that have open communications, they have communications over there, under the ground, eventually discover that they need to encrypt their communications to protect them. So if you have an alien civilization trying to listen for other civilizations or our civilization trying to listen for aliens, there's only one small period in the development of their society when all of their communications will be sent via the most primitive and most unprotected means. So when we think about everything that we're hearing through our satellites or everything that they're hearing from our civilization, if there are indeed aliens out there, all of their communications are encrypted by default. So what we are hearing that's actually an alien television show or a phone call or a message between their planet and their own GPS constellation, whatever it happens to be, is indistinguishable to us from cosmic microwave background radiation. That's really trippy to think about. The cosmic microwave background radiation is actually the encrypted communication of some super advanced civilization, but it gets even weirder when you consider the concept that perhaps this encrypted information is not stored within cosmic background radiation, but is actually encoded into you, that you are the encrypted storehouse of some kind of super advanced civilization and that all you need is a key to unlock this encryption so that you could uncompress all the data stored within your being and that that key can be found in a variety of different ways, including meditation practices, psychedelics, or some unknown method that we haven't even stumbled upon yet or that was lost after the last great cataclysm. Terrence McKenna was one of the primary disseminators of the concept that mushrooms were in fact an alien communication, a kind of alien probe, and here's a clip from one of his lectures where he's talking about this. As you know, the world's largest radio telescope is at Arecibo, Puerto Rico, and as you probably know, a multi-million channel analyzer has been attached to that thing, and there's been funding for another deep space search, and so there they are at Arecibo with the world's largest radio telescope reaching out, you know, mega-marubish dicks into the universe. When you actually go there, the telescope was built into a natural bowl which they made further, they rounded out, and then they planted grass in this bowl to halt erosion. Well then to keep the grass from getting out of hand, they brought in white cows to crop the grass, so there in the grass beneath the world's largest radio telescope engaged in searching for extraterrestrial life is the mushroom in great profusion. If you wanted it, that's where you'd go and get it, and that is the perfect symbol for how we search for extraterrestrial life. It's at your feet, my friends. Shit, maybe it's not at your feet, maybe it is your feet. This is McKenna's version of the Sufi parable of Nasrudin and the donkey. Nasrudin was this trickster figure who, as the story goes, as the parable goes, would ride a donkey across the border every day, and the border guards knowing Nasrudin was a mischievous trickster would search the bags on the donkey's back, and all they would find is straw, and they couldn't figure out what was happening, but they knew Nasrudin was smuggling something day after day after day. He'd come across on a donkey all the while getting wealthier and wealthier until finally he retired in some nice house in some other country, and he ran into the customs officer who was always given him the patdown, and the customs officer said to Nasrudin, you got to tell me, Nasrudin, what was it you were smuggling? And Nasrudin said, I was smuggling donkeys. So maybe the aliens, like Nasrudin, are hiding their communication in plain sight, and the way they're hiding their information in plain sight is not by encoding it into cosmic microwave background radiation, but inside of you. Maybe human life is just encrypted alien information, and the pursuit of self-realization is that encrypted alien information trying to decode itself.

I hope you guys will come out and see me. I'm also going to be in Atlanta at the Laughing Skull, October 15th through the 18th. All of these ticket links are up at DuncanTrussell.com.

I want to thank all of you who continue, amazingly continue to use our Amazon portal. If you go to the comments section of any of the podcasts at DuncanTrussell.com and click on that portal, the next time you're going through Amazon, we'll get a very small percentage of whatever it is that you buy. I'm going to promote something here that you can get through Amazon that I recently bought. It was one of those things, as I'm buying it, I'm like, this is an impulse buy. I'm fucking up. I know that I probably shouldn't pay this much money for it. I was feeling really weird, but I did it anyway. I bought a big green egg, which is this convection oven grill thing. My god. I can't even explain how much I love this thing. The combination of this grill with marijuana and wood chips is just, it's way better. I used to think one of the, one of my favorite things to do would be to get high and play the synthesizer, which is psychedelic and lots of fun. And maybe it's just because now I'm a 41 year old old man. This is just what we like. I'll tell you, getting stoned and grilling, throwing in wood chips and playing with the vents on my convection oven grill that looks like some kind of green spaceship. It really is one of my favorite things on earth. Slathering barbecue sauce on, watching the, watching how hot the thing instantaneously gets. You can cook pizza on the thing. I'm not sponsored by them, but if you are for whatever reason in the market for a grill, even though summer is over, go get a big green egg through the Amazon portal. It's wonderful. It really is. It makes you feel good for some reason to cook with fire, plugs into some deep primordial, genetic part of whatever it is that we are. I don't know. Maybe it doesn't at all, but it's a blast.

I've been trying to get today's interview to happen for a little over a year. I made a list some time ago of the top 10 people I'd like to interview on this podcast and on that list was Jim Woodring. Jim Woodring is an artist who creates the Frank comics. If you have been so unfortunate as to have never come into contact with Frank or the UNIFACTOR, I invite you to go to your local comic bookstore or go on Amazon and order any of the Frank books immediately. They're the most beautiful, psychedelic, incredible works of art and storytelling that I've ever come across in my life. And after reading through the Frank comics, I started looking into Jim Woodring and was delighted to find that he was as mystical as his creation. And so about a year ago, I reached out to him. We weren't able to pull the interview off because he is a busy, wildly successful artist, but a few weeks ago I reached out to him again and he gave me the honor of this interview that you're about to hear. Go visit his website at JimWoodring.com and I command you to immediately go to Amazon.com or one of your local comic book shops and pick up as many copies of the Frank comics that you can find. They're going to help you decode the alien language that is wound up inside your very being. Now everyone please get those pineal glands engorged and squirt some of your sweet astral nectar in the direction of today's guest, artist, and visionary Jim Woodring. Thank you so much for being on the show. I've been looking forward to this. I think I've been trying to get an interview with you for about a year now and I really appreciate you taking the time to have a conversation with me. Well thanks Duncan and I wasn't trying to avoid you. If it seemed that way I apologize. It's been a hectic year for me and it's been hard for me to do anything outside my normal routine. You've been working really hard. You've been spending some time working on the upcoming 3D Frank book? Oh that's done. That's in the bag. That's coming out later this year. So what were you working on this year? Well for one thing I moved and that was a huge upheaval. Other than that I've just been doing what I ordinarily do drawing and painting and doing comics and trying to figure out how to produce something that somebody will want enough to give me some money for so I can continue to do it. Right. I'm sorry I'm going to start off on a sentimental note here and I hope you'll forgive me for it and maybe I'll cut it out because it's kind of sentimental. But man so in 2013 my mom was dying and I was doing stand-up and somebody at one of my shows brought me the portable Frank and I'd never seen Frank before and so I got this really cool graphic novel your graphic novel and I remember putting my suitcase and I didn't think much of it I didn't read it so I didn't you know I just had this thing that I could look at at some point but anyway my mom passed away and for whatever reason I pulled out that book and I gotta tell you I don't know what it is but something about the Unifactor and Frank meeting me in this intense moment in my life has created an infinite connection with your art and I just want to thank you for it. Well thank you for saying that that's a remarkable story and needless to say it warms my heart to hear it thanks very much. Cool man I was hoping that maybe you could just for the folks listening who might not be familiar with your work if you could explain who Frank is. You know that's really a tall order one of the big problems that I have is when I meet people and they ask what I do and I say I'm a cartoonist that is a big turn off to most people and I'm in a hurry after that to say that I'm actually a worthwhile cartoonist that I do work that adults can look at and enjoy that I do work that is appealing to seekers out of mystery and aficionados of dark corners and what might be hiding in them and also people who share an interest which just a second please people who share an interest in some sort of personal investigation into what is actually going on here. Yes. Because the driving spirit behind the Frank comics I guess you could say and it's also the the main work of my life to a to a real extent my to a real extent is that even a phrase to a large extent my work is a reflection of my personal ethos and my I hate to use this phrase but my life's path and my work combined very closely and they have frequently informed and influenced each other so all that is by way of saying that I'm not trying to be an entertainer I'm not trying to be although I guess I am in a certain way because if my work isn't on some level entertaining nobody will buy it but I'm not trying to be an entertainer and I'm not trying to produce a hit series or anything like that I'm trying to express how I feel about the world. It feels to me like you're some kind of I'm going to amplify it even more it feels like you're some kind of visionary prophet that these the the Frank books gave me the same feeling I get when I read the Bhagavad Gita it's the same kind of sense of the contact with some transcendent message that needs to be decoded or and can't totally be decoded that's what I love about it is you know I can go to the Bhagavad Gita I can open it up to any passage and I can spend all day long thinking about that particular passage and forgive me I don't mean to sound like I'm blowing too much smoke here but I can go to the Frank books they're parables you know there's some kind of mysterious parable that I won't pretend to understand completely but it fills me with that same sense of I'm in deep water here do you do you feel like you're channeling this stuff? Well first of all let me say you know that I I too am a big fan of the Bhagavad Gita I keep a copy around and I pick it up and look at it at odd moments just just to see with what what I read at that moment will tell me and it's always something that is the book of books and as far as what I do go is I guess I may as well just come right out and say something which I'm reluctant to say which is that I think I am a mystic yes for sure not which is not the same as being a prophet or a seer or a wise man or a holy man or anything like that a mystic is there's lots and lots of mystics and mystics are simply people who are attuned to the mystical or the occult or the arcane or whatever it is you want to call it I definitely have that that orientation and I've had it my whole life and it has if I could have handled it better it would have been great but it's actually caused me a certain amount of grief because I haven't really known how to see or handle or harness this runaway interest in the hidden realm well this is isn't this a relatively one of the what one of the pitfalls they say that happens to people who get afflicted with those kinds of predilections is that because you've gained access to whatever this energy source is it can I mean it it drives people and say it can drive you crazy like you can lose your mind completely and uh because whatever the power line is that you've managed to grab it's alive and uh sometimes it's not so merciful with people how how has it how do you feel it's negatively impacted your life well only socially only by making me um sufficiently confused by not only the world but my own reactions to it that it made me not exactly antisocial but socially out of step with the world around me if I had I grew up in a very conservative environment in southern california among people who had zero interest in this kind of thing religious conservative or well politically conservative glendale california lily white yes dullsville you know yep and uh it's uh if I'd known somebody who if they saw me struggling with this stuff had said at that time for example oh you should read the bogg about gita or you should pick up a book on shri ramana maharshi or shri ramakrishna or anybody who could have made me realize that there was a codified world of approaches to this kind of thing i would have been a lot better off but as it was i was just a square pegging around whole and all i felt was different and weird and definitely unappreciated but also unaccepted this is one of the big downfalls of incarnating in the west isn't it is that you you if you're born into a family that isn't familiar with the symbol systems available in a lot of the eastern scriptures and eastern mythologies you you will feel completely lost because no one in glenn i mean i'm sure people in glendale have the maps but i know that i mean when i for the i have a very similar story when i was growing up i i didn't come into contact with that information until i was in high school or so and then once you find it you're always oh this is it this is it but when did you come into contact with the those kinds of scriptures or philosophies for the first time the first time you know i can't even really say i remember when i was a little kid my folks who were not particularly religious thought that i should go to sunday school and that was okay with me because i heard that you learned about god in sunday school and that appealed to me but when i was actually there i didn't really learn anything about god i learned about Jesus in so much as he was watching over us and very worried about our sinful ways yes and i learned about daniel and the lion's den and the jawbone of the ass and the walls came tumbling down and all this crap i didn't care about i wanted to hear about you know mysterious things i wanted to hear about god and i can see how people who are born into a christian tradition who want to go beyond it can find it very difficult to do that because christian mysticism is actually very pretty deep yes there are lots of great christian mystic scriptures but they're not people don't they're not up front people aren't saying you've got to read this it'll show you the path to god what are some examples of those of those mystics oh um uh meister eckhart maybe or meister eckhart the imitation of christ by st jonathan crossed confessions of st augustine right things like that that's some heavy stuff that's to me and that's the real christianity to me that's the real deal that's the that's it everything else seems kind of just like the very very surface level of this incredibly deep fractal well i think that most people most people the overwhelming majority of people are not i don't know this is going to sound like an insult but i can't think of any other way to say it they're not really cut out for religion a serious serious religious practitioner is rare a serious a person who really takes the religious seriously from the standpoint of devoting lonely hours to sitting in meditation and contemplation and to trying to you know change their characters so that they can change their minds so that they can purify their mind in all those vedantic things um i forget how i started that sense but if people who really want to do that are not all that common have you done that i have worked at it i don't you know you said something earlier about how about how do i cope having access to these thoughts i don't really i have an interest in them and i have a practice which brings me slowly incrementally closer to understanding i can feel that but i don't have any kind of religious authority whatsoever i just have enough interest in it to express that interest in a way that is intriguing at least to me can you talk a little bit about your practice well i can i can say that you asked me when the first time i saw a scripture was you know when i started realizing that there were answers out there i started trying to find them and i found the Hare Krishna version of the Bhagavad Gita the Bhagavad Gita as it is yep it's very Christian in its emphasis on punishment for your wicked ways right and i didn't care for that although i love the paintings especially the woman boiling an oil for cooking a chicken oh my gosh or the one where the guy i i yeah the cooking a chicken lady's good the sleeping bear was that in yours like i don't recall the sleeping bear oh it's a good one it's if you sleep too much you'll incarnate as a bear and it's this it shows like a woman sleeping and then underneath i guess is this kind of depressed looking bear that i guess that's her next life uh and then um there was the butcher a butcher who's like got a cow's head really trippy fundamentalist christian style hinduism in that book for sure yeah yeah i like that and they take the hindu cosmology very seriously his his divine grace a c bhaktivedanta whatever his name was Swami Prabhupāda yes he was uh you know he was he those books i maybe even that book i mean he talks about the the sour milk sea and this all that you know all that kind of stuff which is maybe interesting and maybe not but certainly irrelevant if what you're trying to do is meditate well right i mean isn't that the uh you know it's interesting i just had a Hare Krishna Swami on the last episode and um you know very wonderful wonderful purse beautiful beautiful guy chanting Hare Krishna is just incredible you know and and i remember when i came into contact with the Hare Krishna's i didn't know that there that bhakti yoga or that mantra is way older than the international society for Krishna consciousness and it was really exciting to realize oh there's all these other forms of bhakti out there not just the fundamentalist stuff that you see in the Bhagavad Gita as it is but that fixation on the minutia of hindu mythology can be really annoying and i actually have been to vrindavan in india and i can remember watching these monks and robes getting into a rather heated argument over some obvious mythology or like what you're saying you know like like what would the composition of that ocean be or what would it feel like in your hand like stuff like that where it seems to be at first glance missing the point but this Hare Krishna that i interviewed the way he put it is all of that stuff is designed as a meditation to take up all your thought processes you know you're sort of surrendering all of your thought processes into this what i would consider to be pretty absurd symbolism but from that you can hit some kind of transcendent platform i guess well that makes perfect sense and it's obviously just exactly the right path for some people right it's not mine and i know that you know all the things that i believe in and think about and and meditate on and and questionably the Hare Krishna mantra is a great one to chant it's a wonderful use of your time but the things that i that that makes sense to me and which makes so much sense that they they constitute a superior reality are just so much nonsense to my friends i don't know anybody really outside of the people who are i know we're connected to Vedanta and they are not in my normal circle of friends i don't know anybody who is interested in the stuff that i'm in this in this religious stuff yeah and they think you know i i don't ever talk about it but on the occasions where it comes up and i do talk about it they think i'm crazy for believing in this stuff it seems as childish and as stupid to them as the idea of you know the virgin birth or infant damnation does to me oh so you're saying when you come into contact with christians and they hear that you have no no i'm talking about secular people like what is an example of some of your beliefs that they take issue with well they just take issue with the whole thing they don't like it they don't like religion and i can understand why they don't like religion if you don't feel the call and all you see averse of religion is what it does in the world it's perfectly natural to hate it think it's a maligned force that is doing infinitely more harm than good i you know sometimes i wonder if that's a force field intentionally placed there to keep to filter people out because it seems like what that's doing is it's filtering out people who see things only on the surface and it's this really kind of genius mechanism isn't it because it's what ends up happening is all these people look at the surface level of the thing and yeah if you look at the surface level you watch the news and you allow that to take up your entire to make the you take up your entire view of what religion is and yeah why would you want to bother with it it's some kind of miserable life destroying thought corrupting ultimately violent waste of your incarnation but man it sure isn't that's not what it is at all and i it's always i know what you mean it's very frustrating when you realize people don't want to push through that membrane and just go just allow themselves to suspend their disbelief in the same way they do when they watch a star wars movie no but i think i think you have to feel inwardly there has to be some part of you that says that responds when you hear something that is always looking and when it hears something that's true and that resonates it picks up on it and it wants to get closer to it right i always feel that like for me one of the distinctions is people will go out in the wilderness and they'll see some awe-inspiring thing and they'll feel a sense of holiness they'll feel a connection to to cosmos they'll feel uh you know overwhelming awareness of how fantastic and beautiful the universe is but some of us instinctively get down in our knees and say you're fantastic watch me i want to know you better i i i see i get it bring me in deeper i want to go forward you this is a fantastic billboard you've got here what are you advertising exactly show me show me bring me in wow and you you when you start looking into how you have to do that you realize the meaning behind all these words the idea of renunciation is appalling to most people yes but if you look at it in the context of what it means in order to have a spiritual life it means that you have to train your mind not to be absorbed in the real world you have to teach your mind to regard it as something to be scorned something that's not important something that gets in the way something that has to be dealt with but you renounce it in the same way you know renounce cigarettes if you're quitting smoking you say i've got to stop doing this because i want this higher thing that i can get from quitting this and it's so hard to do and people have to do it gradually and they it takes i mean what you know how many decades does it take for a person typically to get anywhere solid through meditation well and that to me has always been something very frustrating uh and something i wonder about that that idea that the process takes years and years and years because you hear these stories especially in zen of people like you know a drop of water hits a puddle and bam they wake up or you know you hear these varying stories but yeah as someone who has a predilection to laziness i just hate that idea that yeah this just like anything else in the world takes years and years and years to accomplish yeah yeah well that can be daunting but you know there's the parable of the the master who has two students and they say how long will it take me to attain enlightenment the master points to an enormous tamarin tree in full bloom and he goes it'll take you as many years as there are leaves on that tree as many lives yeah it's on that tree and the one disciple goes oh my god that'll take forever and the other one goes really that's all that's so cool it's just a matter of perspective right right because the more you're fixated on this life and the more you're fixated on the minutiae of this life then of course a tree filled with leaves that represent incarnations is going to seem enormous but if you recognize that we're all an an infinite consciousness that isn't really in the time space continuum it's just confused by it or fixated on it then yeah that's nothing big deal and and just being told oh your journey is finite there will be an end to it by an authority that you respect that would be a huge comfort for for someone who is you know looking at it in that way right yeah that another thing about this that's interesting to me is how i i know people who have gotten onto the path and never deviate and have become monk like in there or actual monks but i've never been that way i'm a real my mind is very very squirrely like i think most peoples are and the experience of getting into a practice and sitting in meditation and being into it for reasons you cannot say and getting results which are very slight but you know them when they happen because they belong to a different order of experience if you know there's that there's something that happens to people who meditate fairly early in the game usually called you know experiencing the white light when that happens to people and it happens in varying degrees it's a sign because it's not light and it's not like anything you've ever experienced is a kind of radiance and it's accompanied by a kind of soul warmth and you say oh this is this is an emissary from that country i want to go to this is off the spectrum of normal human experience my mind has gotten just a tiny bit refined and as a result it's experiencing this very slight awareness of something transcendental does stuff like that ever make you want to put on the brakes no no no never i think i think uh one of the things about meditating is that uh it's the only experience i've ever had where it does not contain a duality with it within itself where it wasn't good and bad at the same time it was only good you know like you can something's delicious you're hungry and eat a cookie it's great you eat 20 of them and you feel sick right or if you uh you meet a girl and you're crazy about her and you have this fantastic relationship usually it isn't long before things start to go south and that love turns into a torment right unless you learn how to be selfish and change your self less and change your perspective and do things differently if you just fall in love and don't do anything but try to have that love forever it'll turn into a nightmare that's right but you can meditate day in and day out if you have the the strength and it doesn't turn bad it doesn't turn into something unpleasant your mind may get tired your your body may rebel but you never feel like god i overdid it now i feel sick i had too much it's always good oh yeah right there's no meditation hangovers no yeah and there's no there's no sense that you've you've pushed it past the point where it was good there's only the sense that you haven't gone far enough deep into it to experience more good which you would like you never hear about people getting dragged into mental hospitals because they meditated too much and there's no meditators anonymous of people who aren't equipped meditating no but there are people who have injured their minds by uh by practicing incorrectly by doing pranayama wrong or something people hurt themselves by doing skull shining and and you know bellis breathing and that kind of stuff what is skull shining skull shining is it's a form of pranayama very intense it's kind of like hyperventilating but it's uh it's uh it's one of those things they exhort you to do very very carefully and i know people who have had psychotic episodes that they never recovered from from doing that who is who has taught you this stuff do you have an active teacher i do i do i have a an affiliation with shri ramakrishna and i have a uh a teacher if you want to use that word who is a senior monk of the ramakrishna order a venerable man let's just call him that who is my uh my guide you say let's just call him that because it's not quite a man right it's more he's a man he's a man you know the there's there's a word guru which is i don't think understood and maybe best not used in uh casual conversation right which you and i are not necessarily having but since this is for oh i don't wear people on this people don't know what a guru is a guru a real guru bonafide guru is the single most important connection you will ever have with a human being in your life more important you can love you more than your parents were capable of he can help you more than anybody else can and he has your interests at heart in a selfless way that is beyond the capacity of any normal human being yeah and you don't i mean it's a very rare thing to come into contact with a guru like that's a that's considered to be a very auspicious and very good karma not everybody gets that in a lifetime well i i have a feeling that everybody who should get it gets it you know they say that the the three great blessings are to be born as a human being to be born with uh an appetite for uh you know uh religion and to meet your teacher they say that's that's that's the trio of auspicious things that can happen to a person who's interested in spiritual life right and there's a fourth thing which i think uh is essential and that is to be a very good aspirant if you want to get the most out of it and i'm not one of the things that really intrigues me is how my meditation over the years has been very very spotty i'll do it i'll really get into it i'll really think i'm going places i will be going places and then the desire to do it just leaves me and sitting in front of the altar is a trial yes and i just get up and i go away and i i feel all charged up i'm very light i'm very feeling very good i've got tons of good energy and eventually that dissipates and i end up crawling back and sitting in front of the altar again and going oh god how do i do this again what is it i'm trying to do and it comes back and i think why did i ever leave this and that's happened to me so many times during the course of my life and i think it's common i think that's much more common than being uh an ever perfect as Sri Ramakrishna called him somebody who is born to be a renunciate born without a strong libido born without a strong attachment attachment to the world born with the intellectual capability to look around at the world at sea of an early age that it never satisfies yeah even in the long terms to say nothing impermanently yeah those guys are boring i like i think they're they may be boring but they're they've they've got it going on i they got a i mean boring in the sense i'm being a player hater oh yeah well that's it that's it and they are people can't see them yeah well don't people you know people look at people generally speaking they're invisible to the world because they aren't making noise and making waves not interested they're not interested and and i'm fascinated you know i love thinking about them because uh when you consider it sort of societally this crazy hierarchy that we have in society and popular culture uh you know like the we've have this spectrum of celebrity or fame and i don't know if you you probably do use instagram no so instagram is this i love it it's this ridiculous thing where people post pictures and if you if you fall a taylor swift on instagram then what you're gonna get is a lot of pictures of her pre-show sort of taking pictures of the massive arena that she's about to perform in and then pictures of the arena while she's performing just countless people just a impossible to imagine almost like adolf hitler levels swarm of people watching her and you see she's the nucleus of this incredible organism that's formed around her so taylor swift you could say is on the very end of the spec this weird spectrum of fame but what you're talking about these people these non these people who aren't stirring up the sediment of culture but are a million times more potent than a taylor swift i love thinking about how far does that spectrum go and where are they how are they spending their time what are their interests here why did they come here why do you think they even came here at all that's that's a question i can't answer one of the things that really uh took me a while to get my mind around when i met my teacher was uh when he when he initiated me he said okay our relationship will be teacher and student and i said good and i didn't really realize what that meant he isn't interested in hearing what i have to say about anything unless i'm asking him a question or trying to clarify some spiritual point he doesn't give up he doesn't give a hoot about my artwork or my situation at home or what i saw on the street or a joke that i've heard or my my thoughts about vedanta all he does is tell me things and he is such an authority that every he doesn't utter an unconsidered or wasteful syllable and the instruction can be really dry and it really frequently isn't what i want i grew up reading lush exciting things like uh you know be here now or the books of ellen watts and things that really tried to kind of put their arm around you and bring you into this field of thought but a real teacher at least uh when i've encountered doesn't do that at all he has information and he wants me to understand it and there are no frills no wasted time no social niceties whatsoever but everything he says is intended to bring me closer to the goal and he's got the insight he's got so much insight and so understanding that his words have power and if he tells me to sit down and say a certain mantra that has a lot of meaning and the doing of it will get different results than if somebody else told me to do that and i sat down and tried it there's a connection there that is incomprehensible and sometimes i will find myself you know i'll pull back from this a little bit and i'll go what am i actually doing here i can say that i feel i have a connection with shri ramakrishna i feel it what does that even mean where did this connection come from did i know i'm in a past life are we connecting on the astral plane or whatever i don't know what that even means i don't know what any of this stuff means but i'm dancing to the tune that it's calling because it is far and away not only the only thing in my life that makes sense but the only thing in my life that seems worth doing everything else is just cyclical wheel spinning time killing you know the road to superannuation it doesn't get me anywhere drugs don't get you anywhere art doesn't get you anywhere romantic love doesn't get you anywhere wow contemplation and meditation and trying to purify your mind so that it can understand transcendental things that gets you somewhere do you know the story there it's a harikrishna story about the dog that has no teeth have you heard that story before i don't think so it sounds sad it's really sad and it's a comparison to people who think you can achieve pleasure in the material universe from gratifying the senses but the idea is there's a dog in a village with no teeth and it's found a dry bone and it's chewing on the dry bone with its gums and the dry bone is cutting its gums so it's tasting its own blood and it keeps chewing on the bone because it's confused drinking its own blood with eating food oh that's amazing isn't that cool and that's the comparison for what everyone's doing here which is that they are trying they're eating plastic fruit so to speak yeah yeah well there's a similar terrible in the Ramakrishna tradition different but similar in a certain way which is that a camel one of the camel's favorite foods evidently is a kind of thorny plant and it hurts it to eat it the thorns hurt its mouth and it's it bleeds while it's eating it but it won't stop doing it right and i you know that's something i i certainly see in my own life and in the lives of people around me we just we're drawn to make the same mistakes over and over again to suffer in the same way again and it's interesting to contemplate why it is that happens what is it about what is it about this world that is so alluring that we're we're determined to squeeze pleasure out of it over and over again even though we know that it always ends in tears what is the and contrary wise why is it that for me at least it can be so if i'm in them if i'm in the in the zone and meditating is a complete pleasure but that zone eventually goes away and i cannot get into it and i wonder why is that what what is it in me that is holding up a hand and saying stop no more meditation it's time to go out and smoke pot and overeat and get in trouble somehow you know yes it's like i don't know why i have to keep taking these these vacations for my practice just to wallow like a pig in the filth of the world but i do help it and i'm i know and i think it's because the pleasures of spiritual living at least at the stage that i'm in are so subtle and so i don't quite trust them if i'm if i'm meditating well and living well and controlling my mind i feel good but it's a very placid kind of well-being now what i want is to take lsd or something and have some mind-blowing experience right hard for me to be satisfied with just feeling calm and a low-level peace well you know maybe the experience the reason you're doing it is because you really enjoy that feeling when you come back to the practice and maybe that's your version of that explosive thing because there's a you know Sharon Salzburg the buddhist teacher no i don't she's pretty great but she's got a saying the healing is in the return and that it's the that moment that when you go when you leave your practice and you experience all the confusion and stagnation that comes from being disconnected from a practice and then suddenly you're sitting again and you get that first what you described is why did i ever stop doing this it's incredible maybe that's what we like maybe it's that i don't know maybe there you know it's like the child running away from its mom and then coming back again there's a kind of bliss in that moment when you come back to it yeah definitely but there's also a certain bliss in the moment where you decide okay i've been meditating long enough i've been a good boy long enough i mean when the thrill goes away there's nothing there's nothing i don't have the discipline and i think that's i think the real difference is that a really deep really naturally spiritually endowed person will sit at that altar every day whether they feel like it or not right they may also have the the inherent blessing of not having a ranging desire to get high or get later whatever it is that pulls me away from the practice well do you think jim that it's possible that there is no escape from the altar some people say that the getting laid getting high gratifying the senses if approached from the right with the right intention becomes as valid a method as meditating yeah yeah well i i is that true i mean it may be true for some people people i've known who did that and they were a sort of autodiadactic tantrics were assholes and i don't want to be you know it doesn't strike me as being a very good thing i i i haven't pulled it off i i can't i mean there's i think you could be maybe a you know i you would have to be a i don't know it's it's like an amphibious creature so i you'd have to i don't know how you go into that place and maintain any kind of lucidity at all i can't i the moment that i go away from a practice for any given amount of time i i've become comatose i'm just an ambient sleepwalker i don't know what's happening i just stumble around until i'm lucky enough that i'm sitting again well you know on the one hand there are you know paths like that you know extreme tantra or agora you know they're not my paths they're interesting to me but they don't excuse me they don't resonate with me and i can just tell they're not for me oh gosh drinking out of a skull cream that a few that idea appeals to me although i can't touch wine but we're sitting on a corpse in the cemetery i mean i like that idea now but the whole burning gap you know yeah i like that and i guess you had an opportunity to do that when you were in benares i saw it i didn't have an opportunity to do it but i saw have you ever been to india no i never have oh you gotta go man you gotta go you go to varanasi my friend and i we went out to we were in india and in varanasi the city of shiva they uh because it's shiva city shiva drinks eats marijuana so marrow you can get marijuana there is a sacrament and we you know everyone had been telling us when you get to varanasi order a bong lassi and uh you know college kids didn't really think about it at all ordered a bong lassi at our hotel drank it then got on a boat on the ganji's river just as the marijuana was kicking in and talk about getting your ass kicked by god just like what did you think you were doing like you you are now on this most sacred river on earth in the city of the what they call the city of burning and learning because it's just everyone's getting cremated there yeah and it was amazing and you see these shivites in the water ringing bells and smoke is rising up from bodies being cremated and people are dancing around the bodies being cremated chanting and monkeys are running on the rooftop and it's just another dimension you are in another dimension that's not the one we're in right now well that's i would love to go there and see something like that if i if i ever do make it to india the first place i'm going to go to is dakshina swarf to see the khali temple there i'm never what is this i've never heard of this the khali temple addiction is you know shri ramakrishna are you aware of him i'm aware of him but i'm as soon as well i'm done with this interview i'm gonna start researching him i don't know too much about him well he was uh he was a uh a temple priest at the khali temple at dakshina swarf so he lived there and it's a place of pilgrimage for people like me so that's that's the main place that i would like to go but of course there are lots of other places in india like binaries that i would love to go to um do you how how how much of how much of this philosophy and how much of ramakrishna has made its way into the frank books well uh probably you know it's a question i can't really answer because i have to assume that shri ramakrishna has always been there in my life and i just became aware of him on a certain point when i was about 35 so frank existed prior to your contact no no he he didn't well i guess he did i don't know frank is a manifestation of uh of uh of my own way of seeing things and before i did frank i did other work in the same vein that did also strove to express the things that frank strove but frank really turned out to be a perfect blue moon vehicle for that and i actually did the first drawing i ever did of frank very shortly after encountering shri ramakrishna so maybe he is some sort of a flowering of that i don't know wow so frank can't oh wow cool but i but i think that may be putting too much emphasis on it because i don't really think that uh i mean i think my work is best viewed completely divorced from any anything having to do with vedanta or religion or even or anything real because what these are these are comic fables right and they're just you know by someone who is not a seer and not enlightened and they should never be taken as having any depth or serious meaning to them people who are possessed of knowledge of certain kinds of depth and meaning might find something resonating in those books that entertains them or intrigues them or in people who are at the very very beginning of their own voyage of self-discovery might respond to frank more than they respond to sunday school because there are spiritual mysteries and parables and cosmic cause and effect and and things like that built into there oh yes i see i you know this is i it's so funny i doesn't matter if you say that i'm still gonna find deep meaning in those books whether you like it or not i love them and i it makes fine with me thank you fine with me i'm just saying that that from my point as i represented from my standpoint i cannot you know i can't say oh yeah this is these are spiritual comics these comics are full of uh you know cosmic wisdom which i have blamed and i'm sharing with you that's that's absurd i could never ever say that that's crazy well well i mean maybe it just accidentally comes out of you or maybe it's just something some of us are projecting onto it because we want it to be there but well i i think it you know it's when i write these stories when i write a frank story i've got this criterion that i developed where and it goes back to the the earliest things i ever saw that had resonance for me you know when i was a little kid like i said i grew up in a very conservative household but i would occasionally see things that got me where i lived i would see a a Hieronymus Bosch print or i would see an illustration by Boris arts of bashif in time magazine or i would see an illustration by Pierre Roy or some other kind of illustrator whose work covered on the boundary line between secular and spiritual then i think that's those images are got something i want to do that i want to try to make pictures that have that quality to them and it wasn't until i was in a high school that i found out about surrealism and the way i found out about it was by going to a massive surrealism and dada were at perspective at the ellie county art museum in 1968 when i was sixteen i never even heard of solvador dali and i walked place and there's all the greatest hits of dada and surrealism and the dali section which was about in the middle of the show had maybe 10 of his best and most famous paintings including the invisible man and i remember looking at the invisible man and seeing one of those flayed graddivas hanging from a plinth by her hair yeah with her face turned away from you as if in shame and that just went into my subconscious like a bullet and exploded and i realized what could be done with art how deep it could go how scary and wrong and bad and sick and glorious it could be if you had sufficient courage to face these things and to put them down and to obviously not give a shit whether or not people thought you were crazy or wrong or perverted or anything right that was a very liberating experience it was like all these all these men and women who i hadn't know their like existed before saying yes by all means explore these mysteries all means to vote your life to this kind of thing so that was a that was a huge eye-opener for me there and when i what i realized is that there's a certain kind of frisson i get from a certain kind of work where i can it just attracts me and it holds my eye and the analogy that i came up with to explain it to myself is that it's like fluorescence yes because you can't see fluorescent light but it makes things glow so you can tell that those rays are there by the way certain substances react and when i'm writing a frank story i will come up with ideas one after another and when i get one that has that glow to it i'll start exploring that and the ideas that i added that initial idea i don't keep them unless they have that glow also and by the end of it i've got this long-going chain of events and i don't worry about what it means or anything i just draw it up and if i'm lucky i never do discover the meaning of it until well if i'm lucky i never discovered so it never loses its punch for me over time i frequently find out what a lot of them are about some of them are quite mundane but really mundane no kidding like how do you mean well i mean they're mundane for example there's one where there's just the whole thing can be explained by a central pun which is the relationship between the words rug and drug that's a little bit disappointing but then again drugs that's not a that's not a small subject right and neither is rugs if you want to look at it in a certain way so no rugs aren't at all griggy one thing to say that oh yeah this this book is about how uh you know uh every individual consciousness is a reflection of brahman that sounds very interesting and highfalutin and easy to contemplate but you know i that's not a message i would ever deliberately try to say i would never say you you know you know this is an interesting idea i'll try to express this tentative vidante in my work that never occurs to me i just conjure up ideas until one of them announces its its significance by by having that glow and i i just put it in the jar and accumulate things until i can make a story out of them wow do you do you when you when you say you write the frank books or you're coming up with these potential ideas are you verbally are you are they are you writing them out as a script or you're okay yeah i write them in pencil in a notebook so you you write out frank does this or yes exactly wow cool and then if you okay and then that if that fluoresces for you then you'll start drawing it yeah if i have a complete story i will just sit down and breaking it down drawing it up all that stuff is kind of fun but the uh you know that by the time i'm ready to sit down and actually draw it and draw those wavy lines and everything all the the fun part of it is gone and it's just worth oh wow right yes because it's so precise what you're doing uh it i could see that it's it's almost like a wood wood cutting or it's incredible um jim we only have about nine more minutes left and i've got a couple of questions from the internet for you may may i ask them i ask people if they had questions for you yeah sure okay um um i picked out two that i really love uh please ask him how he manages to so successfully stay tuned to a subconscious mind how do i i guess by trying to and by sacrificing a lot of my life in order to do it you know when i was the things that that i think lots lots of people have all kinds of dynamic experiences when they're very young they hallucinate they experience paranoia they have a very vivid wild untamed exciting and mysterious view of the world and that gradually goes away with time because they realize that if they want to get an education get a job get married get buried they have to leave all that stuff behind because it won't help them on that quest but for me that was the only the those those feelings that intensity that was only the that was the only thing that ever mattered to me and i've worked my whole life at keeping that tunnel open and my line of sight back down through the years to those to that kind of early cauldron experiences open and so the answer is how i do it is i work at it i've sacrificed dignity and time and a lot of other things just so that i can maintain that connection what do you mean dignity how do you sacrifice dignity in that pursuit well i guess i didn't have to but i i just ended up doing it because i was a monomaniac you know a person who you know it's like somebody is in the throes of creation they don't really care whether their hair is combed or whether they've showered or wearing their their pants are inside out they just want to they're just focused on the work and i've sort of been that way my whole life in my pursuit of the enjoyment and the slow unfolding understanding of what all this means so i haven't tried to i had never learned to quorum i could never have gotten to finishing school i never really cared much about how i dressed and to a certain extent i never cared about how i acted and that all really worked against me in a social way can you describe your workspace well we just moved from our beloved old house in seattle's u district out to fashion island nearby and so my workspace is brand new but i have a small room that i draw in and i have a work table that goes up and down so i can stand at it or sit at it and it's got a big light table on it and that's where i do all my drawing is it true that you listen to crickets when you work no i listen to frogs and now i've got real frogs i'm surrounded by tree frogs so all they have to do is open the window but yeah i listen to recordings of frogs and i also listen to spoken word you know you're talking about the you know during the artwork and i was saying that the right the preparing it of it is easy and the the drawing it of it is hard i can't listen to anything while i'm writing it there has to be dead silence but when i'm drawing it i just listen to spoken word and old radio shows non-stop what which spoken words what spoken word do you listen to oh books on tape uh i go to the library i just got a bunch of books on tape by david sideris i got a novel about zelda zelda fits gerald i got michael moors autobiography i got john lithko's autobiography i just burned through the stuff i just like to hear human voices talking while i work have you started if you got if you started listening to podcasts yet while you work not to be self-promoting uh i have listened to some podcasts yes um and but no music you don't listen to music while you're working oh yeah i listen to music too i listen to loud loud classical and rock and roll music what kind of what kind of rock music do you listen to oh i still listen to nirvana an awful lot and but you know i'm not up on modern music for me the white stripes are still a new band so same here same but i like i like rock and roll i like guitars drums rhythm guitar i don't i can like yeah my son is always playing hip hop for me and you know Beyonce is great and 180 thousand is great oh there's lots of great stuff out there but what i really like is rock and roll and guitars and with music what i really like is uh i mean with classical music what i like is lush heavy orchestral programmatic music um jim one last question a lot of folks who listen to this podcast a lot of folks listening right now are artists and maybe they they haven't had the same kind of courage you've had when it comes to allowing themselves just to go deep into whatever that soup or whatever the thing is that's coming out of you is there any kind of advice you could give them methods they could use some tech technique or tactic that they could adopt that will help them uh be more of a conduit for this kind of creative energy you're putting into the world no i don't i don't really know how to do that myself so i couldn't give anybody else any advice to it i will say that when i hear from a cartoonist who tells me that he's going he wants to be a cartoonist and he's working at it his wife is worried about where the money's coming from so he's given himself six months or a year to succeed and if it doesn't work out he'll uh go back to whatever it was he was doing i just tell him to go back to whatever he was doing now because that attitude is is uh counter indicated for people who want to succeed the only way to succeed is to have no other options no backup plan i used to tell my wife and son when he was old enough to understand what i was saying that i was going to do this work and if we had to live in the park and sleep on bales of hey that was too bad but i had to do this work and there was no hope for it because i couldn't i couldn't do anything else not only did i not have the skills i couldn't focus on another career while i was thinking about this one beautiful thank you so much jim i'm so grateful to you for this conversation it's just been wonderful where can people find you is there i know you have a
