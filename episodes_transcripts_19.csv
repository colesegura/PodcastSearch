Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Greetings to you, my darling children of the Southern Moon and Northern Moon and Western Moon and Eastern Moon and all those in between. It is I. D. Trussell. This is the D. Trussell family. Our podcast coming to you from God's country, Austin, Texas. And I must say, it's incredible here. It reminds me the 80s, the time before the dark tentacles of the God of safety had wrapped their weaving six slimy tendrils around the planet and started to slowly squeeze the fun out of everything. Even the most wretched Lovecraftian Hell God has nothing on the darkness of the God of safety. At least when you read the wrong words from the Necronomicon and the thing jumps out of a portal and rips you to bits, you know you're being ripped to bits. You might even have a few moments to think to yourself, holy shit, I'm being ripped apart by a demon. But the God of safety wants to keep you alive. And yeah, that might sound great, except the God of safety doesn't want to keep you alive and happy. The God of safety doesn't want to keep you alive and excited. The God of safety doesn't want to keep you alive and inspired by your ability to survive on your own. The God of safety wants to keep you alive, bored and mildly scared of everything. The weird paranoid fog that can fall over a place where there's too many rules has not come to Austin. Also, it's taught me something that I definitely needed to learn, which is the whole idea, the spiritual idea that your outsides are actually a glimpse of your insides. What you're seeing around you is just your own projection, meaning that if you're in a place you don't like, you don't like yourself, man. Learn to love yourself and you'll love wherever you may be. Now, we have a wonderful podcast for you today. Connor Habib, author, philosopher, adult film star. And most importantly, my friend is here with us today. We're going to jump right into it.

My friend, now a critically acclaimed author, Connor Abib. Come on. Connor, welcome back. It's so nice to see you, man. How you doing? Are you in Ireland still? I'm still in Ireland. Yes, I am in Dublin. I'm sorry I keep asking you. By now, it's your home. And I keep asking you. It's getting rude now, isn't it? It's like when you become a vegetarian and people keep asking you if you're still a vegetarian. Are you still a vegetarian? You still don't eat chicken, right? So you love it there? I love it. I mean, this country is just really special and bizarre. And people treat each other much differently here. And I really love it. And it also has given me a complete weird perspective on the US and the rest of the world for sure. It's made you appreciate and love the United States, realize how kind we are to each other here because people in Ireland are mean to each other. But here in the United States, we're so sweet. Well, it depends on where you land in the United States, doesn't it? You know, like some places are like filled with festering, angry, cunts in other places or, you know, people are sweet. It just depends on where you're at. Yeah. I mean, I think it's also just made me realize how intensely felt like every small moment in the US is for people. I mean, it's just that I think it's been like mind blowing. It's like, I mean, of course, there have been big moments as well, but like everything feels so, seems to feel so immediate for everybody there, so urgent, so close to home. And I think part of that too is just like, like when you're in the US, you're, that's it. You know, you go on vacation to other places in the US. It's not like you're here and you go to Portugal, you know, on like a couple hour flight for vacation or whatever. You're in a completely different country, different language, different set of problems, different, like said, you know, different art, all that kind of stuff. So I think even though culturally from place to place in the US, it's very different. It just still feels like sort of everything feels claustrophobically urgent, which is so strange because I'm on tiny island and things feel so much less urgent here than in that massive, gigantic country, you know, looking from the outside. Why, why, what's the difference? What do you think is going on over there in Ireland compared to here that would make people less urgent? I mean, for example, like I would say looking at, I mean, you and I talked a few times through like lockdowns and stuff like that, but I would say like, even though the regulations here were extremely like strict and some of the most harsh whatever you want to say regulations in the world for the longest period of time, I still was like, thank God, I'm here because I couldn't have taken the cultural conversation about it in the US where everybody's each and everyone's personal actions seem to be, you know, elevated to the level of, you know, the fate of the world depended on it, you know, and I think, and so people are just nice to each other here, even if you even if you really weren't on the same, you know, wavelength as your neighbor, they were still your neighbor. And I think like that, you know, some of that is probably born from the fact that, you know, the US's actions do hold such sway in the world, but that's like filtered down into people, you know, making dinner choices and, you know, what they do when they go out and like this the fate of the world might hang on this one, you know, that kind of thing. Oh my God, that is so interesting. I've never thought of that angle and it's true. It's like, as above so below, the conditioning is such that everyone feels like any decision they make, they're launching a thermonuclear strike or it's like, it's like, calm down. Relax. We're just trying to figure out where to put the couch, you know, like it's okay. No, the, the. Yeah. It's a, and also especially, you know, especially with COVID, you know, if you were, regardless of what side you represented, whether you were like hyper COVID safe or whether you were like middle finger to Fauci, depending on what tribe you stumble upon, they will look at you as though the entire fulcrum of the world was located in you and your decisions to not wear the mask or to wear the mask and because of you, this is why we have the problem. You know, you weren't just an individual. You represent all the assholes that ever lived through all the pandemics. So everyone was scapegoated and scapegoating and that's what we do as a hobby. We scapegoated. I mean, yeah, I mean, like in one way it's really beautiful in a sense because that is true actually, like the entire world does depend on you. I mean, you are like a fucking pulsating cosmos where everything happens within which everything happens and nothing escapes, right? But then like, so, I mean, on the one hand, like that's absolutely true, but on the other hand, the wrong approach to that is to it's because of materialism is because, you know, you're materializing the spiritual truth and like thinking that it depends on, you know, whether or not you washed your banana before you ate it or whatever the fuck. So like, I think, you know, that's the that's the spiritual truth is lost in like a sort of cacophony of material, you know, minutiae. Not to divert, but do you wash your bananas? Is am I supposed to be washing my fucking bananas? Because I've never washed a banana. No, I never washed a banana. I peel them. Thank God. I was about to be like, well, now I understand why I don't feel good sometimes. Okay, good. Okay, great. I'm glad. And that's okay. Yeah, you didn't wash your fucking bananas. You pig. Okay. So the the I'm sure there's someone who washes their bananas. I'm sure there's someone listening who's like, you don't wash bananas. I wash well, there were people washing their like fruit and groceries during the whole pandemic for sure. Like that was all I did that. Okay. When I when I was in my freak out phase, man, I was like out. I was like full on alcohol, swabbing everything. Oh, God knows what damage I did to myself just with a disinfectants. God knows my sperm count is probably in the negative at this point from that shit. But okay, so if you get back to what we were talking about earlier, it's like, you know, the like some part of us infinite, eternal, everything is, but if you try to like push that into the world, the impermanent temporary material world, then it's it can only come across as what you're talking about this kind of urgent, I don't know, manic sort of seriousness or something. Is that what you're saying? Yeah, well, I mean, I think most of our problems today, like probably all of them, maybe they come from a sort of mistranslation or misunderstanding of the spiritual realm and trying to, yeah, externalize it, pull it into the sort of heaviness of, you know, the material world. And when you do that, it's just like a fun house mirror, like it distorts and fucks up everything. But you can nevertheless see what the spiritual truth is by looking at the material distortion. If you have the right sort of mirror to reflect back on it, you know, and that's why, you know, people who have a spiritual worldview or spiritual practice and I know you do this sometimes too, is like, you can just look at the horrible thing that's happening in the world. And instead of thinking into this horrible, you can ask the question like, what is trying to work itself out here? What's being sought? What exactly are we looking for? How is this for us, you know, to learn the true version of it? And so I think then it makes you, you know, that things feel less urgent. They feel more like, okay, we're working this one out. We're sorting, we're sorting through. Yeah. So like right now, the newest thing, the newest horrible thing, Roe V. Wade overturned by the Supreme Court. God knows there's like a, like a massive urgent, like people are losing their shit, panicking, freaking out, threatened, you know, people are getting like very, like probably will, they're probably, there will be violence, I'm sure. So there already has been, yeah. There already has been. So from like, how does what you're saying apply to Roe V. Wade? Like what, getting overturned? What, what distortion? What is getting represented? What is the thing that we're supposed to take from it? What transcendent message is coming from this thing getting overturned? Yeah. I mean, you know, this is a particularly sort of fraught one to discuss. I mean, one, because it's in the moment to because, you know, in a lot of ways, this wouldn't urgently affect me as a gay man. Anyway, of course, in all the connections in the LGBT community and all that sort of stuff, of course, it does intersect with my life, but it's not going to present itself as an urgent in my face concern like it will for, for women and, you know, non-binary people have babies. But I think it's like, you have, you basically have a sort of loss of understanding of the connection of the spirit and the body. So you have people who are, I mean, just to sort of take one side of it, you have people who are claiming to be Christian who have no idea what the spiritual connection between, you know, developing organism fetus incarnation coming through the levels of cosmos into being is and so then they just sort of stupidly vehemently say things like you're murdering a baby. But of course, like, they don't feel that way when it comes to, I mean, the sort of quip is like, oh, you're not pro-life, you know, you don't care about life and all these other forms and that's true. Like, and it's because they, they have this complete misapprehension of what's happening, you know, and so I think one of the, I think a really sort of gentle way to bring this to light is like, you know, there's a woman here, Lorna Byrne, she's, she lives in Ireland and she wrote a bunch of books about angels. Now, whatever we want to say about Lorna Byrne and do we believe that she sees angels, talks to angels, all that kind of stuff, that's up to, that's up to everyone. But one of the things she says and just imagine how intense this is in Ireland with the Catholic Church having so much power, she said, listen, the angels told me about abortion. They told me what it is. Like the, the, the children that were meant to incarnate within a vessel have decided to not go through the process of incarnation in cooperation with the mother and they're actually thankful for that process. And so then they get to actually incarnate in the step that they want to. So they told me that a lot of times those beings are actually thankful to the mother, right? Now, I'm not saying people have to believe in that, but I'm just expressing a different spiritual standpoint and a spiritual standpoint that doesn't immediately align itself with a kind of unthinking actually quite a spiritual or anti-spiritual version of Christianity that exists in the US that refuses to take the reality of the spiritual world seriously. Well, sometimes it feels like the pro lifers have this idea of like when a woman gets an abortion, it's like going bowling or you know what I mean? Going to Vegas. You know what I mean? Like they have this idea that they're like skipping in there. Like it's the best day ever. Not understanding how, how, how the experience is, it's not like they're in there like, oh, let's go. What do you say? We go get abortions. Then we'll have some margaritas or something. It's, you know what I mean? So it feels like they think that it's a little, people are taking it more lightly than they are. But then, so I like what you're saying. And this is this very compassionate to the, to the mother so that the mother isn't burnt because some people who get abortions or they may never admit it, but they are burdened with guilt for their whole lives. They feel terrible. I think God, what's, who wrote that incredible poem about it? There's like a feminist. I think it was a Joan Didion wrote this. You see how I find it. Let me see. I think life starts it when you come. Let me find this. John, hold on. Hold on. That would be amazing. Wouldn't it? Hold on. I've got my damn speech thing on. Let me see. I'm fine. Is it June, June Jordan? Maybe I don't. Let's see. Maybe. I'm going to look it up. Uh, I can't, I read this. It was just this beautiful poem about someone driving home after getting an abortion and like, I don't know. They just encapsulated the entirety of the thing, the necessity of it and the horror of it. The, you know what I mean? The like, the, the, the, the, the tragedy of it and like, but this was, I couldn't have been a ma. I couldn't like what there is no way I would have, you know what I mean? Like that there's no way it could have worked and there's all these medical issues. Look, I'm not going to get in a, I don't want to, two dudes yapping about fucking abortion. No one wants to hear that right now, but I like what you said because I think people deserve compassion. If they find themselves in that situation and there's something incredibly terrifying now. If you find yourself in that situation and you have to like fly somewhere, you know what I mean? They're making it a lot. Well, you could always fly to another state. Oh, that's going to be fun. Fly to my abortion. Great. That's going to be great. Yeah. No, all that abortion tour, abortion tourism. I'm sure people don't really want to engage with that. Yeah. I mean, I, I think it's, I think it's pretty presumptuous that that will just go smoothly for people, for women, you know, I think it's absolutely preposterous to just sort of rely on that and already, you know, today US pharmacies were saying, oh, well, we'll only give out certain amounts of, you know, of, you know, abortions, so-called abortion pills, you know, and that sort of thing to, to people. It's like three per customer or whatever because they're such a high demand. I mean, you can already see the strain and then also just think about the people who worked in clinics and, you know, did sexual health awareness and everything in these states like, well, so what? Like their lives are completely destroyed as well. Yeah. So it's not just as simple as that. And I mean, I think it's, it's really something to admit with those kinds of responses that we accept a certain kind of intra, like our, like intra US nationalisms that we already accept these absolute divisions between who gets what kinds of things, whether they want it or not, and that you have to essentially flee the country to another country within the same country to go and get, you know, certain things provided for. Oh, right. Like, like, it's what this is doing is it's just starkly amplifying the division. It is now it's like, let's just put neon around how the, the, the cracking, fragmenting landscape of America with this law. Now it's just like, look at how we are truly splitting apart. Yeah. And I think, you know, it's, it's weird, you know, you and I scheduled this episode to record a while ago. We didn't know this was going to happen. And of course, it's on the forefront of our minds. And then like, also, kind of the last people that should be talking about it. Right. Sorry, everybody. Obviously, we don't know. It was podcasting. This is like, you're allowed, but you're allowed to talk about it. I mean, it's like, you are everyone. By the way, and let me also, I'm sorry to cut you off the way it does affect you. The way it does affect gay people is they're coming for gay marriage next. That's next. Hold on one second. I'll be right back. This episode of the DTFH has been brought to you by Express VPN. Have you ever had that thing happen where you get your bag at the airport and the TSA is left like a note in there that they inspected your bag and you're looking at the contents of the bag thinking, oh my God, look at how cool I am. There's lube, weird prostate vibrator things, virtual reality goggles so that I could experience VR porn while vibrating my prostate and lubing myself up with this very expensive lube and then you have that moment of like, oh, I'm sort of embarrassed. I mean, what do they do with it? I don't want to worry about their hands being all over my special toys. This is what it's like to use the internet without a VPN except the people who might be rifling through your data online. They don't leave you little notes. You just know they're doing it. So whenever I turn on Express VPN, I get the same feeling you might get if you're allowed to lock your luggage at the airport. You just feel better. I don't want people snooping around and whatever I'm doing. I don't want people up to date on whatever particular new genre of porn I'm into and I know, okay, yeah, maybe I need to open up a little bit more to the world. But right now, I want that between me, my wife, my friends and friends of my friends and people who hang out on my special Discord server, you know, not the entire internet, not some dark web warlock who's going to weave together an AI bot to seduce me or something.

What's his face already said? Let's talk about it. States rights, states rights. And then, you know, and then the state's rights thing is weird because though I do love it, on one level, I love all the stuff about let's restrict the power of the federal government. The more the better, if it's a democracy, let the states decide how they want to run the, quote, experiment of each particular state. But holy shit, man, like, you know, some, then if the population of a certain state, if the majority are voting Muslims, let's say, what do we do then? What if the majority of people in a state are voting? Like, what do they call them fundamentalist Muslims and they want to start Sharia law? Or what do we, you know what I mean? How does it work then when it's not Christians who are voting, when it's not the fundamentalist Christians who are trying to vote Christian ethics into the legal system? This is why you need the federal government to have these like things that aren't voted on by the states because otherwise you're going to end up with a freaking theocratic state. You're going to end up with a theocratic government in a state and that there's, that's not good news. Depending on what religion you are. I mean, just to say like the theocratic states already exist without a lot of people voting for them, right? So like, so we already have states that are run by these religious fundamentalist assholes, none of whom are Muslim in the U.S., right? I know you were just making an example, but I think it's funny because it's like that, of course, like these, you know, Christian fundamentalists are always, you know, on everybody's shit for like, don't let Muslims don't let the Sharia law. That's why I, no, but that's why I said it. Yeah, that's why that's why I'm going, that's why I'm going there with you because it's like to freak them out. It's like, hey, look, you might be going your way right now, but what 10 years, 20 years down the fucking line, what are you going to do? What are you doing when the Satanists are the majority? Right, right. And then, but then also it's like a concentration of oppressive power into the hands of this, you know, a state rather than the federal government is not somehow, you know, like deluding power, you know, from the state is just actually, it can actually be worse for people, you know, in a lot of ways because of how that filters down. And like, we don't, I mean, the thing is, it's this whole idea that somehow these kinds of choices, which are deeply individual can be solved politically is always sort of, it always turns into this mess. I understand that they all have political dimensions, but it's the same thing with gay marriage, like I, you know, the way gay marriage takes place in the US to me is pretty shit, honestly. Really? Oh, yeah. I don't, I mean, I was never for gay marriage in the US in the sense that it was just, it's an exclusionary project that's like, well, the state says that this kind of relationship receives these kinds of benefits, which is the relationship of marriage, whereas, you know, like lots of people have different kinds of relationships. And so the state is just sort of like, here you go. Great. Now you can have straight rights for gay people, right, but actually gay relationships and gay forms of belonging and all this kind of stuff. It's just very different than straight people in a lot of ways until there's sort of like coercive political pressure onto the cultural realm happens. In Ireland, it takes place very, very differently, which I think is really powerful. In Ireland, and that's why it's still an issue in the US. In Ireland, people went door to door, knocked on, because it was a vote. They knocked on their neighbor's doors and they're like, this is what I desire. These are the kinds of people I love. Meet me. Right? That conversation is completely radical because it's not a political conversation solved by courts in the US. It's actually a neighbor cultural conversation that then ends up organically making a political decision. And so it becomes so much more solid. It becomes so much more radical and profound and the kinds of attitudes. I'm not saying that there's no violence or homophobia in Ireland. Of course there is. The kinds of solidity and bonds that it forms are really profound, whereas in the US when you have courts solving or applying pressure on cultural issues, it always ends up being a disaster because the political realm really shouldn't be trying to dominate the cultural realm. And I think that that's what people are trying to get to when they're like, oh, the federal government doesn't have any power anymore. Great. It's the states. But of course the states exert just as much political power over our culture as states. So that also is like a huge problem. And I do think that the cultural, sorry, I'm getting a little ahead of myself, but the political realm is two or more people trying to sort out how they relate to each other. The economic realm is everybody. It's all the resources, all the breaks and flows of how money works, all that kind of stuff. But the cultural realm, which includes relationship to your own body, to your health, to all that kind of stuff, that's individual. That's one. And so when you sort of go up the level and try to make cultural decisions through political or economic wrangling, it often has disastrous effects. We should really honor that this is individual and this is up to each and every person who's capable of giving birth to make these kinds of decisions. Yeah. You know, and that's, I mean, I understand why that you can sort of get then a glimpse of pro-life people being like, no, actually this is two people and one person's making a decision for two people, but they're wrong. They're not correct. They're just not correct about that because they have a misapprehension about, again, incarnation and all that sort of stuff. Oh, and also the critique of many pro-life people is you're not pro-life, you're pro-birth. Big difference. If, you know, you can't, if you're going to, if you're going to make somebody give birth to their, their rapists child and then raise that child and theoretically what share custody with the rapist or how does that work? Does the rapist have to pay child support? Are you eternally connected to your rapist legally where you have to get money from them? When you're doing that, you know, at that point, you're really like, you're not really pro-life. You're, you're, you're, this kid is going to be born into a God knows what kind of life that, you know, so to me, those, those, those like glaring arguments, they make the extreme arguments that make, make a lot of sense to me. But again, man, I am, I don't, I don't, I don't know. Like the partial birth abortions, the late term, those things, man, they, those, that seems pretty fucked up to me. Like that stuff is like, I don't get that. I can't wrap my head around it. So look, and let me truly, you all have to wrap your head around really is do you want to create a law that tells women that they have to not do that? Like that's its own, that's the question, right? And not for me is the answer is always no, I don't want to, I don't want to empower any government to tell somebody that they can't do that, you know, because one, because who the fuck am I at the end of the last person that that will ever affect, but two, like, that's what like, you know, as a sort of cultural understanding, and as a, you know, even as a political understanding amongst women, they're saying, no, like we want to be able to make that determination for ourselves. So that's where the, that's where the freedom should lie. I think I don't think men should be allowed to come. Like, I think they should be, I think we should make only certain days where men can come in another day, other days. It's like, no, but, you know, it is interesting thinking about all the other body, body things that, you know, laws that we could create in every single one. It's like, what? That's fucked up. I mean, it would be sexy. It's kind of fucking hot. It's like you're forbidden to come except on certain days and you're like, oh, it's coming. My comment is not part of the problem. It's part of the solution. So I just want to say. Hey, I want to bring it back to something you said earlier real quick. If you don't mind. I never considered what you just said about gay marriage being. It's like, it's like, uh, if you, it's marriages, a man and a woman and, uh, or two people in this case. So like, oh, so like the fundamentals of like marriages, man and woman, that's it. But gay marriage is no, it's two people. It's two people who can be the same gender, but, but what about all the other intimate ways people get together? Like all the other essentially you are still saying this is natural, but you know, throuples or all the other like even like deep platonic friendships. What about that? Why, why, why isn't that? Why can't deep platonic friends like cohabitate and get the same protections or get to adopt kids? It is interesting, but I never thought of that. How weirdly limiting and yet celebrated by people like me. I'm always just like, but it's gay marriage. It's great. But yeah, I never thought it's like, oh, weirdly restrictive. Yeah. And I mean, I think it's, you know, you can see that it's, uh, the political realm and the economic realm sort of working in tandem to achieve their aims by coercing culture. In a certain way. It's like what, like, like the economy functions through monogamy essentially in the US and it functions through marriage in a lot of ways, like the ways that taxes funnel in the ways that like how people have certain kinds of personalities and therefore can be in politics, have certain kinds of relationships and therefore can be in politics. The way insurance works, all those kinds of things are founded on a certain economic version of love relationships, which is fucking insane. And so you don't, so you have these two things and then, and then they start coercing like people into thinking, oh, well, look, wouldn't it be radical and amazing if gay people could enter into the way the economy works and the way that capitalism works and the way that this political realm works and then people buy it and then it starts eroding what happens for gay people. It starts eroding the history. It starts eroding. And so I think it's like there's just so and that affects obviously that affects straight people as well and asexual people and anybody, whatever way you want to identify. And so because of that, you know, you have this sort of monolithic thing. Now, I don't necessarily have a problem with people wanting to be monogamous or married or whatever, but the way the state determines who gets what kind of economic benefit and political benefit is based on a certain kind of relationship. And that is insane. I mean, that's that's fucked. I don't exactly know how to like, I haven't really sat down and solve the problem, but like, you know, gay marriage is like, it's a great hustle, you know, for like staying, you know, for like being able to see someone in the hospitals for being able to inherit things to be able to, you know, have certain kinds of kids, you know, like certain like have adoption and all that kind of stuff to, you know, get tax breaks, all that. But like, that's pretty much in the U.S. At least that's what it is. I'm not saying people don't love each other because they're married. Of course, people actually love each other in these forms of relationship as well. So I'm not denying that, but like, can we think bigger than that, you know? No, no, what you're saying is so fascinating is that like the if, you know, what do they call it, heterodoxy? If like, if a male female marriage and its duplicate is like a binary two people marrying, if it has its roots in any kind of religious ethical system, which is obviously it does, it's like the marriage is like wrapped up and especially marriage between men and women and it's wrapped up in all the world religions. Then what you're saying is the separation of church and state isn't really has, that's not happening because church and state have been fused together in the most insane way through taxes and economy. So it's like deep in the code. It's hard baked into the code. Whoa, that is so trippy, man. That is so trippy. I mean, so imagine now like that was, you know, when like property in California and like all the stuff with gay marriage is like whipping up into a frenzy and I was like trying to convince people that this was bad, you know, like in the gay community, I'm like, no guys like we don't want to do this. And there were obviously there are a lot of other sort of radical thinkers who were doing similar things, but it was like, I mean, you were just hated because like you were somehow fucking with the tactic there, but like the truth is like we've gotten a bad result from using those tactics and we should have included that in the conversation the whole time, which could have been like, listen, yes, this is a great stopgap. It's the same thing I feel about UBI to some extent universal basic income. It's like, it's a great stopgap. But as soon as we get it, we have to fight against it like as soon as we get it, we have to be like, okay, that's done now next thing. But like we always tend to sort of go through this, you know, process of getting some sort of political gain and then we rest there and we think that the thing is done, but actually we need to treat these things as one stage in developments. Otherwise, they just become completely, you know, retro, you know, retrograde, whatever retrograde baby retrograde wow deep man deep controversy. I mean, surely. Yeah. It's like, so it's like you're not saying like gay marriage is obviously for dealing if we're in a society where people who are like completely in love and it can't like go to see each other in the fucking hospital, then gay marriage is obviously a step forward, even if they're not in love, whatever the fucking thing they're in, but it shouldn't be the final step. Like we have to keep reconsidering. What is this thing? We're calling marriage and what is the relationship between married people in the state and why is there still restrictions for other? I get it. It's brilliant. It's brilliant. I'm voting for you. I love it. I don't know where you're running from. Yeah. And like I like what you said before about like, oh, you know, the church part isn't gone. Like it is gone. Like I like what you said because it just it was showing me like, well, actually, again, this is one of those cases where the spiritual value of marriage is actually completely lost because like Mammon, you know, like has fucking come to be the stand-in for whatever alchemical spiritual truth happens when two people have ceremony to merge their, you know, spiritual field and now it's like, you know, it used to be like tie the fucking tie the ribbon around each other's arms and profess your love and like have someone play in a flute and like then your spirits will merge and you'll continue to have karma into the next life and interact with each other and the life between this one and that one. And now it's like put the ring on and get some money off when you buy a house, you know, it's like, yeah, yeah. No, before when we got married, we were in Hawaii. We had to get like, uh, we had to do all this weird certification before Ram Daska Marry. So we had to go to this shitty fucking dead, like, you know, Hawaii is beautiful, but somehow the place where you go to get married certification is just like they found the one part of Hawaii that's like a strip mall that's like you go down some dark hallway and then like as the lady's giving us the certificate, she just burnt like a lava. Here you go. It was just like, ah, the least like if the opposite of romantic. Yeah. And it's the same when people are, you know, when people are dying and suddenly you're not just being with them as they die. You're like, all right, do I have the password to your bank accounts? We got to turn your internet off. Like, you know, that so I, yeah, that's called Mammon. That's Mammon. Well, Mammon's Mammon's like that God of like, you know, bad finance, essentially like Mammon's the, the, the being that sort of eclipses, uh, you've seen the spiritual value and replaces it with quantitative financial monetary value. That's Mammon. I thought that was the Demiurge. Well, I mean, just look up Mammon. You know, you'll, you'll find doing it right now. Hold on. You are giving me an intense education today. Hold on. Holy shit. Mammon in the New Testament of the Bible is commonly thought to mean money, material wealth, or any entity that promises wealth. Oh my God. Oh my God. There's a name for it. I thought it was the Demiurge. I've been wrong all this time. There's a picture of Mammon here. He's like a terrible looking, like evil looking leprechaun. He's one of the seven princes of hell, I think. Yeah. So. Oh my God. Mammon. That's the God of the West. Yeah. There's a, there's a book about capitalism as a capitalism as like a black magic theology or whatever. I just called the enchantments of Mammon. Mammon. Money. Mammon. It's almost like. Yeah. Wow. Okay. Wait, hold out real quick. During the middle ages, Mammon was commonly personified as the demon of wealth and greed. Thus, Peter Lombard says riches are called by the name of a devil, namely Mammon. For Mammon is the name of the devil by which name riches are called. According to the Syrian tongue. Piers Plowman also regards Mammon as a deity. Nicholas Delira, commenting on the passage in Luke says, Mammon estenomen de monis. Mammon is the name of the, of a demon. Whoa. Mammon. Whoa. So then now that you've said it, you know, we've said his name so many times people will listen to the show and be like, I'm going to pray to that being so I can get some money. They're like, don't do that because all that's all that will happen is you'll get paid for the obliteration of your soul. That's it. So don't do that. You know what? I don't even think you'll get fucking paid. I think you'll just have to fill out a bunch of stupid forms. I think. Yeah, you're getting paid. It'll get like an NFT. Yeah. Yeah, just you're, but you're going to have to go to Bank of America for some reason. You're going to get an email and go to Bank of America and fill out a bunch of forms and so you can access your account. You know, like, because that, you know, that, that's so fascinating. When we were making the Midnight Gospel, it was like, you know, the insane amount of like paperwork and forms and licensure that has to happen for any music you wanted to use or anything like that. The, there was a, for sure, a terrible barrier of forms and money that gluck just completely clogged up the creative process that just glomped it up and glued it up and slowed it down and sometimes made it really stressful. That's Mammon. Yeah. Yeah. And I mean, some of it is, you know, like the opportunity to overcome Mammon in your own life. I mean, you, you know, well, I'm sure that like until you can actually contend with that stuff in some sort of reasonable way, you can actually be successful, which is such a horrible thought. Like, I mean, there are some people who have had just sort of been rescued from a kind of, you know, absolute poverty just based on their skill alone. That is very rare. And even then those people have a whole team of people who are managing Mammon. Right. So like one of the aspects of actually being successful is developing the inner capacity to overcome this demon and redeem him because he wants to be, he wants to be redeemed, but he's so huge is that it takes a lot of people, you know, to do it. So like no single person can probably do it. Yeah. Connor, you're so brilliant, man. I like this is, I think it's just having that word now and like, yeah, you're right. You, you know, one of the trappings is if you're lucky, you, it's like you hire people to pray to Mammon for you. So you don't have to do the forms. Right. Right. And it's so interesting that like the, like the people who can do the forms and all that kind of stuff, they do it. I mean, they have stress in their lives, but like, you know, that feeling of like you get the bill and you don't want to open the fucking envelope, you know, it's a bill, right? And that so just sits forever and then you get another one and then you get another one. And so your debt just keeps increasing. But the people that do those jobs, which we think are boring. If we're not in that job, like they actually have this profound skill for just encountering a demon with no fear. And they're like, no, look, actually know how to get rid of you just by filling out this little game, uh, spreadsheet. Goodbye. You know, and then I'm going to do it again. And like that skill is really profound and it seems a spiritual to us. But in fact, it's a deeply spiritual act. Wow. Bravery even so brave. They're dragon slayers. They're slash exorcists slash. And you know, those people are always really good at calming you down because they're used to people being so like shivering and fear of Mammon scratching at the door. Don't worry. I can slay this beast. I've slain it many times before. Oh, cool. So how, what would a redeemed Mammon look like? Yeah. I mean, I think, I think we're actually getting there, aren't we? Like we're getting to a place where our relationship to money is changing and economy is changing. So that is, uh, making us confront this being and other sort of related beings and to move on from the kinds of sway that they had over us. So whenever people talk about capitalism, um, as sort of a bad thing or whatever, what they really mean is if you like, so can I, can I lead up to this? It's going to be a little like weird. If I just, yeah, can I just like lead up? Wait, hold on. Before you lead up, I'm so sorry. I got to, I got to be. Yeah. Me too. Do you mind? Mary? Oh, no, I'll be right back. All right, cool. All right. Great. I want to thank Lumi Labs, the creator of microdose gummies for not just supporting this episode, but for keeping me pleasantly buzzed. Y'all deserve a Nobel Peace Prize. Not even being hyperbolic about that. Truly. You did it. Lumi Labs figured out how to dial in the perfect microdose of THC for general wellness and performance enhancing purposes or whatever purpose you want it to be for. I've shared these microdose gummies with marijuana connoisseurs who love them, who want more of them. These things are perfect. It's so easy to accidentally put a psychedelic time bomb into your stomach so that you eat a gummy or whatever you're eating. And within a few hours, suddenly you're wondering if maybe you actually are Jesus being crucified and trying to escape his inevitable destiny of having to surrender his entire being to God by exploding into fragmental portions of which you might be one. That might be nice sometimes, but not when you're just trying to go for a jog. This is why I love Lumi Labs. They've done it. It's the perfect dose. Even better. It's legal nationwide. You could fly with it. I fly with it everywhere. To learn more about microdosing THC, go to microdose.com and use code Duncan to get free shipping and 30% off your first order. Again, it's microdose.com code Duncan. You'll get free shipping and 30% off your first order. Links can be found in the show description. But again, that's microdose.com code Duncan. Go. Let's go. Let's hear what you were saying. Let's hear the leader capitalism. Yeah. So I think, you know, we are in the, in the stages of overcoming them and at least in a certain way. So like when we talk about when capitalism appears, a lot of people have commented on how capitalism has sort of arisen around the time when witches were being persecuted, right? When, when witchcraft was going away. And I find this like really interesting because when people don't. So, so the, one of the people who talks about this is this writer, Sylvia Federici, I don't particularly like her. I think she gets a lot of things wrong, but I do think it, you know, she's popularized at least this observation that capitalism and witchcraft were in total like antagonism to each other. And so I was really thinking about why that was and her answer is that witchcraft is somehow nonproductive. It can't enter into the capitalist economy and in a certain way. I think maybe a better way to think about this is to think about what our experience of money under capitalism is and money under capitalism and economy under capitalism is a constant sense of temporal anxiety and it's a limited form of anxiety. What's coming next? What's coming next? What's coming next? Like how much do I owe? When's the next bill coming? When am I going to run out? All that kind of stuff. And, you know, this, there's another writer who I do quite like and he's been on my show a few times, Todd McGowan. He wrote a book called capitalism and desire and he basically said, look, any idea of progress or getting the thing you want, which is how most humans experience desire is actually completely wed to capitalism. And that's why capitalism is so intense and so hard for us to get out of because it mirrors the way we desire things. Now, he bases all this on psychoanalysis and I think he makes some fundamentalists in some way statements about it that I don't totally agree with. But I like this again, sort of reinforcing this idea that we have a time sense around money. And I do think that our time sense is changing and because our sense of time is beginning to change that our relationship to money and economy and capitalism is about to be eroded and changed. So it's always just sort of going back to the phenomenon, the experience, like what is actually happening to me when I spend money, when I have credit, when I have a bill, when I have the envelope come in the mail, even when I save money, you know? And so there are lots of ways out of this predicament. Wait, before you go with the ways out of the predicament, can you go into a little bit of detail of what do you mean time is changing? What do you mean time is changing? I mean, look, we know space is changing. Like we can say that because you and I are doing this right now, right? So like the sense of space is completely different. Also, I mean, I think pandemic space was very weird. Like you were confined to a room constantly attenuated to the fate of the entire world. So it was like you're thinking about everybody while you could see no one every single day. You know, I mean, that's pretty profound. Yeah. And obviously time, you know, people talked about like COVID time and all that kind of stuff. So we've been dealt a kind of inner blow collectively to how we used to see time in space. But that's been going on for a long time. I mean, when people went to the moon and saw the entire planet, right, if you believe if you believe they went to the moon when they saw the whole planet, you know, I mean, that's, you know, that's something I like to say jokingly. I can't remember if I said this on the show before, like, you know, one of the astronauts put his thumb up and like occluded the entire planet with his thumb and he's like, everything I know is behind my thumb. And now think about people using their cell phones. I mean, everything they do is like right underneath their thumb. It was like a pre-echo of what we do with our fucking phones. Right? So if space changes, then time definitely changes because time is just made up of space. So like time is all the space put together. So if you have time, if you have the new relationship to space, you have the new relationship to time. And I think what's happening there is a kind of, um, is a sort of long view of how time works, of how things process and happen. Like, look, if, if you understand reincarnation is real, which I experienced that as true, and I think you do as well, time becomes a completely different issue, doesn't it? I mean, so as that idea of reincarnation enters, we have something as the popular, the repopulization of astrology enters into the cultural sphere. We have something different as the unpredictability of money and markets like starts happening. We have something completely different. So I think a lot of those things are changing. I'm sure people could just add a huge long list right there. And I think that we're beginning to understand that things are not sort of like, uh, cumulative in the way that we thought they were that progress. Shit, man, good Lord. So like the economy is interwoven into the time space continuum. And so, and you know, again, this is like, it's not just you go to the moon, you look at earth, you're like, holy shit, you do the sake and pale blue dot thing. It's time is moving differently. The further you get out of the gravity well of earth, the movement of time changes. So if, if money, if capitalism is woven into that experience of I desire a thing, when will I get it? Or Oh God, I don't know how long I'm going to hold on to this thing before it's gone. And something happened to the time, to time space. If something started, who knows what? Should we, we, you know, obviously this is the creepiest thing about living in a universe this big. You don't know what happens. You don't know what happens every 20,000 years, 15,000 years. There could just be a time burp. You know what I mean? There could be a thing where suddenly time slows down to a fraction of the rate or speeds up. And if we were approaching something like that, then yeah, the world economies, they would begin to reflect the shifting nature of time. That's fucking nuts, man. Like if a time machine gets invented, it's going to destroy. It will destroy the economy, right? Like if it would, it would fuck everything up. Yeah, that's brilliant. And I think like, I mean, look, anybody, anybody who's ever been like scolded on Twitter knows that time is different, right? So you're like moment to moment to moment. Who's saying what? Who's saying what? Who's saying what? Who's saying what? The day lasts fucking forever. You go to bed exhausted just because you've been paying attention to moments. Or if you meditate, right? Like that's the sort of other version you meditate and like, I mean, how like anybody, if you and I, we won't do this, but if you and I were just to decide on this podcast to just sit and meditate for three minutes, three fucking minutes in silence with people listening, like they would think that it lasted fucking hundred years. They were listening to science. And, and for us, we would have so much going on or nothing depending on how you wanted to meditate. So you can instantly see that like time is like, yeah. So again, as meditation enters, as people's responses to media, you know, everything gets sort of thrown up and shocked in a certain way. And yeah, of course, economy is made up of space and time. It's the all. So as that relationship of all of us to all of us changes, then yeah, like the economy is going to completely change. Is that like that? Is that Bitcoin? Is that like crypto is like that? Is that I'm not getting in a crypto conversation because I don't still don't understand it now. I'm proud that I don't, but it's like, is it like. This is so interesting. We're, we're, you know, Terrence, okay. Terrence McKenna, he, he would, he said, well, technology is making it so the amount of time between what you want, what you can imagine and it coming into the world or you achieving it is getting shorter and shorter and shorter. So capitalism is dependent on that amount of time between what you want or what you can imagine and you getting it like maintained some stable rate, you know, and also or, or, and it also depends on for some people that rate of time between what you want and what you get being infinity, right? Like not everybody can get everything because there's not enough for everybody, you know, the whole thing falls apart. So, so like, so that amount of time between the desire and the manifestation of the desire via some currency is supposed to, it can't be the same for everyone for wealthy people. God, you're so smart, man. I'm just breaking apart what you're saying for wealthy people. Time, time is different in the sense that a wealthy person wants a thing. There's no saving up. It's how long does it take for Amazon to get it to your house or how long does the take to get the adrenochrome helicopter to parachute it over your head? Whatever the fuck you're doing. You know what I mean? But it's like, but, but, but for, for like people in the non-privileged classes, it's like, it can take a year just to go on a vacation or something like that. So the experience of time is different among the classes, I guess. Damn. Yeah. That's so weird. Yeah. No, it's a classic class is in a lot of ways a function of the experience of time, right? So like turning around the other way, like rather than placing it in the material world, creating the experience, actually, the experience is creating the material, the materiality of it, right? And so like imagine what would happen to the sense of time for people who had money if, and I do think that this is a real possibility, money lost value over time and like we're therefore incentivized to circulate it rather than gain value in a savings account, right? I love that. Yeah. So that, that would be, that would be great. I mean, I think also like if we think about when you're talking about cryptocurrency, this is another example of like the distortion of the spiritual understanding, like the spiritual understanding really in cryptocurrency is like, oh, we all are relating to each other. I mean, that was the thing with Bitcoin was like, as far as I understand, it was like every transaction relates to every user in a very explicit way. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But like, you know, that starts, that obviously like that kind of shit is crumbling and precarious because we're not able to live up to the spiritual promise of, you know, what we're, what we're really seeking. But then, you know, another thing about like, I want it, I have it. That's actually how the realm of the dead works, right? So this is another way of understanding like it when you're dead and you don't have a body when you think something, and I put this in quotes because you don't think anything when you're dead exactly, but when the process of thinking happens immediately, you're in the results of the thinking process. When you feel something, you're immediately connected to the weather of feeling that you're within. Yeah. So that's why when we think of the dead immediately, they're present for us, right? Like we feel their presence. If we're close to somebody that are dead, like you think that they're there because actually they've thought us and they're present with us and we think that it was us calling them in. God, what are you doing to me today? What are you doing, Carter? I'm going to stumble out of here. I'm going to be like Rhonda off into Texas raving. That's so cool, man. You're going to do that anyway. The dead are thinking of me. Well, okay. So, okay, this is so cool, man. So what is, so in, in, from this perspective, Mammon is weirdly like a function of time, right? Like man, like Mammon is a time God or a time, a creature of. Wow. Yeah, man. Okay. Okay. So the redemption of capitalism involves what? Uh, changing of the relationship with time. Yeah, definitely. Because one of the main functions of capitalism is the idea which is completely false, that you can pay someone for their labor. No one should be paid for their labor and no one can be paid for their labor. You can't buy time. I mean, that's preposterous, right? So like the whole idea time is money, right? But I mean, of course, it's like Benjamin Franklin thing. It's really quite astute when you start looking into it spiritually. Um, and he was obviously a mystic, but like when you have this idea that you can pay people for their labor, well, no, actually what if money becomes in capitalism if we redeem it? And I know like Marxist, you will not like that. I'm saying you can redeem capitalism at all. But I also think Marxism has its own sort of place in the equation, but like when you detach payment from labor and you instead say, I give you money out of a spirit of brotherhood because I like what you do. This is why Patreon is so amazing. I'm not that this is an ad for Patreon. I mean, it would be great if they didn't take a percentage of it. But like, like models like that are amazing because people are saying, I give you, I give you money because I trust you to create in the world. I don't give you money for your time. I don't give you money for your labor. You do the works that you do and we offer in a spirit of brotherhood. You know? Well, yeah, this is the, this is, uh, what is the story? The story in the Bible, the workers, it's one of my favorite stories. You know, the, like some workers were there in the morning. Some workers came in the evening, but they all got paid the exact same thing. They were the people, workers who came in the evening were paid what the workers in the morning were promised and the workers in the morning were like, what the fuck? They only work for 20 minutes. But like, like, but it was like this from what, from the conversation that we're having now, I mean, that, that parable has within it time and also an assessment of time from the transcendent perspective being really isn't about the hours that you put in. And actually that the hours are, that's just what you're saying. Well, you can't buy time. It's more about the intent, I guess, or the, uh, the, um, once you, once you're there, you're there. It doesn't matter how much time it took you to get there. I mean, this is, this also, by the way, you know, ties in a lot with the, I don't know how to put, I mean, this, this is something I think about when it comes to impending neurological, technological, merging the ability to download the ability to the, if you, if when we are finally able to like in at two minutes, now you know how to speak another language. Now you know how to play piano. All the people who struggled for years and went to conservatory and try to learn to play piano, all that, that time, all that, whatever there, how much their ego got attached to the struggle. It's now like, well, yeah. So you spent years to learn to play piano, but this kid, you know, that all that gets fucked up. All that gets like that, those sorts of hierarchies. Yeah. I'm sorry, but like just how pissed off people are like, you're going to dissolve student loan debt. I worked so hard to pay off my student loans. We're going to be like, Oh my gosh, you can fucking play dance of the goblins on the violin. Like I had to learn that, you know, like over decades. I couldn't just download it, you little shit. I couldn't download dance of the goblins. Look at my gnarled hands. But you should. I mean, but it should, it should be like, it should be that whatever version of that happens. We should be preparing people to live out their karma like as best they can to experience their own being to the heights of what they want it to be, whether it's artistic or not. You know, like being Beethoven or Einstein or these people that we hold up as the greatest of the great, that should be normal. Right. Like that should not be an extraordinary person. That should be normal and it doesn't have to look like that. It doesn't have to look like someone, you know, composing or making movies or, you know, coming up with scientific stuff. It can look however it looks. I mean, maybe someone's just like a really, really great fucking parent or gardener or whatever it is, but that achievement should be absolutely normal. And the fact that we don't want it to be is, and I'm not seeing there being a quality of ideas or creation. I think that lots of things would be better than others because people would still be trying out things that they're not good at. Yeah. And like, you know, doing the fucking James Franco thing where it's like, Oh, I wrote like a novel just because I felt like it and I made a movie because I felt like it. And I'm like, it's not all going to be equal, but it will be like this kind of, you know, openness for people to really deepen the gifts of their individuation and also to encounter their karma and to overcome the challenges of their karma. Right. Yeah. You're still going to, your karma is still going to appear regardless like if you make yourself like an incredible violin player, but you're also a race car driver, but you also speak 90 languages. But you also know how to tap dance and you also memorized the Bible downloaded in your brain along with you still, no matter what that, I think that actually is will be one of the benefits of this currently theoretical possibility is that you know what I mean? It'll show you different angles on your karma. Like, Oh, you thought you were suffering because you were lacking in this department. Well, look, now you have that lack has been fulfilled and yet the suffering is still there. So, right, you know, from, from that perspective, it might help people get more of a handle on what's really going on with them when they're suffering and, and like vanquish the illusion of like, Oh, if I could only accomplish this or have that. Yeah. Yeah. No, right. Yeah. Different things will end. Different things will enter then into the laws of karma, like what sort of people experience karmically want to be great. If like, we actually, you know, like my karmic debt to pay off was that I like yelled at a tree once instead of like, you know, like murdered 7000 people in my last life or something. Like, yeah, everything starts getting like better and better. But what, what actually will happen is that like, then like our, see, we're so, we're really wed to this view that extraordinary achievement only happens with, you know, certain people and that they are, you know, so we hold on to that so tightly and what happens then as a result of that is that we're all aspiring to be that, you know, and we're not actually working on the conditions of our own karma and our own culture that could lead to us being that, you know. Right. It's like for every idol, for every, you know, whatever, top of the top of the food chain and whatever industry thing there is, there's countless people who at least temporarily, temporarily have had their promise extinguished not because they're not working or because the way they're working is to try to become somebody else. And so that's the, isn't this why in the Bible and idolatry is so frowned upon and is, if you really want to piss off God, what do you do? Worship a golden calf bow down to something that isn't the moment. Isn't, right, that, that pit, I mean, obviously we're talking about, I'm not saying God actually gets mad at this, but I think that's what you're talking about. Like when we have a hierarchy in this, in the world and culture, where it's completely normal to worship someone who's achieved some thing and, and, and, and, and like place them on various pedestals and, and, and just imagine all I could never, I'll never do that. I'll never be like that. That's not possible. And you're saying, no, every single one of us, every single one of us has the capacity to be that. And I love that. So why would that's another destabilizer that fucks capitalism up to doesn't capitalism as we understand it kind of depend on worshiping achievers. Yeah, like in the way it exists right now, it's definitely about, you know, like there's, you know, there's a meritocracy, the idea of meritocracy. There's the idea that, you know, certain people achieve because they work really hard, all that kind of stuff. But like, obviously, you know, that's, that's not so for so many reasons. And one of them, you know, often overlooked is that people who have a lot of money are often deeply in a deep state of suffering, you know, right? Or doing or exacting their deep state of suffering on others, which is also, you know, truly terrible. I don't think I'm sorry. Don't you think meritocracy is good though? Don't we want a meritocracy? Don't you want the best surgeon operating on you? Not, you know what I mean? Isn't it in some cases, isn't meritocracy sort of important in the sense that we need to differentiate like just from an evolutionary perspective, it's like, look, that person is really good at something and this person is not. So let's imitate the person who's really good at something and instead of the person who's not because that that's like a, that would be horrible. So isn't meritocracy important in certain cases? Yeah, I mean, I think, I think like just sort of bringing it back to the way I was talking about things before where there's a cultural realm, a political rights realm and an economic realm. Yeah, you definitely want there to be a kind of merit-based system in the cultural realm, right? Like you want, you want success, you want ideas that are strong and real and skills that are strong and real to win out. It's just that we don't want those people treated differently politically or economically. Like that's, that's the, that's the issue, I think. And it's not, and, and not because we want everybody to be poor, but because we want everybody to be wealthy, you know, that's the, that's the reason. Yeah. Right. Well, but like incentivizing using like the current systems of wealth, it like, it's going to, you know, it's going to create some mutated like fucked up hybrid beings, right? It's like, you're not going to get, you're going to get like, you're going to get like greedy Beethoven. You're going to get like, you don't even, you're going to get like, you're going to get like Shakespeare, but who like is wants bling like Shakespeare. So like, you know, like, so, so in the, the more Mammon and the, the, uh, whoever it may be, the artistic achiever become fused from this perspective, the more it's going to dilute whatever the thing that we're calling merit or achievement just in the sense that, yeah. Yeah. I mean, just because it's going to like, occlude that person's ability to see the true value of what they're doing, which is not economic or political, but like spiritual off-rame, not just for others, but for themselves, you know, their own connection to God. And so when you say like, oh, God doesn't get angry at certain things, it's like, well, no, it's like God's not going to get angry for you at you for like taking a ton of money to perform a good surgery, but you're actually creating something that's very much like anger, which is a distance between you and spirit, you know, when you do that. So that's, that's not the anger of God. That's actually like our own frustration at no longer being able to see God. Wow. Yeah, it's like you, you, you're like, it's like the most beautiful thing in the universe, hands you a stack of money and you're just staring at the money. You're not even looking at like the clothing hand or anything. You're just looking at the dead green paper and ignoring who's handing it to you. No wonder you're miserable. You're like getting these in credit. Like the gift isn't the fucking paper. It's the thing that's bringing it to you along with all the other wonderful stuff. Wow. Cool. Man. Whoo. Mammon. Fuck. This is so good. This is a masterclass in mammon. Just, you know, like, I mean, I think that these are the things that people are going to have to think about more and more. And I mean, you know, it's like the world, especially I'm sure today as we record this for a lot of people, it just feels such shit and like people are talking about how terrible it is all the time and a coming civil war and, you know, like climate change and this and that and this and that. And like, obviously, like all those are wedded toward to capitalism and the economy, like the anticipation of a certain kind of future, you know, and that, that, you know, there's a book about, gosh, I forget the exact title, but it's by someone who's on my show, Joshua Ramey about divination like neoliberal economy and economics as a system of divination, right? I think it's called the politics of divination actually. But it's like shit like this, this idea that like, oh, you know, things are getting worse and worse and worse and worse, but actually that is divination. Like that's us trying to interpret what's happening with the gods when we all know that things don't go like that. We all know that actually what if this whole thing that's happening, you know, right now with that sort of splitting up intention between states leads to smaller countries, which, you know, actually ends up redeeming allowing for more freedom in those states where people have restricted, you know, abortion, you know, rights and all that. Now, look, all that is not to say that people aren't facing on the ground shit and suffering right now, but we were anyway in other forms and in other pockets and in other places. So like, we don't know where these things lead to and we forget that we actually also direct them. Like we direct them, we direct them and there are lots of different ways to direct. It's not just protest. It's not just direct action. There are lots of ways to direct the field of action in the world and it is really up to us in so many ways. So like the moment we're like, it's all terrible. It's all blah, blah, blah, blah. It's going to a horrible place. That's actually the moment we fall back into the capitalist time current and time form. You know, and that's what and people claim to not be doing that when they think it's so bad. It's like capitalism is bad enough without you imagining obliteration. Like it's doing horribly well on its own. Now, like get to a different place, have a different experience and then start redirecting how this all works. Oh my God. Yeah. Don't sing hymns to Mammon. If you're saying things, you know what I mean? Those are the hymns, spontaneous hymns to the one of the Lords of Hell and you don't even know you're singing them. Right. That's what's even that's what's so insidious. At least if you go to like a typical like dark satanic or go to the fucking Bohemian Grove, you know you're doing some crazy shit in front of the owl with a chance or whatever. But in this case when you're just kind of mildly like spreading your fear among others, you are actually just participating in this secret hidden religion, which is the worship of Mammon and Mammon loves your fear. Mammon loves your anxiety. Your anxiety actually underlines, crystallizes, right? That's the idea. It brings into it. It makes the most important thing in the world, the paper. It makes the most important thing in the world, the literal least important thing and it depends. Wow. Yeah, you're not you're not you're not saying don't be you're not saying don't be afraid of there's not work to do. There's not activism to do. It's just saying look, don't do it for Mammon because if you write if you're if you're doing your activism for one of the princes of hell, even if the activism seemingly is to make the world a better place, it's not going to work out. Whereas if it's coming from a heart that is not in the as you said capitalist time current fuck, then you know that you're going to you're going to it's going to be more effective. It's going to be real. Totally. And that's why drawing your sense of time into your heart is actually really important right now like experiencing time as a heart sense rather than a thought sense, you know, like think about time in your heart, you know, and like suddenly something shifts and like all kinds of new thoughts become available. All kinds of new actions become available. I mean, we've got to do that with everything. I mean, the the the coming change of the heart and the cosmos God that the coming change of the heart and the cosmos is actually that's where we're all going. Those are the things that we're going to have to learn and that's going to take place in so many ways that not just the time sensor, the economic sense, but that's where the mysteries and the and the real spiritual work are all going to need to be done. And you can just tell like if you just sit for a moment and it hold the experience of time within your heart, you know, not in its beats, not your not your physical heart because that could just screw you up probably and trancing yourself and slowing your heart down. But like if you just do it in a sort of that sense of your spiritual heart that that heart that feels love that feels affection that feels care and warmth for others and you'll hold time there. You can just feel I mean that just feels different than thinking about the fucking bill that's due, right? And that I mean that is that's pretty pretty indicative of the direction that we need to go in when we're dealing with economy and when we're dealing with time and when we're dealing with anything really because that's our that's our task right now that sort of almost holy grail initiative. You know, it expands when I'm doing it now. It's like suddenly I'm like I'm not just stuck in this day or month. I'm like, I'm in like the dress. I'm like in the, you know, like you're suddenly you become part of this ancient being you become like part of something so old and beautiful instead of being just sucked in to like the next 10 or 20 minutes or it's so cool, man. I've never heard of that. I've heard a lot of heart meditations because of these hippies I hang out with but I've never heard of that. That's so cool. Well, I mean, you can feel it. You've done everybody's done it on festival days, right? Like on Christmas, it's like, I think about Christmas. You're actually what you're doing then is connecting yourself to 2000 years of history, right? Like and that's part of the warmth you're feeling is like if you feel it, you know, you can also experience the 2000 years of, you know, oppression if you want, but you're feeling you're you're you're hooking into a rhythm of, you know, the presence of the dead, you know, around a festival time. So you can start to feel it around Easter, around Christmas, around whatever festival you're, you know, religion or whatever. It's like fucking crazy, right? Like you stand on that day and you're acknowledging the presence of 2000 people across 2000 years. So like you can start to see like, oh, this is actually happening in different instances in my life anyway. Maybe if I just do this intentionally or engage with it, you know, with a little more attentiveness, I can start to experience something, you know. Connor, tell me we're going to have to we got to jump into it. We do you, I don't like tell me about your new book. I haven't had a chance to read it. I got it. I'm excited to read it. Hot, hot mountain. That's it. Yeah. I'm I'm actually I'm really excited for you to read it. And you can also listen to the auto book, which I read. So the sweet soothing sound of my voice will read. Is it I love your voice. Is it on audible? Yeah, it's on audible. Yeah. Wow. You have to I think by the time this episode comes out, the book will be out because in the U.S. It comes out on July 5th. So then, you know, and in Ireland, the U.K. comes out on the 21st of July, but it's, yeah, there's a lot of time in the book. In fact, it's one of the main concerns of this novel, which is a sort of literary horror novel. It's a horror novel about emotional suffering. So it's, you know, it's about these two guys, Jack and Todd, and they went to school together, high school together, and Jack relentlessly, relentlessly bullied Todd in high school, but the book takes place 15 years later. They haven't seen each other since then and Todd is sitting on a beach in New England and is like six, almost seven year old son, Anthony is playing in the water and Todd sees someone walking up the beach and, you know, because it's a novel, of course, you know that that's bad news. And so he gets closer and closer. It, he sees that it's Jack and Jack, Jack says, Hey, can I, can I stay with you for a night? You know, for very complicated reasons, for very complicated reasons, Todd's like, yeah, okay. And Jack stays and stays and starts developing this really intense relationship with Todd's son. And Todd's just like, you have to fucking leave out a third of the way in something fucking horrible happens. And from there, it just gets darker and darker. Oh my God, that's so fucking nuts. You know, as a dad, that's like, you, that is just what you just described is the worst. It's the worst. The worst. Your son is friends with your bully. Yeah. It's, yeah, that's. That's a pretty terrible part of the book. Um, and, you know, a lot of, you know, a lot of people, if I can talk about what people have said about it, because, you know, one of the big moments for me was I got an email saying, can I call you? And it was from Clive Barker, who I've never, you know, what? Yeah. And I need, I need just called me and he was like, this book is incredible. I want you to know you've done something really. Amazing. And like, this is really special. And he like blurb the book and, you know, it's been getting like these great reviews and all the magazines and stuff. I'm just very, very excited about. I mean, that relations. Thanks, man. That moment was huge for me because I've been reading, you know, Clive Barker, Hellbound Heart, Night Breed, all, well, it's called Cabal's a book, you know, Weave World, the Magica, all that shit. Like I've been reading Candy Man, you know, which is has a different name as a short story as well, but like all that, like I've been reading since I was a little kid, you know, and like that was just like, fuck. And it's so crazy because I used to admit when I was writing when I was a kid, I was like, like eight or nine years old when I started writing and I make these fake book covers and I put blurbs by authors like Stephen King or whatever on the back and one of them was Clive Barker and now this book has come out and Conrad Beve's debut novel is a bleak dark adrenaline rush. That's like an excerpt from a much longer blurb that he gave it. But it's like that's what Clive Barker says. And I actually have this. So mind blowing. I'm getting goosebumps. I'm getting fucking goosebumps, man. Clive Barker would like that. Well, you know, yeah, sure. What you like Stephen King. Fuck you. Read Clive Barker. That was like that was like the horror of horror and I love Stephen King, but you know, the kids were reading Clive Barker. You'd be like, oh, shit, you're going to mess with that. What is that? What is it? Short stories like the books of blood or something. Yeah, dude. Yeah. Like he has really like had a profound impact on like our culture. I don't think people realize how many movies I don't think people understand how much of popular culture is shaped by Clive Barker and you like what the fuck, man? Did you have any idea that he'd been like a copy got sent to him or you were like, yeah, yeah, I knew, I knew that because I requested a copy be sent to him and we had emailed. He emailed me like a year before that and like we communicated a tiny bit, but there was no like, I've never met him. You know, I just, I was just a huge fan and I was like, holy shit, like I'm in contact with this person and then sent the book out. I didn't hear anything for a while and you know, you send the book out to a lot of people, you know, when it when it's coming out. And you just like, I mean, I said, I had it sent to this guy who, you know, won the Nobel Prize for literature is one of my favorite writers jam. Yeah. See, I couldn't hear back from him. I'm just like, whatever, you know, you send it to your dumb friends like me too. We're real slow readers. You got to forgive us. I'm not like Clive Barker. He's probably he rips through books probably. Yeah, but I mean, it's just like Caitlin, Caitlin blurb the book as well. Our mutual friend, Caitlin Doty and some other people, Brian Evanson and Paul Tremblay. And, you know, I mean, it's just like, so, and yeah, I'm going on a book tour. I'm not coming to Texas, unfortunately, but like I'm doing, you know, right around probably when this comes out, I'm doing the East Coast and the, and the, and the West Coast book tour. So like, it's just like mind blowing like all this, you know, I've wanted to be a writer since I was like, this is what I've wanted to do. I mean, the podcast is fucking awesome. And I'm so happy to do the podcast, but like being a novelist is what I've wanted to do since I was a little kid. And so like that, well, I wanted to do porn too, but I did that for 10 years. So now the end of novelist is this thing. And so now it's like this is happening and this is all, you know, coming together and it's just fucking, it's, it's incredible, man. I mean, I mean, I'm sorry. How many other porn stars are you aware of that are novelists? Well, see, this is a really interesting thing that you're asking me because it's something that I, I just, my friend pointed out to me the other day, my friend, Heather Berg, she wrote a book called porn work, which is like a communist look at porn. It's a fucking incredible book actually, but she was like, I was talking about how hard it was to move from doing porn to other stuff. And she's like, yeah, you're the only one. And I was like, what do you mean? She's like, yeah, you're the only one that's done it. Now, what she meant was not that there weren't other porn performers who had written books. There are lots of porn performers who have written amazing books or porn performers have podcasts, great podcasts, whatever other things. However, I, as far as I know, I'm the only one who's done this stuff that's not rooted in or related to expressing sex work. Right. That and so I'm not trying to brag about that. I'm actually trying to say like how fucking incredibly difficult that passageway was and I'm so, so hopeful that this makes it easier for all of her sex workers. Like I like the idea that like I've been able, I'm sure there have been other people like there's, there must be someone that I'm missing people from non-English speaking countries or something like that, but as far as I know, like and being able to break that ground or break that wall or barrier to allow people to come through and probably do a much better like job of it than me. Why was it difficult? Aside from like how hard it is to write a novel, what do you mean specifically as a sex worker moving to writing as, you know, to working on something non-related to sex work? What was the difficulty there? Well, that's what everybody wants you for, right? So that's the first thing. Like to even get in the fucking room, like people are like talk about sex work because everybody's so mystified by sex work because of all the fucking stigma and regulation and all that and talk about something that relates to Roe versus Wade. Like, I mean, all the like bodily autonomy laws on the internet, all this just kind of shit. That's just insane. So like to even get in the room, you have to sort of self mystify and be like, yes, I have this secret knowledge that I can bring to you. Well, at the same time, you desperately want to be like, this should be normal and understood as normal and part of human culture and as it has been for like thousands and thousands of years. So like this should be okay. But then you have to sort of as the hustle, mystify yourself to get yourself in the room and then that's what they want you write about. And so even when this came out, like, well, it's not not out at the time that we're talking about when this comes out. Yeah, yeah, right. So so even as Hawk Mountain comes out like every like my my marketing team for Norton in the US and then Doubleday in Ireland, UK, fucking great people. But they're like, oh, let's get you on this thing and they'll ask you about sex work and porn and all this. And I'm like, that's fine. I'm not ashamed of that by any means at all. I'm quite proud of it. However, like, fuck off. Like this book stands on its own. You can ask me those questions, but the book has to be in the foreground. And so when I I think that that's it really, it's like you never are allowed to do anything but that, you know, and everything you do has to touch it. Not because of any sort of a central thing, except the fact that people in in culture are so fucked up about sex and sex work and pornography that they can't stop. You know, they can't help themselves. And so I had to be really like consciously taking a stand against that. And I know it's going to come up and that's fine. I'm I'm happy to talk with people about it. But like, can we talk also about the book and and the fact that the book has gone already this far before it's even come out without it being like porn centered. Not because porn is bad or lesser than porn is its own art form that is I think just as fucking momentous and amazing as novels, but it it's just because it gets to be, you know, have this life. I think it's pretty amazing. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, totally, man. I get it. Yeah, you so much. I mean, it's you're so much more than just that. That's what's, you know, God, who is it? Buckminster Fuller. Somebody was, I haven't read the essay, but it's always telling me how anti-specialization he was. How are you like, you know, was talking about how that's just the worst thing that ever happened is this concept of this uniform, singular or whatever. And then of course, yeah, add to it that you won one of your specializations is porn sex work. Yeah. And that we're all like weird sex deprive freak. So everyone's like, okay, okay, book, whatever. Tell me about talk about sex, please. You know, that's frustrating, right? That's got to be frustrating. You've like spent all this time writing a really good book. And then you're going to have to deal with it right on tour. There's you're going to have to deal with it because inevitably it's going to it's going to come up every single way. Well, the good stuff will come up too, right? Like the like the sex workers and the people who like my porn that like the novel, like that all happened as well. It's just going to be the journalist who's like, so like they'll just start with like, so what's better writing books or making porn, you know, and it's just like, I don't know, like, have you like, have you read a book? You know, it's just going to be like, it's just going to be fucking that kind of stuff. But I don't, I don't care. I mean, I've managed much worse than that. Obviously, like over time, I just, you know, and see, it's so tricky to even talk about it with you, Duncan, because like even as we it's like, like even the language that we use, like, well, I do more than that. Like what I don't mean more like, I don't mean more like better than, you know, but that's what people that no, and I know you don't either, but that's what people will hear as we say it, or it's like, you know, oh, he actually did something that wasn't porn related that it's like, they're these little because the way that people think they're these little cues for them to find their way to condemn, you know, this other thing. And it's like, the fact of the matter, I mean, there's there's sex in the book, but the fact of the matter is like, my interests are all over the place. Obviously, as anybody who's heard me on this show, I'm just fucking bonkers. So, but like, you know, I think it's just it's so it's so sad, but I'm so happy to have played a part in in, you know, confronting that that fucking wall. And I mean, you know, I can't wait for you to read this and are you are you kidding? Man, I know that's my next stop. I'm going to the bookshelf pulling it down. I can't wait, man. You're just I and I'm sorry. I didn't get to it before this conversation. We just moved up and slammed. I haven't read a damn thing. I've listened to a few auto. Yeah, no, I don't but you know, there's a lot of stuff about time in it because like parts of the book are told like in the flashback of, you know, like them being in high school together, but those are written in present tense, whereas the present time ones are written in past tense and there's a reason why I do that time sort of stumbles and those two things get sort of fucked up and shifted around and there's stuff about child's consciousness in there and everything. But it's also just very like page ternary. That's the that's been the greatest compliment. It's like people have read it. They're like, I just read this in one sitting like I just like couldn't stop. It was like compulsive and it was horrible. Like it made me feel like shit, but I couldn't stop. Oh, my favorite thing. That's my favorite. That's Cormac McCarthy does that to you. That's Cormac McCarthy. They're just like, what the fuck am I reading? But you're just go. Oh, my God. I can't wait and congratulations. I'm so excited to hear that it is being well received and who knows, maybe like what I'll be doing shows around where you're doing a book signing or something. That'd be a dream come true. I'm fucking great. I would love that. Well, I love you. Thank you for being coming back on the show. I love you too, Duncan. You know, we haven't spoken since my show when I was in the fucking pit of heartbreak and now we're here. I'm with that guy that we talked about. I know I've got the book coming out. I'm gonna, I mean, just it's that that's, you know, time. It's like, I remember the last you seem like you're you're doing great though, man.

Greetings, friends. It is I, D. Trussell, and you are listening to the Dunkin Trussell Family Hour podcast. I woke up at 4 this morning. It's crazy. I've been reading this book called Can't Hurt Me by David Goggins. It's almost too inspiring or something. It's like the guy is some form of immortal being. Like he's like a super athlete or super ultra runner. So he does like 150 mile marathons. He basically burrows through mountains with his will. And he's written this incredible book that just, it's infectious. And I started off listening to it thinking like, I don't know about this guy. And then by the end, I'm listening to it on a treadmill at 5am at the gym. And I know that might just be everyday life for the 20% of my podcast audience who are ultra marathon runners. But for me, it's like the second coming of Christ to find myself running again and exercising again. And this Goggins book mixed in with a healthy dose of Neville Goddard, who you should also check out, has really got me going. Also, the early mornings are psychedelic. And if you want some easy way to feel superior to everyone in your house or your neighborhood, just wake up at 4am and look outside and think to yourself, wow, I did it. I pulled myself out of bed at 4am. While all these weak, miserable people dream and sleep, I rise to power. Then repeat the seven sacred names of Asmodeus. Turn yourself into a bat and fly around your neighbor's house as they sleep and look through the window and watch them as they sleep and judge them and then fly back to your house and turn back into yourself and go back to sleep. So I do that every morning. And I wouldn't be able to do it if not for this incredible book by David Goggins. So you guys should definitely check it out. We have a fantastic podcast for you today.

He's a meditation teacher and he's got a fantastic podcast called the Astral Hustle. Please welcome to the DTFH Corey Allen. Corey Allen, welcome to the DTFH. It is so nice to get to chat with you in person instead of just emailing. Oh man, I'm really glad to be here and thank you. It's so glad I'm also so happy to be chatting in person. It's really cool. I checked out your, well what I could check out of your book because it's still in pre-order, but I was sort of like looking through the beginning of it and realizing that we're part of this like community, like the people in the Fords giving you talking about the book in the beginning or people that I've had on my podcast and many of the people you've had on your podcast, I've had on my podcast and I just realized like what is this thing that we all seem to kind of be part of? What would you call it? I think it's a new emergence of like, you know, I look at knowledge or wisdom or like the inner path and seeking all that stuff. It's like, I don't really look at individuals per se. I look at it as like this long scroll moving through time and like we're all, humans are all these individual cells that create the species of the human critter and I look at the collective like neural connections between all those things is this long river of data and information and for, you know, thousands of years and increasingly so in the complexity as civilization in the modern age in society and more people have emerged out of birth and so forth have continued to complexify. That story has gotten more intense and more streamlined and so forth and so throughout time, you know, people have been picking up the pen and writing on that scroll and then dying and picking up the pen and new people pick up the pen and write on that thing and it's just emerging and emerging and emerging and it's always changing shape. You know, like back in the day, there used to be like pre-technology. Of course, there was gurus and things like that and who was it? That was some dude hanging around that if you had a question about, you know, an existential question, a spiritual question, a question about life, whatever, you would go find that guy that was a guru and you'd say, yo man, I got this issue. What do you know about it? And he would tell you. But now those people are irrelevant pretty much. Now we have Google instead of guru, right? So now when you have a question, you can go ask Google and now Google will tell you, you know, all these different individuals, all these different books and all these different things you can read. So I really think what's happening is that all of these, you know, these collection of individuals that you were just referring to, we're like this kind of singular connected hive mind of the human collective conscious wisdom that's all been maturing and evolving up until this point in time. The thing about Google, I think there is a difference, man. And I'm not trying to like, I mean, I, I neem curly Baba, I would say is my guru. And because of that, I will seem suspect as I'm trying to defend the guru formation thing, which I think is like really quite dangerous generally. And I think more and more it's being shown to just be, if anything, that time definitely does seem to be passing. That being said, I think a difference in the data stream that comes from Google or from the internet versus like human contact. I think there's a big difference, but it's tricky in the sense that you can start thinking it is the same, which is I had this great conversation with Damien Eccles and we were talking about the transmission of information, the scroll, so to speak, and the disciplic succession as it sometimes called the, what's it called, whispered transmission. It has all these great names for it. But he was telling me, and I think I have experienced this to some degree, that it is a combination of just basic philosophical concepts mixed in with something that's a little bit like the Olympic torch, except instead of starting wherever off of, you know, an Olympic flame and then traveling, it's moving through time. And it seems to have started, quite often the stories are it starts from some messiah being, but a collective maybe, or even something more than that. Do you know what I'm saying? I do, yeah. And this is the Dharma transmission that they talk about sometimes. Do you feel like you've gotten that transmission, like you've gotten the download in a traditional way? I feel like we all have the download and it's a matter of clearing away all the stuff that's been piled on top of it to kind of get back to it, the natural brilliance. And I totally agree with what you're talking about as far as the guru idea. A human contact is crucial and essential to, I think, to just being a person that's learning things in the world. But I guess the point I was trying to make was that knowledge and information is no longer being held hostage by one person. Now there's like all these different places, and that's one of what I was mentioning, all the different people that you can find through the internet and all the books and all that stuff. We're living in this amazing time where there isn't just one person that's guarding all the information, like it's everywhere. And I think that's such a useful turn for this type of stuff to take, because it makes it where you inherently kind of understand that there isn't just one way. There are a multitude of ways and all of them have value, and you can find what speaks to you and extract and learn from those different things and kind of build your own individual narrative of seeking that is what you need, because we all need something different, of course. I've been working on my discipline lately, and I'm always trying to learn music these days, but that's something we have in common. And not just learn music the way I in the past have just dabbled or whatever, but really going online, taking courses, studying music theory, and I'm astounded by how easy it is to learn how to play music these days. I mean, forget all the guru bullshit, and like if you wanted to learn guitar in the old days, you would have to find a guitar teacher. You needed to go and hang out with people who play the guitar at the very least, but you couldn't go on YouTube and instantaneously have access to thousands of guitar lessons. And what's fascinating to me about the internet is it is such a beautiful reflection of us in the sense that back to back, we have guitar lessons. You could take free classes from Harvard. You can make contact with some of the smartest people, at least the smartest public figures are putting themselves out there today through Twitter, Patreon. And yet also, there is this ocean of just shit, right? Like, you know what I mean? And like, when I watch my habituations and my pattern on the internet, it's always wild to like realize like, why am I choosing to, why do I keep going back to some of these data streams that are inevitably just hellscapes? And this, looking at the Ford of your book and reading what I could of it, it made me want to talk to you a little bit about that, because I think that decision to siphon bad energy. You were talking about peace being the energy, I think versus fear, right? And that decision to like go to the fear, go to the fucking fossil fuel, go to the like polluting energy that gives you this, definitely gives you a rush. Fear will put a spring in your step. But man, it's not very sustainable. And the decisions you make in that frightened state are quite often wrong. But why, Corey, why do we pick fear over peace? If there is this thing that you're saying is in us, why, why aren't we there? Why don't we want to go there? I think it's like, it's not that we're choosing fear, it's that we grow up in this circumstance where we're bullied into being fearful. And it's because, you know, there's obviously a bazillion reasons, one of which is we live in, you know, in a society where like, America is in the business of making things famous. And if you're not famous, a lot of people feel like normalness isn't enough. And being normal is failing. If we're being told that we're not enough so that we need to keep buying new things, we're marketed to like, if you have this, you'll feel okay. If you buy this, you'll feel okay. If you wear that, you'll feel okay. And so we're all feeling like less than we're feeling like we're scared. So, you know, the modern world is freaky, it's complex. And so, you know, we're, yeah, we're just born into this space of like, yeah, man, feeling insignificant, and like nobody, and like we need to kind of, in an animalistic way, almost get ours, you know, that's sort of this theme that is really beat into people for whatever reason. And what was amazing for me anyway, was like realizing that based upon my, you know, family inheritance, I'll call it, you know, my five billion dollars that I inherited. Yeah, I inherited a billion. Wow, five's great. Oh, I got to end this, man. If only a billionaire, yeah, I'm sorry, man, anything under three, I can't. Sorry, man. Well, I'm working at it, I'm trying to inherit again. Well, just let me know whenever you can, and we'll pick this up again. All right, well, nice chatting with you. Yeah, this was, this was okay, actually. Yeah, this is okay. No, but anyway, you know, like, you know, your family inherited programs, the operating script that you get from your family circumstances and so forth. And yeah, man, you know, I had a lot of, a lot of pain, a lot of suffering based upon, you know, being loved conditionally, being taught by my father that he was this Dallas like banker kind of Tarantino movie type of guy that was very much this alpha conservative fellow that always carried guns and stuff and sure, I had one of those. And wait a second, maybe we're synchronizing here. Then you took my inheritance, motherfucker. Oh, hey, man, that's the game, Duncan. So you got, you got the, the, the like, power dad. Yes, got the power dad download and the all of that. And, and so, you know, and then he wasn't around, you know, and so it was like, I had a lot of resentment, a lot of fee wasn't around because of the divorce you got your parents got divorced or wasn't around because he was a workaholic or divorce. Yeah, yeah, divorce. And he just didn't really have much interest, you know, right. So he was doing his own thing. And so, yeah, man, like that left me with a lot of resentment. And then just, you know, otherwise being, as I said, just being growing up in a destructive attachment environment with conditional love and emotional manipulation and, and being parented through fear where you, you know, I wasn't able to know what to trust know what to believe like what is real like what I'm being gaslit constantly is kind of how I felt and it left me feeling calcified and externally and and scared and just tons of anxiety and cynical and ultimately I used my begin using my intellect as a way to like chop down everyone else so that I could feel secure. So if I could like undress someone intellectually really fast and show them that I could think, you know, in particular ways, it make them sort of like, hmm, I don't know, maybe it's like a jujitsu move like you got to get someone to where they're like intellectually about to tap and then you can feel comfortable because you know that you've got that that handle on them, you know, and so yeah, I know what you mean, man. I know that you mean you like because you're insecure and because you I'm sorry, can you all one second? I don't mean to interrupt this, but my Chihuahua was about to shit on my podcast, Epistry. Oh, it's a good metaphor. It's like, it's so bad and embarrassing. I remember when I started realizing I was doing that and like, like just the weightiness of that and the neediness that you, you know, you're around somebody and they don't understand why they're probably feeling tired when they're hanging out with you and or you know what I mean? It's like there's something and it's because you're literally like want them to be your daddy. Yeah, totally. Yeah, that's it. That's it. And it's like, you find yourself as an adult, like one of your walking with someone else, you're letting that you're like following them in this most nuanced little microtonal type of way where it's like, you're walking together, but you're really following them like a little kid. You're just not holding hands, even though you're like six foot three, you know? Yeah. So, so here's, here's how I, I chrysalis and in hatched out of that was feeling all of that stuff. We're just talking about all the nastiness, you know, I don't, I imagine you probably had this same thing, man, is like just because of where you, you seem to have ended up and it's secure billionaire. The classic problem. Classic problem. No matter how many fucking fountains I get around my mansion, I still can't sleep, man. It's crazy too. And the fact that they're all filled with your own piss is you'd think that would do it. I tried piss, it didn't work. Then someone said drum didn't work because now the cumbereds keep me up at night. Those cumbereds are heaven. Their feathers look beautiful though after a couple of months of that. Undeniably beautiful. Yeah. You can really, it's where I do a lot of my truth gazing is into the kaleidoscopic feathers of cumbereds. What did Gandhi say? I learned everything I knew, I know from the cumberd. That's right. That's right. Yeah. He said, my knowledge went tits up whenever I started gazing into cumbereds. Okay. So underneath all of the suffering, the external suffering, the destructive vinegary narcissism out into the world, I always had this deep, deep connection and awareness of true compassion, of real love, of this desire for peace because being in a chaotic space emotionally and physically, I've really learned, I was shown what the lesson was to like, this is why peace is important because this is what it's like when it isn't here. And a lot of people grow up in a rather stable situation, but whenever you grow up in an emotionally or physically chaotic type of situation, you really honor and you have this integral connection towards like, okay, peace is fucking valuable, man. And I always had that underneath all that other stuff. And it was weird. It was like, I was living disconnected from who I was outwardly into the world. And so I randomly overheard when I was a teenager, I randomly overheard someone mentioning about like who if they could talk to a couple of people like dead or alive, who would they be? They mentioned Jesus, Nietzsche and a few other people, which like, we could stop right there. That's an interesting enough like dinner table to have Jesus and Nietzsche. And so I was randomly like walking through a bookstore one day and I saw Nietzsche on the back of the spine of a book and I went over and picked it up and I was like, holy shit, this like, I felt completely incompatible with the rest of the world. But this, this is like how I think this is the math of how my conceptual mind works. And I became obsessed with like Western philosophy, right? So I went way deep into Western philosophy. And then just following some of the bridges of the hippie philosophers like Terrence McKenna and Robert and Tom Wilson and people like that. I then found my way to Eastern philosophy. And then once I read that, I was like, this is not only what I think this is this is how I think this is what I believe this is this is the kind of the pathways in which I see are possible in the world. And I became obsessed with Eastern philosophy. And that's how I learned how to meditate was, you know, as a teenager, privately in my in my room, I had this sort of like Victor Franklin moment where I realized no matter what was happening outside of my skin in the world, that the world in my body, my inner life is mine. And I can begin to turn like that those that those broken pieces into I can melt that gold down and reform it into what I know is possible and then allow that begin to begin to emerge and hatch out of my body into the world. And I just started like, yeah, doing that, you know, meditating and doing trying all these different practices, seeing what worked. And just quietly one step at a time, one day at a time, following that path. And what became fascinating to me was that I saw like, as I just continued on, and I would read, you know, I got way into psychology and neuroscience and all this stuff. And I could feel like as I would read, I could feel like I'd feel stoned after I was done reading a lot of this stuff. And I realized like, that's my brain literally like the horizon of my mind is getting pushed back. Because I'm like, my the wattage of my brain is getting turned up. And I got addicted to that feeling. And as I continued doing these practices, I started to realize like, wait a second, I'm like, I'm a different person than I was three months ago. Like I don't feel as angry, I don't feel as scared. I'm able to like rest in my skin, like my hands don't shake when I go to put the key in the keyhole the front door anymore, like I'm not as anxious, you know, did you did you find something when that's the times I've had that happen? I realized how addicted I am to that anxiety. Like, when it's not there, there is it, I don't know, did you have that that sense of like shit, man, that was me or that was like, that was one of the defining qualities of who I am. Yeah, being anxious, freaked out, neurotic, weird, whatever. And yeah, and then when it's gone, when when you're doing the work, and you get these little spaces in between freakouts that are longer than you're used to, there is a sense of like, shit, did I just lose something? It's really kind of pathetic. You know, no, no, no, it's a beautiful part of the process, man. And you did lose something. You lost an old story of who you told yourself who you were. It's like every big breakthrough I've had in my life, or you know, they're not even like, you know, these big theatrical breakthrough, but like these big moments I had of deeper insights of hatching, of continuing to follow this new image and idea of myself into the kaleidoscopic bridge of the future. Like every time that that happened, there was like a mourning period. And it was because the I in quotes, that I believed I was was dead. And it was like, okay, that guy who was wearing death metal t-shirts and pissed off and angry at everyone, it was like this Nietzschean that thought he was smarter than everybody. That guy's dying. And like, it's okay, it was who I was, but he's gone now. And like, I'm going to sit with that feeling. And so I know what you mean is that that I call those like growing pains, you know, your but it's like internal growth as opposed to physical growth. It reminds me of like, when you have an shitty piece of furniture in your house. And you I don't know if this, I mean, like, I've sometimes I'll have a thing around me for the longest time. Like, for example, right now, I'm looking over at the corner of my podcast studio, and I have an overturned spray bottle of cleaner next to a record player that I don't use. And it's ugly. But I haven't I've just let it sit there and ignore it. But it's always there. It's just but anytime you take something like that out of your room, you feel that space. And it's a strange thing of like, God damn it, I was attached to the clutter. I was attached to the to the I was attached to the whatever that fuck it was, I was hoarding. And God, what weird creatures we are, huh? It's like, you see those? Well, you know, I don't know, they said it was pathetic. I thought it was kind of cool from an evolutionary perspective, not pathetic. They said it was sad. But this story emerged of these like bees or hornets, building their nest out of plastic. You know, or you see these creatures that construct their shells out of like, plastic floating in the ocean. And that's I think what a lot of us are like, in this dimension, right? Like, we're like, gathering, we gather the story, the shit story, and we assemble this crazy fucking shell thing. And then we just huddle inside of it and hiss at anything that walks by. But yeah, you, it seems abnormal to me, you're a teenager meditating and reading Nietzsche and like coming to some brilliant realization, I'm just these days, I think, coming to these kinds of realizations, the great peaceful kingdom in the heart and all that stuff. Yeah. Yeah, man. I mean, it wasn't, you know, like an easy just like, you know, light switch type of thing. It's a it faded in over the period of a long, a long time. But, you know, I, I don't know if it's just, I have thought about like, how was that possible? Like no one in my family were readers even, much less being into something esoteric. You know, I got way into Crowley into Sufi mysticism and all that stuff at the same time. And, you know, I ended up meeting Robin and Tom Wilson whenever I was 18. And then I went and, you know, spent time with him in person over us 21. How did that happen? Can you tell me that story? Yeah, sure, man. Be glad to. So basically, you know, in really diving into all this, this obsessive compulsive reading, which, you know, in hindsight, I realized that, like, I was putting blinders on to use that obsession with philosophy, and even Zen Buddhism, which at the time I was still coming from the headmind, not the heartmind. It was like, here's another way to be stringent clinical about reality. This is just a more express way to depersonalize, you know, through Zen Buddhism. Anyway, amidst all of that, I just randomly found a copy of Prometheus Rising, one of ours 1817 or 18. And yeah, I just read it and was like, Oh, holy shit, this guy, you know, particularly at the time, it was like, this is kind of the I grew up on like really on stand up comedy a lot too. So like, Carlin was like a huge influence to me growing up. My brother and I listened to Carlin like nonstop from the time I was like, you know, 12 or something. Cool. And so I always had that that comedic sort of voice in the back of my head. Right. And so like reading Robert Anton Wilson was like, Oh, wow, this guy is kind of like Nietzsche kind of like leery, kind of like the Buddha, but also kind of like Carlin. And that was like the perfect parent God for me to begin to become obsessed with. So yeah, I get really obsessed with him. And then what happened was they started making a documentary about him called maybe logic. And I was like crowdsourced the like whatever, I don't know what it even was at that point, if it was Kickstarter, or if it's anything like that. But I remember, like helping fund the documentary about him called maybe logic. And then around the same time, they started doing like online classes like Robert Anton Wilson started the what he called the maybe logic Academy. And it was and this is like in 2000, I don't know, maybe 2002 or something like that. 2001. And so it was online, like university taught by, are you serious, Robert Anton Wilson, I think Nick Herbert did one, I think Ivan Stang might have done one. Yeah. So there's all these like counter cultural legends doing them. And so I took like Robert Anton Wilson's course. So we would like talk online and I would be able to ask him, you know, I'm sure all these bonehead questions. Imagine being like a 70 year old talking to an 18 year old. You know what I mean? Just what an idiot I'm sure that I sounded like. But we would like be able to talk and stuff. And, and then during the premiere of the maybe logic thing in Santa Cruz, I went out there and then met him in person there, and get to spend some time with him. And then after that, I began just trying to kind of just help in any way I could just be supportive. And then he was trying to write this book kind of based on his lectures, because he's done so many awesome lectures over the years. So they were going to translate his lectures into sort of a collection, a book collection. And so I was working for him as like a transcriber. So I had all these really, like shitty quality lectures that hadn't been published. And I was like to spend hours and hours, you know, transcribing them sending them the transcripts. And then unfortunately, he died before they put out that book. But I ended up going to his funeral as well. They watched him like dump his ashes into Monterey Bay. And what was the funeral like? It was, it was pretty, it was cool, man. It wasn't like, maybe I don't know what one would expect, but it was pretty like normal. And the aliens to show up. I don't know, man, a submarine to come out of the bay and like turn his ashes back into him and then. Exactly. Yeah, Eris was there giving. Yeah, no, it was, it was pretty cool, man. Like a lot of countercultural, you know, those figures were there hanging around and just some people, his kids were there and I drank like, you know, I don't know, 10 shots of Jameson. I respect. And yeah, it was, it was pretty, it was wild, man. It was just a, it was a good, good moment. But so he was one of your serious teachers, like you, he was one of the big, big teachers in your life. Yes, definitely, definitely, man. And I mean, as I said, like I think that not to be that dude, but one of the things I put in the book was in my book was that wisdom without levity is a tragedy. Wow. And I think, I think that Raw definitely encapsulated that and he did that thing that, you know, I started talking about this recently is that, you know, no one's perfect and Robin and Tom Wilson definitely had his like, his faults, but he was incredibly, incredibly impactful and powerful. But the most valuable thing that I think he contributed to the world and contributed to me in my way of thinking was that you should think for yourself. And he presented his ideas and his work in this cyclical type of way that he swirled around the subjective viewpoint of an objective idea enough to where you had to go, wait a second, I was like, what, what's going on here? What do I think about this? And that was his trick. That's what I say, like that swirling ring that he wore. That's what that always meant to me. It was like that swirl of like, hear all these, you know, impressions or subjective, his reality, what do you call a reality tunnel, these different ways of seeing objective reality. And the swirl is being able to step back and go, Oh, hold on a second. What is my impression of this? And what do I think for myself? And that's, that's this really necessary, crucial lesson to be able to learn how to, you know, something that's important to me is like, how do you author your own future? How do you begin to recognize and increase yourself awareness to relearn, you know, who you are, what you are, who you want to be, and then how you can begin to like, respond to your life and walk into a direction that you want, as opposed to just getting into this momentum of pre-programmed chain reactions, where you end up living 10 years with your head underwater, you know? Well, you know, man, I think one reason it's very easy to do that is because for many of us, our experience of nature, our experience of certainly of cities, our experience of anything outside our homes, and for some people, even inside our homes, is marked by the imposition of boundaries. You go to the ocean and there's lifeguards and quite often there's buoys. You can't swim past those fucking things. A lifeguard gets mad at you. And you know, this situation of having like these invisible lines placed over reality by people who are theoretically trying to keep you safe has produced, for a lot of us, I think a real fear reaction when you're off the map. And man, I love going off the fucking map, but whenever I do make it off the map, so to speak, whoa, it's a little scary because you don't have help now. There isn't that fucking guy you can kind of secretly walk behind to tell you what's happening. There isn't the whistleblowing person. There isn't anything except you in reality. And that's scary. I think these days, that's terrifies the shit out of people who have really invested themselves in the idea that they figured it out. They did it already. They figured it out, man. They know everything. Carl Sagan figured it out. Neil LaGrosse Tyson figured it out. I'm just in a well-tended amusement park. And I'll just hang out here and pretend I'm happy until I fucking kick the bucket. You know, and a lot of times going off the map means breaking the law, doesn't it? It means putting things in your body that are illegal. Sometimes it means trespassing. It literal trust. You've got to go into places where either the government or somebody said, don't go there. Yeah, you got to take weird drugs in weird places. Weird drugs and weird places, man. And then you just, I love the experience of going off the map. And also, I love the experience of the invisible barriers that you're imposing on yourself for maybe no reason. But what would you say those are for you now? Oh, now. That's interesting. I don't know, man. I don't really, I guess I don't think about life in terms of those barriers now. Like, to me, things just feel fluid and open and just continually evolving and moving forward. And in a sense that I think a big way that I stopped feeling like I needed to overcome something was, and doctors hate this, doctors hate it. And I'm going to tell you about this secret. This is going to put you into the enter of my click funnel. Doctors hate this secret, man. Doctors hate this secret. Foot doctors hate this secret. Yeah, that this mom's method. Yeah, foot doctors hate this Tennessee mom's foot secret. They hate this secret. I'm going to share it in just five more minutes after I prime you to go into my funnel. You know, Duncan, you got to go on the buyer's journey. You can't just, I can't just offer you up. I got to qualify the sale first. Then you got to go through the buyer's journey. You got to find yourself along the way. And that is the secret. Damn, that was bullshit. All right. Here's the secret. So like, or for me, this was very useful, was what I call like the acceptance of what is. And that sounds super basic. And it is. And the issue, the reason why I think humans have trouble accepting things that are simple is because they don't get to put their human little fingerprints and get them all humified and complexed up and all that stuff and get their stink all over them, you know. But the most simple thing, like accepting what is to me was so useful because I set without idea literally for like a year of like, I'm going to just, and by accept what is, I don't mean be inactive. I don't mean don't continue to try and like self develop and refine yourself and so on and improve. I mean, to be with what is the circumstances of being alive, the circumstances of what comes to you like of the narrative story of the camera view of your mind intersecting with the self organizing structures of reality and the environment. And instead of trying to make the world like you, like we all do, allow the world to change you somewhat, and then also allow you to change the world at the same time, allow this interlocking dance between the arising of your natural brilliance of like the fullness of what you are coming through from the root of your subconscious passing through your memory and heart, mind, your emotions and your intellect and allowing all that to come through without as much resistance as possible. That's like grasping, right? So grasping is allowing the full dunkiness, the richness coming up from, you know, your intuitive conscious mind. And then whenever it passes through the heart, oh, do you need to change this and some emotional like to make it serve some idea or make it serve some resonance that you feel like it must serve. When it passes through the intellectual mind, does the inner critic kick on? Do you feel like you're a piece of shit all of a sudden for some reason? Do you start hating on yourself? Do you feel like you have to shift what you want to come through? Because that's the only way that you'll be accepted through by the world or whatever it is that comes up in your mind, you know, but really let that thing come through, man, and feel what's coming through honor that thing and allow it to inter-gauge and lock with the world and for it to all connect and be what is and to me the acceptance of letting that come through. And this includes the the fuck ups and the failures and things not going your way. But just being able to like realize that those are more that's growing pains, you got to swing with that stuff, man. And like, for me, some of the biggest teaching moments I've had has been through failures has been through things not going my way. Because then, as I've encountered things that haven't turned out, I've wanted them to, I have then changed my way of thinking. And through that change of thinking ended up at a result way greater than I was even possibly imagining of the thing that didn't go through. It's through that flexibility in that, and this is kind of an Alan Watts idea in some ways, being able to bend with the water and not get all wrapped up in your own story, wrapped up in your ego, wrapped up of your idea of what should be and allowing what is to unfold and then walking through the doors that open before you. Okay, I love it. And I'm not good at that. But what about the thing that happens when you're around somebody who isn't doing that? And you become the part of the universe that they're trying to make like them. And then you enter into relationships and situations with people who, yeah, fuck, you might be all open and shit, you're the river and the water, but I'm going to like build a goddamn dam. I'm going to harvest your energy. You know what I mean? I'm going to build where I'm going to, I'm going to fucking fine. If you want to be all fluid, go ahead. I'm going to fluid your ass into my fucking maze. And I'm going to like, you know what I mean? This happens. I do. And this is one of my fears when I think about this kind of stuff is like, and I don't think I'm alone and thinking, shit, that's a great way to get exploited. That's a, you know, that looseness, that openness, that being said, anytime I overcome the tyrannical motherfucker inside of me that wants to produce in every single moment, some kind of like fascist version of reality where I'm controlling everything and just give it up. And just for a second, let the universe do its thing. Everything gets so much better. And everything becomes so much more interesting. And that's when the synchronicity start and the epiphany start. That's right. That's right, man. That's, you know, when the synchronicity start, that's how you know that the conduits of being that you've actually got amongst the conduits of being, that's what synchronicities are, in my opinion. The conduits of being, what do you mean? Like the fractal web that connects all things, like the fabric of our universe, that shit gets tuned up like a, like a, you know, musical, like a chord on a piano. Yeah. And when the vibrations all get in sync, they create like a beautiful sound. That's like where you hit, you know, a black key and a white key and a piano next to each other, you hear dissonance. If you hit all, you know, white keys, you hear, or the proper, you know, combination of white and black keys, you're a beautiful resonant sound. And that's things being in tune. And that's like the conduits of being all that shit. It's all resonance, man. It works in the same way. And why have you let go and start like, and stop grasping, then you get amongst that tunage. And that's when the synchronicities appear, because you start being like, Oh, cool, I'm walking within the scaffolding that like I need to be like life wants us to, you know, we get in the, I hate the word the flow, because it's so sort of like overused, but you get in that in that groove, man. But I think a very important thing to say is that being open in, in kind of swinging with what is, does not mean allowing yourself to be a doormat or allowing yourself to be, you know, have your energy harvested, as you said, like, that's a big misconception in the earlier stages of people who are trying to be more compassionate. And it's just a lesson that's got to be learned is that compassion is not identity quality. Compassion is an intention. Like you have to draw strong boundaries for yourself. You have to have like this personal sovereignty where, yeah, man, if somebody's trying to suck your energy, like, no, that you're not, you're not someone to steal off of, you know, if I don't get my energy sucked, I won't have any come from my fountains. Great point. Important point. Important point. Then you won't be tits up with knowledge, man. And so you're just saying it's like, yeah, it's not, it's not like you're like becoming some kind of like, yellow-bellied thing rolling over and letting anybody kick you in this. It's like, you still get to have your, your claws if you need them, you still get to like, you know, have a self. I guess what I'm expressing here is just how much I define myself by my defense mechanisms. So tell me a situation. Well, yeah, like love is strength, right? Not complacency. Love is like fierce. Yeah. Calling. Love. I'll tell you a situation that happened today. I was, so like, I've somehow, man, I'm on this like quest to start waking up at five and working out. And I was fucked up. Oh, that's not the end of it? Oh, I thought that was the end of it. Okay, no. What's up, man? What's wrong with me? Yeah, I can't help you with that one, Duncan. I'm sorry, man. It's working. I'm pulling it off and it's cool. And it's like really special. The time between five and seven in any city is magic. And so again, I got up today. This is like, by the way, this is the second time I pulled this off. So sorry if I'm putting out there and doing this like consistently, but two for me is a big deal. That's two in it. That's like two times and like two times of intentionally doing it, not because I had some meeting or some shit. And not because the baby was crying, but two times and maybe a decade of like, okay, I'm going to get up early and I'm going to start exercising. It's been a while. Anyway, I get to the gym. There are juice bars closed. I wanted some caffeine. So I go to the Starbucks right up the street and walk in. There's a guy sitting there five a.m. And I've gotten my head. Listen, man, that thing we were talking about earlier, this is now a place for me to sit on some dumb ledge of judgment. Like I'm up at five. Look at these empty streets. While they sleep, the warrior goes to train. Doctors are going to hate me by the time the sun comes up. I'm going to have all the secrets. No, I'm embarrassing. I've done it twice and I'm already like, you know what I mean? I'm like acting like I'm Goggins or whatever. It's like two fucking times. Anyway, so I get to the Starbucks and there's this guy sitting now. I'm annoyed because the people in the Starbucks don't seem like I was thinking like, I'm no longer going to bed. I just run into like healthy people in the morning. Like that's where the healthy people are. This fucking guy is sitting at Starbucks. He's taking his shoes off, his bare feet are hanging there. Okay, whatever. That's fine. But this guy is coughing like and he's literally sitting right where they serve the drink the fucking lot. Why would they serve the drinks? Like he's sick and he's sitting at the place where the drinks come out and he's sneezing on them. Like he's part of some satanic germ ridden assembly line. And like, I'm like, I can't get sick. I'm too busy. I have baby. I anyway, I didn't, I like sat there and as soon as my drink came out, I snatched it, making sure it wasn't sneezed on and got out of there. But there is an example, man of like, I'm like pissed at the guy. I'm like mad at the fact that people would just not be so unaware that they would do that fucking shit. And also there is a piece of me that almost wants to say something to him. Like German, you see what you're doing? Like, do you understand you're the fucking reason the black plague happened? Yeah. Hey, snot wizard, why don't you go practice your magic somewhere else? It's a snot wizard. It's a morning snot wizard. He's decided to sit and cast spells on everybody's coffee. Blessings, I guess is what he was probably about. So what about that? That's what I'm talking about. It's like, I don't, I cannot be in the flow in those places because my asshole just fucking tightens up and I'm just like, Oh, yeah. Okay, I know what you mean. Right. So that like, I think what you're experiencing in those moments, first off, like, you got to let yourself off the hook because that's just a part of being human, man. Like, you're we're all going to get into the situations where the world seems to be magnetically opposed to our senses, you know, like that happens to me where I'm just like, Oh, man, look at this person, look at this snot wizard over here. Um, but the issue is it's not about not having that feeling because that's I actually think that's a part of our evolutionary, like ancient brain is that because ultimately, this is the most heartening thought ever is that we are a hotel for our DNA. And that we're designed on a on a genetic level to just reproduce essentially, right. And so everything about us is designed to somehow lull ourselves into the illusion that we are at least better than that guy at the snot bar, you know, they were at least better than him. So we deserve to continue on. We have the self belief in the conviction to continue on to reproduce to take resources and so on, right. Yes. And that's why you're sitting in the, you know, the example I've used before is like, you're sitting, I don't want busted. I, you know, isn't worth new examples. So the example I've used before when you're sitting in the traffic or whatever, and someone walks across the crosswalk and you're like, Oh, look at that douchebag. It's like, what? Like, why did I think that? Like that, that guy's probably that guy's someone's son. He's probably super nice. He's probably interesting or whatever. And so like, what is that thought? Well, I think that's an evolutionary ancient brain thing going, Hey, yo, Duncan, you're better than that guy. So you deserve to have a steak tonight because he doesn't need any meat. He should have vegetables, you know, he should be weak and whatever. And so, so anyway, so it's not about having that thought, it's about recognizing that thought and then having, you know, the space, the negative space internally, and being mindful enough to then choose what to do with that thought. So another thing I put in my book is that you were not your thoughts, you were your thoughts, you turn into action. Because we, you know, we have 40,000 thoughts a day. And some of those thoughts are going to be great. Some of those thoughts are going to be, you know, judgmental and critical or whatever of ourselves of others. So as all of those thoughts go through and flow through us constantly all day, as the clouds roll underneath the sun, your consciousness is the sun, you know, shining down. And all these, these thoughts are the clouds. And so as the dark storm winds come by, as the negative thoughts come by, the thoughts of judgments, the thought that makes you want to go like, man, fuck that guy. That's not wizard. What you become, what you build into your future self is what you choose to grab and to express. And so by choose, by recognizing that thought, and you did, you succeeded, you like saw the side, you had an impulse to want to say something to him to get really wrapped up in it and get really pissed off. And you're able to just like, okay, you recognize it and you let it flow on. That is taking one small step into building yourself into the Duncan that has fewer of those thoughts and that suffers from firstly not being identified as a person that ever would express that type of negativity and melt that into actually who you are, being able to let that go into infinity. And the amazing thing about that way of thinking is this is something I realized from my own personal like path of this was I realized that as I like, you know, in my back in my younger years, whenever I was a narcissistic little prick and full of anger and vinegar and what have you, before all the psychedelics and meditation, I realized that like, there was always this tiny little ember in there. It was like this ember of positivity, of love, of like complete infinite compassion that was buried amongst the ash of all this other stuff that had been burned to the ground, you know, all the suffering. And I started just paying attention to that little ember. And I started thinking literally like, if I can just give that ember some air, it's going to catch a little bit more fire and that fire can grow and grow and grow. I need to start indulging that part of what I know is in me, you know, and I started really like focusing on that person, that quarry within me that that element of me. And the more I could just, you know, of course, I was still doing like, you know, saying mean things and being judgmental and just being a first class, you know, cynical asshole, all over the place. But I was still like letting that like, okay, I need to come back to that thing. And the more I did that, the more that that started to take over in over the course of a long time in periods of like, what I call existential paralysis, feeling completely like depersonalized and disembodied and overwhelmed by my head mind, as opposed to like the heart mind, and all that stuff, like just always choosing and like coming back and trusting that space, and allowing that to keep growing, is that it really eventually overwhelmed the dark side, right? And it began to take over. And only later by reading like neuroscience that I realized what was happening on like a physiological level was that given that, you know, the neuroplasticity of our brains rewire, because, you know, for anyone that isn't like hip to that, essentially, we have thoughts because, you know, our this is super rudimentary, but like, the neurons in our brains sig electrical impulses to each other through synapses, which these connective, low roadways. And because our biology is all about optimization, because it takes a lot of energy to be a human critter, you know, like the brain, the electricity that's in the brain can power like a small light bulb or whatever. So it's always trying to make that pathway easier, more simple. I'm sorry, if I could just stop you there. The electricity in my brain actually powers a medium sized light bulb. Oh, I was thinking a fluorescent light bulb. I was I mean, like in a lighthouse. Are you okay? Okay, I was gonna say, are you being humble again, Duncan? You're amazing, man. This is the best. I'm sorry. Neuroplasticity. So I'm sorry. Go ahead. Why the fuck did I do that? I didn't cut you off. Neuroplasticity. You know what I call that, Duncan? I call that being a good boy, once you just did. What's apologizing? No, no, no, no. The like having the thing that's so, so fun in the brain that you have that you got to interject and drop it in. I love that. It's being the good boy. Okay, thank you. You are not as you're the opposite of a snot wizard. Okay, so the neuroplasticity. I'm a cosmic Kleenex. Okay, so I look at those things also, like what you, the chiming in thing, I'm all about it because it's like, I feel like in the same way as like in a gospel situation, like an Episcopal church, whenever people are singing and someone's giving a sermon, then the people in the audience are shouting like, yes, or like there's, you know, what do they say? Fuck yeah, whatever. I don't think they say fuck yeah, but that would be. Oh, they don't. Fuck yeah. You know what I'm talking about? Yeah, man. That's like the, that's the psychic high five, man. So I like those. Okay, cool. Yeah. All right. Anyway, neuroplasticity. So basically habitual thoughts in your brain, your brain rewires to make those roadway connections easier and more direct so that as the, you know, one set of neurons trying to connect to another set, the synapses is a shorter distance. So it takes less of your abundant electricity in your brain, Duncan, to make that connection, right? And so as you can get yourself into habitual thinking patterns, what happens is that the way that your brain thinks by default starts to shift and change over time. You know, I think it takes like 60 days to start that connection. And then that just continues to compound from there. Well, what's interesting about that is that if you use mindfulness, and that's why meditation is so valuable, it doesn't even have to be this big, you know, thing filled with the stink of religiosity. It's just a simple practice of taking the phone off the hook, you know, your brain for five, 10, 20 minutes a day and sitting and breathing. You simply, it's as easy as this. As I say, you do it every night when you sleep, you just have to do it when you're awake, right? As you just breathe in, and then exhale and allow the muscles in your face and body to soften. Breathe in again, try and imagine breathing in something like life, like whatever that means to you. Exhale, allow your face and all your muscles to soften a little bit more, and just make it that simple. Do that for five minutes a day, and you'll begin to feel that negative space, more space between impulse and action. And that's the space you need to be able to begin to author your future and choose how you want to show up in the world and how you want to, do you want to indulge that negative thought, or do you want to try and walk into this image, walk into this idea in this honor of something more peaceful, something more open, something more filled with our relentless curiosity and wonder, as opposed to the gnashing teeth of judgment and anger and fear. And so, as you begin to do that more, your brain starts rewiring in a path to make those thoughts more easy, to make the positive thoughts, to make that what comes up with you naturally, and what's crazy about it, and I just know this from, because I live through it, I forget this out by living it, is that as that begins to shift, when you go to look at, you know, the entire world in your daily life, the, all of the nuances, the impression, the overall harmonic that's created from all of the tones happening in the world become, by default, more positive. You start seeing the world in a different way. You start, the world begins looking more full of wonder in a more peaceful place. You know what, this is a thing that I, when we, hopefully you will be able to do part two of this with me, because I have a theory about this these days, it's fucking crazy, but because, which is that it's not just that the world looks differently, it's literally different. Like maybe you're moving into another realm when you do these practices, and like if your internal neurological structure and the quantum flow of energy in your brain is being changed, then who the fuck knows what's really happening? Are we literally just moving into some other aspect of the multiverse? Is it like, because to me, it's like, man, I know what you're, I know what you're saying. And the times I've been lucky enough to experience this thing you're talking about, where it's like, you get done with this and it's, it's a different universe. This is something John Lilly used to say, you get out of a float tank, you're in a new dimension, man. You've moved through- Yeah, you're a dolphin. You're a dolphin in a, in a, in a speedo, man. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But like, this is, um, to me, like, uh, one, and I, you know, I, I think that talking, talking about this shit could be a little confusing for people who are just interested in meditating and learning a little piece. But my God, man, there's like, to me, I, when Christ says the kingdom of heaven is inside of you, when Chogyam Champa Rinpoche talks about Shambhala, when you hear over and over and over again, and all these religions and all these mythologies about the existence of the fountain of youth, the hidden city, the, like, whatever you want to call it. And here in the modern times, you're like, yeah, that's a really beautiful metaphor. But sometimes, depending on how many edibles, edibles I've consumed, sometimes I think, I don't think that's, I think they mean it. Yeah. Do you ever wonder that, like, do you ever wonder if like, if you, that there would be, hear this shit about ascension, you know, do you ever, or like the goddamn Zog Chin people turn themselves into rainbows? Sure. Do you buy into that stuff, Corey? Well, I don't buy into the Zosha notion of like, that's a nice little, that's got a ring to it, doesn't it? It's only the motion in the Zosha notion that, you know, as far as like, man, he was there meditating, and I looked over and it was just hair and fingernails. You know, I think that that type of thing is a bit of a metaphorical way that we can get an idea or concept in our mind and begin to aim towards that, you know, as a kind of a hypothetical. But as far as like, literalness, yeah, I absolutely think that, like, I, speaking of Chogyum, you know, I raise Wind Horse every morning, you know. Can you tell people what that is so people maybe don't know what that is and it sounds crazy? Sure. When you just say it, if no one's ever heard of it, what do you do? Yeah, man, it's basically just, I mean, okay, so in short, it's bringing in energy, it's consciously during meditation, drawing in source energy. That's the easiest way for me to describe it. Okay. And I look at it as it's a very literal thing. The idea is, you know, raising Wind Horse is drawing in all of like the life force into your body. And, you know, someone can hear that and say, okay, well, how many crystals are you surrounded with, whatever you're doing this, whatever. How much crystal meth are you surrounded by? Yeah, I'm actually perched on top of a mountain of crystal meth. During that, that's the horse that I ride is a white horse. It's actually a city on a crystal meth mountain. Absolutely. They just mine that shit right out of the mountain. Yeah. But think of it in this way, like, I'm very much like, I think that casting the net of the hypothetical and the speculative is crucial towards finding out what's next and exploring your mind in the world. But I also think it's equally important to not spiritual bypass and delude yourself by believing every bit of flotsam and jetsam that you pull back up out of the water, you have to run that shit through your rational kind of scientific materialist filter to say, okay, like what's testable? And I like things that have one hand in the scientific materialism and then a couple of fingers into the spiritual mystic. And I want those things to lock together. And that's the stuff that I tend to be drawn towards. Me too. And it's important because otherwise, let me tell you, if you put the whole fist in that other side, you are going to end up embarrassing yourself, man. Either one, man. Yeah. If you spend all your time fisting science, then you're going to be a cold, boring, reductive motherfucker. And if you spend all your time fisting, you know, mysticism, you're going to be a self-deluded, you're going to keep wondering why things don't work out and why people are against you and why others don't get it in quotes. In definitely in quotes. And you're going to have a manic fucking episode and you're going to make some really dumb tweets and blog posts. And then you're going to get, there's that both roads lead to a really dark place. But like, I know what you're saying, like, and I love, this is what we have now is like the flotsam and jetsam of a, you know, hundreds of different mythologies, hundreds of different philosophies, millions, I don't know, thousands that you could look at. And then also grounding us. We've got this fantastic, like beautiful, deep understanding of cosmology and physics. And they both mirror each other to some degree. Man, why do I, I didn't mean to, you know, some obvious fucking point. I have got to go. It's 1212. I'm running late for a thing. This podcast popped up out of the blue. I should have expected that I would want to talk to you for a thousand hours. But fortunately for my listeners, they can listen to you for, I don't know if it's a thousand hours, but you have a beautiful podcast called the astral hustle. Am I correct about that? You nailed it. And you've got a pay wonderful Patreon. You do you, you actually, I believe are a meditation teacher. You've been helping people. You work directly with people like Robert Anton Wilson used to work with you. Correct. I'll allow you to call me that. I don't know the name for whatever. I have this theory of like, we shouldn't be able to call ourselves artists or teachers, only other people should be able to call us artists and teachers. See, there's the bound. There's one of your boundaries, Mr. No, it gets the stink off of it, man. It's a way to inoculate yourself against arrogance. And look, I'll tell you this. I just, I can't remember who it was. Maybe it was Pima Chodron. Sorry if it's not you, Pima, not you listen. She doesn't listen to my podcast. She's on the edge of her cushion right now. Talk about the height of fucking narcissism talking to like Pima fucking Chodron. This is your podcast. Jesus Christ. What's wrong with me? But, but, uh, but, um, one of these beautiful, brilliant people, I don't think it was there actually said, die a teacher. And like, it was this wonderful permiss and I think Robert Anton Wilson's, I make you a pope and like, now you're a pope and I make you a teacher. Damn it. So there you go. Whether you like it or not. And you, you get to now teach and speaking of teaching. That's a lot of enlightenment coming through right there, my friend. Uh, you, one last thing, just so I can continue to plug all this beautiful stuff you're putting out here. Now is the way is your new book coming out and it is available for pre-sale right now. I don't know when this podcast comes up and just saying that in case it comes out before Tuesday. If you're listening to this after Tuesday, it's there for you. Man, listen, I'm so, this, I love podcasting and God damn it. Thank you for having this conversation with me and thank you for doing it like chaotically. And, and, and I really, this was a wonderful conversation and it has given me a lot to think about. Thank you so much, man. Thank you. I really appreciate it. And, uh, I love podcasting too. And it's always, uh, it's just a real pleasure. And it's, it's, you know, these conversations that they're like, kind of like magic, right? They feel special. You go somewhere with them. And, uh, it's just a beautiful time. So thank you so much, man. I really appreciate it. And also, you know, you said it's chaotic, but no, all chaos is calm. If you're cool, man. Wow, cool. Hey, I'm going to send you a cum bird. I can't wait. I can't wait. I'll talk to you soon. By that, I mean, you mean a dead one that's been preserved and, and, uh, and, uh, uh, like amber fluid or something. So I can keep it forever, right? Yeah, absolutely. That's my, that's, you know, one of, that's 30% of my income comes from my online cum bird business, my amberized cum birds on ed.com.

Sometimes, if you're lucky, you run into super cool people. This happens only if you go to super weird places, usually. And this is how I was lucky enough to meet today's guest, Neil Allen. By the way, I don't mean weird in the pejorative. I mean, weird is in cool. Awesome. Outside the beaten path that you've been going on in some terrible infinite circuit, which I've been going on before I started spending time at these Ramdas retreats. And I've met a lot of awesome people there. I got to meet Neil because I met his wife, Annie Lamott, and did a podcast with her, and he was there, and we talked a little bit, and over time, by some act of grace or good fortune from the universe, I became friends with Annie and Neil, and we started talking more. He wrote a book called Shapes of Truth, which is wonderful. I was very interested in this book, not just because I like Neil, and because the book, the premise of the book is incredibly trippy, but because Neil and my mom both spent time in something called a mystery school, this thing called Diamond Heart. I'm not gonna try to talk about it because I don't really understand it. If you're someone who watched the Midnight Gospel and watched the episode with my mom, then a lot of the things she was telling me come from this Diamond Heart approach, as it's called. And because it was my mom, I intentionally avoided it as much as possible, but after she passed away, I've become more interested in it. And so I spent some time, some non-podcast time with Neil, where he was showing me some facets of this mystery school. And it was some of the most intense mind-expanding hours that I've had in my life. There's this interesting thing that I began to notice when I was hanging out with the Rom-Dos people before COVID and going to the retreats and spending time with them, which is that the people who had been in the direct presence of Neem Karoli Baba, and honestly, many people who hadn't, but who had had some experience of this being's present, they all had a kind of sweetness to them, like an energetic sweetness that was identical. And the more I began to see it in people, the more I realized that what I was looking at was some kind of metaphysical fingerprint or something, I guess it's not really that weird. I mean, if you meet people who all share the same shitty monstrous boss, you might notice that they have a kind of commonality in their negativity, a sort of similar limp to their gait from being abused by some rotten manager or something like that. So if that happens at a Best Buy, then it's probably gonna happen in the reverse in other ways too. It's like these people exist in the world who are, I don't know, they're flowery, they leave a sweetness on people who get to come into contact with them. And it's really trippy talking to Neal, today's guest, because there's something about him that reminds me of my mom. And I think what that thing is, is the shared experience they've had with the Diamond Heart approach and with this mysterious being called Almas. I still don't know a lot about, which, by the way, is something I love about Neal's book, Shapes of Truth. I've never read anything like it before. I've never heard of anything like this. And it's somehow connected to a mystery school, which makes it really enticing for me. But more than that, having worked with Neal a little bit and experienced some of what he writes about in this book, I can verify that it's really powerful. And I hope you will check out his book. You can go to ShapesofTruth.com, find everything you need to know about that book. You definitely should order it. As you're about to see, he's a genius and a wonderful, funny, brilliant person. We're gonna jump right into this episode after this. Much thanks to ExpressVPN for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH. I know none of my listeners watch pornography. It's really interesting. I think at least a few of you do, because I watch it all the time. But just in case you know people that do, you wanna pay attention to this, with everything going on in the world, governments have increased their surveillance. They're using your devices to track your locations, movements, and in many countries, your internet activity. You don't want to be caught with your beautiful pants down. And one of the best ways to keep your online browsing activity private is by using ExpressVPN. When you use ExpressVPN, your internet connection is rerouted through a secure encrypted server so you could surf the web anonymously without anyone looking over your shoulder. Look, I know you probably think that all you have to do is use incognito mode and no one can see that you've watched whatever you're into. But sadly, you're wrong. Even when you use incognito mode, your internet provider like Comcast or AT&T, can see every single website you visit. And if you live on campus or use a shared Wi-Fi, soak in your network admin, it's just too much. You don't want them to know that. I don't need everyone at the holiday end to know I like watching lesbians suck each other's feet. That's why I use ExpressVPN whenever I go online and I recommend all of you do the same. Without ExpressVPN, you're giving people a free license to peek over your shoulder and see all the amazing, freaky shit you're looking at.

[""Welcome To The Blue Blue"") by Neil Allen plays in the background.] Welcome, welcome on you That you are with us Shake hands, go get to be blue Welcome to you It's the darkened castle DTFH Neil, welcome back to the DTFH. I gotta tell you, there's something that we've talked about. We've talked about by now a lot of cool things. One of the reasons we've talked about a lot of cool things is because we already did an episode of the DTFH, which I lost due to a technical error. But of all the things that we've talked about, the one that really I find the most unnerving and kind of mind-blowing is your attitude when it comes to cancellations and like things not happening according to the expected schedule. And I wonder if we could just start off with you talking a little bit about that philosophy and what it is. I guess the way I think about it is things don't go wrong quite the way we think they do. We think that things go wrong because they don't meet our expectations of how things are supposed to go, right? So we think that we're very accurate at predicting the future and when it doesn't happen that way, we blame ourselves or blame other people. The problem with that viewpoint is that in fact, nothing goes wrong, we think things should happen a certain way, the only way things should happen is the way they do happen. Right. And that's called acceptance or letting go or there are a lot of kind of new age ways of doing this magic thing where you can accept fate where it takes you. For most of us, that's kind of a crock of shit. You can't accept things going wrong. They went wrong and I've got to prevent them from going wrong in the future and thinking any other way is gonna get me into a lot of trouble, right? Yes, yes. And I'm not gonna get what I want and people aren't gonna like me and I'm gonna end up homeless and with my body rotting on a sidewalk somewhere, right? Yep. And so everybody thinks that way. The problem with having a viewpoint of acceptance is it only works if instead of it being an intellectual viewpoint, you actually try it out, right? And so you actually have to see what would happen if instead of complaining a lot about things not happening the way they should, I instead went out and pretended that I wasn't much of an actor in the world, that I had very little effect on the world and just pretending this, right? I don't have to, I can just wear this for an hour or a minute or a day or preferably about a week and see what happens if I have no strong expectations about what's gonna happen next. The curious thing is that if I let the world just kind of drag me along and I don't pay much attention to my influence on the world, I get the same amount of stuff done. In fact, the world actually drags me along in exactly the same way that I think that I am influencing my life. It's just that I have this weird app that tells me things are going wrong or things are going right and I think I'm making things go wrong or things go right or whatever, but I'm really just being dragged along. I'm disrupting my background metaphysics essentially and saying, wait a minute, maybe I can live in a metaphysics that doesn't require me to spend so much energy on free will and maybe the world will evolve the exact same way. The Buddhists call this dependent arising, I think, and it's a way of situating myself in the world without a lot of preconceptions. And if I don't have a lot of preconceptions, I can't think things go wrong. And most, yeah, one more thing, which is this is my discovery and I'm taking full credit for it. And if anybody ever mentions it to anybody else, I want them to give me credit for it because I deserve credit of most everything that I say I've stolen, but this one I thought up on my own. You gotta come up with a name up for it then. I mean, we need a name for the philosophy. All right, we'll do it afterward because it's actually not a philosophy. This is a discovery of human behavior that most people have not ever heard of. Nobody's heard of because I discovered it. When I was a kid, my favorite chore was wiping down the woodwork. I loved what, it's just aesthetically pleasing to get all that grime around a doorknob. And all it takes, you really can do it mostly with warm water, you can put 409 on your rag or whatever. And so, but most of it just kind of wipes clear and you all of a sudden have a fresh doorknob. The other day, a few weeks, maybe a few months ago, I was looking at the doorknob and thinking about that. And all of a sudden I realized that all that grime, and Annie and I, we have our own bathroom. Nobody else goes into this bathroom. It was pretty much ever. And so, any grime on that door handle on the inside of that bathroom door is Annie's and mine. And I was thinking about it, where'd that grime come from? You know where it came from? We're not very good as people at getting it right, how to open a door, right? Every bit of that grime was, I missed, and I hit the woodwork with my finger. The efficient way to open a door would be to get my hand around the knob and open it, right? I don't do that. I put my hand, my grimey fingers above it, below it, next. I'm missing it, every thing, you know, not every time, but presumably a high enough percentage of the time that I'm a failure as a door opener, right? Yeah, right. Who would think that I am, that's going wrong multiple times a day and it's just not even registering to me that, no, my predictive abilities, my ability to encounter the world and know what to expect is really much worse than I think. And in many ways, I live with it, right? I live with it by wiping down the woodwork every once in a while. But in other ways, I think, no, this is something I need to control, well, maybe I don't. Why do you think this discovery sounds so black? Blasphemous to people like me. I mean, I've heard, I don't know how many hours of this podcast I have done, and I've heard many controversial viewpoints, but this one, I find somehow to be the most, I've interviewed Satanists, I've interviewed, but I've never heard anything so blasphemous as this, this idea, I'm being a little tongue of cheek here, but this idea is, it really upsets me. Like anytime you've forgiven me for flaking out or for, you know, losing this podcast, which I was excited to release, it was in my calendar when to release it. And I was just assuming I had it, but in my expectation, whenever I contact someone like you, I know I must be busy and say, you know, that hour you generously, that hour plus you gave to me way back when that I told you I had to release it this time, it's gone, it's just the fantasies of how you and Annie would treat me after this. I was, my first time was, well, they'll never talk to me again. So there goes some friends, there's some friends down the tubes, because you fucked up, you're supposed to be a professional podcaster, what? You can't figure out a record audio, like the basic fundamental quality of this. And so my assumption was, well, there, there you go. Another friendship lost to your disorganization. And so to be met with a response, such as what you just said is, I don't know why, but somehow it really burns. Can you explain why? Well, it's hard to, first of all, that was my public response. Our private response was, huh, we thought Duncan was a pod head, but maybe it's heroin. I wish. Oh, I wish. If I was on heroin, you can blame it on the heroin. What do I blame it on? It went this far, which was, let's see, he had cancer, so he probably did to heavy painkillers for a while. Maybe he sucked on morphine. Is that true? That's the conversation you had? Well, that's how we talk. So, yeah, we talk that way about everybody all the time, but we have zero belief that we're accurate. Oh, let me tell you something. I'm so glad you're being honest about that, because that is more the conversation I figured y'all were having, because it's like, well, they definitely, Annie's in recovery, so this kind of stuff is gonna make her think that I just must be on some insane amount of weird drugs, because otherwise, how do you fuck up this bad? But, yeah, you know, no, not even, sadly, I can't even really blame it on the weed. Yeah, so, okay, thank you for being honest about that. And also, thanks for not saying that as your first response, because then maybe I would have just gotten into heroin or something. Well, I mean, the fact is that that response was, and I'll be sincere now, and that response was our having fun, right? Because we expect everything in our lives to screw up. We just do. And Annie's a good friend of a guy named David Roach, and he's, I think he titles himself the priest or pastor of the church of 80%, and his line is you can be 80% all right with just about anything, but make sure that you preserve the right for things to be 20% off. Yeah. And my favorite line of his is that he says, for instance, darling, darling, instead of saying, I love you forever, he says, darling, I promise I love you, I love you till the end of dinner. That's a, sometimes that's a pretty big promise. That is, that's a big promise. Why would we promise more? Why wouldn't we accept the fact that even our most beloved people are gonna be annoying and are going to insult us and irritate us and annoy us. And that's okay, because we're not supposed to be 100% at anything, right? Including everyday life. But I think what's really annoying about it is we wanna have free will. We wanna have control. And we want to believe that we deserve accolades for the hard work of living. And there's no question that life is absurdly difficult, right? As a humorist, you know full well that every single joke you tell is mocking the difficulty of being a human being. The absurd difficulty of life gives us all irony, all sarcasm, all humor. Maybe there's a, I guess there are bits of humor that don't do that little kids joking around don't know how hard life is yet. But most sophisticated humor is, it's just hard. The hard part is we're expected to be productive and we're expected to get things done and we're expected to be rewarded with external value with being liked or getting money or being famous or being powerful, whatever, whatever. And for me to say, I gotta take life as it comes, I'm giving away my right to have control over life. And that's scary as hell. Because I've got a little voice in me that says if I don't keep taking control of life I'm gonna end up homeless and on the sidewalk. Yep, yeah, this is it. That impulse to take control of everything tortures me and especially when it has to do with taking control of like things in the past, which, because it doesn't seem to be able to distinguish the present from the past from the future. It just wants an all encompassing control over all aspects of reality when it's really bad. But anytime that I've allowed myself, the fantasy like you're saying, right now I'm gonna call it fantasy, I'm not sure. But anytime I've allowed myself that fantasy and really pulled it off like a Meisner acting style where I really do it versus like you're saying intellectualize it, the relief is so tremendous, so immense. There's such a sense of peace and then I am able to connect and then I am able to connect with people over dinner or connect with people because I'm not completely broiling over with a sense of like, well, I must have sweared it, I fuck up. Or even, everything was a fuck up. I don't know where I went right here. If you, this is kind of reminds me, is this similar to Ram Dass' idea, or Neem Karoli Baba's idea, everything's perfect? You know the famous story Ram Dass, when will you see? Everything's perfect. Yeah, it is, it is. And I thought you were gonna say, is this similar to them saying, be here now? And they are the same thing, be here now, everything's perfect, let go, allow the world to organize itself on its own. One way of thinking about it is that we're taught that we can't escape from time and we can't escape from space. And so we invent a God who's omniscient and is able to do those things. And we leave out a third thing we can't escape from and that is the world will organize itself without my input. And it will always organize itself. And in fact, the only people it doesn't organize itself for are people with disorganized minds, right? Who have a mental illness or who, for some reason or another, have an organic problem where their minds are disorganized. But for everybody else, most of us, from moment to moment to moment to moment, the world is perfectly organized around us and perfectly supportive of where we are. If the world wasn't supportive of us, we wouldn't be alive still, right? So if you're alive and you're however old you are, which means you're your own age, then the world has been supportive, right? And that doesn't mean that bad things don't happen. That doesn't mean there aren't natural disasters. That doesn't mean people don't die early. That doesn't mean we don't have wars. That doesn't mean that we shouldn't work for justice systems that help people who are in danger. That doesn't mean that we act as if, oh, it's the best of all possible worlds and become a bunch of candies and Pollyanna's running around with little blissful grins on her faces. It's not like that. It's that at the same time that I have free will and an ability to vote and an ability to talk to you right now and an ability to influence people and an ability to beat up my enemy, if that's what I wanna do. I also have going on at the exact same time, a perfect world that is always organizing itself perfectly. And it's weird, but I can hold both thoughts at the same time. So as Westerners were taught to look at free will and determinism or the kind of God world that everything's determined for you, free will and determinism as opposites and they can't co-exist, right? If you're brought up as a child in India, you're more likely to be taught there is free world and at the same time there is determinism. And they coexist and sometimes you're better off being in free world and when you're voting and other times you're better off being in a deterministic world when you're being carried along by the flow. Yeah, I've heard this described as relative and absolute reality. Relative and absolute reality. And there are, people talk about non-dualism and they're, they mean several different things. There's sort of four different metaphysical systems I know of that call themselves non-dualism, but all of them involve some way to merge those two views. So they're always talking about, what in philosophy is called a materialist and an empiricist. That's how I was brought up, right? I think a table is a table and it's got the essence of table in it. There's an ideal table out there, but it's solid and I can put my fist on it and I know what a table is and I'm an empiricist, I go around and I see things out there and I judge the world according to individual things I see out there. That's a very particular way, very particular metaphysics that's grounded in us universally. So all these Eastern systems are doing is, and Western philosophy does this too in a little more tragically subtle and piecemeal way, but the Eastern systems go and say, well, let's disrupt your materialism, your empiricism. Let's give you some other metaphysical views and by doing that, they're not saying, these are better metaphysical views. That's what happens, that's the mistake people find when they go into, oh, I wanna live as a hermit in absorption, right? That's better. No, that's another metaphysical view that you're gonna attach to. The great thing about learning and having your materialist empiricism disrupted is that it lightens it up by knowing that I could be a materialist empiricist or I could be something else metaphysical. I get to not take being a materialist empiricist so seriously. And so my familiar life can go on, but it doesn't take itself quite as seriously because I realize, well, there's other ways I could look at this. And the chief other way to look at it, the one that most of these systems hang onto at some point is, I'm materialist empiricist and I'm being dragged along by an interdependent world that I can't find cause and effect in anywhere that would allow me free will because everything is so interlocked together. And it's a wonderful feeling to be able to notice that all I'm doing with free will is selecting out some fairly trivial variables and working with them while around that surrounding it is this wonderfully independent, dependent arising universe that I have no control over and that has already put me in the exact right spot for me to be in and will take me to the exact right spot tomorrow. This reminds me of Tim Leary's advice that I read a very long time ago and I can't remember what book it was in, which was, lift up your legs and float downstream. That's it. Yeah, and that is actually quite good advice if you've ever been, I bet you, have you ever gone rafting on a river? Oh yeah. Capsized in a river. And the first thing they tell you is don't fucking try to stand up. It's a river, what are you doing? If you try to stand up, you're screwed, your foot's gonna get stuck under a rock. Who knows? You try to float down, cause you can't beat a river a lot of the times. But when you fall out of the boat, that's like the first thing you're gonna wanna do. It's just built in, is to try to stand up, try to control it. I love the philosophy. I love lightening up that part of me. It feels like so subtly revolutionary. Suttly revolutionary.

You know, it feels like what you're talking about, which is a wonderful articulation of a lot of different lineages, how does it work? How does this work in the big picture? And maybe that's a dumb question because we're not supposed to worry about that. We should just worry about ourselves. But I'm thinking, I'm trying to run a business or something. You know, I don't know what it is. Or let's say I'm running a hospital. And I'm thinking, I'm trying to run a business or something. And one of my doctors doesn't show up for an operation. This is not forgivable. I'm not going to be able to be like, well, you know, everything happens. There's a bigger picture here. It's like, you know, someone died because you didn't show up for this job. Or sometimes I'll, you know, God, I don't know why Aaron and I have been doing this, but we just watched Dateline all the time now. Maybe it's the pandemic to like resonate with the horror of the pandemic. Just story after story of murder. And at some point watching this, I realized how amazing it is that these detectives take their job so seriously. Like how lucky in society that there's people who are fully, seemingly, dedicated to enforcing the law and getting justice for people who've been murdered. That they aren't just like, whatever. I mean, are we really going to, like everyone dies eventually. So how do we reckon with the reality? We do need an almost mechanistic way of running society. And that doesn't seem to fit in very well with lifting up your legs and floating downstream. Or not everyone can do that, at least. Yeah, I think that so I vote. I do socially relevant things. I am appropriate in public. I drive a car. I stop at red lights. There are social restraints that are built into my species of human beings. They're not moral. We're taught that they're moral, but what they are, I mean, they're moral if you accept the fact that morality is whatever is convenient for the species to expand and fill new niches. And so that's what we do as human beings. We're probably the second best species at it after bacteria, right? They can go, they can fill it. Niches that we can't even imagine filling underwater and everything up at the top of Everest and stuff. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But we're pretty good at it. And that's what we call morality is protecting the species right, self taught right to expand its numbers. I participate in that. And I have either a responsibility or maybe just a light social engagement that allows me to participate in that as part of my life. I have a huge part of my life that doesn't have to do that. That's called my individuality. When I'm dealing with public health authorities, I should have no individuality. They call it public health because it has to be public and it has to be statistical and it has to be not based on my belief in science but on real science, right? But I have this other part of me that's private and that's individual and that is creative and is interested and fascinated by the world as it is and is apart from the social structures. So this me takes walks in the woods. This me will gathers and this me can do all sorts of things. It can get into a kayak and float down a river, right? And that me is nonproductive unless it wants to be productive and its productivity can be for its own sake and not for a social sake, right? Now, my productive side, which has this control mechanism called a superego, a little voice in my head that keeps me productive and keeps me stuck in the social moralistic side of expanding the species and filling more niches. That side of me doesn't want me to have an individual self. That side of me wants me to be spending all its time focused on the rules and the restraints and being productive in my... What it really wants me to do is be a mid-level manager in a big corporation, have a suburban house, two kids, a dog and two nice cars, right? That's what it wants. That is the American dream for Americans and for immigrants and for refugees and for anybody. It's the exact same. And what's interesting about that is that it is a modest enterprise that has financial, economic, social, political moderation to it that if everybody's aspiring to that, it's a pretty good balance for being able to spread the species and for the species to succeed. There isn't anything all that much better about a brick suburban house than a tin shack, right? If you think about it, they're mostly shelter, right? Most of us get our needs done very simply, but we end up doing this social dance and improving our level of whatever, income or whatever. That doesn't mean that to focus on myself and to notice that I have self-worth built-in that doesn't need to be productive, that doesn't need external validation and doesn't need to be part of the financial system all the time. That self is allowed to run free at times. And the more that that self runs free, the more it can sort of see through the game of the species expanding itself and how it kind of pulls me along into this very conservative world of a socially defined being. That's one way to answer is that I have a social life and I have an individual life and my individual life can involve people or not. My social life always involves people and my social life, I just want to make sure that that productive social life doesn't take up all my time. I want other time elsewhere. The more I do that, the more I find that this other self that is okay with how things are, this individual self, the more I can bring it into my social life and it lightens up my social life. To the point where when I think about the extreme example, here's the extreme example, right? The extreme example is it's World War II and I'm in the bunker and there is Hitler standing and we're eye to eye, right? Yeah. And I'm looking at him. Sounds like you're in the wrong bunker. What are you doing in Hitler's bunker? What's going on? Why are you in that bunker? Keep in mind. Okay, go ahead. I'm sorry. So I'm looking him in the eyes and I'm thinking to myself, he didn't ask to be Hitler, right? He got brought up a certain way that made him Hitler, right? There isn't anything wrong with him being Hitler in that sense that he didn't decide this for him. Lots and lots and lots of influences. He had no control over, brought him to this moment like me, right? I didn't ask to be the guy in the bunker with Hitler. Lots and lots of things brought me there and eventually I can get to empathy with Hitler, right? And I can say, I am capable of being him. He's capable of being me. I am him, right? That's what empathy is. It's ultimately coming to the fact that we're, you know, it's like Kurt Vonnegut. Nice, nice, very nice. So many people in the same device, right? That's it. We're in the same device. That's humans. And we are the same kind of people and we didn't ask for the life that we got, but some of us feel lucky. Some of us feel unlucky. Even that's not quite the way it is. But at any rate, I look him in the eyes. I am you. He is me, full compassion. And the right thing to do is I pull out my 45 and I shoot him between the eyes because he's Hitler, right? Yes. You got to shoot Hitler, but you can do it. You can shoot Hitler compassion. But I know I'm shooting myself too. You know, I know that. Right. That's justice. So there's a time and a place for justice and for voting and for trying to raise people, you know, equalize the opportunities for people and those are very, very important. You know, my wife and I engage with politics, but we also spend a lot of time not engaged with politics. Right. Yeah. Well, you know, this is what it's. I'm curious about how you and Annie have fused together because she anyone who's read any of her books knows that she is a basically some kind of Christian mystic or something. And a lot of what you're saying like Meister Eckhart level, but for them for the modern era, like articulating all the deep metaphysics of Christianity, but in a way that are like we can digest, but in a way you, you, when you leave it, her books, you're, you don't know what to call yourself, except you're just like, oh, I guess I am a Christian and I guess I do love Jesus, but you, you in your book, Shapes of Truth, it seems like this is a different lineage than Christianity. This is Sufism and hearing you talk, it just makes me wonder how do you, how do you two, how does it work metaphysically with you two? Are there places where you're at odds with, with her mystically? And I don't mean to stir up anything by the way. I'm kind of, I feel a little clumsy with that question. Okay. We love this question. Annie and I both love this question because every time we're asked it, we get to think about this remarkable luck we had in finding each other because one of the, one of the underpinnings of our falling in love and our relationship was exactly this question, how to, to people with very strong spiritual bents and kind of sort of belief systems, not just cooperate in, as Annie puts it, not looking for, you know, inviting our Jewish friends to Christmas dinner, right? Right. Like that. It's, it's that her spirituality has zero to do with the, with Christianity with the church, right? Her spirituality has to do with what she learns from having a personal relationship with Jesus. She could care less about what the church says is Christian dogma or what she's supposed to believe, right? But she picks up on certain attitudes that Jesus has about suffering that are remarkable and just bent as shit, right? They are really bent ideas. And the bent ideas are the ones that take you into the radical bent ideas are the ones that take you into further possibilities so that I can expand myself out of this very limited materialist empiricism that I was brought up in. What are the bent ideas? Can you name a few? Yeah, I'm going to get, I'm long winded. I'll get there. Okay, thank you. She's got some bent ideas. I've got my own bent ideas like in this book, right? And they're just kind of, they're people who read them may or may not take to them, but their primary intent is to disrupt you from your typical way of looking at things. It doesn't matter to me how I'm disrupting you. I want to disrupt you. Yes. I want you to think that you can tear yourself away from the little voice that tells you to keep yourself restrained and open yourself up and spend some part of your day in that more open place and that more open place has a name, which is a soul. And whether it's whether you're a Christian or a Buddhist or Vedantic or Vedic or Sufi, you're going to have a word like soul. Right? Yeah. And it's basically who am I before the outside world gets to me? Right? Who am I when I have internal worth and I haven't even done anything yet? Yeah. I'm just a blob. I mean, who would ever say that a one month old baby didn't have value, right? Right. And that one month old baby can't even objectify the world yet. It has no idea that there are things, right? Right. Can't build value. Can't can't engage in transactions even in her mind. She can't, right? Yeah. And yet we know she has value, right? So we all know what a soul is. A soul is right there, right there, that one month infant. That's the soul, right there. You can point to it and you can see the kind of wiggly way of absorbing itself into the world around it that the infant does. The infant's free and in a strange way since it's so dependent, but maybe we're all dependent that way as adults and we forget that, right? And we're wiggling just like babies. So she's got her kind of Jesus world and I've got my whatever I don't have a lineage, but I picked up the things here and there and particularly this guy, Hamid Ali, who has a mystery school in Berkeley called Diamond Heart that your mother was in. Yes. And so I have my lineage that takes me to that soul and he has her lineage that takes her to that soul. That soul looks exactly the same. So where what we noticed was and we're both writers. And so I'll be writing about something that takes me toward the soul and some aspect of the soul and I'll walk in and I'll say, Hey, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm writing about the discriminatory power of the soul and she'll say, What are you talking about? And, and I'll say, Well, you know how you've got a soul kind of and you don't really know what it is. And yet somehow it can kind of parse the world and pick things out and so go, Oh, Oh, you mean this and then she'll start talking about that and I'll take notes or whatever. And it, and it'll kind of amplify where I was at that moment trying to figure something out. So we'll, we'll kind of amplify each other. By the way, we get totally buzzed when this is happening. Right. When you, when you're talking about the soul, the soul goes, Hey, this is cool. Talk about me. Talk about me. And it's like we're tripping all of a sudden, right? And we're talking about the soul. So there's that fun aspect to it. There's also, um, because I'm a random Christian, I get to spend time more time than I would, uh, thinking particularly about Jesus's, um, lessons or parables or whatever, because they're kind of in the air. She's writing about them or I'm hearing her talk to somebody about them or whatever. And so it gets me thinking about them. He's, he is the compassion guy. Right. So he's the forgiveness and compassion guy. Right. Just like, uh, uh, uh, uh, Buddha is the disrupt your metaphysics guy and, um, Krishna Murthy is, uh, don't trust institutions guy and give up your identities guy and all these, uh, Adyashanti is awakened to being awakened. He's that guy, right? Yeah. Well, Jesus is the compassion guy. Compassion guy has a huge amount of force and importance in a, in a, um, uh, uh, an organized, particularly industrialized civilization, any organized civilization, because the problem with civilization is unlike tribal life, you live next door to strangers and that's what Jesus is about. He's about, uh, question whether you should be suspicious of that guy, question whether you should call, separate people into friends and enemies and he's radical about it. And he's an important guy to listen to when he, Jesus is so amazing. He, he comes out of nowhere and one of the first things that he does is he gives a lecture on what he knows, right? Yeah. It's called the Sermon on the Mount and the first line of the Sermon on the Mount is, uh, blessed are the poor and spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Yeah. Um, he comes out of the box and yells to people, Hey, you got it upside down. The losers, the poor and spirit, the people who no longer believe in wealth or fame or anything that they've been taught the complete losers. They're usually poor also besides being poor in spirit. Yeah. I've been walking around the world and those are the coolest people around. He's not saying go feed the poor. He's going, he's going, he's going and saying, why don't you emulate the poor in spirit? Why don't you get right down into the bottom of the dark night of the soul where you have no hope that, or that anything out there is going to help you be better or feel better or help get rid of this little strange feeling of not quite belonging in this world or not quite or feeling depressed or whatever. Go all the way down there become a big loser. And guess what? The kingdom of heaven is yours now because there's a little portal there, right? Sometimes some people, I just heard a great, it might be a trap door at the bottom of the dark night of the soul at the bottom of the well. There's a, you think you're on the floor and there's a trap door and you fall through and there's God, right? Or you go, or it takes you to wormhole. They're different metaphors for how the dark night of the soul works. But Jesus is saying, do that. Well, naturally, no one has ever believed that's what he was saying, right? And no one listened to him and very quickly after the sermon of the mount, he quit telling people what he actually believed them knew and then just talked in parables the rest of the way because it doesn't work. You can't tell. Holy shit. You're saying, oh, wow, that is amazing. That was his first, that was like the beta test for Christianity and he realized, yeah, this isn't gonna, this doesn't work. They don't hear it at all. They don't, you've got to talk to them in stories. And then he, that's when he started saying, let them who have ears to listen here because he realized, shit, this is their, wow, that is so intensely beautiful. I just love the fact that I just love the fact of thinking about him wandering around and just kind of, I just picture him as kind of a guy is just walking down streets. He goes down the rich people streets. He sees how they act behind their walls and their protectiveness and their separateness and their caginess. And then if you walk down, I don't know about you, but I make a point when I'm in a city of walking down into crummy neighborhoods because I've learned that what I was told to be suspicious of I was wrong about. I was told to be suspicious of people coming up to you and talking to you, right? Of course, be suspicious of the drug dealers on the corner. You know, I'm not saying don't be suspicious of the people who are actually up to something, but the people who are coming up to you and talking to you. That's just how you behave in a poor neighborhood. You go up to people and you say, Hey, what's happening? What you doing here? And they're really curious. Here I am. This guy who looks this bourgeois way. They're curious. Why are you here? And so and if you talk to them, the nice thing about talking to people who are poor in spirit is they'll actually answer you truthfully. Yes. How are you doing? They'll go, Yeah, you know, my feet are really hurting today. And yeah, they're not scared of their own suffering or talking about it or me relating to it. And they assume that I'm like them and I'm capable of absorbing their suffering in the sense of, Hey, tell me more. Yeah. And that's in the end, by the way, that's that's the Jesus way of compassion is just tell me more. Tell me more. I'm not here to fix it. I'm not here. It's nice that their food pantry is an important and all of that. And that's one way of feeling compassionate. But true compassion is basically getting in someone's face who's suffering and saying, tell me about it. Oh, yeah, because because we complain, we vent, we talk about our suffering because it's the best way to get rid of it. Oh, yeah. And you know, that is so beautiful. And if I could just add one piece, it's also believing them. There's a culture of not believing people when they say they're suffering or imagine they're putting on a show or something like that, that, you know, they're, or that their suffering isn't justified. And that is that's so brutal to do to people. If you just, and also a lot of people, I think have resentment resentment for people in their lives who they consider to be whiny or whatever weak or all this like Machiavellian like an Machiavellian attitude towards people. But if you if we go back a few minutes to what you were talking about earlier, which is what was the quote? The was it Tom Robbins or not? Oh, Vonnegut. Nice. Nice. Very nice. So many people in the same device that when you start there and realize that, yeah, maybe you're, you know, wherever you're at, can't understand why they're suffering or that doesn't seem like something that would make you suffer. But when you just realize, no, they're really fucking suffering. They're not lying about it. That's real. For me, that's the how I that's the avenue to compassion is to trust when someone says they're not happy. They mean it with the logic behind it. Who cares? They don't feel good. And that's how that's real and then I can listen and then and do what you're what Jesus was, I think advising. What is the kingdom of heaven? Yeah, that's a good question. I think it's ease going with the flow being able to be fascinated by what is right around me. And I think that most of love is the same as most of truth, which is fascination with the other. And I can't imagine that if you use the metaphor of God having created us or created the world and created us, I can't imagine that the God who created us as self-reflective so that it could know itself would want us to be focused on being productive for each other more than would want us to be fascinated in the world that the God had created. Well, what happened though? I mean, you know, I'm not asking you to give me an explanation for why there's evil in the world. But what did happen? I mean, if we're going to do the theistic thing and we're going to go down that that route. We live next door to strangers. It's just we have not learned how to live next door to strangers and it's just it's a it's a kind of weird problem. It as far as I know it hasn't happened to any other species where we had a way of living out of our instincts with a modest amount of self-reflection that didn't have to turn into a whole lot of social restraint when we lived in Stone Age tribes and they're right there are Stone Age tribes that are are still around in New Guinea and the Amazon couple other places and the anthropologists who kind of study them point out that they if you're if you're if you're in a closed tribe where the enemy is a known other tribe the other side of a boundary that only enters in your life on very rare occasions or in a very patterned and defined way and you haven't been in battle with that tribe for years or maybe you have I suppose it wouldn't make much difference when you're around your own people in your tribe you have perfect trust. Yes, you and you live your life in perfect trust right there isn't a hierarchy of property there isn't a hierarchy of jobs there aren't hierarchies there's division of labor no question but everybody's kind of in the same they're equal in the sense that you come up with tribal decisions by consensus that you don't even have votes in these in these kind of tribes and outsider has a hard time understanding how the tribe made a decision to move from here to there even though they had a tribal council the the consensus of people who trust each other is very different from the combative competitive kind of way that we right we we behave there was a point at which the earth got too populated and tribes had to merge and without learning how to treat each other the way that they had treated themselves and while in the tribes and so then you have to have justice systems and you have private property and you have all this kind of crap we have but my main problem is as a civilized human being is that I have lots and lots of very nice neighbors and I know my neighbors and all my neighbors have have have fences my neighbors have fences I'm fucked as soon as my neighbor has a fence I'm fucked right because I am no longer trusting I'm I'm living in a world where my default is distrust not trust and it gets crazy at that point I can't get out of it I you know we we just moved into a neighborhood and our neighbor came walking into our yard to say hello and I gotta tell you that that the part of me that is not the kingdom of heaven the reaction internally I had was so embarrassing and ape like as I'm thinking like what you just you can't just walk in my yard man you don't know me why you walking into my yard and I it's an embarrassment because I you know I don't want to be like that but then also I don't know him who is he I don't know this guy's history or story or you know who knows what are his intentions I mean don't you think there is something to be said for boundary is them and fences and you know because we got these loons out there we got loons the problem with taking that view and I take that view like anybody would is that we've taken it so far that we've trained our guardians our police forces to actually spend their time in a in an exercise of looking for suspicious looking people right it turns out that's that's a bad exercise yes you train what would be important would be for us to learn how not to look at people as suspicious right because of course they're going to be the bad actors but they're fairly anomalous so that if you go into a bad neighborhood or go into a store or anywhere if you go in without looking for suspicious people without picking people out you're probably pretty safe you're probably we do have a decent civilization and a decent set of rules that behaves kind of like we can trust each other and has replacements for natural trust and we could actually live through them but we haven't figured out that we can and we can today and that we have to for instance I mean I you know Black Lives Matter is so important but it's so focused on deaths and not on wait a minute our cops are trained to look for suspicious people let's get them to quit doing that we'll lose a modest amount of control over crime but what we will gain will far surpass that and will remove crime in the long run but anyway I have a neighbor moved in a little after we moved in here and my neighbor decided that he didn't like the redwood tree that I had planted because in 60 years it'll block his view and so oh my God how old is he yeah well I tried to work with him on that and I think we worked it out and then he got furious when we had these power outages and because I'm from the East Coast I went and bought a generator that's what you in the East because you have blizzards and you have generators and everybody boy when there's a blizzard it is a racket you know walking down the street because everybody's got their generate well I was I happen to be the first person on the block to get the generator when PG&E started their blackouts and so he didn't like the sound of the generator and the decibels were too loud and and so he became to me the bad neighbor right right and then one day I just started laughing at realizing to him I'm the bad neighbor and he has no idea that to me he's the bad neighbor right that's how distrust is so silly I mean any normal you know if we were smart about it we would actually instead of sending tax and God he got at me through next door at one point and you know he went next door you know he kind of did and then I came in and it the whole thing is kind of funny but if we were truly tribal and we're living next door to strangers none of that is possible right none of that you're all you know there's such communal purpose when your only needs are true needs food shelter and the funny thing is so we gossip complaining about our social lives right that that's 80% of what we do is gossip as human beings right yeah tribal people gossip too you know what they gossip about falling out of trees getting eaten by large mammals they got a drought yeah roots that you eat during the time of drought that are slightly toxic but it will keep you alive right yeah so they gossip about their actual needs in the world to stay alive we gossip about all this crap because we've got our actual needs largely taken care of massive amounts of food around the world through our transportation system so drought for most of us isn't a possibility or a probability yeah we have shelter and we have clothes and that's it so most people think they have a bunch of needs you have three needs food shelter clothes and by the way you don't need them in the long run you need them in the short run right so living week to week that's fine you've got if you're living paycheck to paycheck you've got food shelter and clothing yeah dealt with for the week right that's fine yes we think there's something wrong with both our belief that that's enough and our belief that there aren't other needs and so we build up all these other needs and complain when they are difficult to maintain so I don't know about you but I'd say at least half my life is maintenance of the stuff beyond food shelter and clothing that I have collected around me right and I and I think that I'm getting enjoyment out of them when what I'm primarily doing is maintaining them it's funny no you know here's an ironic thing one of the most challenging events in my marriage right now is trying to get a fucking fence built around our yard so that we can keep the dogs in and getting a fence right now is is really like I'm not going to go into it by now my listeners are like I don't know how many lists I've lost complaining about fencing but this is like a it's really hard during the pandemic to do this but yes and and I you know I'm one of my dear friends is having a rough go right now and part of what's bugging him is is that he feels guilty about not being some profoundly tremendous success not have you know the what you just said about the week to week thing I think for a lot of people is really going to make them feel a little better because so many people beat themselves up for being in that situation but in and not realizing that that that that's actually that is you can call that success you're eating you're sheltered you have clothes I mean you think about it until what a hundred years ago a hundred fifty two years ago 99% of the world lived paycheck to paycheck the equivalent right nobody saved money right it wasn't an expectation there were there was some rich people and there was some politically powerful people but most people just kind of live their lives now were they animals no they were self-reflective human beings with brains and interests and they had a huge amount of leisure time right and they used it right and we think everybody was a Puritan and spent 14 hours a day at work that's absolutely not true right sharecropping farmers and in them in the Middle Ages worked several hours a day and lived in shacks and and and drank and hung out and talked and watched the sunrise and sunset and presumably went holy cow do you see that isn't that beautiful right yeah and they didn't have fame and they didn't have money and I'm not glorifying so people are going to get on my ass and tell me that I'm somehow glorifying the poor and they have real you know there was poor public health and people only lived half as long as they do today and all of that kind of stuff and all of that is also true right now I don't get that from you I feel like what's that what's coming out of you is more in along the lines of give yourself a break you're you're spending your entire life torturing yourself tormenting yourself over these things that are so far away from authentic happiness that's what I get from you and not just these conversations but our private chats too and it's such a liberating it's such a liberating way of looking at the world and it's a great reminder for me because I I always get lost in the things that are so far away from just that and you know the scary about that is that if you're not careful you're just you'll just be dead you know you blink and you're dying and you realize that the whole time you're doing some stupid compulsive masochistic internalized capitalism dance your family was at home your loved ones were wondering where you were and then eventually forgetting about you and that's pretty sad I mean the weird part it is sad I guess although I have another take on that which is particularly if you have the good luck of getting a immortal a fatal diagnosis you know told you're going to die in a year year and a half rather than a sudden death unexpected but if it's not sudden and you have some warning about it my experiences most people virtually everybody wait did you say good luck I'm sorry did you say good luck so this is a great story actually Ram Dass wrote this for yoga journal many years ago he gets he got a phone call from Timothy Leary and Timothy Leary says to Ram Dass Ram Dass I have great news for you and Ram Dass says what and he says Timothy Leary says I'm going to die in a year and a half and Ram Dass says how is that great news you're my friend you're my best friend how's it great news that you're going to die and Timothy Leary says I know I'm going to die that's what's a great news I get to prepare for it wow if you if you get a diagnosis that you have a disease that is in incurable and you have a certain amount of time to live the general most people who go through that experience who I've seen very quickly adjust their thinking and very quickly let go of a huge number of unimportant things and very quickly bring their life together and the interesting thing about the divine or consciousness with the big C or unifying with God or non duality or any of these sorts of things is there's not much difference between spending five years in freedom and spending twenty minutes in freedom if you've spent twenty minutes in freedom and that's what dying people often do is they get their twenty minutes of freedom it's plenty it's plenty just knowing it just having met it it's plenty and if you get more than that it just becomes familiar and it's plenty too Neil thank you so much for this conversation thank you for your friendship I hope that you and Annie and your next gossip session about me will forgive me I don't do I've never done heroin I don't believe you know I want you to bring us some if anyone do it but I turned it down when I was a teenage I turned it down when I was a teenager it's one of the few regrets of my life no I feel the same way about heroin I feel about golf I'm not doing it I feel like I was like you know Iggy Stooge is a big golfer that is he really that shook my world I was like twenty five when I when I found out that Iggy golf and I was like how's that possible he's Iggy does he do what does he wear does he wear the outfit does he put on the khakis and the stupid Neil thank you so much shapes of

Connor Habib, subscribe to his podcast, sign up for his Patreon, and strap in my sweet loves and welcome to the Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour Podcast, the wondrous Connor Habib. Oops. Hey, real quick. I just realized this. I don't know. Maybe I'm being ridiculous here, but I think I said rigpa a bunch in this episode. One of the things I'm pretty good at doing is hearing a word and imagining I know what it means when really I don't know what it means at all. So rigpa, it means basically in the most literal translation of it, it means intelligence or brightness. It says here that if you say somebody has a rigpa, it means he is a clever, sharp fellow. The sharpness of rigpa is a kind of side function that develops from the basic mind. It is a kind of lawyer's mentality that everybody develops. It looks at the problem in every possible way, inside out and outside in. So today's guest, Connor Habib, he is a fountain of rigpa. And everybody, welcome to the DTFH, Connor Habib. Connor, welcome back to the DTFH. How wonderful to see you. It's nice to see you too. Man, I was interviewing or I'm going to start God. It's okay. I keep coughing so it's perfect. Connor, welcome back to the DTFH. I was doing what I should have done every other time I've had you on the podcast, which is research. So I'm doing actual research. Thank you. Finally, it happened. And then realizing like, oh man, you are, Duncan, you've got to be the worst interviewer on planet earth. Here is this evolutionary biologist who's been in your midst over and over again, and many other things. I realized like there's so many things that I don't understand that I'm good at acting like I understand. And so I thought, all right, great. Here we go. Why don't we start with Connor? Let's start at the basic, basic, right? So I want to talk about the understanding, but not understanding thing, but we can get back to that. I think that is the basic, basic maybe. Let's start there. Yeah. So I want to say something I've been like thinking through a lot lately is that I don't, there are plenty of things I don't know, obviously. And when I talk to very deeply spiritual people who have had more sort of intense, crazy spiritual experiences than me, I will, you know, have that longing. I'll be like, why didn't I see that spiritual being, you know, standing at the foot of my bed beaming rays of light into my head and then I understand Russian the next day. Wow. And someone did tell me that. But I was like, you know, I don't, that kind of stuff doesn't happen for me often. I certainly have a trouble willing that into being, but what I do have through all the stuff I've done in my life is a coherent worldview. And that is something that even if people have had really high spiritual experiences, they struggle for spiritual experience in a different way. And I think you're always working towards that as well. It's sort of like, okay, maybe you don't know everything. You don't experience everything that the people you talk to experience, but you strive to form some sort of like, like a way that these pieces fit together and you are good at that. And that's what I try to do as well. Cool. Yeah. Thank you. Okay. Cool. Thanks. Well, the, here's, here's the question. What is DNA? Well, I mean, that is a really big fucking question, right? It's something that I'm not, let me actually, yeah. So it's so funny that you asked that because one of the reasons why I studied science in grad school. So I went to grad school for creative writing and also organismic and evolutionary biology. And I studied with a woman named Lynn Margolies, who's married to Carl Sagan, who, you know, discovered that, or proved that our, that nucleated cells are symbiosis of different kinds of bacteria. She came up with this thing called Gaia theory with James Lovelock. Hold on. That cells are, that cells with nuclei are symbiosis of other kinds of bacteria, right? So like, if you have a cell that has organelles in it, so like mitochondria, for example, or chloroplasts implant cells, those are there because two organisms formed a symbiotic merger. So she really went a long way to proving that. Wow. There are people that had talked about it before, but she put in a lot to popularize and eventually lead to the evidence that showed that that's true. That thing, I didn't know she was associated with that. Oh yeah. That is one of the most hopeful things in life to me. I knew that, I knew about that. I didn't know that came from her, but to me that's always been the kind of like, I don't know, smiley face inscribed into nature, which is this can work. Yeah. And it happens through initial like conflict or consumption, right? So like one organism is trying to like swallow the other one, you know, again and again until eventually the resistance is so strong that they live in harmony with each other, you know, and you can't actually take them apart from one another anymore. So she did that. She also came up with a whole new theory of evolution that's based on symbiosis saying like when a new species emerges, it's because there's been a symbiotic merger between one species and another. Usually one species is big and one is really small. So like we don't think of cows as symbiotic beings, but they can't live without all the symbiants in their gut, you know, they just can't live without it. You take those out and the cow dies. So I went to school and I studied with her. One of the reasons why I was really interested in studying science is because people were having these conversations about science all around me and they were like, well, DNA proves this, DNA proves that. This is like we know this because of our genes and I was like, do you know what DNA is? Do you know how it's extracted? Do you know what it looks like? You know, and everybody who said no, and I realized I didn't know either, but I recognize that I wasn't accepting the answers because I didn't know, but a lot of people were accepting the answers and they didn't know. So I studied it. A lot of it I don't remember because I didn't do lab work. I did mostly like natural history. I studied the scientists themselves. I studied like the way they talked about things rather than anything else. So you know, I'm not a scientist, but I know more about science than most people. DNA is still to me a little bit of a mystery. Like you can look up the dictionary definition of DNA and you can, you know, everybody knows the double helix thing or whatever, but how exactly does that work? How do genes work? How do genomes work? I mean, it's just very confusing. And to me, in some ways, it's almost like a minutia conspiracy theory way of thinking about things. It's like, for me, because it was organismic and evolutionary biology, what can I learn from looking at an organism without going into the genes? Like what can I look at, learn from it by looking at its shape? What can I learn from looking at the way it behaves and interacts with things in the wild and lives its whole life cycle? And that could be a plant as well. Like if you take a plant and you take a snapshot of it, it has one form, right? You can see its leaves and you can see one. If you follow that plant over its entire growth cycle, like it just completely transforms the shape of the leaves and change that they turn on the stem, the flower opens up. So over the course of something's life, you get something very different than you get if you take a snapshot of it in time, which is how we tend to do science, right? For its environment, so if you take a dandelion and the dandelion is in the shade and you look at its leaves and then you look at the leaves of a dandelion that's been in the sun, they look completely different size-wise. I mean, it's just like, looks like almost like a different organism. So that was the kind of stuff that was interesting to me. So you asked me what DNA is, well, look it up on Wikipedia. What's more interesting to me is, and we can do that now, right? What's interesting to me is, well, what does DNA mean for us as people? What does it mean in our culture that this is the conversation we have about organisms instead of, well, what can we actually see? What do we not need microscopes for in a lot of cases? You know? Well, yeah, man. That's beautiful. And I think that that's something that obviously can be, you can extrapolate from that a kind of philosophy of compassion from that, which is sometimes you run into people who maybe haven't been in the sun, so to speak, enough, if the sun's the truth, you know? So you see some people who are behaving in a way that seems brutish, ridiculous, sad, pathetic, maybe even if you wanted to be a judgmental person, you know? All of those are judgments. But you know, you know what I'm talking about? You will run into a being that it seems to be in some kind of dissipated state. There is a lot of anger, paranoia, fear, worry, a sense of lack and a definite feeling that at any moment they're about to go smashing into some kind of even worse state, right? Now you run into that and you can think what a lot of us do think when they steal your radio. That's an asshole! But if you were to look at it like a dandelion, right? You could maybe say, oh, that's something that hasn't been in the sun long enough. That's something that needs more sun, so to speak, in this case not the literal sun, right? But some connection with the thing that a lot of the energy that we metaphysically use day to day derives from. The inner sun. Yeah. Yeah. The inner sun. Yeah. I mean, I think that the lesson for me is that, yes, that's the appearance of the person and that's important. That personality is important. But we're all equal in spirit. So I can still have conflict with your personality and I can still resist your personality because I think it's doing bad things to other people's personalities. But in spirit, you know, there's an equality there for sure. That's it. Well, I mean, you have to. The thing is, like, if you can't run into this, whoever this be, you can't run into somebody who's like walking down the street swinging at people. Oh, right. They're like a dandelion that has the kind of sun, like it breaks jaws down the street. You have to restrain that person. There has to be there. It's David Nickton, who I studied meditation with, studied under Chogym Trumpe Rinpoche, and he says there's compassion and then there's idiot compassion. Right. So, but both there's compassion within both of those, which is great. It's just idiot compassion is, is where you like see a mouse in your house or you see a roach in your house. And then you like think, well, I hope it's getting enough food. Right. Right. Yeah. Right. And then you like wake up and it's like drinking the liquid from your baby's tears, like eye ducts, you know, in the middle of the night. Yeah. Yeah. Which we, you can't have that. No. Yeah. So that. So how to achieve sympathy. This is a question I have for you and it's not there. I don't know what even how anyone could answer this. I've brought it up before, but maybe you have a take on it. How does radical inclusivity work when you're friends with pyromaniacs? Well, yeah, I mean, there are a lot of different ways to answer that question. So well, but why are you friends with pyromaniacs? I'm just was trying to come up with an extreme example. Yeah, no, but I, but that's part of my question for the example. Why is the, the, the, as Margolis was talking about this sort of like initial sort of conflict. Right. Yeah. Like why? I don't know. Maybe the pyromaniacs like trick to you and maybe the pyromaniacs want you to be a pyromaniac and they're like, you know, maybe they're like, there's some sense that burning things down is like the only hope or who I don't know. I mean, it's a ridiculous. Yeah. No, but I get, I get, I get, you know, yeah, I just wanted to make sure. So, you know, I mean, part of what she would say very often was, okay, so if you look at people playing basketball, it looks like they're competing, but if you stand back, you see that they all had to decide to come to play together, right? You know, and so you have a process of, you know, I described it, um, I wrote an essay about her when she died in 2011 as lean forward, stand back. It's like, I can look at the conflict or I can stand back and look at the symbiotic aspect. I can move forward and I can come back, which is a really great metaphor or, or a phrasing for what she did, which was looking microscopes of bacteria and then stand back and look at the entire, you know, Gaian system of the earth and how the earth regulates itself. You know, so she did that all the time, but that's something that we have to do constantly. That's like a breathing. So I can't tell you how you would do it with this or that particular person in your life, but there's a gesture and inner gesture of looking very close and then pulling back and looking at the big picture and looking very close and then pulling back and looking at the big picture until that movement, it's almost like if you do that enough, it creates a sound or a tone. And then when you hit that tone, you try to stay in that column of frequency for as long as you can. Cool. Yeah. That word that I've heard and I've been using lately is rigpa. You ever heard this? No. So it's like a word for, sorry, Tibetans out there, if I'm fucking this one out. It's a word for steadiness of, so, you know, like you were talking about your friend, some being appears in front of them, glowing being teaches them Russian. That's a great moment or like, I don't know, downloads Russian into their mind or activates the part of their mind that already spoke Russian or whatever. That's a cool moment. That's a peak moment, but they still are going to end up at the grocery store. They're still going to end up in line when they don't want to be in line and there is not going to be a being floating above them. And so that moment of probably when they saw the being where they were like, oh, wow. That's the, maybe what Margolis, when she's talking about this Margolis, when she's talking, when she's talking about the tone, wonder, oh, wow. That's a good way to be, but that way, where is that when you're in the grocery store? So to speak. I would be maintaining that sense of like, oh, wow, wow, this is, whoa, this is wonderful. It's really love. Yeah. Well, and it's the entire way that I try when I try to teach occult stuff to people. That's how I describe the occult in general is like, look, people want to get all, you know, well, I want like a wand and I want a room with like a pentagram on the floor and all that kind of stuff. That's all great. I can all assist you. But why don't you just start with the fact that you can't see your own face. That'll fuck you up for a really long time. Like just meditate on that. Okay. Because our experience is fucking bizarre, right? And so when I, when I tell people like, I say the occult is radical phenomenology. So if you actually just pay attention to your experience, the world becomes something completely different. And when you, and when that happens, if you can let all your politics and views of the world sort of stem out of that, instead of the dumb place of accepting all sorts of, you know, like presumed, presumed things, then something really crazy happens. So I've been trying to say in my own life, like if the bean appears and beams light into my head and I know Russian, though that hasn't happened, I have had some weird things happen to not say it's weird or intense or even be surprised by it anymore, just to be like, well, this is something, but is this something more than the grocery store when I'm in line? You know, that's also completely weird. I mean, look right now, Duncan, if you and I look around this room with all the stalactites and stalagmites and evil beings in this cave that you record in, don't mention the dead bodies, please. They're all impaled. If you just look around and the people at home can do this too, like look around the people at home. I don't know why I'm assuming they're just like sitting in front of their fireplace is like cozy enough and listening to us under an Afghan. But no, the people at home, if you look, you'll see in your site that you're not actually perceiving depth with your site. There's a color against the color against the color against the color you're seeing in two dimensions, right? So like go to the grocery store and do that. I don't fuck you up. Like move into that space where you're like, what actually am I seeing or pick something up? What actually am I feeling here? You know, start doing those experiments with your senses and you'll realize that like the angels pretty extraordinary. The being that teaches you Russian is pretty extraordinary, but so is everything. Yeah. Yeah. That. Yes. Because the other way is great though. You just end up if you're always chasing an angel that's going to teach you Russian, and you miss a lot of angels in that. Right. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. That is a, I think maybe why so many people end up being fixated on this thing or that thing because what you just described, they're just those few little steps of popping out of your normal sense of like, I know how things are to the way things actually are, which is that yeah, you don't, you're never going to see your own face. Right. And if you do. God help you. You're in a horror movie. Well, there is a way you can see your own face. And that is to recognize that you are in everything else. Okay. Yeah. So, you know, Rudolf Steiner, who will probably talk about more on this episode, I've talked about it every single time I've been on the show with you. Yes. You know, he says something like when you get around 40, 40 to 43, something like that, you begin to be able to see yourself the other, the way others see you. It's this developmental thing. And maybe the age has shifted a little bit because people live a little longer now. But the fact that you can see yourself the way others see you is a way of seeing your own face in a way. It's a way of experiencing your own countenance, you know, you can't actually see your own face and you can never see your own face, which is a real mind fuck if you think about it. As much as you think you know what your face looks like, that's a two-dimensional ecology of light and a flat surface and a mirror or a pond or wherever the hell you're looking. You will never, ever be able to see it. I mean, it's bonkers. In NDE's though, like you do hear this is one of the things that people with the near death experience to say that they actually do see. They see their own bodies. An astral projection. Yeah. Yeah. Seeing their own faces that they don't look the way they thought they looked in the mirror. So they see themselves and they're like, whoa, I didn't know I looked like that. So there is supposedly a way to do that. Well let's back up though. You're not seeing it because you don't have eyes. So when you are having an NDE or you have an astral projection moment, you're not seeing with the same thing that you see with when you see with your eyes. What are you seeing with? I don't know. It's the same thing in a dream when you're like, oh, I saw a cat and I pet the cat in its fur felt this way. No, you didn't fucking see a cat and your fur didn't feel any way. Your eyes were closed and your body was lying in bed. It's an inner experience or a different kind of experience than the sensory experience. Or there's some, you know, ottoman watcher thing that isn't dependent on biology to see. This is why I brought the DNA thing up because I had this crazy dream and in the dream, it was just weird. Do you ever have those dreams where like you're somebody's lecturing you in a good way or like you're listening to like a radio station? Of course. It's really cool. So in this dream, I'm getting this wonderful lecture on, it's like some kind of like lecture on impermanent, no, on emptiness. The lecture was on emptiness and then within the lecture, it was saying like, it was pointing out the Francis Crick, Francis Crick, I think it was Crick said that the DNA doesn't make much sense based on how old the planet is. It seems like it would have taken longer for DNA to evolve than the age of the planet. And so in the dream, this was being brought up and in the dream, it or they or whatever it was was saying, Oh, well, the reason that is, is because DNA is the bridge and that is being used by this emptiness to have form. So the emptiness is the emptiness came first and then the DNA came sort of like as a result of the emptiness, the emptiness flows through the DNA. It was a great lecture. I don't know if it's like scientifically valid. That's why I wanted to ask you about DNA, but that's why you wanted to ask me about DNA to ask if it was the rainbow bridge from Asgard to Midgard. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Did they, did people say that that's what DNA is, is the bridge? No, I'm just picking it up now. Did we just start first verse in the scripture of our new religion? Yes, my Lord Thor. We did. Yeah. Well, this, this, uh, so the idea was like, Oh yeah, DNA took like the, this stuff got them. They're the scientists who listen. I'm so sorry. This is just, probably they already pressed pot. They were just like, all right, I'm out of here. Hey, I mean, Watson and Crick did LSD, right? And that was how they came up with some of the speculative. Yeah. The idea is like they, I've, I've investigated this. Oh, you did. Absolutely. Like anyone who loves LSD is like, Holy shit, maybe I'll figure something out. But, uh, yeah, I looked it up and the idea is that if they did encounter LSD, which they most, one of them certainly must have, it was after they, and also I think they kind of stole the DNA idea from a woman. Yeah. Yeah. So it's like, which I love that I don't remember her name. Was it Rosamund? Something? Yeah. Anyway, I was telling, you know, this is a real me slapping myself in my dumb face, but this was like, I was telling you, this is boy. I was like mansplaining to my wife that DNA had been stolen from a woman and at the same thing happened. Like, I can't remember her name. Oh, yeah. Stop talking about it then. But the idea is that this, these eyes that we have and these hands that we have and this body that we have and all of nature and all of the beauty of it all is like pouring into time via this, this, this bridge and the bridge at the basic fundamental level as DNA and whatever like quantum stuff makes up DNA and through the DNA is this replicating biological form that emerges into the emptiness. And you have to have the emptiness for the, for the form to work. If there was no emptiness, there would just be stuff, a big never ending cube of matter, so to speak. You know, we need the paper to draw on, right? So that, I don't know. That's it. It was like a, and then I was reading in this wonderful book, Rainbow Painting by Tolku Irgin, Irgin Rinpoche. He was saying that there are something like six moments in every moment that make you what you are. So in every single like millisecond, you're going through these six repetitive cycle that is in the way that your DNA is building you out infinitely as long as you're alive. There's another little like sort of psychological DNA that is like repeating itself and that's creating your identity. It's just six little moments that you're repeating over a five. I don't remember. I have to go look it up. There's a certain number of moments and you just keep repeating them over and over and over again. And that's producing the pattern of your existence. Have you ever heard this before? A little bit. I mean, something that's really interesting is like, to bring it back to Lynn, her son with Carl Sagan, Dorian Sagan. So Dorian, he wrote a book with a guy named Eric Schneider called Into the Cool, which is about thermodynamics and says that, you know, like there's this big question of why life, you know, why life doesn't follow the same entropic principles as everything else? Like, you know, the second law of thermodynamics, why doesn't it just run down, you know? Right. And their whole thing is that life and complex organisms are actually gradients. In other words, like a tornado is a gradient of like two different systems coming together and resolving itself so that human beings and other forms of life are gradients resolving certain forces. Right? And so this is what you remind me of when you talk, it's like that there's these forces coming together and they sort of wind themselves around and that's a DNA, you know, shape that they wind themselves around continuously until the gradient is resolved and then it kind of falls out. Now Dorian, Dorian's friend of mine, so I'm just able to speak about him sort of freely critically, even though he's a brilliant person, but that at that time, especially he was very atheistic, you know, humanistic. And so he would not have at that time at least have allowed that there was any spiritual principle. For me, those forces are, you know, I mean, right now there are angelic forces and other beings constantly working to make your organs work and to make your being work. They're always doing this, you know? And I think even as I say that, you might feel something as I say that, I don't know if you do or not. Sure. Maybe it's just like a little excited feeling or whatever, that it's a feeling of recognition as far as I'm concerned of these, you know, people that are these beings that are doing the upkeep of your body. And there are other forces as well that are purely, you know, we will call them purely physical, but then there are spiritual beings behind those forces too. So yes, I think that they wind themselves, which is why you see that, you know, the double helix as a spiritual, you know, symbol in so many different cultures and in the past and all that as well. There's a great book about that called The Cosmic Serpent by Jeremy Narvey, an anthropologist, which he ultimately again comes to materialistic conclusions, which I disagree with. But the journey through that book is good. Oh, right. Well, it's just, I think, you know, in the same way in the beginning when I asked you about DNA, you're like, well, let's look at the form and the DNA is cool, but let's look at the form for now. Sometimes I think people like your friend Dorian, maybe they're kind of like, well, maybe the angels, but let's look at the this, I'm interested in this form right now. And then maybe they do draw a conclusion from the form that negates the angels, which is a, I think a mistake, but I get it. It's like, I want to work with the stuff that I can like measure and weigh and quantify. And that's kind of where some people, their mind goes there. Like I, there's a bike shop down the street, wonderful bike shop on the LA River called Spoke. And there's a guy who is some kind of genius who works on bikes there named Dane. This guy is some kind of genius, right? But the way his mind works is very mechanical. He's like, he's, he's a bike technician and like, he can look at a bike in a form and be like, Oh, this and this way. It's like really cool. It's like, he's like a, if there were, like, I don't know, he just reminds me of some kind of entered someone who should, if I was a spaceship captain, I would probably kidnap him. But anyway, what I mean is I get Dorian Sagan's POV because it's like, okay, this is my mind is looking at things that I can see and measure and quantify in your mind and my mind. We hear angels are behind the DNA or in the DNA or the way I heard Ram Dass say it, which I really like is like within the heart, there is a doorway. There's a doorway between soul land, as he calls it, or the place of the soul. And this place that we're in right now and standing in the doorway is a name Crowley Baba or the Buddha or Jesus or whoever you is your particular angel or the father or mother of angels or that from which angels emerges from a personified love intelligence that is the formation is the, is when you, God, I'm saying a personified love intelligence of following it by the dumbest thing ever. You know, the Play-Doh stars, the fun factory, right. That's it. And that Play-Doh's big, the thing that went through which like all of this is being like pushed, so to speak, or forming that pattern. That is the guru, the angelic figure, whatever, the personification of love. And then that comes out. And then as that's coming out, it starts running into all of your stuff, the karma, you know, it starts running into your mind moments and your DNA. And now it starts taking on this other beautiful form, which is you. And it is beautiful. Even though you might, you know, have this thing or that thing going down with you or this like tendency to do something that's not so savory or great, or which is for most people a tendency not to do something bad, but to look at themselves and be like, I suck. I'm horrible. I'm the worst. But still within that is perfection. Yeah. I mean, I think so to bring it to the beginning of your statement, you know, you can fly and find whatever it is you decide to go looking for, right? So if you want to look at things that you can quote unquote measure, and I do that because people can't see me doing the air quotes around that because I think that measurement is its own weird thing, but you, that has problems. But if you want to go look at it that way, you can. But in some ways I find, I mean, we need to measure for building a house. That's like, if you're going to build a house, we need, we need to measure. Like there is a place where I don't know that all cultures measure the same though, or that they use, they have the same relationship to quantity and measurement, right? And they can still build shelters. So what I agree with you, right? That measurement has its place, but we configure that gesture of measurement in our lives and cultures in different ways. So I don't want to assume that the Western form of measurement is the one that I need to go for at this moment, depends on what you're building, right? And I'm going to do that if I decided to build a house, which I will never do. But like, when I think about the measurement thing, I think, okay, in some ways though, looking at DNA or doing some of these other, you know, scientific, they're kind of like, if you ever see someone try to, you know, write an experimental poem, right? When they've never written a poem that rhymes, you know, and you're like, do you really like, why is there a word, you know, like split up into 10 syllables all the way across the page? That's interesting. But like, are you doing that out of compulsion, or are you doing that out of freedom? It seems like you're doing that because you can't write the other kind of poem. So this isn't really an option. This is just you being lazy, right? Or whatever, maybe lazy isn't the right word. But I would say like, where can you start now to think about what's composing the forces in your body? So this philosopher, psychoanalyst that I love, Jacques Lacan, he would say something like, I'm going to get this wrong, but he would say something like, you know more about the words gallbladder than you do about your own gallbladder, right? So you know more about the concept of it. So let's start there, right? And so this is what I want people to do is you know that you can investigate your experience right now. So investigate it right now, your concepts, your feeling of having a body, you know, it's like what's happening right now, Duncan, and people listening, where are your hands? Did you choose to put them there? How did they get there? You know, how are they resting? Where are they? What's happening in your organs? Well, you don't see any organs. How the fuck do you know you have organs? Maybe you're an exception and there are none inside of you, whatever. Okay, you have a feeling that you do? Okay, that feeling is part of your anatomy. So let's talk about the anatomy as consciousness states that you locate and other consciousness states that you think of as places and locations and all that kind of stuff. That's your anatomy. So you can do that. All right. And what I want is for the scientists that study DNA and all that, I want them to do that too. So that's a version of science that used to exist that we don't do anymore, which is as I do the science, I notice what I'm experiencing and I include that in the phenomena. If I see a rose, it brings a feeling to me. I don't just say that feeling isn't part of the phenomena. I say that feeling is part of the phenomena. That's how science used to work. The scientific method is not a universal thing that has existed for all eternity. It's changed over time. The concept of objectivity has changed over time. What counts as objective and subjective has changed over time. So now include the phenomena because you matter. You matter. You're looking at it. These two things are co-creating together. You and the rose are bringing something to light. Beautiful. How wonderful. Because you're right. Because what happens is it's like, look, I don't give a fuck how you feel when you look at the rose. Oh, does it make you feel good? We can't measure. I mean, look, maybe there's some. This is very funny. It's like, God bless them all because if they're hard work, we're going to have at least prescribable psilocybin pretty soon. But when you go to some psychedelic conferences and you see these scientists who are having to put mystical states into a scientific descriptors, they have to quantify metaphysical mystical states because there seems to be some correlation between achieving a state of mystical unification with the divine and the cessation of certain addictive patterns. So they have to say like, they have to come up with a scientific way of quantifying. It's very interesting to watch. It's like watching. It's like what it's like trying to turn Shakespeare into emoticons. You know, it's like a really difficult thing to take this one thing that is maybe the source of language and then try to put it into language. So I love that so much. It makes me feel it's almost, it's empowering. Of course. It makes you feel empowered right away like, oh, shit, I'm human. Wait, this does mean something. And also humble at the same time. Sorry. But go ahead. Yeah. Yeah. I like it a lot. It's really great. Cause like, yeah, I can't see my organs, but I can definitely feel where there's tension. I can feel where there's energetic blocks. You're doing it right now. I'm sorry, man. I actually, I have to go pee. So I'll be right back. That's so good. It's so easy to end up getting just like pure like you can, you don't even realize you're turning into Joseph fucking Mengele and you like, you know what I mean? Like you can end up getting just losing your whole soul in the mechanistic or I guess not losing it. Like, man, if we're sitting in a room and there's like classical music playing and it's the most beautiful thing you ever heard and, but some people in the room are very charismatic and have a real sense of authority or being like, there's no music playing, there's no music playing. No, there isn't music playing at all. There's no music here. It's really a depressing thing because you either have to be like, oh yeah, I guess that was just something I wanted to be there, that music. Or you have to be like, no, there's fucking music playing. And if you're not careful, sometimes that'll get you on a mental asylum. Well, especially then sometimes you can say that for so long that you do hear music when there is none there. Right. And I think also like, I just want to say, I mean, you know this, because I know you've read that book, Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism, right? But there's a way in which most people's spiritual pursuits turn into materialism very easily because we're so used to it. Because we live in a time where we really praise empiricism, which is the senses. But there are things that are beyond the senses. And in fact, the senses are themselves an idea, you know. So when we, let's see. So like think of someone who does alternative medicine, okay, acupuncturist or whatever. And we think, oh my gosh, I'm going to the alternative medicine practitioner because I think, you know, allopathic, you know, regular medicine, it kills people. It just puts a lot of chemicals in your body. Okay, great. And go ahead and do that if you need to do that. But then they go and the alternative medicine practitioner is like, take this vitamin. And then they're like, I'm going to put this pin in your, in your liver because you're having liver problems. I'm going to put the pin right above your liver. It's the same fucking thing. It's just different content, but the gesture is exactly the same. What is, would be totally different is a completely different conception of what you are and what health means. And then you would be doing something different, which is why, you know, for example, for me, something like psychoanalysis is something that's far more radical than something like naturopathic medicine, because here's something where, you know, Freud and these other analysts, you know, they decide, okay, so what is happening is there's something going on in the person's sort of mind, mental conception, and that's arising as other problems. And those are also imagined. So I'm going to talk, we're going to talk and something's going to happen here. We're going to speak and listen and something's going to happen. That's different. Does that make sense? Yeah. So I'm, in other words, I'm not just giving a different kind of pill. I'm decided to change the entire concept of what's happening in this health and healing relationship here. All right. Yeah. There's never when I, like a doctor will be like, where does it hurt? Hurt physically. You go to the doctor and you want to say like, oh, well, my arm is hurting. My shoulder seems to be hurting. But yeah, the other stuff, the doctor won't then be like, right, but I mean, how are you feeling? Like, where's your, where are you right now? What's going on with you right now? Where are you at in the second year? Can you describe it? What is going on? It's just like, oh, my arm and they're, all right, we're going to give you Vicodin. And then we're going to send you do a physical therapist and we'll get you some MRIs and see what the structural issue is in your arm. And then we'll work it out, but he's not going to say, well, wait, why does your armor? Well, and I would respond like this because it just happened to me. I would say, well, here's what happened. You see my wife is having a baby and there appears to be some kind of like hardcore, really weird sense of wanting to be able to provide for my family. It's kind of freaking me out. Actually. I'm a little worried. I want to make sure that. This is like manifesting in a lot of weird ways. So what happened is we paid eight dollars for some wood for the fireplace. And then I thought, I can't pay eight dollars for wood, man. I came from North Carolina. And then what I did is I drove around until I found a stump and I bought an ax from Home Depot and I went outside and I split the ax with or the stump with an ax and I hurt my arm because I don't really want to acknowledge that I'm 44 right now. I can't fucking hit. I'm going to be an old day. I love this. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Totally. Yes, because the principle of causation is like would be so much different if you did that, right? But let's say you didn't remember the ax or maybe you didn't split any wood and you're like, ah, you go into, you know, see a psychoanalyst and you say, you know, well, how are you? Well, I'm going through all this stuff and also my shoulder hurts. And the psychoanalyst says, OK, so it sounds like your shoulder in a lot of the burden and you'd be like, oh, all right, then it locates conceptually and linguistically where the pain is coming from, you know, cool. It's so funny. I was talking to my friend who's from Ireland, my friend Helen, and I was talking about, I kept having this weird like pain in my butt cheek, right? And it was not anything, any other like disease or whatever. And she's a very psychoanalytically minded person. And it wasn't like I'd gone to like a doctor to like get it checked out, nothing. And I was like, you know, I'm just so bummed out about this. And she just started laughing. And she's like, you're what? And I was like, oh, so that you start noticing that there are these like linguistic mind constructs that begin to locate themselves in different places in you. And you can't just undo it by noticing that, you know, your doctor says, oh, your shoulder in the burner, whatever. I mean, sometimes it can work that way. But it doesn't, you know, but it but it points out that there's a thought that's going through you again and again and again and again and again. And then it just locates itself somewhere, you know, because that's how anatomy works. It's constructs of your thinking. So cool, man. Yeah, this is brilliant. Thanks. Whoa. The yeah, it's it's a it's a I think it's like a an articulation of like the idea of karma. It's like, this is a way to understand how karma works. Because, you know, for me, because I'm I haven't. I haven't like mastered the ability to do what Chokin, Trump or Rinpoche recommends, or I guess that unmasked or the ability would be the better way to put it, which is just relax, just relax. That you're going to be fine. Like the thing, there's a thing inside of you. And now that you're telling me this, it's like, oh, I love this because it's like, just what I've been reading is like, there's a deep relaxation that can happen. There's a organ inside of you, so to speak. That if it's too tight, if it's tightened up, right, too much, if you're too stressed out, if it's too burdened, if it's too heavy, then all your other organs are going to start fucking up because it's like it's stress. It's all the but if you just let go and this is going to be fine. And sit and feel that part that's all cramped up. I just like try to just loosen and let it go just a little bit to sink in. Chokin, Trump or Rinpoche actually, in one of his lectures, he goes, it's like when you come home after a hard day's work and you go, but I guess all the time. Yeah. Now you don't have to do it after a hard day's work. You do it during the hard day's work and before the hard day's work. And that's, and I think you can come up with thoughts and ideas that will help you with that too. Right. So I mean, that's what placebo is. That's what sham surgeries are. All that kind of stuff where someone's giving you a thought cure. So, right. You know, one of my favorite placebo stories is I'm saying it's my favorite but I don't remember all the details of it. But like they were testing out these some company in Italy was testing out these two, this blue pill that was supposed to I think put people to sleep. And then they realized that like all the men that took it were staying up and all the women that took it were falling asleep. It was a total placebo. There was no effect, but there was no actual quote unquote drug effect. But they realized that the people, the men were staying up and this is sexist, of course, but because it was the same color as the football jersey of the region. And they were just like getting amped up every time they looked at it. Right. So I wish I could, I'll find this. It was on Chris Crescer's podcast once. But when you think about it that way and you're like, oh, so it's all like we're taking cues, like it's finding the right cue for yourself, you know, and that is the cure. So even if I do take a pill that's, you know, supposedly has some kind of real medical effect on me, it's still having that placebo effect in addition to the real medical effect. Right. So what do I find the right cue? Why, for instance, can I take two ambient and not fall asleep? But I know people can take half of one and go sleep forever, but I can take a Xanax and like Conk right the fuck out, right? Xanax is better than ambient. Right. Spell the same backwards and forwards, you know? Not even love is spell the same backwards and forwards. But I feel like I take it and, you know, it's like, why that? Why do some cues work for me and not others? And then, you know, then I think, you know, it's like, why that? Why do some cues work for me and not others? And then, you know, then I start thinking about it with, with porn, right? Like, why did I have lesbian fans? Right. That was something that was really confusing for me for a while. I think I actually talked about that a little bit on a show that I did with you long ago, but then I figured it out after that show, which is that like people are getting turned on by cues. It's not because they see what they want to do on the screen. Something is evoking. It's evocative for them of a certain kind of cue. So our physiological responses are not directly related, you know, only to the thing that's presented to us. It's what's happening there. What's the thought construct that I'm swallowing when I swallow the pill or watch the porn or whatever? Yeah. Interesting. Right. And that goes back to the rose also and looking at the rose and understanding that you're part of the phenomena. Oh, right. Yeah, because you're right. But yeah, you've literally swallowed the rose. Yes. This is the, that it can be a kind of claustrophobic moment, in fact, where you realize, and we sort of brushed over it, but when you realize that the entirety of your experience is happening within your cranium, you know, within your, well, you're the totality of your being, but it's being processed, the processor seems to be the gray matter in your head to some degree, but it's all connected. There's neurons in the heart. Regardless, you have this realization of like, whatever is happening is being projected within the theater of my mind. And that means the rose is in me. Connor is in me. The whole thing is in me. It's all in me. It's within me. And then that can be a moment of like, wow, cool, followed by, holy shit, I'm trapped in here. How do I get out? Yeah. Okay. So let's mind fuck you for a second, though. Okay. So yes, it's all in, well, I'll say it's all in me. You know, that's the, you know, joke. It's all in your head. You just don't know how big your head is. That's a Lon Myler DeKett book, the subtitle of one of his books. But, but here's something that's not in me. Me. That's the real fucking problem. Okay. So here's how I'll break that down. And this is like the real, okay. So you watch like, I'm going to use friends because everybody, a lot of people know it. So you watch friends and you think about the fact that friends doesn't exist in the friends universe. Okay. So like, they don't ever get to watch friends because that's them, right? Okay. So, right. Ross and, Ross and Rachel, that never happened in that world, you know, and so this huge cultural phenomena did not happen in that world, which means that all the conditions of that fantasy world are different. That's what Duncan Trussell is for you. You never get to watch Duncan Trussell. You never get to experience Duncan Trussell, right? Right. You only get to have a version. You're the only person for whom Duncan Trussell does not exist. I mean, not because you're so famous that everybody knows you, but because you never get to exist for yourself in the way that you do for the totality of experience. Right. So that's when you have the moment of being able to see your own face. And that's a spiritual moment. And it really is an intense experience. I've had it happen many times. When you become the world looking in on you, instead of like you're this set, you become the center point that you really are. Like you realize that you're this nexus sitting there, this weird intensity of forces coming together. But those forces coming together are now where your sensing lies. And it's looking in. Does that make sense? Yeah, man. Yeah. That's what, I mean, this is why, this is why I love sitting. Like I love doing sitting practice. I just love it so much because it's the, it's sort of this exploration of this event that you're talking about. And that because I'm still in the basic phases of it right now, which is just, just real, like first let's work on the mind continuum part. So it's like you sit thoughts emerge, whatever they may be, you go thinking back to with a breath. So this is the, this type of meditation is the space maybe between your lip and your nose, but it's really just watching your breath. And it's not changing your breath either. Like trying to breathe in some spiritual way. It's just like watching the breath and then thinking, so this is the beginning part. Just learn the mental continuum first. And then of course, within that you have these moments and those moments are freedom and a little flicker, flickering bits of freedom where you aren't that nexus point for a second. You aren't that interrelational, steep, fixated thing that you're describing the chakra of identity or whatever. For a quick second, it might happen that the birds tweet and you for a quick second, you might forget to do the thing where like, Oh, those aren't, those aren't me and the birds and your thoughts are emerging in the exact same way. The sound of the birds are your thoughts and then the trees are your thoughts. Maybe. And then in that moment, Ducat, is that his name? Oh, La Milo Duquette. Duquette. In that moment, you get a little glimpse of like, Wow, my mind's bigger than I thought it was. And then the moment you're like that, you go thinking and go back to the breath, you know, because that's just another thought. Yeah, totally. More birds. Well, that's the reason why a lot of traditions say like, get rid of the ego. So I'm totally against getting rid of the ego, but I am into transforming what the ego is. But one of the things is once you obliterate that sense of self, you can sense all the otherness because you are it, right? So it's like, I'm not me anymore, but I am everything else, right? Like, there's a whole thing about like, I think I'm not explaining this clearly, but it's like, when I was, I was in Vietnam last year, and I was sitting in a room and there was a gecko on the wall. And I just like looked at that gecko and it tilted its head and looked at me. And then suddenly I could see it. I could see the gecko looking at me. I could feel the room, the walls of the room present around me, the floor, the air, the light. I could see all those things composing my presence. Like they were composing me. They were making me, you know? And that's happened actually many times in my life, but it was very clear in that moment exactly that everything had been woven together, you know, and then that lasted for a while actually. It wasn't a second. It was a while. And then I came back into my, my sort of, I guess, normal, maybe the word we would use being. Does that make sense to you? Yes. So myself, it didn't go away. It just became everything. It became everything looking in on this sort of negative space where I am, you know? Yeah. Yeah. This is actually, my teacher is telling me that spaciousness. I hope I don't fuck this one up. Spaciousness is a precursor for compassion to happen. Totally. So you need, you gotta have, like before real compassion kicks in, you need that thing you just described. Because if you're all compacted down to this, just compacted and compressed, it's like, how can we be compassionate? The, but the moment you hit that like vastness, it's primarily with a self, you know, I mean, it's like the compassion for others is, I mean, not to sound cliche, but I think it may be the only hope we have on this planet. But that being said, you, good luck for it. And especially if you're not being compassionate to yourself, especially if that compressed super focused state has within it, this whirlwind, a cyclone of self hate, where you're like whirling around in there and looking at everything you do and everything you say in this stern, strict, brutalizing way, which a lot of people do. And they won't say that that's what they're doing, but they do. And that, and part of that I think is because they're not acknowledging the organs of the senses that you're describing here, because somehow they've been convinced by loudmouth that there isn't another thing that happens when you look at a rose. That thing you taught me just now is very, it has within it so much compassion. It's like, man, you don't have to just be a machine, you know, there's like a lot of other stuff going on in there. And some of it's angels. And that's, that's so sweet. It's loving, right? Yeah. The, this is Rudolf Steiner. The sun is a negative space and is through that virtue by which it shines. Okay. It's a negative space. So how is that? I don't understand that. When you, when you listen, when you really listen to someone, when I sit here and I really listen to you, I emptied myself out to receive what you've said. I don't even hear your words. You see, it's something is enacted in me by this communion. The sun is that all the time. So it's always shining. Right. The sun is listening. The sun is listening, you know. And then what we do, and this is crazy to think about. So when you think, when you think there's a movement happening, okay, and the thoughts are the husks of that movement, it's like, imagine a snake moving and every movement, the snake is shedding its skin behind itself as it goes. That's what thinking is like. But the thoughts are the husk, the thoughts are the skin, the shed skin, they're products of a movement. Okay. Yeah. So we need to work into, I mean, I, I, I resist the idea of no thought. What I want is to get into thinking, the active movement of thinking itself, instead of just the thoughts, the content, the thing we say, they say this, we say this, we say this, we say this. What's the active movement there? Can we get into that? And that is revelatory because that's totally sense free. There's no senses related to it. It's just a movement. It's a, it's a being. It's a lie. Yes. When I look at a rose or a person or whatever, I've already missed the chance to not destroy something. Not just because I don't have a con, not just because I have a concept, but because I can only see things because they die into me. I can only see something because it dies into me because I'm, as soon as it enters, I've killed it by turning it into perception. I've killed it into turning it into a conception and it's dying. It's always dying into me. That's how I see. Dead. Dead. Is it dying or dead? Well, it dies into me and then it's dead, right? And the, the, another occultist, Masimo Scaligarro, problematic person, but still very amazing teacher and writer. The light by which we see is not the true light, but the dying of the light. So. Yes. When we see something, when I see, when light hits my eyes, that's not a thing. That's the process of something dying that illuminates as it dies, like a firefly florescing in its last moment of life. That's what I see. We're killing machines, everything we apprehend and look at we kill so we can turn it into substance to apprehend it. But if we can get into a place where we're actually in the movement itself, instead of just receiving these husks, then something really is happening. This is making me think of a few different things. One, sorry, everybody for being that confusing because it's intense concepts that I'm still working through. But you're not being confused more like it's just, I at least my like it's my, it's it's wonderful. The sun, I, this is a very sad sweet article I read about how long it takes for a photon to come from the core of the sun to outside the sun. It's a very, very long time. Millions of years, I believe hundreds of thousands. I can't remember. I remember it's an incredibly, it's, it takes a long time for one of these sweeties to blast out of the sun. And then this, this, this thing that is just purely like giving, pouring out all these photons. Bounce into something and then enter your optic nerve and they are lit. Just like what you're saying, they're killed. They get converted into energy that produces the vision of what you've seen. So your eyes are eating photons. They're devouring these things that spent so long to come bursting out of the core of the sun. And in that little brief moment where they made the transit from the sun to the earth and landed in your eyes and that they got to be alive. And then you have devoured photons. We are all, well, as like everybody like Oppenheimer quotes the Bhagavad Gita and it gets used over and over and over again. And I finally looked at him quoting it and realized like, man, he's like quoting it wrong. He's not mentioning what follows the quote that he said and he's not mentioning what preceded it and he's using, he's saying that what he says is Krishna, he uses the term Vishnu. Okay, whatever. I don't mean to be like a Bhagavad Gita comic book, but Krishna Vishnu wanted to impress Arjuna, the great warrior. And so he said, behold, I have become death. You've heard it a million times often. The destroyer of worlds. But number one, Arjuna asked, when, when he tested the, when the atomic bomb, yeah, when he detonated the atomic bomb, but he says, Oh, you know, it's like Arjuna, Krishna wanted to impress Arjuna. And then the, behold, I've become death, the destroyer of worlds. But then it's like, there's so many other things he says within there too. And it's really what's happening. I think as a scientist has done something or helped to be part of something that is really disastrous and is trying to like work, make it work in some romantic, metaphysical way. You know, maybe Oppenheimer was trying to impress people by splitting the fucking atom. But when Krishna and this beautiful story turns, shows himself as the universal form, it wasn't like the, the source of all love was like, I'm going to impress my friend. Check it out, man. Anyway, that's neither here nor there. But what I'm saying is our eyes are the destroyer of worlds in the sense that we're, and I never had heard that before. So it's very beautiful. That's just really cool. Sorry to ramble about it. But the other thing it made me think of was the difference between fire and ash, like a fire goes raging through something or another. And then the ash in this case would be the thoughts, the thoughts for the ash that is left from the fire of awareness, I guess you could say, right? The thoughts are like, by the time you're thinking the thoughts, we've moved down the line. And in fact, by the time the thoughts emerge, for sure, at least in time, right, whatever the phenomena is that you're thinking about, it's already passed. Right. That that's gone. The thoughts are almost like an echo bouncing off of a thing that's long gone, which was that moment. And so that moment, which is what's happening right now, that's where it's all happening. This is where it is. This is the difference between being the fire and being the ash. And when Christ was crucified and went to the center of the earth, most as a whole other story, and at each level of the earth encountered a trial, and you all can look at this. It's from Christian occultism, sure. But I'm not going to go into all the details of it, but encountered a final being that he could not overcome near the center of the earth, whose name I will not say, and you can feel free to look him up. And I think we've talked about this before. But when Christ got there and they were fighting, the way Christ overcame this being was by giving up. And he said, I, here's all my power I give up, right? And then by doing that, conquered this being. So the end of killing is not by trying to kill more, I'm going to look into an even more powerful microscope. I'm going to look, you know, really into this when I'm, no, it's giving up the power to kill and to win and to move into that space that is totally helpless, which is the active moving river of your thinking. Wow. That is wild. That is so wild. Whoa. That's really, really cool. That's the way Jesus, of course, that would be the way that you won. I'm going to find this thing. This kind of makes me, here, this is something that I read. And I guess this is why I had this thing here. The antidote, this is from this book, Rainbow Painting, the antidote for exhaustion is from the very beginning to relax from deep within, to totally let be training in the awakened state of mind is not something you must keep up in a deliberate way, rather. Recognizing unfabricated natural naturalness, right? Rather recognizing unfabricated naturalness is totally effortless. The best relaxation brings the best meditation. If you're relaxed from deep within, how can that be tiring? What is difficult is to be continually distracted, freely remaining in the totally unfabricated, undistracted non meditation. It's impossible for tiredness to occur. Let me repeat again. What is exhausting is ordinary, uninterrupted delusion. The mind thinking of this and that, the continuous spinning of the vicious wheel of anger, desire and dullness. We engage in such useless activity, nonstop, both day and night. Once you have been introduced to the nature of mind, you could possibly tire yourself, tire yourself in your effort to be diligent. But if we are effortless, how can we be exhausted? That reminds me of what you're saying. Jesus goes to the core of the problem in this case, the core of the problem, all these whatever battles were happening, which would have been interesting to see. But then finally reaching the core of the problem. What is the response? Yeah, to relax. Yeah, I love that. I love that. I love that passage. And the way I would say it is your inner self is never suffering ever. It's never suffering. Your inner self is never suffering. That should be a great comfort to all of us. You know, it's beyond suffering. I don't mean beyond it like it's achieved to stay beyond it. Like suffering is so much smaller than your inner self. It cannot suffer. You know, wow, that's right. That's the thing, the spaciousness, that spaciousness must be a precursor to compassion because the idea is like once you are able to unfold to the point where your suffering is no longer the goes from being a conflaguration. To being a campfire and from being a campfire to being a an ember and then from being an ember to just being like a star far away. It's still there, but so much more is going on. And that that's that is a I think the usefulness of these kinds of ways of thinking and also the usefulness of some kind of practice, some kind of some sitting practice, some thing where you are exploring your identity more than just driving around and thinking, what am I, even though it's driving around thinking, what am I, is a perfectly. I mean, it's really better than most people driving around and not thinking anything, right? Like it's better than driving around and thinking, who the fuck do you think you are, what do you think you are, or saying, I am this, I am that, you know, like getting really entrenched in identity, you know? I mean, that's also its own problem. It's really interesting, because every time I see you, you're still Duncan, like over the years, because I've now known you for quite a long time, a long time, 11 years now, 10 years, something like that, maybe a little longer, maybe a little, maybe it's only like six years. But, but there's a, there's an idea of, you know, I come, I see you, you're still you, you're still funny, you still got that voice, you know, you got the beard and the hat and all that. But you are, and this is definitely got to be because of practice. Like you feel different, like, you know, it's like, you're you, but you feel different and I'm different too. So maybe you feel different because of that as well. But that is because of practice. That's not because of information, you know, that's a difference in what you desire, you know, yeah. Thanks, man. I'm so happy that you, that it's nice. I don't, again, to get to spiritual materials and also because my teacher is like, was a student of Joakim Trump for a long time and he's very good at teaching me not to get too caught up in it, because it's so easy to get caught up in it, but thank you. It is nice to hear. And it's, yeah, and it is, you know, that is the, at some point you do go from thinking about it to doing it. You know, you, and that's, and not whatever that amount of time is. It's okay. Like when I'm with people and I'm going out to sit on this bench out here, I meditate, I, I say, you want to go out here and no one ever says yes. Really wants to meditate. It's so, you know what I mean? It's like, and like, that's how I was for the longest time. And like, I don't, I, I, it's, this sounds callous, but I really don't care if people don't want to come meditate with me and I, I totally get it. It's boring from that at first. It sucks. It's like, there's a period of leading, like for me, there was a, I don't know, years, years of hardcore resistance to just sitting still. So I get it, man. But yeah, there is a point where you realize like, Oh, wow. I still fucking have it, dude. Like I didn't meditate this morning, you know, like, and I, yeah. And I get like, I get into this mode where I'll do it for a long period of time. And I'll be like, that's it. I'm on it. I got this. And then like, you know, a friend will come and stay for two nights and then I'll be off it for like a month, you know? Yep. Because why? Because it depends completely on free will, completely on free will. So that's, you know, I mean, that's really intense, you know, it's like really the decision to do that. And maybe once you get into the meditative act, it's not free will anymore. Maybe you could just do that in a pattern and wrote way, like lots of people do, but the decision to do it, you know, and really develop and work on development, we all have that call, you know, and I wish for people to be able to obey it, the call to become what is needed in our moment, you know, that's the call. The inner development is not just some lofty bullshit thing of like going to moon juice and getting delicious, activated dulce almonds. Yeah. Um, and that was not an advertisement from inches. They really actually have them sitting here and they're really good. But you, but the, the, the call is not just to do that. It's, it's not just about personal development. It's personal development in a way that is in accordance to what is needed. Oh my God, I just thought it's perfect. I was, it's so ridiculous. But remember, I get you to read poems sometimes on this podcast. Remember when I got you to read that ode to pan? Yeah. I've got another one for you to read. Great. But before we read, and then, but maybe we'll do that. Yeah. Let's just do that now. Because it's like, I think what someone gave me this poem and since then I've been going back to it and looking at it and looking at it and looking at it and realizing like, Oh, I think some, somehow within this poem is an answer or a direction for, for, for folks in, in, it's an expansive answer, but I have to go grab something to give you to read it. I'll go get the poem. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I'm enjoying it. Okay. Okay. Here it is. Okay. Kindness. I'm going to say the name wrong. Sorry. Kindness by Naomi, she hub night. Let's see. And I've never read this before. Before you know what kindness really is, you must lose things, feel the future dissolve in a moment like salt in a weakened broth, what you held in your hand, what you counted and carefully saved. All this must go so you know how desolate the landscape can be between the regions of kindness, how you ride and ride thinking the bus will never stop. The passengers eating maize and chicken will stare out the window forever. Before you learn the tender gravity of kindness, you must travel where the Indian in a white poncho lies dead by the side of the road. You must see how this could be you, how he too was someone who journeyed through the night with plans and the simple breath that kept him alive. Before you know kindness as the deepest thing inside. You must know sorrow as the other deepest thing. You must wake up with sorrow. You must speak to it till your voice catches the thread of all sorrows. And you see the size of the cloth. Then it is only kindness that makes sense anymore. Only kindness that ties your shoes and sends you out into the day to mail letters and purchase bread. Only kindness that raises its head from the crowd of the world to say it is ah, you have been looking for and then goes with you everywhere, like a shadow or a friend. That's great. Yeah, that's really something. Yeah. I mean, that is the state of the world for sure. You know, and when, you know, all our spiritual leaders, all the really deep spiritual leaders, the ones that can do the crazy shit that we hear about, they were all black magicians in past lives. Okay. They all were because you have to go through that experience. You have to go through that experience to understand in the next lifetime how to be open and good and kind, right? Wow. And so wait, I have to stop you there only because one of the people in the lineage of Buddhism I'm studying. Yes. Uh, actually wasn't a, uh, a, a sorcerer in a past life, but in his, in, in the, in the, in his story, he started off using sorcery to kill people and, um, he met this teacher, Marpa, the, uh, scroll translator who like tormented him for like 20 years or 10 years by making him build. Yes. One rock at a time, right? Run stone at a time carrying the, the rock up the hill. Yes. Yes. And that was to help him burn the karma off for the, for that. That's interesting that you brought it up. That's how it's cool. That's cool. You know, um, I've talked about this woman before on my show. There was a woman in Germany named, I think I can get the name right. Ulla von Bernus. Okay. Gives me a shiver to say her name. Ulla von Bernus was raised by Christian esotericist, but decided to become a black magician. She, this is recent, you know, not, not super long ago. She was hired by people to kill people with black magic. Um, someone lived next to her and became a cannibal just by sort of like radiation of her presence. Yeah. She was known as one of the wickedest people in the world. And she was a very powerful, uh, magician. When she was older, a friend of hers died. It's interesting, I think, of her having a friend, right? In the first place, but a friend of hers died and she was lying in bed at night. And Christ appeared to her in a shower of wheat. I don't know what that means, a shower of wheat, but he appeared to her in a shower of wheat and he said, in the end, I will conquer all. And from that day on, she dedicated her life to white magic and Christian esotericism, right? Till she died. So the realization can wake up in us because we see pain and suffering in the world. Or our evil can be a necessity for us. So we can be something new in the next life because we had to go through it, you know, and we've all done horrible things in past lives. We've all been murderers. We've all done really, truly terrible things to people. Well, you know, the wheat shower thing kind of makes sense, uh, only because people use a scythe to like, yes, yes. Like, is the, you know, representation of the harvest and also that, which is used to harvest is this thing traditionally carried around by the Grim. Right. At the end of our time, no matter what stands Christ, however you want to take that being, right? But who do we want to be and how do we want to live until we get there? That's our question, you know, until we get there. And then also what's beyond that is another question, depending on who we want to be in and how we live. So do we want, and I will wrap this seismic wave in, in here. Okay. Do we want a seismic wave running through the interior of the earth, hitting as different earthquakes through the world because earthquakes happen in part because of our own passions and intensities in the world, uh, infecting, stimulating and agitating the interior of the earth, or do we want to practice the attitudes? Do we want to have mercy and kindness and love with one another so that the earth itself is receiving the attitude that we take. When we do that, the earth changes. And if you don't want to have a spiritual worldview, it's fine. Just imagine an earthquake happening somewhere where everybody loves each other. Wow. Connor, thank you so much. What a joy chatting with you. Thanks, man. Against everyone. You also have an amazing Patreon going on. Can you just tell people where they can reach you? Yeah. So it's just patreon.com forward slash Connor and Bebe. Um, I think, you know, my podcast against everyone with Connor and Bebe is been, is up to episode 50 as of the time this comes out at least. And, um, the patron is the way that I fund it. It's basically a full time job and I want it to actually be my full time job. And so this thing that I have to do on top of everything else that I do. And so the patron really helps me get out of this like fucking crazy ass, you know, soul killing way of living, you know, by giving me a regular paycheck related to my podcast. So I really, I really appreciate everybody that supports me on there. And then I also have Twitter and it's just at Connor and Bebe. All the links to get to master Habib will be at dunketrustle.com.

422^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - 430: Introducing Dark Air With Terry Carnation Transcript and Discussion^2021-04-01^Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. It's my dirty little angel. You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Hello, sweet babies. It's me, Duncan, and this isn't a Dunkin' Trussell family or a podcast. I've never done one of these before, and I'm sorry if you feel betrayed. Like I stabbed you in the back as you were emerging in only a towel from some ancient bath house. That's a house where you wash baths. Anyway, this is a really funny podcast that's getting put out by my beloved podcast network. It's called Dark Air with Terry Carnation, and it was created by the great Rainn Wilson from The Office and Aaron Lee. It's super funny. Some of my friends are in it, including Al Madrigal. A lot of stars are in it, like Karen Sony from Deadpool. Give it a listen. Listen to Dark Air with Terry Carnation on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you get your podcasts. And now, let's welcome Terry Carnation. Greetings, dearest listeners. Thank you for coming along with me, Terry Carnation, on this incredible oral odyssey. That's oral with an AU. Not with a no, that would be disgusting. This oral audio odyssey of the return of Terry Carnation to his seminal show, Dark Air. You see, I had been away from the radio for the previous three years due to some mental health difficulties having to do with the loss of my dear wife, Zellon. But now I am making my triumphant return to KSB Radio for my late night AM paranormal call-in show, Dark Air with Terry Carnation. And in this brief segment, you'll hear me interacting with my new audio engineer, Jeet Batra. And I'll be going to the phone lines, taking some calls from fans who have some supernatural and paranormal concerns. Finally, we will hear a call that will send shivers down your spine. Testing, testing, testing, testing, testing, testing. Reginald, can you hear me back there? Brr. Brr. Mamala papala, mamala papala, mamala papala. Brr. Rubber baby buggy bumpers. Oh, hi. Mr. Carnation, right here. Reginald doesn't work here anymore, sir. What? No. They let Reginald get away? Oh. He's a three-time winner of the Golden Knob Award at the Ingeni-ries. I know, sir. Unfortunately, they did let him get away. I am your new audio engineer. My name is Jeet Batra, but I don't expect you to remember that. It's very complicated. I am 23 years old, and I'm your biggest fan. I've listened to you since I was four years old, and my mother would nurse me while listening to your program, sir. I cannot tell you this is an incredible honor. Oh, no, no, no. The honor is mine, although it is disturbing that you nursed that late. Jeet, you said. That's Hindi, I believe, for victory, is it not? Yes. I mean, I don't know. I don't know why I said yes, I think, but I trust you that it is. Good, so you are open to the possibility. I am open to all possibilities. Wow. OK, you know my catchphrase. I allow you to be my audio engineer. I won't let you down, Mr. Carnation. I will take a bullet for you if it comes down to that. Let's hope it doesn't. All right, it's go time, y'all. Three seconds to the air. OK, perfect child of God, I am a perfect child of God. You're listening to KSB Radio. Good evening, fellow travelers. Are you open to all possibilities? Because Terry Carnation has bloomed again. This is so cool. Oh, my hands are sweating on the knobs. And now, from the unexplored depths of the Marianas Trench to the unexplained reaches of space, time, and mind, you're listening to Dark Air with Terry Carnation. Dark Air, we've got Daryl on the line. Hey, how's it going? It's pretty good, Daryl. How are you? You know, I'm pretty good. I guess I just don't know how to ask this. I think there's a woman living in my house. You're saying that you've got a woman living in your house? Yeah, like a spirit of a woman, maybe. So not an actual, it's not a roommate. It's not a wife. It started to feel that way, but there's a lot of opinions. How do you know about her opinions? Does she talk to you about them or write them down on a notepad? Or how does that work? No, like the other day, I sat down and I ate a bowl of cereal. And then I live alone, by the way. And I got up and I poured another bowl of cereal and I heard a long sigh, like very passive-aggressive, like. Like she didn't like that brand of cereal? No, I think she has a problem with me gaining weight. Oh, you know. She has an issue with your carb intake? Well, the other day, I went to the fridge again. I cracked a third beer and all I heard was, uh, really? Wow. Yeah, I feel like I'm in a relationship and I don't quite know what to do. Well, maybe you need to talk to her about whatever's happening with you and her and food. It seems a little bit of kind of some passive-aggressive triangulation there. It's not just food. Like when I'm doing the dishes or cleaning the yard, I do this thing on YouTube where I do some sit-ups. I feel a positive energy in the room, like she's agreeing with what I'm doing. Well, are you interested in this spirit or is there? I don't know, it's just been quite a while since that. Excuse me. It's OK, Darryl. It's been quite a while since I've been in a relationship. I don't really know what I'm doing, you know what I mean? Yeah. OK, well, here's my advice to you. First of all, let's cut down on the carbs. OK, let's put the beer aside, maybe at least move to a light beer. There's that certain brand of beer that's like a low-carb myclobe. Maybe just switch over to that. I mean, that's disgusting. It tastes like water. I might as well just drink some water. OK, does she have a name? Do you know? Do you call her name? Do you have any sort of? After I've gotten out of the shower, NERAC has been written on the mirror, so I think that's NERAC. NERAC, NERAC. Oh, of course. Oh, excellent. Karen, OK. So, you know, I think if you're willing to make some sacrifices for Karen from NERAC, the least you can do is switch to the myclobe low-carb protein beer. Sorry, are you ready to make the move, you and Karen? Are you ready to commit? Well, it's either that or move, and I don't feel like moving. Well, there's your answer. Yeah, a yoga ball just rolled into the room, and a glass of water just appeared. So I think I've got to go work out for the day. Daryl, thank you so much for your call. Yeah, I'm coming. Can you turn the lights back on? I've got to go. You're listening to Dark Air with Terry Carnation. Dark Air, this is Terry. Hi, Terry. This is Christine. Hello, Christine. I'm so excited to be talking to you finally. I'm a big, big fan. So my dog, Kenny, he is super weird. He's a rottweiler, and he, well, he has a lazy eye. And one of his eyes, I swear to God, I think it's looking at ghosts. I need your help. OK, so is it the right eye or the left eye? It's his left eye. Well, that makes sense. The left eye is the contingent eye to the spirit world. And was he born with this defect, or did it happen at a certain point in time? No, when he was about six years old, he got in a fight with a feral cat, and then his left eye just has been lazy ever since. It just wanders off, but now we think he sees ghosts. So perhaps some of the muscles were severed, which has allowed the eye to drift from the physical, from the material, into the spirit realm. Now, what is it about Kenny's lazy left eye that makes you think that he's witnessing something spectral? Well, sometimes we'll just be sitting there, you know, like eating supper or just hanging out as a family. And he will just be looking in the corner of the room, and no one knows what he's looking at. He just keeps looking, and then he starts to growl a little bit. That's what made us scared. Well, you know, the Sufi mystics often speak about the power of the third eye, the all-seeing eye. Just to be clear, Terry, he only has two eyes, and they're both brown. It's as if actor Peter Falk could see ghosts with his lazy eye. Anyway, so how can I help you with Kenny? Are you viewing this as some kind of danger or threat to you or your family? My granddad did die in this house, and so sometimes we wonder if he's talking to granddad, but we don't know what it is, and I know you're the expert. So I thought I'd call you and ask. Well, my assessment is that Kenny is peering into the spectral realm. And as such, he should be revered. He should be honored. I mean, to the ancient Egyptian, the humble house cat had two feet in the material realm and two feet in the spirit world. They were often buried with their owners. I think that it's important, when Kenny passes, that he be buried with someone in the family. Yeah, you know, we could bury him with granddad in the backyard. Although there is a problem with that, Kenny dug up a human leg bone and brought it in the house. We don't know if it was granddad or if it was one of his wives, but that could be a problem. But otherwise, we don't definitely bury him. What was Kenny's relationship with your grandfather? Did he beat Kenny? Well, no, he did not beat Kenny. He just sometimes whacked him with a newspaper and kicked him once or twice. But that was about it. He didn't beat him. I'm going to revise my assessment. And I believe that Kenny is in close contact with your grandfather as a kind of spectral retribution, keeping him attached to the material realm in order to reverse the punishment onto your grandfather for the welpings that he brought him with said newspaper. So put the phone up to his snout. OK. Kenny, Kenny? Kenny, hear me? Kenny, can you hear me? He's nodding. He's nodding yes. He's saying yes. Good, good. Kenny, listen to me. Listen to me very carefully. Is he there, Kenny? Is grandfather there? Do you see him? He's nodding. Do you see him in the corner? Kenny, Kenny, let him go. Let grandfather go, Kenny. Let him go. Oh, my God. Oh, oh, my God. Terry, he's up on his high legs. He's walking like a man. Oh, my God. He just put on grandfather's rope. He's walking out the door. He's acting like a man. I have to go get Kenny. I gotta go. Goodbye. Kenny? Oh, Godspeed, Kenny. Godspeed. Collar, you're on the air. The dark air. Ooh. What's this? It's hitting me in the ear bone. Collar, are you there? Hello? Terry? Yes, this is Terry. You've got the right guy. Could you speak a little louder, though? Terry, Terry, I'm here. I'm getting some feedback. I've got some kind of echo going on. Please continue speaking. Terry, Terry, please find me. Help me. You've got me, got me, got me, got me. Wait, no, no, no. Come back. Come back. Cheat. Get her back on the line. Hello? Is it you? Is it a crank call or is it a prank? Is a prank not the first prank call we've ever heard on the show? Let's go to an advertisement. Well, how about that? Oh, dearest listeners, I hope you enjoyed that tillating little sneak peek into the life of Terry Carnation. I hope you enjoyed breathing in my dark air. There's so much more dark air to breathe in in the subsequent 14 episodes. Oh, there's misadventures and shenanigans, hijinks, adventures, romance. And yes, heartbreak. Was that a call from my dead wife, Zalon? There's only one way to find out. Keep listening, follow, like, subscribe. I don't know what you call it.

And I thought why not get down to it and have a conversation about enlightenment itself. What is it? What a mysterious thing it is. Seems like the famous spiritual teachers are very enigmatic when it comes to the question. Take Sadguru for example. How does anybody here know I'm enlightened or not? I never made a statement on that. So how do they know? They're just assuming. Yes? How about Eckhart Tolle? You can never reach it because it's an abstract concept of who I want to be. Not realizing you are it already. Hey welcome to my restaurant. We don't serve food because you're already full. Here's your bill. What is enlightenment? Again this is one of those words that have come from India. To be enlightened. To be enlightened about what? I want, please let's be rational, not irrational. When I say enlightened, I'm enlightened about what? I don't know Krishna Murthy. Well we're going to find out today in a dialogue with David Nickturn about the concept of enlightenment. We're going to jump right into it, but first this. I want to thank Zip Recruiter for sponsoring this episode at the DTFH. Friends there's some things in life that I just like to pick out for myself.

Now everybody, please welcome back to the DTFH. You know him from the Midnight Gospel where he played himself, but he's here now also playing himself. David Nickturn. Hello David. Welcome back to the show. Thank you for coming on again. Duncan, I feel like I never left. That's cool. Yeah, it is cool. So today I thought we could just talk about something that a lot of people talk about, but I don't think, I know I, what I discovered is I got ready for this conversation and I just started researching just basic enlightenment or the concept of enlightenment as I had never, I knew nothing, I'd never really done that. Like I hadn't really looked up like where did the word come from? What's the, you know, origin of the concept itself? And I found a lot of really interesting things, mainly enlightenment. It's a fairly recent word that is a translation of a lot of a few different words. And so I thought maybe we could start there with the concept of nirvana, which I saw means extinguishment or literally blowing out a candle. Maybe we could start with that. Yeah, so it, of course, since we spoke a couple of days ago, I thought, well, let's tune into this idea, this concept. And I think, as you said, a lot of people have said a lot of different things about it. So remember, remember the movie, the Japanese movie Rashomon? No. Oh, you have to see that Duncan, because there's a murder that happens in the forest. And then the, the different witnesses appear before the magistrate and each one of them tells their story, what they perceived to happen and who committed the murder. And then they never, they don't resolve it, which is what's Japanese and cool about it. You don't get the, there's no fourth act. That's it. So when you say something's like a Rashomon, it means there's different perspectives on something. Yes. You know, so I think enlightenment would have to fall into that category that different people are speaking about it from different angles. But, you know, as you know, I'm speaking about it from a Buddhist perspective. So I wouldn't, I wouldn't presume to talk about how, how it might manifest in terms of the European culture version of it. The Christian version of it. You know, other people would be much more knowledgeable about those things. Okay. So here's, here's a framework and you know, we always talk, we set up frameworks to have a kind of piercing conversation, you know, penetrate somewhere. So sudden and gradual. Sometimes we talk about sudden enlightenment and gradual enlightenment. Okay. That's cool. And you know, you could say within Buddhism, that debate has been going on for thousands of years. And some people advocate, you know, the notion of sudden enlightenment. There's some kind of penetration into a state that is like, you know, happens in a moment. Yes. And then there's like a real transformation involved with that. And then there's a notion of gradually building the causes and conditions for what you called nirvana there, you know, for a cessation. Now, they have had debates over the centuries. There's a famous debate between the sudden and gradual. Okay. And so if I could, I'll tell you just one little story. Which was Kalu Rinpoche, who is a very famous Tibetan Lama. And actually there's a young Kalu Rinpoche now who's quite formidable, appearing. But his predecessor, you know, was an extraordinary practitioner. And he had a debate with a Chinese Zen master. This is kind of, kind of famous story. And it was sort of, the Tibetans were representing the sort of progressive or stages of enlightenment approach. And the Zen master is representing the sudden enlightenment approach. So the Chinese Zen master takes an orange in his hand. And he holds it up. You know, he has the, his person take it over to Kalu Rinpoche and put it in his face and say, hey, what's this? And Kalu Rinpoche just looks puzzled for a minute, you know, thinking about it goes. And he says through the translator, what's the matter with this guy? Hasn't he ever seen an orange before? That's so funny and so deep and so cool. Historically, I think the gradual people often won the debate. But here's the kicker on it. I would say the school I come from, you know, which is the Kagyu and Nigma School of Tibetan Buddhism. We talk about both kind of simultaneously, which is interesting or interwoven experiences. So there's always a possibility of like recognizing, sensational, you have to do stop thinking for one second, cut through for one second. Everything stops. Yeah. You can have that experience. Anybody in the audience can have that experience. Like if I just, if you just made a noise or something or lightning flash or something. Yeah, you go. But that's second everybody was cessated, you know. But then the thing is the whole thing comes creeping back in like a bunch of worms towards an apple. Yeah. And then you need to work with it. So that's, I hope that's a good framework for beginning to talk. Really cool. Very cool. Very cool. It's so from the story, of course, just the surface level is very funny and it's a really wonderful jab at someone trying to be so clever. Then in the, the, but then also if you start breaking it apart, which is the cool thing about, you know, these people is like both sides. It's like incredibly deep, but it's so simple. And both sides had to be like it's, it is the conflict between the two that produced a parable, a brilliant parable like both, you need it both takes for that to even happen. But then so, but, you know, the, the underlying thing is it's already, it's already here. Like, yes, that's the sudden part. It's, it's already, in fact, it's like, it's faster than sudden. I mean, like, you know, something is here. There's no sudden it's, I mean, you can't get more sudden than something that's already like, it's like the speed of light or something. You can't warp, warp drives warp drive can't get faster than already here. And so, but then on the other side of it, there is this like acknowledgement. Some people don't know what a fucking orange is. You know, like, you know, and so it's the most and also the other part of it, if you keep picking apart, which I really like is like, what's on one level, what's more boring than an orange? You know, it's like, there's piles of them at the grocery store. They're at, you know, it's like, I've got oranges down downstairs or everywhere, but the, but also on another level, what's more amazing than an orange? Like, how did this even possibly happen at all? So, you know, it's so cool on all these different levels. He's teaching this about using the orange as like enlightenment as the right. That's the idea. Well, and you could say basically fundamentally from a Buddhist, again, I'm speaking mainly from a Buddhist perspective, but, you know, everybody's living in the same world. So it's not like we're describing different universes per se, but you could say enlightenment's a preexisting condition. A tremendous thank you to ExpressVPN for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH.

That would be one way to talk about it. As you said, it's sometimes unconditional or primordial or words that are used. I also thought we could use as a framework the three Yanis or the three vehicles in Buddhism really talk about enlightenment in different ways. Okay. There's stages of recognition or realization that are generally acknowledged as part of kind of method and a kind of progressive approach where you're developing something progressive which would be the gradual approach. There's three Yanis as you know. There's the narrow vehicle. There's the Mahayana which is the Bodhisattva vehicle and then there's the Vajrayana or Tantric vehicle. Each one has a slightly different perspective on maybe how to approach the topic that we're talking about. Okay. As I was looking it up, it is the Wikipedia entry. Very deep research here. What does wikamine? I don't know. I'm sure if we look it up it'll pop up immediately. Wiki. Different podcast. Okay, so it talks about the extinguishment of these three fires. The three poisons and so on. Are these three poisons or the three Yanis supposed to be some? Is there any connection or just as another? No, totally it's connected but in this way. Poison is the word in Sanskrit is klasha. So it could mean poison but it could mean an obstacle or obscuration. It could mean a neurosis if you want to use really modern language. The three are grasping when you grasp at something and cling to it. Attacking or aversion and ignorance. So those three are as you know at the center of the wheel of life. That's what makes the thing spin. That's where the torque comes from. Look out at the world and you break it up into three slices like a pizza with three slices. One slice is I don't want it. Get it out of here. Another slice is I gotta have that. And the third slice is huh, duh, not even seeing anything. You sound like my kids. My kids are literally the three ways. And if you have three kids one of them could be each klasha on any given day. On any given day. But I'm like them too. It's like they passionately want something. They passionately don't want something. Or they're just confused. They're just like bewildered. But completely confused. Yeah bewildered. Yeah so in these now what you're saying it obviously it was mentioned that these are the like this is what the term weaving comes in. So these are the three things that weave together the experience of being here a human or what most people think of as the human experience. This is like these are the things that glue it all together and that the extinguishment is that it's not getting glued together by these three pizza slices anymore. And now what? Yeah. Yeah. You know and so because the implication there and I think this is where all of us on on the where we're still eating pizza get really titillated is because that implication of no more pizza what kind of world is that what are we you know what is that even is it even something conceivable. Is it something that you're still enjoying your pizza your your hell pizza. Can you even imagine it and I get the clapping thing and that pause between breath thing but yeah yeah we're talking it's like trying to imagine what it would be like to have a two hour orgasm or something or you know what I mean like what experientially. Yeah. Can you describe it. Yeah. This podcast is sponsored by better help.

Well, so just continuing to build the frame for one more second here. So the description there would be sort of most akin to the Hinayana perspective. Because you're looking at those things as, oh, these are in the way. I got to get rid of these things. I got to extinguish these fires. Because every time I go to look at a tree, the passion, aggression and ignorance get in the way. Every time I go to, you know, to call a girl for a date. Every time I go to play with my kids. Every time I talk to my wife. Every time I work, passion, aggression, ignorance are in my face. And I can't even see what's right in front of me with any clarity or, you know, or equanimity. So now, so therefore you begin to dismantle those three things. First, by recognizing them. Second, by making friends with them, which is really advisable that you don't regard them as an enemy, which could come from the idea of extinguishing. You know, you might want to crush them. And third, by recognizing their nature, which is they don't really have any substance. That's why people got to meditate, Duncan. You got to meditate because otherwise you go, I get this intellectually, but I haven't had the, I haven't tasted the soup of non-substantiality of my thoughts. I buy into everyone every time. I'm on board. And if I have a passionate thought, I'm running down, you know, I'm running to the deli to get ice cream. And if I have an aggressive thought, I'm yelling at the neighbor, you know, there's no gap at all. So practice is where that's where it fits in. It cuts the chain of those things, just going around and around in a loop kind of pattern. So that's the gradual. Yeah, but yeah, by extinguishing those gradually, seeing the, seeing the root of them, befriending them so you don't, you don't lose, throw the baby out with the bathwater. And then seeing the unsubstantiality of them gradually, their grip on you is released. That's the theory of the Hineana. They cease to grip you. That's Nirvana. You're not governed by those things. But okay, so when I look at it, maybe this is getting too literal. When I look at a candle, like a flame, it's just a flame. It's, you know, there's, I guess you could say it flickers and there's like temporary form to it. That's always changing, but it's essentially just a flame. So do these three poisons, are they real? Is this just like kind of like the opposite of a rainbow? You know what I mean? Like you take light, you put it through a, you look at the spectrum of light, you get all these colors. Is this like a shit rainbow or something? It's like, you know what I mean? But ultimate. Good title for something. Shit rainbows, you know. Shit rainbow. But is it, is it essentially just the same thing? Like when I'm, you know, like when I'm, when I'm sitting or when post meditation, when I'm thinking or looking into the precognition experience of suffering, it doesn't really seem much different. In other words, like aversion and desire don't really seem, they seem like they're coming from the same place. Okay, now. So what, and what place is that? Where do they arise from? Well, well, that's where I'm, that's where I'm stuck right now. I mean, that's where I'm stuck right now is because whenever I get to that place, it just seems like a very painful. It's, I mean, if I had to define it, I would say it hurts. It seems to be very hot. It seems to be very piercing. I guess you could say very like pointed and, and, and I mean, not to like an annoying, just annoying. It's like, it's annoying. You know, it's like a, and also it doesn't seem to, it doesn't seem to be so dependent on phenomena as I would like it to be. You know, because if it were dependent on phenomena, then the shifting of phenomena would reduce it or, you know, but it doesn't really, as far as I mean, you know, and also it's not there all the time, but, but at least I'm not aware of it all the time, but it is there a lot. So I don't know. But then from that comes shit. If I'm not here, then maybe this will go away or fuck. If I go get the ice cream, that'll do something or a nap will take care of this thing or whatever. You know, but it's, So the glaciers come, the glaciers come roaring back. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. Once you get to that, but the underlying root system doesn't seem to be very, it's not nuanced. It's just a splintered feel. It's a, you know, it's like when you have a splinter. So let's call this chapter the beginner's guide to the experience of emptiness. Okay. Okay. Okay. So, and this is also a little bit of a peekaboo into the Mahayana practice. You have a glimpse of some kind of non substantiality of those glaciers that maybe the whole thing is not really solid and fixed the way that it feels. And then you start to feel underneath that there's a kind of uncertainty that is free from any ability to calibrate or categorize. And that's called Shenyatta or emptiness. Now, how would the ordinary person experience it? Like, yikes, somebody just pulled the rug out. This is, this is not, not exactly pleasant. And that's, I think, a big, a big misunderstanding is people think, oh, emptiness is going to be blissful and I'll be happy, but there's nobody there. There's nobody home. So there's a feeling of loss of spaciousness, but also panic underlying it, fundamental panic. And then you dive back into the three glaciers to create ground, right? Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. That's right. This is a roadmap. You know, this roadmap exists. So we're just talking about, you know, a very traditional approach to these things, but that might leave you at a place where now the glaciers reignite and you go, you know what, I don't want to resolidify these, but they keep coming. So how can I work along with them to make them a kind of more compassionate universe with the thought in mind, I'm going to have to be dealing with this for a while. So soften your aggression, soften your aggression, you know, lighten up on your grasping. And this is called Mahayana practice. It's very gradual and you start to work with the interpersonal, it appears interpersonal, it's really your own mind, but you appear to hate your neighbor for whatever. And so maybe think better about your neighbor as a way of reversing that, that traffic flow, you know? Okay. Now, this is something I was thinking about just yesterday. The antidote, I've read it about the antidotes or something. So it's like, it's almost like a reversal where, oh, okay. So here's the feeling that makes you an asshole, whatever it is. Like, so here's the feeling, you know, suddenly you're looking at like, oh, I'm completely anxious. And because I'm anxious, this presents the possibility of the opposite of anxiety, which I think a lot of people when they're getting contorted by whatever the feeling, the clashes may be, they don't even think about the opposite. And that's useful for me just like, oh, okay. Like what it would, what is the opposite of this rotten feeling? I mean, whatever. How would I, how would I, this is my question. How is it, is there, is it phony to then say, okay, so I'm anxious. So now I'm going to try to imagine being calm or act calm or pretend that I'm more peaceful than I am when I'm completely like annoyed or rattled or worried about something. Yeah, faking it till you make it. No, it's a little bit more nuanced than that in this way. The, the simplest equation is. Go ahead. Sorry. Yeah. The simplest equation is for my honor practices, exchanging self for others. That's the engine. So you take on what they, what you've attributed to them, you take on and what you're trying to, you know, pulling off onto them, you take on for yourself. So you got good, you got good feelings, give it to them. You got negative feelings. Make sure that you work them through yourself rather than projecting them onto somebody else. And then the logic behind this is it's like, look, if, okay, so to go back a couple of steps, the spaciousness, the pre-cognitive glacia experience. This is like the gas on the stove, basically, right? It's like, that's the gas leak. And the spark is the, whatever the particular instantaneous response to that may be. So that's how it lights. So the logic here is, look, the reason you're going to exchange yourself for them is because that's just all part of the gas leak. Right now it looks like it's a flame. Right now it looks like form or something, but it's not. It's no more form than when you see gas lit up. It's gas. It's like you're looking at. So the reason you're, it's not just like you're doing some kind of thought experiment here. It's like, it's a reminder, right? It's like, look, I know you think that's not you right now, but that's, you're just seeing the fire. So you might as well acknowledge that by recognizing whatever you're assigning to them is in you. Now what I mean is it's not like you're doing some kind of like feet where you're literally, you're taking the darkness in you. It's like, no, the darkness is already there. You wouldn't be seeing it. Is that, is that it? Well, that's, that's part of the nuance of it is recognizing the point of origin of whatever it is you think you're experiencing. Of course it's in you. And a lot of times you do these practices, there's literally nobody else around. You know, so, you know, that's kind of a giveaway. You know, what you experience when you're alone is kind of a giveaway that you're the source and point of origin of what you're experiencing. Right. Okay, so there's, you know, this is like, you know, modern psychology and everything, you know, the notion of projection. So you just work with the projection from the point of view of reversing the habitual pattern of it. So it's a further subtle way to let go, you know, of the glaciers actually to refine your relationship to the glaciers. Can you give me a basic example of what that like a basic real world example of what that looks like? Yeah. And I just thought of, you know, we always are saying first up best that right. So, yeah, you have a fight with your wife. I think those are easy. Those are safe. Never. I've heard people do that, but that's never happened to me. And you storm out of the house, right? You storm out of the house. And the door sort of slams on your foot and you kind of stub your toe. What's your first thought? Fuck. It's fuck. That's, you mean, you know, your first thought is that fucking bitch, that fucking bitch hurt my toe. Is it not? I didn't want to be that honest. Exactly. What the fuck? Yeah. Look what you did to me. Yeah, that's right. And there you were just, you know, so I'm not saying everything's like that. Sometimes somebody comes up to you and punches you in the face for no reason. You know, we don't get crazy about this, but a lot of the experience that we have comes about because we've conjured up enemies. We've conjured up grasping neediness and we've conjured up a kind of dull wash, you know, whitewash of, you know, blank canvas. And we work with that by just saying, well, okay, the other people who appear in my drama, let's give them some, let's give them some props. Let's give them some love. And if there's any blame to take, let's take some of it too. Got it. Okay. That's my honor in a nutshell. That's so cool. And that's graduate. That is so cool. Now, if you don't mind me just, I thought if I framed this out, then we could jam for a while. But the third frame that we talked about is the Vajrayana. So, which is Tantra or, you know, Buddhist, something called Mantrayana, Vajrayana. And it's, it's the, of the three, it most clearly presents the idea that enlightenment is a preexisting condition. In other words, it's saying, Buddha nature, it's called the proclamation of Buddha nature. The awakened mind is already present. And we don't have to go anywhere to get it. Nobody can give it to us. Nobody can take keep us from it. So it's already on board and it's considered of all things, you know, kind of permanent in a weird way. Even though we talk about impermanence to where blue in the face, that is a kind of ongoing situation. Nowness is the portal. And you, if you approach nowness, you go, there never was a problem actually. So that's the Vajrayana ground perspective. But we have, from beginning this time, occluded that perspective by creating a dualistic world. And it's got considerable construction to it. So it's dismantled in the Vajrayana. And it's dismantled relatively quickly compared to the Mahayana. As I say, and this is just something that people can chew on, that the Mahayana practice will liberate somebody in three eons, three Kalpas. And the Vajrayana one lifetime. That's just, you know, now, it's, in all these eons, there is method and there's form and there's a sense of, you know, gradual development. So that's different than a lot of the, I heard your introduction. I thought, well, nobody's really talking about, you know, how you get there. You know, I mean, if you followed, I love Eckhart Tolle, but he woke up on a park bench. So is he, is his method sit on a park bench? Should I go sit, get depressed and sit on a park bench for two years? You know, what's the method? So the Buddha left it really elaborate and kind of well-defined method. And people have followed up on it. Now you can't eat the map. So people got to do it themselves anyhow, right? You can't eat the map. You can't eat it. Well, okay. I'll tell you, there's a phenomena that happens. It's really annoying to me, which is people get hit in the head. Have you heard about this? No. And they could play piano. You ever heard of this? So like some, it's rare, but you can look it up. Somebody gets a brick, hit some of that. And all of a sudden they're just, they can play piano. They're suddenly masters of the piano. I've heard the same phenomena happens with math. Someone gets smacked in the head. Now they can like see numbers and they could do these incredible equations. And all these stories really bother me because it's just like, so what? You know, like, wow, you're a robot or something. I don't know what the fuck you are, but who cares? Like it's more interesting to me, the person who spent years and years studying piano and got good at it. And in stories of enlightenment at Cartole seemingly being one of them, you get a similar version of the concussion leads to the suddenly being able to play piano. And in Zen, you hear these stories. Oh, they were walking down the street and a drop of water landed in the puddle. And then suddenly they were awakened. Or it's all a park depressed dude on a park bench. You know, suddenly he's awakened. And that would just, by the way, maybe it's, I'm jealous. I mean, it's like, holy shit, lucky you. I'd love to wake up in the morning and look down and I've got fucking abs and I'm ripped. I don't know what happened overnight, but it's gotten superlative shape. So, but as far as like things I can plug into, I prefer the story of the method. I prefer that because that's just where I'm, that's where I'm at. It presents a pathway to, and some something real to work with. But I wonder, does it even matter? Can I jump in there for a second on that one? Because it's such a great, you know, colorful. So I want to go with the brick and the head. Now we have somebody who can actually play piano brilliantly. And we hit them in the head with the brick and now they can't play the piano. But you can. Wouldn't that be awesome? But you can now play like that's how you learn to play pianos. You have to hit a pianist in the head with a brick. Oh, and then the person holding the brick learns how to play the piano and the other guy forgets about it. It's how it jumps into you. It's a great movie. And also you could hit a person with a brick in the head and you can kill them. That's another option. And another one is you hit them with the brick in the head so they can play piano and they end up being a rugby player because of it. So it's very unpredictable. Let's face it. Right. I mean, it's pretty, it's pretty chancey. So it just depends what somebody's prescribing. You know, we're all prescribing things. Your podcast, you're prescribing this, you're prescribing that. Try this, try that. And if you want to start your own, hit a person in the head with a brick school of mastermind class. No. You know, make sure you have good lawyers. That's all. You have to be spooky in that version of reality. When you meet a talented person, you're like, fuck, stay away from me. You know, he's like, everyone would be wearing helmets if they were good at anything. But look, this is a, we got off track here. To me, when something popped into my head when you were talking about the difference between the Mahayana and the Vajrayana path, which is what's, and I feel like there's an obvious answer to this, but it's like, so one thing takes eons, one thing takes a lifetime, but is time even wrapped up in that, the destination anyway? Is there, is it doesn't matter if you get enlightened in a lifetime or in a zillion eons is, I guess, is it, is that just a human thing to want to be able to get enlightened in a lifetime with the Mahayana people just say, you don't need to be in a hurry with this thing. Just relax. It'll happen. Well, Duncan, you know, we, we often together in a part quote, Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche, right? Yes. So here's a quote that I think we might have touched on before. Enlightenment is ego's final disappointment. Yeah. So I like that because I don't, I don't know if there's something really to crave in it. It's almost the extinction of craving. It's the extinction of, of, of feedback and acknowledgement and kind of confirmation. So for most people that experience it is like, you know, and they say, God, they got gone. It's like, it's you that's gone. There's no party. There's no certificate. There's no nothing. So what is there after it would be only a kind of primordial awareness which is infused with compassion for sentient beings. That's my best guess at what you mean by enlightenment. Primordial awareness, non-dual awareness, there's not a separation of my needs from your needs. And then there's a tremendous like sort of natural flow of compassion and skillful means. And that comes from extinguishing, the glaciers are, are obstructing that potentiality. They are greed is obstructing it. Jealousy is obstructing it. Anger is obstructing it. How do you make friends with greed? Wow, that the whole world could learn that lesson, right? As soon as the better, right? Don't you think that's one of the primary afflictions that we're suffering from as a group of species? 100%. 100%. And it's such a, it's such an unsavory, like with jealousy, when someone's jealous, it's annoying, but there's something cute about it, you know, and hanging out with comedians. They're a world jealous. And we are openly, you know, some, some of my favorite comics are open in their expression of, of like, if you, that's one of the great compliments is they're like, I wish I thought of that fucking joke. Oh, I was right there the whole time. And it's a way, you know, but greed, it's so, there's no, I can't think of like a cool kind of greed. It's always gross. Somebody eating too much, somebody taking more when there's food on the table and they eat all the food. It's always just, ugh, it's, there's something so unappealing. I don't know how, in my own personal greed, anytime I'm like looking at like, good, what do you want? What are you looking for here, man? Why are you looking at my plate? When I eat with certain friends, it's like they look at the food in my plate. I know they want it. And they had a chance to order. They had plenty of time to order. Oh my God. Or just sometimes Forrest and I will be eating the exact, now I guess this is where it is. This is a kind of greed that doesn't bother me at all because it's my son and it's adorable. But we'll be sitting and eating and like grits, eating grits, I'm eating grits, eating grits. And he'll look at my plate and go, I want daddy's grits. It's like, but you have grits on your plate, like the same amount, but it's like, I want daddy's grits. Of course. Yeah. You know, it's that. Wow. Like, yeah, I can love that. But my own personal greed, other people's greed, how do we make friends with it? Well, the greed, you know, is associated, you know, you know, you've read my book Awakening from the Daydream, which is about six, six realms, the six realms, not just the human realm, but the hungry ghost realm is the one you're talking about. Hungry ghosts are particularly, they're addictive personalities in modern terms, and it's very challenging to deal with it because their dissatisfaction leads them to your plate. They will steal your credit card. They will spend your money. You know, right now it's cute on Forest, but if he's 20 and he's stealing your credit card to go score opioids, it's not going to be cute. Right. Right. You know, like, you know, extract the love and the generosity from that, and somehow at the right time, go, you have what you need for us, and you need to, you know, help him learn that. He does have what he needs. He does need to crave what other people have. And I'm sure you'll teach him that. Your family will be healthy enough, and he won't have to go through that. So, the hungry ghosts, they're visualized with tiny little mouths and tiny little necks and huge bellies, so they never can get satisfied. And we all know what that feels like. Everybody, I know, knows what that feels like. But, you know, when you're sitting with somebody who has a marked amount of that, they're kind of leaning into your space. That's their way of, that's their way of making love to you, actually. That's the only way they know how. Yeah. Yeah. They don't feel like they have enough. And they're, it's the only way of making love to themselves, and it's never enough. So, it's a particularly challenging state of mind to work with. And generosity is the only cure. Okay. Is there such a thing as greedy generosity? Well, there's idiot compassion. You know about that, right? Where you're sort of satisfying yourself by appearing to be compassionate to others, you know? Yeah. That's another great drum groove. I love that one. The image he gives that I read on, I always think about it is it's like someone's dumping honey on top of you. It's like someone's pouring, you're stuck in all this sticky, sweet outflow, but it's too much. And it's like, it's all, you know, when it's happening, like when someone's being legitimately generous, it's a totally different feeling than when someone's like trying to like do a kind of potlatch in front of you by giving you shit, you know, to like, and it's a sad state to see someone in. It's a sad state. So making, I'm into, I think this idea of making friends with the clashes is something I want to just keep talking about it a little bit more because the, so you get like the gas leak of suffering. It explodes into these fires, aversion, desire and confusion. Again, I just don't understand how to make, like for me, I think my, if I had to like look at it the way the thing catches fire, the worst of them for me is the confusion part. It's the, the mode, the, and the, I can work with desire. I can work with aversion, but when I get all numb or confused or just tired, you know what I mean? Or just fuzzy. I don't know how to work with that. I don't, I don't know how to make friends with it because the state is so remember when we first started working together, I would meditate. I couldn't meditate for, I couldn't meditate. I could barely meditate. And anytime I started meditating, that was the first thing that I felt sleepy. It was the very first thing. I would feel all of a sudden, and I had insomnia at the time. So all of a sudden I would feel mysteriously, Oh God, just exhausted. Like now I can really sleep. Whereas at night I'm like laying wide awake. You know what I mean? It was, and I thought I must be tired. It's fatigue or something. But now I've come to see, Oh fuck, that's one of the things and it sucks. I don't know how to make friends with it. It creeps in and suddenly I'm fuzzing out or I'm just like feeling kind of entropic. You know, it's depression, I think. It's a form of, you know, I think people call it depression when it gets out of control, but it's something worse than that even. How the fuck do we make friends with that, David? Well, of course there's a person who's experiencing that who you could make friends with. Ah, that's cool. Right. Yeah. You know? And it does come and go in my experience. Yes. It is often, I'm not going to say every single time, but often people like us who are, you know, real thinkers, sit down and just pay attention to breath and we just go right. It's like, I call it the road runner principle. We're kind of zooming around, zooming, zooming, and then it just all stops because you sat down and it's just like you crash. Yes. But a lot of kind of thinkery type people, not out during meditation. Not exclusively. It also could be you're not getting enough rest and that's, you know, you should get enough rest. Yeah. So I thought, well, gee, if you fall asleep every time you meditate, why don't you just meditate right before you go to sleep? It wouldn't work. Either way, either way, you'll come out of winter, either you won't fall asleep and you'll be meditating or you'll fall asleep. And that's good because you're trying to fall asleep. That's what that's what making friends is like working with the energy of it as opposed to I see. Okay. Like kind of like, like looking at what the system you're dealing with and then hacking it to some degree, like I'm doing first, just understand what, how is the energy system functioning? And then let's, let's tweak it. When I started meditating more, it, that phenomena when it went away, but it was the first thing it was, it was worse than boredom. It was worse than not wanting to sit still. It was because it's like a heavy headed feeling. It went away. I think that's how I experienced confusion. I mean, I think that's what, to me, when we hear the term confusion or ignorance, I think people think more of like, I can't solve this equation. You know what I mean? I don't understand why this is happening versus what, for me, at least the way it appears is more of just like a, you know, like a zombie like state or something. Is that, or maybe I'm misinterpreting it. No, there's, well, I mean, again, you know, classical Dharma, there's laxity and elation of the two words in English that are used. So they basically correspond to manic depression and contemporary language. And those are the kind of two extremes that most of us will experience in the meditation process. Either it's too loose or too tight would be another way of looking at it. Not too loose or too tight. Wow. So that's laxity you're describing. Just the energy sinks. Yes. You know, and, and it's bottom. Usually people like that, they're going to hit the other extreme too at a certain point. Sure. So elation doesn't mean you're happy. It means you're like, you know, kind of a little bit wired up, you know. Yeah. Laxity and elation. Yeah. There you go. There you go. That's a good one. Right. That's real good. And we're going to experience it. There's no, so I feel Duncan, as you know, that like helping people to understand that there's a process involved with meditation. It's not a magic pill is can be really, I found it experientially, it's very helpful to people. Like they're not just, it's not a one shot deal. It's like, you know, it's not like, oh, I got to do it all at one shot and just get the whole thing under my belt. So laxity and elation are very common experiences for meditators. I mean, I do think for a lot of people when they first begin meditating, they're looking for elation. Like that's the, that's the goal is elation. And, and if that isn't happening, there is a sense of failure or like something went wrong here. But to get back to the concept of enlightenment and to get back to the argument of gradual and sudden enlightenment, I have to say this idea of sudden enlightenment is very appealing, even though, yeah, what you do sit on a park bench or whatever. And visually, I can kind of, I can kind of imagine, I mean, if it is a flame, if that's the, and that is the one of the ways that suffering gets described, not just in Buddhism and Christianity, where do you go when you die? If you've been a complete fuck up, a lake of fire, you know, it's like the fire gets used a lot to describe suffering, but that's where Johnny Cash goes. Yeah, exactly where the ring of fire, baby. But the, but the idea, and I think there's something in my heart that soars at the idea that at some point you can turn off the fucking burner, you know, that at some point that that that just, it's done. You're done. Can you talk about that a little bit? Is that just a dream or something? I mean, the gradual enlightenment idea, it appeals to me because there isn't a sudden extinguishment that's happened as of yet that lasts at any amount of time. But can you just talk a little bit about sudden enlightenment or the sudden extinguishment of this and your thoughts on the matter? Has it happened to you? And have you met people who it's happened to? So again, there's different perspectives on this. So it's helpful to know the range and then you tune into where you plug in the best, what's useful for you. So that's what I encourage everybody to do. And I want to emphasize that anybody we're talking about, there's no disrespect intended. It's just what's going to work for people to actually engage some kind of process where they can move towards, slowly or rapidly, a positive state of being and existence in their own terms. It doesn't have to be even on somebody else's terms. It can be on their own terms. So the extinguishing part is broken up into a glimpse, which I think basically people, it's pretty easy to induce a glimpse if somebody's had enough living experience. Wow. That was a gap. That was an in-between experience. And then there's the notion of you could say recognizing what that is, which is, that's why the word recognition actually is part of the original meaning of mindfulness. You're recognizing something. And then in the sort of more progressed types of training, you recognize it frequently, but without a lot of drama attached. And you recognize it not just when you're in the cushion, but you recognize it like now, like in everyday life. You recognize it in a glint of sunlight. You recognize it when your mind shifts perspective. You recognize it when the light changes in the room. You allow yourself to recognize an underlying state of awareness. That's very, very open. Then there's the notion of disowning that recognition, not clinging to it in any way. So letting it go, you recognize and release. That would be the technique and frequently. And then there's a notion of stabilizing that recognition. And then there's a notion of stabilizing that during the day. And then there's a notion of stabilizing it during the night. Wow! And then there's a notion of complete stability in what we call rigpa, or kind of underlying primordial awareness. And when somebody has had that happen, now different schools will talk about this differently, in the Kagyu and Ningma schools of Tibetan Buddhism. They would say, yeah, sure there's people who have gone all the way through that experience. And I would personally say, without any doubt in my mind, I've definitely met people like that. Human beings and human bodies, but they have that level of realization. And I'm not saying there's a lot of people like that. There's a lot of high level bodhisattvas and unbelievably compassionate and developed and disciplined people. But I feel like I've clearly been in contact with, at least from the point of view, a strong confidence in the possibility for anybody, which is why I like to work with people, because I basically see them as intrinsically having that capacity. And so therefore it's a joyful thing to cultivate that with people, for both parties. When it first started happening to you, and I'm not trying to get you to admit some state of permanent enlightenment or something, I'll deny it. I have a pretty accurate, you know, where I think I am on that particular grid. Where are you on the grid? I think clearly you could say the transmission of that recognition has been effectively given. And that's by my teacher and other teachers. But primarily by Trungpa Rinpoche. So when we talk about the recognizing what it is to recognize, I feel I have some confidence in that particular aspect. I have confidence in that aspect for you. Yeah, I mean, and I don't think it's a... For you. Okay, well, you know, it's something that gets passed along. That's the way the tradition works. It's called transmission, it gets passed along. That's straight through from Buddha. That's the kind of essence or heart of the matter. But then I would say I definitely personally would experience clashes. I can get angry, upset, needy, any of those things. My view of them is that they're insubstantial, though. So even though I'm hung up in one, it's like I'm not really, really going, is this your final answer? No, it actually isn't. So it's something to work with. I think also I feel somewhat gentle towards myself and towards others in terms of like, okay, this happens. It's not the beginning or the end of the world. And I try to be kind to myself when I can, remember. And then I think I'm very much dedicated to well-being of others. I've taken a bodhisattva vow. It's very serious to me. I try to work with others and keep their interest in my heart and mind. And then in the perspective of stabilizing, no, no, no, no, no. I'm flickering in and out of it. Ah, damn it! That's my next question. That's so funny, David. My very next question was, how to stabilize? How to stabilize? Because I do feel from working with you, I have caught a glimpse. And wow, anytime it happens, just all I want to do is like, that's... There is no not grasping. There's no disowning. There's, ah, holy shit. I thought the reason I felt like that was because I was Christmas with my family when I was a kid. Wait, that's the feeling I used to have in the best day I ever had at summer camp. Oh my God, that's the thing I associate with this event or that event. It's not, but I'm just sitting here on a mat in my closet meditating. And suddenly, what the fuck? What is that? Well, if I felt like that all the time, if I felt like that, if that was where I lived or that's how I was, then there would be nothing else to want. And then before you know it, I'm like, what's the word you use? The elated. Now I'm elated. And now I'm like, wow, that's when I'm on the phone with you. David, what's this? And that's when you're like thinking. It's thinking. And so you know what I mean? But how does, you may not have been able to stabilize it. What is the instruction regarding stabilizing this thing? And do you have a little, we only have six minutes, so maybe I should have saved this question for the beginning of the next podcast. But how do, I think many people listening have caught a glimpse of this thing. If you've caught a glimpse of the thing, I can't imagine you not grasping at it. And then how to stabilize without grasping. Well, okay. So, you know, a lot of times poetry is the way to express these things or metaphor. So immediately you thought, you're talking about that, I thought of fly fishing. Don't eat the fish. Catch and release. So this recognizing and then letting it go. And Trunk Rumache was even more, you know, kind of, you could say, powerfully emphasizing disowning it. He used that word and he spoke English very well. That was not a translation, disown it. So catch and disown, fly fish. And that keeps you, you know, and do it, do it frequently. But without any kind of obsessive quality to it, a light touch. And then don't worry about stabilizing it at this point. That would be the wrong end of the, you know, that's like trying to put the hook in your own mouth. That's awesome. Wow. Oh, I'm so lucky. I'm so lucky I get to have these conversations with you. Wow. Thank you. Thank you so much. That's how I feel too, Duncan. That's how I feel too. We've got, you have a, can you talk a little bit about the course you have coming up and Ah, wonderful.

So there's a nice community of Dunkeits that are part of the, part of the tradition of being trained as mindfulness teachers. They're really good people, Duncan. They're really good people. I mean, you really, you really got some nice friends out there and they're very sincere and they're kind of, you know, they have good discipline in general and they're not, you know, just going low and just spoon feed me this.

It's easy to feel as though you've been digitally crucified on some kind of horrific neo-execution device sprouting up out of a horrible hill of skulls that is the modern day internet. And there you find yourself weeping and wailing out, gasping, begging for some sip of water, and all you get is a sponge of shitty tweets shoved down your social media mouth. Well, friends, my dear loves, there's a way out of this situation and it's over at patreon.com forward slash DTFH. Do the modern day version of saying, Father, into your hands, I commend my spirit.

Let me wash your corpse and resurrect it at patreon.com forward slash DTFH. Come home to your family. You know, I actually forgot that I met today's guest prior to interviewing him and as I was researching him, I was thinking to myself, he seems so familiar to me. And then I thought, well, of course, he seems familiar to you. He's super famous. He rose to global fame over the course of the pandemic, was launched into the stratosphere and as awesome as that might sound, it can be quite terrifying and supremely confusing and sometimes even dangerous. This was a really fun conversation and it was really cool to realize where I met this beautiful being and a little embarrassing that I forgot about that. But you know what? I'm 47 years old and I did acid for, I don't know, 15 years straight. So I get a hall pass, right? If I don't remember, sometimes my own birthday. Regardless, I'm excited for you to meet someone who I consider a new slash old friend and I hope you will too after this conversation. You can follow Jordan Firstman on Instagram. It's Jay Firstman, check him out. And here we go. Everybody welcome Jordan Firstman to the DTFH. [""Welcome to UofLive""] Welcome, welcome on UofLive that you are with us. Shake hands, going to be blue. Welcome to UofLive. It's be done contrivously. It's be done contrivously. Jordan, welcome to the DTFH. How ya doin'? I'm good, I feel like I've already ruffled you up. I love it. Cause you're like, nice to meet you. I'm like, we've met. I obviously, is anything about my spirit feeling familiar to you at all? Extremely. Okay, okay. So yeah, there's like part of you that knows. But we've had a couple run-ins. Okay. But you know less than I do. And my mom loves you. What? And you met me and my mother together. Okay, I'm gonna just throw it out there. This is amazing, this is an amazing mystery. Yeah. The comedy store? Disgusting, no, I would never. But me, I would never myself and I would never subject my mother to that kind of experience. Okay, okay. Rom Doss retreats. Yeah. Okay, all right. Are you kidding? Yeah. Whoa, no way. Okay, now it's all coming back to me. Wow, okay. How fascinating. Okay. When you were at their mom. I also wanna know like, do I, like, do you know why I exist? Are you like, why is this like gay guy on my podcast? Well, I know that you're like a superstar. You've got, like, I know that you have like, also I think what's really interesting about you is that it seems like when you really started to hit was during COVID. So you have the bizarre experience of weirdly benefiting from a global plague, which in some way I've experienced something like that because the Midnight Gospel came out during the pandemic. And I think that that made it resonate a little bit more with people. So I think in that way, we have something in common and that you have had a kind of like a meteoric rise from diving into Instagram and like just putting out some stuff that I imagined at first, you're like, this is just something. And then suddenly like celebrities were into it. And then now you're on like, Jimmy Kimmel and stuff. I'm on like my, I have like the meteoric rise and it's like, then I entered the kind of like inch by inch downfall from that. And like- Oh, do you feel that's happening? Oh yeah, for sure. It has not continued to rise. That's the funny thing about the internet though. It's like, you do hit these caps. And then it's like, this is who it's gonna be. And then once they get a little bit sick of you, then it's only gonna go down. Yeah, I mean, I think those downs are just like, you can't get to, you know, a Ragu who, did you meet Ragu at the retreat, Ragu Marcus? Yeah, yeah. And I wanna go back. I wanna go back and tell- We'll go back. This is cool though, man. Okay, so Ragu Marcus who runs the Love Survey Member Foundation, and he was one of my mentors, he calls the part of the mind that attunes itself to all that stuff, which is the rise and the fall and the numbers and God, the satanic aspect of the internet is it will let you quantify down to like, moment to moment, who you're losing, who you're gaining, a kind of diabolic stock market ticker, where you imagine you're witnessing your value socially or something, it's really fucked up. But he says that's bean counting. So like, when we get caught up in that, like, oh shit, I'm on the way down, or I'm on the way up, or any time you find yourself going deep in the analytics, you're bean counting, you know, it's not really, and for me, I know that the thing that bean counting didn't, is not why I ended up with a job where I could podcast. You know what I mean? It happened probably the same way you made your first impression video, I'm guessing, which is I was just like, oh, it'd be fun to do a podcast. No thought behind it at all. No thought, just I'll just see what happens, you know? Yeah, but I think for you, you found something, and I don't know, maybe it's all for a show and you like secretly hate it, but I think you still like love it, right? I love it, but I can also hate and love at the same times. I mean, I don't love, you know, for me, the responsibility, now I have a family, I got kids, so there's an added responsibility, which can sometimes, if I'm not really careful, my mind will feel like, I have to do this. You know, but then suddenly I'm hanging out with you and I love it. You know what I mean? Then suddenly it's like, oh, this is gonna be good and this is fucking cool. And you know what I mean? I think you're allowed to hate shit that you also love. Yeah, something in me, I mean, I had about eight months where I was like, I was definitely bean counting on the way up, and I was like, fuck yes, like, oh my God, everyone loves me, this is great. And then once I realized how many people hated me, then I started having to bean count those people too, and I was like, oh damn, I shouldn't have paid as much attention as the people who love me, because now I'm paying as much attention to the people who hate me, and then I started to resent the people who love me, because I was listening more to the people who hated me, and I was like, they're right, and you people who love me are idiots. Oh my God. It became this, I mean, it also happened so fast and after a really traumatic time in my life that I couldn't really process it. And so I was just like, I guess this is happening. And then you're also thinking about the specifics of who you wanna please, because I'm like, I have Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston watching, but then I have people who are like, I think are cool, not that they're not cool, like sure, they're great, but then I have people I want to respect me as artists, like peers, then you have all these people who want something else. So it's like these three categories of people or more that I'm like trying to please at one moment. And then I kind of was just like, fuck it. And now I'm like, I just don't care, you know? Yeah, look, I think it's a daily struggle. It's like those people, you make these little holograms of Reese Witherspoon, whoever the particular comic or whatever the underground person is that you wanna like you. She is my favorite comic. Reese Witherspoon? Yeah. Yeah, I've got them all living in my head, man. I got everybody. People who don't even follow me, I'm trying to impress if I let myself go crazy. I want fucking Michelle Obama to like me, but also I want like some deep conspiracy theorist, bunker, dwelling freak to like me, but then also hyperdimensional beings to like me. And then I get paranoid and think none of them fucking like me or maybe no one's even listening at all. But this is just my mind, you know? Because again, to get to the, and I think people here, I don't care thing and they think, how could you not care? But I think that you don't care thing that you're saying is like a kind of holy, I don't care. And also, you know, in magic when like they say you have to draw the protective circle, like I think that protective circle has some quality of I don't care because it's the care part that the demons will use to try to trick you. And I think like at the beginning, and like it, I was kind of doing more than- My apologies. Is it Michelle? I'm so rude. I actually had it on airplane mode and somehow it's still ring. Okay, go ahead. That's so weird. It wasn't an alarm, it was a call. They got through the fucking demons, got through. They got through, Michelle Obama got through. What was that? What were we talking about? I don't know. I mean, I got completely distracted by that. We were talking about demons and penetral barriers. The concept of I don't care. Yeah, yeah, so I was like, when it was like first hitting, like it was deep pandemic and like it was, I was, you know, micro dosing acid every day. I felt like super connected, super connected to these people, these strangers, these other beings. And I was like, maybe I can like, maybe I can make this non-human thing human. That was like, I was like, maybe I can do it. And then all at once it kind of like bursted. And I was like, oh, it's fucking Instagram. And it's like, it's Mark Zuckerberg. And like this is a platform that is now run by someone who started the career comparing women to farm animals. And like that is what it will always be from now on here on in. So it's like, I can't go up against that. And like my little attempt to like make a machine or a whatever a platform more human ultimately failed. But it worked for a second. But I would consider it at this point looking back a failure. No way. No, well, I can't, I mean, look, if you're, I think that is an interesting take. I mean, I think it was a successful experiment though, right? I mean, you've got a result. You rippled the water in a kind of like intense way and got a result that a lot of people would be thrilled about. Like, I mean, like if suddenly I was like, I mean, I think there's something terrifying about your meteoric rise. Your head did poke up pretty far. You know what I mean? And that is where you do run into like increasingly bizarre levels of danger, right? From the haters is there, is there called? Yeah. I also got, I mean, like I got the like story of like the rise was like happening and it kept happening. And then I was like little by little, I was like, oh no, the gay guys are coming. Like I knew pretty quickly. I was like, these baggots are coming. They always, like I always had faith in gay people and like until I experienced it firsthand and I'm like, dude, these guys need help. And what do you mean? What do you mean? Tell me about this. Yeah, yeah, you kind of do have gay friends. Yes, yeah, I do. Like one of my, yeah, and I don't mind you asking that. One of my best friends is Connor Habib, who used to do porn. And he's a fucking beautiful person. I want to know him a little bit too. I've met him a couple of times. Yeah, and he's like, he's a cool guy. And like, and I love him a bunches, but do I have like a ton of gay friends? No, do I have, I mean, do I have a ton of straight friends? No! I have the non-dimensional, yeah. You're welcome to, I mean, when you become a parent, it's not, I mean, in move, we left LA and came to Asheville. So it's sort of like, I'm making friends. I hope we become friends. I hope so too. Okay, yeah, so I'll go like a little bit into gay guys. They just, I mean, my, if I were to theorize it, I just think we're in a horrible place as gay men. We had a couple of good years. Actually, gay men, like really, like, it's been a rough, it's been a rough time because they only had like a, like post-Stonewall pre-AIDS, there's like five years of like having fun and fucking and being free, and those years were like, probably really lit as fuck. And they, it meant something. Like the sex meant something because they could. And the drug use meant something because they were like, we're living in this counterculture. It was like another religion. And they didn't have to like assimilate into culture. They could just like be these hedonistic like beasts, but like had the soul of being oppressed for a while. And then living in like a basically post-AIDS, at least in like the gay male urban culture, it's a post-AIDS world. And it's, and we can get married. So it's like weirdly assimilating into straight culture. And so because of that, like, I think we have like lost touch with any form of struggle, but still aren't straight people. So it's like just the hedonism jumps out. And so like I look around and I see like insane sex practices, insane drug use, and like so far from the truth. And then it's also we, because we're not like still fully accepted in society, this competition to like be the only one that can be successful or be like thriving is really major. So when they see- Can't wait, can I stop you there for a second as a straight guy? Let me tell you, cause today I was just thinking we're gonna have this conversation. And I was thinking all these assumptions we make about gay people and what their lives are like. I was thinking like, you know, I have been kind of making this assumption that makes me feel better, which is like, you know, y'all probably still have some problems, but mostly you worked it out, right? You know, like I, like a, and I, and I was thinking today, like that is such a fucking stupid assumption to make based on nothing more than like just like- We could have sex whenever we want to. Yeah. That's the thing that straight, every straight guy is like, dude, I'm so fucking jealous. You could just like take out your phone, get your dick sucked. No, I don't mean that you can have sex anytime you want to. Though I do think that like that hedonistic period that you were talking about that I'm obviously I'm aware of. It does, that does sound like, holy shit, that would have been amazing. Like that level of freedom, that level of also the psychedelics being used would have been, and I think during that time MDMA was still kind of legal. You know what I mean? It was just sort of bubbling around. I'm not positive about that one. But no, what I mean more than that is not just like, oh yeah, it's great to be gay, fuck whatever you want. I mean like a kind of assumption, at least I've had in my own mind, which is like kind of what you're saying, like marriage is happening now and there isn't like, that things have gotten, you know, better regarding the way society is like looking at like gay people. But again, these are purely heterosexual, married persons, lazy assumptions. So to hear you, you know, talk about that, it's sounding as though like within the community itself, there's some kind of like friction. Is that new friction or has that always been there? I'm feeling it in a way that I've, I always kind of knew, because like I just like in my small experience, like trying to make gay work and like trying to like get in Hollywood and like tell like gay stories. Like I kept like running into these walls and they were like, no one's gonna watch it. And I was like, you're wrong, you're wrong. People like gay guys need this and they will watch it. And then the second I started to like blow up, I was like, oh my God, they were right. Like they wouldn't, they won't watch it because they don't want to see themselves reflected. It's like, it's this weird thing where I was like, oh my God, I was like fighting for a community that most of them do not want someone to fight for them. And then there's like the other, there's the other side of it that's like, then on a very like commercial capitalistic level, like you can't talk about the issues that gay men face. Cause it's still so fresh that you want the straight audience to be like, we're thriving or we're oppressed. It's like either like one of the two things. And then there's like all of this like energy inside of it that is honestly extremely fascinating, but it's just like, it feels at times like there's no market for it. Cause the way in which basically like, I sense the gay people bubbling up and I was like, I'm losing gay people. Like the fact that like Ariana Grande is like fucking with me, they're like, we're jealous, like we're not, we can't do it. Or they're like, they, they, in their minds, they're like, cause then I started like becoming kind of like fashion-y and I was like doing Versace campaigns. It just got kind of spiraled. And then gay men also have a thing with like, I don't have like the perfect like gay male body. So they're like, why does that bitch get to be a Versace model? I'm at the gym seven days a week. He's kind of fat a little bit. Why is he getting to be a model and I'm not? So then there was like, and he's being funny. People are thinking he's funny. It was too much for them. And so it like became, and I watched this happen. This was like the, one of the most interesting internet moments I've ever experienced, but like basically they, there were a couple of people like campaigning to get me canceled. And they were like, team assemble, we're going through. And I watched it. I was, they were like, we're finding everything. And so I was like- What did they find? I Google, I didn't find anything. What's the point? I'm glad, I'm glad to know. I'm glad to know. What did they find? Usually when you're, when I'm like researching a guest, the cancel thing is the first thing that pops up. Nothing, just like everything very positive. Oh my God, what did you do? What, what did they find? It was, I mean, it was really crazy the way it happened. Cause like first it was like this kind of popular meme account that was, they were like changing the captions on my videos. And so like, there was like one and they wrote like, this is my impression of a black woman as if I wrote that. And so then that started like getting passed around. Oh, shit. Yeah. So that's like true, like cyber bullying. So, you know, I was like, I was pretty well liked at Instagram HQ at the time. And I was like, guys, like delete this. I was angry. And I was like, don't take this post down, delete these fuckers forever. And that was big mistake, big mistake. Cause then they knew, they knew. And it was like a pretty big account. And I know it's hard to build followings. And I do feel like a little bad, even though they're fucking assholes. Oh my God. Like I got their account deleted, then they went to Twitter and they're like, it was like 10,000 tweets in five minutes. I fuck Jordan first and we're going to take them out. We're going to take them down. That's when they like went to the Twitter and I'm like, Duncan, I'm, I'm deleting tweets as they're going through it. I'm deleting them by the thousands. And they're like, guys, he's deleting tweets. We need to go faster. Holy fuck. It was like a video game and, and they found three. They found three. What'd you say? Honestly, they were so, it, it was, the reason like you didn't find it is because like, it was so attempted. It was attempted cancellation cause they weren't juicy enough. I mean, the one, the one that people got the most mad at was just speaking of homeless people as anyone tried killing one. Which like- Oh fuck. Yeah. Not funny, but it's like, obviously I don't mean that. And obviously, like, I was obviously, I was also 19 years old or 20 years old, 10 years ago. Just like tweeting. I was like, thought I was Sarah Silverman. Like I didn't know what I was doing. Yeah man. No, I know. I mean, it's the horror of all comedians is it's like, I know exactly why you did that. I certainly have like, when I look back at all the grotten things that I've said, not out of some like hateful part of me, but just out of pure lazy edge lording. And it's like, you're trying to get a reaction. It's like, but in your, and you are like a, you know, younger version than yourself now. You aren't thinking about anything other. No. And also generally like, comedians when they're coming up, they like, and again, I'm not, I'm speaking for myself. There's a kind of like serious insecurity. We devalue ourselves in the most extreme way. At least most comedians that I've like run into in the, like they're, you run into every once in awhile comic who's like, just imagines they're the funniest fucking thing that ever walked the face of the earth. But under most mostly there's a sense of like, you know what, it doesn't matter because nothing's ever going to happen for me. So I'm going to just be fucking lazy and say some stupid rotten thing. And then so you're in 20 or 19 or whatever, you're edgelorting. It's edgelorting. You don't mean it. I mean, that's the thing is like, there are people out there. That means that. Wait, one second, pause one second. Sorry, I'm, my computer is throwing up. [""Can't Sleep, I Don't Know Why""] Can't sleep, I don't know why. Oh, I remember, there's a pandemic.

But also I just, I also wanna say I'm not, I don't consider myself a comedian either. So- Okay, well, but you do, you're making comedy, you're making some form of comedy. Yeah, it was kind of fluke vibes though. Like it wasn't what I, like I spent years doing other things and then it was like a quarantine, like I'm gonna make some videos just because. It was very like, it was an accident. Semantics aside, when you start experimenting and making people laugh, you know, like it's just like with my toddler, you know, when he's exploring the world, he'll for example, slap, I'll bring him some milk and he will slap me in the face. This has happened, he bring a nice fresh glass of milk just a slap followed by like an observation, like a scientist, like what happens if I slap dad in the face after he brings me some milk? And there's only love between us and cause I recognize, oh, I know what you're doing. You're not like, fuck you motherfucker, I don't want your milk. You just are trying to see what happens. Something, there is something that is interesting there too though. Cause like, aren't we in some ways always trying to like slap the milk out of someone trying to give us milk? You mean like basic aggression? No, just like basic not accepting love. Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Yes, well, I think in a lot of adults, this is one of the great like sad, like self-imposed love tourniquets that we wrap around ourselves and out of some horror, God forbid we get embraced by the universe. It sounds like you experienced this, you know, what's cool about technology to me, one of the cool things about it is it like exposes these archetypical realities via ones and zeros. And so all of us who have experienced the comment reading problem have quickly realized how habituated we are to turning away from love and turning to hate and how interacting with the hate only amplifies the hate just like what you were saying up front. Some fundamental rule in the universe, which is here you could have infinite comments of like, God, you're just, look, I'll tell you, man, I just uploaded, I just did this comedy central animated thing where you talk about trips that you had and like I had totally not been, I had like been successfully in denial about how fat I had gotten over the pandemic, like really successfully like just ignoring that. I got fat. I'm like, I'm like, you know, like, I'm like somehow. And so then I see my video and I'm like, oh God, Jesus. And people are there saying you're fat too? Well, it's a lot of sweet comments. They love the stories, they love it, but yeah, of course. They're people who are like, not just you're fat, like somebody was like, I'm worried about Duncan. That looks like dangerous way. It's like not just you fat fuck, you've been eating too much cereal at night. I'm worried, I'm worried about him. So it's like my mind is not paying attention to this love comments at all at that point, just doing this satanic fishing trip to find all the insults. And it's also like I, it's kind of fun though in a way. Like I get why they're doing it. It's like, it is, I've, I like, even with my audience, like I started noticing them in the last couple months, they're like being mean to me. And I'm like, why are my like fans being mean to me? And I'm like, oh, it's cause I'm giving them nothing, but hey, like I'm not giving them good energy like I used to. And so they're responding back to it. And I'm like, part of me is like that thrill I used to have like seeing the number go up. Now I have a similar thrill of seeing it go down. I'm like, how many, I'm like, how many can I lose? Like what can I do to, I don't know. It's just, I mean, because if I'm, I think I need to, as a person, I think my, my like karmic journey in life is to like learn how to not live in extremes. And I'm like, if I'm not going to have extreme love, like I will have extreme something. And so like then I'll, I'll, I'll like push, I'll push them away to like feel something of the same on the opposite side, if that makes sense. Yeah, it does. It's, I mean, it sounds like, it just sounds self-destructive. It sounds like you're trying to hurt yourself. Or it's, I mean, it sounds like a, to me, it sounds like an experiment that success in the experiment only means some kind of like failure. Why, why, why, why, why do that? I think it's just a more experience, I guess. It's like, I think I am someone who like seeks out major feelings and like, and like living in a like median range, super difficult for me, has always been super difficult for me. Actually, I would, and like, I actually do want to go back into the ways that like you, you are super connected to my life and like my, my growth as a human. And you actually keep coming back in weird ways. But I, even the last time I did, I Alaska, it straight up was like, stop coming back. You're done. You don't get like, you're not getting this high anymore. Like we taught you everything we're gonna teach you, don't ever come back. And so like that was like, and now I'm like stuck here back here and I'm like, fuck, I know I can't go back to that place. I kind of like do know the answer now, at least for my life. Like the time before that I did it, it straight up like, told me the thing and now I just have to like live with that. And so I think like it is now about hopefully trying to find some sort of peace. But- I know I've been evicted too out of the psychedelic universe. I've had those moments where the, whatever the thing was was like, come on, what are you doing? You do you want it like, why are you, once it was, why do you always go through the back door? You know, you don't have to like, you know there's other ways to, and yeah, and I remember like understanding like, oh yeah, like it's more like, I was trying to take shortcuts or something like that. And you know, instead of like dealing with the ground, you know, the thing that you're in the spiritual world all the time is like, you can't build a house from the top floor down. You've gotta start, you know, with the foundations and then work your way up, even though it would be nice the other way. And I think sometimes the psychedelics, at least that's what I was doing, even with meditation, with music. You know, I bought all these fucking modular synthesizers before I learned scales. You know, I wanted to like do the most extreme thing. Yeah, but okay, I want to throw this out there. Yeah. And definitely shoot it down. Do you think maybe you just got a little freaked out by getting too famous too fast? There's definitely part of that, but like honestly like it didn't feel that weird. I was like, yeah, this makes sense. Like not to be like a cocky little dick, but like I was like, I get it. Like it just felt like right, but then it also was like taking me really far out of, cause I had spent like, I'm going to talk about it now. So like I started listening to your podcast when I was around that age of the tweets, probably right after those tweets. And I had just had a really traumatic year that I don't want to super get into on here, but like I had gone through like a major, major trauma. And like your podcast like open, opened me up so much to so many new things. And like, yeah, I started, got obsessed with ayahuasca from like listening to your podcast, had like a year of like being obsessed with that before I did it. Then like that whole journey took me on this other thing. Left that for a while, came back to it, got into Ram Dass. Like you, you're the reason I have like a spiritual world inside of me for real. Thank you. Thanks for telling me that. Yeah. And then I, we, we met at the Ram Dass retreat and my mom who's like either, like she can be either super perceptive or like the exact opposite, like super delusional and just like not living in reality. But she was like, she was like, he's your teacher and you need to know him. And I was like, and I was kind of like, it's even like in my, in my like wanting to talk to you, there is part of me that's like, just like you can just like leave, leave this man as someone who helped you. You know what I mean? Like you don't actually need to know him. Like he can just be a part of your life that like is, that privately helped you. But then I was like, I also want to talk to him. But just to say, like I, you, you are, I mean, you, you understand your, your shamanic in your own ways. And I think actually like we, we then ran into each other again, I think we're both on MDMA. And I, I was, are you, am I allowed to say that? Yeah. It was at like some warehouse space and you were, you were dating someone that I knew and we had like a moment, we had a moment. But I was like, Oh, I totally remember it. Yes. Okay. Now I've got it. You got it. Okay. Cool. Yes. I remember now. Yes. And I was on, actually that was MDA and I think not MDMA. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Cool. Now it's all, now I've got it. Okay. Cool. I kind of liked it better when you didn't, but now we can't go back. The memory has been, been locked and loaded. I remember. But I was, I was telling you, I was like telling you about your shamanism. And like you were, it's like, it's kind of weird how you react like when, when confronted with that, right? Like it's like you, I don't know. We had a kind of like conversation. I can like really like push and prod people too. So I might've been being annoying. But I think I was just telling you about your shamanism and you were either being very like humble or like you were scared of your shamanism and like wanted to like retreat. Not scared of it. No, you know what it is? It's like having been with like, had spent time with these teachers from the Ramdas Satsang. Yeah. Ragu or my teacher, Jack Cornfield or Trudy Goodman and seeing this commonality in discipline, in lineage, in practice. It's more along the lines of like a sense of like, look, you know, I'm someone who's trying to figure this stuff out and I love talking about it. But, you know, if to say much more than that and it would, I would feel like I was like, not that there are any kind of like ranking systems here or anything like that, but I would feel like I was being not deceptive, but it's just sure, but these people, they're like, if there is something in me that you're responding to, it's because of my connection to them and my practice that's related to what they've recommended. You know what I mean? So that's, it's not really humility in the sense that I know sometimes I can describe some ideas in a way that people hear them and I think that's fucking cool and I'm so happy I could do that. But also it's like, Jesus, like my teacher, David Nickturn, having worked with him in using the lineage of Chokim Cheparimpoche and experienced what that's like and seeing how organized the process is. You know what I mean? It's not like you just decide you're gonna be a meditation teacher. It's like he spent years working with someone from that picked up a methodology that's legitimate, you know, and it's been passed down for thousands of years and evolved and refined so that when you're, when he's working with me, you could tell that there are gradients and that the gradients are based on like his ability to assess where I'm at with it. You know, it's like, the way he puts it is we do this in real time because I'm my, initially working with him, my personality is such that I wanted the shit right away. My ego wanted the, I want the initiation. I want the magic. I want the download. I want the fuck. I want to actually project. I want to read minds. I want all the cities. Is that all the ego bullshit and his for literally for years, for years was you just try sitting and meditating. Just sit. Yeah. Well, you should sit. Why don't you meditate? Well, I had this incredible experience when I was meditating. Oh, forget about that. Now just sit and you realize over the course of working with someone like that, that there's a real reasoning behind why you was doing that. You know, so anyway, sorry to go on and on. That's why when people approach me and suggest something that I wish was there, and which could be one day, but what's now I know is not, then I always shoot it down. I try to shoot it down. I mean, but there's also like you're obviously someone who believes in some sort of soul thing. Like maybe like, I'm not sure exactly which version of it, but like there are just, there's learning and there's like being receptive to learning and there's like being skilled and knowledgeable and like keep building on that. But then there's like also just some chosen souls out there, buddy, right? Like, and like there has to be some form of, I mean, it's like, it's pretty biblical, right? Like these people have to like accept that they're chosen to be able to like spread it, right? Well, okay. So the story, I always go back to the Ram Dass story, he has a brother who ends up in a mental asylum, have you heard this story? I think so. His brother thought he was Jesus and like I think they found him in an apartment with like a group of senior citizens that were convinced he was Jesus. He gets committed, sees Ram Dass says to him, why is it that I say I'm Jesus and I end up in a lunatic asylum and you're out there, you look like Jesus and you're saying you're, people are treating you like Jesus, you're fine. Ram Dass famously says, it's because you think you're the only Jesus and I think everybody's Jesus. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And so I think that like, you know, this is like right now I'm reading this great book, highly recommended to you, cynicism and magic. It's a, it's a trend, it's like a Devandra Banhart reading, Chogym Trumpa's like a book that was taken from his first lecture. And in this book, he talks about spiritual materialism, which is a recurring theme for him, something called spiritual materialism. Have you heard of this? No. This concept, okay. So the concept is really fucks you up because like as a spiritual people, we like to, we almost like self quantify. And so we imagine that we have all these stripes or pens or badges or there's some hierarchy here, you know, a real like hierarchy. And I don't mean in the sense like some people are like licensed teachers who, there's like a kind of licensure that's there for the same reason in therapy, it's there because you don't need, every time someone is, you can really fuck people up. Oh yeah. And it's fucked. And so, but I mean like in the sense like, oh, I've chanted this many times. Oh, I've meditated for a year straight or oh, I went to the Himalayas and touched the feet of this person or that person. And what ends up, what Chogym Trumpa Rinpoche was identifying as like this thing that happens where you start creating an imaginary storehouse of powerful experiences. And from that, you can come up with this, the soul thing that you're talking about. And Ram Dass and Chogym Trumpa Rinpoche and all of them, they would always just fuck that up. When I would have tried it, it was always like, oh no, that's your ego. That's what Ram Dass would say, that's your ego. Because, you know, a friend of mine was telling me he was talking to Ram Dass. A lot of the things I've learned from Ram Dass come from other people telling me that, talking to him privately, someone was telling me they went to Ram Dass and they were saying, I put all my love out into the audience and the audience gives me all the love back. You know, Ram Dass, you know, and only the way someone like him can, with a big smile was like, that's your ego. You can't give love away. You can't take love. There's no transaction here. That's the frustrating thing about it. So, as far as the chosen ones and all that stuff, oh, wouldn't it be nice if we were, God, that'd be cool. I'd love it. I'd start a whole fucking thing. I'd have a tower, like Carl Jung had, I'd have some kind of fucking tower. I'd etch important shit under rocks. No, girl. But, yeah. You have the podcast tower. I know, but again, I try to make a fairly concerted effort to deflate that idea only because it's not fair and, God, Jesus, man, I'm telling you, if it were real, I would fucking inflate. I would be like, yes, I can read your mind. I can heal. I'm a healer. I talk to the spirits, but it's like, oh no, my friend. I get in fights with my fucking wife. Sometimes I drink too much. I eat bowls of cereal at night. I'll jerk off to foot fetish porn. Wipe my jizz on my fucking sweatpants leg. No, I'm afraid not, I'm afraid not, because I think that's the only ethical way to get into the discussion about this stuff, because otherwise, you know what I mean? You end up, you end up fucking everyone out. Yeah, yeah. Fake expanding. It's true, it's true. Like, I can say it to you, but it's good. It's good that you've come all over your pants and eat cereal, too. You know, sometimes they can feel like the entire world is trying to keep you from getting a good night's sleep. For example, this morning, oh, at 5.30 a.m., two elderly gentlemen went power walking with flashlights by my window, loudly talking, simultaneously waking me up and reminding me of my own lack of daily exercise, keeping me awake as I rolled around thinking, why don't I get up and run or walk? I mean, come on, are you kidding me? These guys were probably in World War II, and they're out there doing at least six miles per hour with weights, at least weighted flashlights. The point is, when you have a purple mattress, you can sleep cool and comfortable, no matter what the world throws at you. That's because only purple mattresses have the grid. Its unique ventilated design allows air to flow through, to help you sleep cool, even when it feels like 1,000 degrees out or 1,000 degrees in, and the grid is amazingly supportive for your back and legs while cushioning your shoulders, neck and hips, no matter how you sleep. Unlike memory foam, which remembers everything, the grid bounces back as you move and shift, so you never get that, I'm stuck feeling that you can get with memory foam. They sent me one of their amazing pillows, it's actually amazing. I wouldn't promote it if it wasn't unlike other charlatan pillow mongers out there and mattress mongers out there. Purple offers a truly advanced mattress and also it's my favorite color and the color of the DTFH and you can try your purple mattress risk free with free shipping and returns.

But again, I think these days we're seeing in technology and everything the dangers of centralization and everyone's playing around with decentralization. I think when we're looking at spiritual communities, when we're looking at all the stories surrounding so many spiritual teachers, anytime there's central and look, it happened to you. You fucking centralized, you got hyper centralized and in that centralization, suddenly you're getting like hate and people are like, what the fuck? You're not who you say you are, you're something other than what you are. And in that, all these accidental, you ran into all these accidental problems, and so I don't, anyway, but that being said, the term spiritual friend, I like that a lot, which are satsang, spiritual community, which is it's like, we're here to talk with each other and from where we're at. And that's where, to me, the magic really happens. Yeah, it's funny, I'm like, I'm, I think something about the, I'm trying to find my way back in, but I'm also kind of, I'm in a godless universe right now. And I know that about, I'm like very aware of it, and it feels really weird as someone who has like, the last 10 years has been very gaudy, and like, I'm into this shit, and I feel it, and I believe it, and I experienced so much of it, and like, I'm, I'm like looking around me, I'm like, not there, not there, and I'm like, no God, no God, no God. And I'm like, this is so strange to like be feeling so disconnected from something that I once felt so connected to, but I'm kind of also trusting that it's like, you know, it's like we go through these, have you gone through a godless phase since you started the thing? Of course, right? Fuck yeah. Yeah. You know that the, I mean, isn't this the, okay, Jesus on the cross. What does he say? Do you remember the things Jesus said on the cross? I'm gay. He said like, if I want, if only, if only, that would be iconic. It would have changed a lot. It would have changed the course of human history for the better, for sure. And you know what? Probably if he had said that, they would have been like, don't write that down. Sadly. But the, he says, for my Christian friends out there, forgive me if I leave one or two out. He says, I'm thirsty. That's one. And that's when they shove this vinegar soaked cloth in his mouth. They call it vinegar, but really, this is an interesting sort of Da Vinci code moment. People like say, actually, they gave him opium, like that bitterness. Oh, they gave him something to make it a little easier on. That's nice. Yeah, that's nice. So that now the second one thing that he said, I can't, is what he says, he says, this is the most poignant one. I think he might call for his mom. And, but then he also says, this is the part where you're at. He goes, father, why have you forsaken me? So this is to me, this is why I love Jesus is because all these other like avatars, yeah, they, they're in it to win it, man. Where is the moment of the dark night of the soul moment? Jesus on like in the great, you know, final act or the Christians will get mad if you say final act, but in the great moment, literally is experiencing what you're experiencing, complete disconnection from source, complete abandonment, yeah, abandonment. And you're in, and here's what's really interesting. I had a rabbi on the podcast and he was explaining the Garden of Eden story to me and in the Garden of Eden, are you familiar with this, the Garden of Eden story, like the basics of it? The basics, yeah, definitely the fruit. Yeah, of course, of course. Really trippy, man. That like the whole thing is just really fun to read when you're high, but like Eve gets at him to eat the fruit you're not supposed to eat. And of course, literally, it's the stupidest shit you ever read in your life, like, but it's not meant to be taken literally, but so, so God calls out to Adam after this like transgression and you hear all these things, depending on the version of the Bible you're reading, and it can sound really like patriarchal and like, where are you Adam? You're in trouble, but really the original translation, the way he calls out is the way a parent calls out when they can't find their kid, which when you have kids, it's the most fucked up thing where you're so terrified. Desperation. Where are you? Where are you? So it's like the, this is almost like a mirror of that on the cross where the Christ is calling out in the same way. And the word being used is Abba, which means daddy. So it's not father, why have you forsaken me? It's more like, where is my daddy? Where daddy, daddy, daddy? Heartbreaking. So crushingly heartbreaking from that perspective. So the godless thing you're talking about, you know, yes, I think that is a natural and important part of whatever you want to call this thing that I think we're engaged in, which is at some point, yeah, there's nothing there. And you got, I mean, like that's kind of like what the whole, it's funny, like that last ayahuasca trip. Also, it was like speaking of kind of like, it was, it was run by a charlatan, I'll say. And I just like add in an act of desperation. It was like right after all the shit felt like it was going south. And I was like, I can't, like I need, I need answers. Like why am I being tested like this? Like again, like I thought I went through the bad part, but it's like, no, the bad part like keeps coming back. And like it, there's always going to be, it's always going to come here again. And then it's going to go up and down and up and down. But I was like in an act of desperation, I get this shaman reference from someone and like I go and it just like wasn't the vibe. But like it was all still like part of the lesson of like, you shouldn't, you should have done your research. You should be a man. Like you need to grow up and like stop asking these higher things for answers. Because we've already told you we're not giving them to you. And so be a man and like part of like being a man and like by man, I obviously don't mean man, but I mean, like be a, just like grow up, stop being a baby and you don't need God all the time. Sometimes like just do your work and then feed yourself and then go to bed and then wake up again and like do that for a little bit instead of like constantly being a little kid, pleading because the time the like last like experience I had with God, I was truly begging. I was like, it was, it was, you know, the last time I did Iwaska, I'm in Peru. It's my like last time Peru, the way I got there was super crazy and like running away from a relationship. I was like, I need answers. I need answers. Didn't give you the answers. I want it. And the last night, the first time I ever did Iwaska, like female God, as I call it female God, male God, that's kind of just like how I categorize it. And she came to me the first time and like that bitch is amazing, obsessed. Like I, and so I've been like searching for that like endless love since and she had never come back on any of my trips. And so like I'm sitting there the last night and I'm like, I'm just like sobbing and pulling my hair out and like hitting myself. I'm like, you're fucking here. Like I know you're fucking here. Just like reveal yourself and give me the fucking answers bitch. Like just screaming like, like bloody, bloody and like just so much pain. Like the pain of it felt like the true like the word struggle. It felt like that times a million. And I've never felt more just struggle in my life. And then it is a podcast. So it's like, you're not going to be able to see it, but maybe we'll try to describe it after, but after like two hours of that, I like sat back and just like, took a breath and then she like came to me and she just made this face. Wow. And she just like stuck her tongue out at me and she was like, you don't get to know. So I'm never, ever going to tell you any of this. And like that's it. I started laughing so hard and she was like, you don't get the answers, but like what you do get to do is laugh at me with your friends. So just like do that. But like just know right now I'm telling you every question you just asked me, you will never know. I'm not telling you straight up. No cap. And so then like I, that's like what I'm living with right now. So it's like, of course, I'm like kind of, and then I start that kind of sends me into the next like year of my life where I'm like making like people laugh. Cause I was always like, so I did not, I resented my like ability to make people laugh. I've always run away from it and been like, I want to be taken seriously. And this is where it all kind of like connects back to you too. Cause it was like, I was just starting to have this experience where I'm like making a lot of people laugh and they're like relying on me for laughter and it feels really good. And I watched your show, which like obviously really moved me a lot. And I started thinking and that made me think about Ram Dass. And like, you know, at the retreat, you, you know, you have your like whatever, like five seconds with him and it's like this beautiful thing. And like I go back to my like memory of that. And I'm like, what did I choose to do with my five seconds? I chose to go in and like crack a joke in his ear and make him laugh. And like I have this beautiful picture of like me like making him laugh. I think I just flirted with him. I was like, you know, like something about how like he like looked like didn't look a day over 40. I just said something like cheesy and flirty, but I was like, oh, this is so interesting that like all of these things are coming back to laughter. And like that for, for me, I mean, like I believe everyone has their own God or so to speak or the God inside of themselves. And like mine, I do think I've learned is, is a God of laughter. And but I think that I think that is probably why I'm living a Godless experience right now is because like I that laughter was at a point taken away from me by like my experience in the last year, or maybe I laughed too much. Maybe I let or maybe I gave my laughter to everyone else instead of like laughing myself. So I don't know that I don't know where any of that story goes. Love it. Listen, it's this, you know, the, the, maybe it's just because I'm reading it right now. But you know, this is again, something that I keep going back to is this concept of in spirituality disowning these experiences, which so like, I remember once actually when we were making the Midnight Gospel, I remember walking by a trash can and looking at it and thinking, what if I just like forget all this bullshit? Like all the Ramda stuff, all the neem curly Baba stuff, all the Buddha bullshit. What if I just could just throw it all away and just start over again with none of it at all? And my heart just would like it was the best moment ever. And once up here in North Carolina, I was up in the forest meditating. And I had this moment of thinking, why do you even call this Buddhism? That's so stupid. Like there's Buddhism doesn't own this experience. Like how crazy that you're, you're giving this away to like some label or some thing. And that was a really like powerful moment for me. And then I would articulate some of these things to David, my teacher and his advice sometimes would seem, I wouldn't talk to him for days or be so annoyed with him because he would tell me just, you know, in different ways, maybe disown that, maybe just, you know, let that one go. And I would be like pissed because I couldn't see what he was giving me, which was freedom, the freedom of not being encumbered by the past. Because whatever the fuck it was, the laughing, Kali-esque goddess figure that you encountered with her tongue stuck out, which is very metaphysical, has a lot of like real significance. If you look at any of the paintings of Kali, most of them she has her tongue out, you know, and like it's like a very powerful thing, what that represents. So one of my, the Buddhist teacher, Bob Thurman, you know, was telling me about this Buddhist scripture where the Buddha sticks his tongue out while he's delivering the sermon. And everyone watching on the tongue could see like the multiverse, essentially, him in all these different forms, alien forms, god forms, goddess forms, delivering the very same sermon simultaneously throughout the universe. But he's sticking his tongue out to do that. So the significance of the tongue sticking out from a metaphysical perspective is very powerful. And it's one of the ways that the divine shows up for us somehow. It's like a hugely powerful symbol. Yeah. I mean, kids love it too. Yeah. And it's ridiculous and silly and absurd. And that, so it's like, to me, one way to look at it is denial. The other way to look at it is trying to blow up your whole fucking game. You know, like it's not like I'm not going to give you the answer to these questions. That's what they're saying, but it's more like I'm going to pop the bubble there because your questions and all of it, what's behind all that? What's the real, what's the answer behind all of the possible answers? I don't know what that is, but disown, disown. It's like another thing that came into my mind when you're telling me that story is what Ram Dass would say, you know, one of his teachers was channeled. And that being, I think, said to him, you know, just because something doesn't have a body doesn't mean you should trust it. And so a lot of encounters people have on ayahuasca, I think, are with legitimate beings from the astral realm, but not necessarily who they say they are. So it's like, when a being says to me, why do you always come through the back door? Because of the resplendence and the beauty and the glory of the trip, I can think, yeah, you're right. I'm forbidden from psychedelics. Thing I've never met before, who I'm seeing. I guess I'll believe you because you're astounding in your lack of embodiment in the normal sense. So I'll believe you. But it's like, why? Disown and throw it out the fucking window and see what happens. And for me, it's weird when you start realizing, when I've realized the manacles holding me back, the things that are keeping me locked in are not the darkness as much as my attachment to the transcendent experiences I've had. And then the very natural desire to replicate that. And because you won't, it's gone. I don't, you don't know that lady was out there. You don't know if she was sticking her tongue out at you, telling you, you will never get the answers to your question. You know, you should have stuck your tongue back out of her. Because it's like, okay, who are you? Who do you work for? Where's your fucking credentials of disembodied entity? Why do I have to believe that I won't get these answers? It's such a stern. You got this stern thing. It's like, okay, well, next, next, who can I talk to next? I'll take the next one. You know, but I do think there's something to be said for disowning it, to like make the blast. And that's why a lot of blasphemy is good to me. Like that's why I think there's something to be said for blaspheming. There's something to be said for, you know, occasionally like doing whatever you think the worst. This is why I'm from, you know, some of my friends are satanists and why I really appreciate what they're up to. Is they're helping people who've been indoctrinated into like really abusive fundamentalist, fucked up, like sex negative, shame filled. Like conditioning programs that are disguising themselves as Christianity, they're helping them like disengage via some symbolic blasphemy, which I think is like very useful anytime you find yourself falling under the spell of any kind of powerful singular being. So whoever your goddess lady is, I wouldn't call her back. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I think I had like a similar, also just like a response to like blind positivity, which like I was living in like delusional positivity for a while, because things were going well. And like, yeah. And then when things stopped going well, you're like, well, like it, where does the positivity come from? Like it's, is it come from other things or it comes from me? So then I just went online. I was like, I'm going to, I'm going to like dig this ship into the ground, spent like six months just like going to raves, drug sex, like doing all those things. I was like, fuck the positivity. I'm a bad boy now. I'm in my Justin Bieber bad boy phase. Let myself like go the fuck off in that way. Then you get to like a point with that where you're like, okay, that didn't really work either. And then I mean, like I'm kind of like, like when I say I'm godless, I just mean that like, I think nothing, I'm in a phase right now that will obviously change. But I'm like, nothing has worked. Nothing like the, the drugs have never worked fully. The sex has never worked fully. The, the art, even the art, like I thought art was my salvation. I'm like, that's not even really it either. It's like there's only if only. Oh my God, I would love, I would love it if those things worked. But I do think that it's like in the alchemical laboratory of your life, you must do these experiments if you're drawn to them just to make it. Because if, what if they, what if it did work? Like what if you do end up being someone who like, no, actually sex, it's working for me. Like fucking all the time. It's getting me in shape. I'm getting plenty of sleep. I'm making great decisions. No one's mad at me. Everything's fucking awesome. This is working. You never know, it could be. There are, I'm sure there's people out there like, oh, I fuck. Oh, he clogged. And it's awesome. I love my life. I love my life and the same with drugs. Maybe there's some possibility out there for these things. But as far as like the godless thing goes, I mean, I think that it's an important, it's like, I can't smell right now. You know, I got COVID and now I can't fucking smell. It's been going on still. And so I can like kind of smell stuff if I get real close, but I can't really smell. If I am not careful, I'll panic. I'll be like, what the fuck? Am I never going to smell again? I'll never smell a forest. I'll never smell. But then if I just kind of like, let it be, all right, I'm not smelling right now. It's really not that big a deal. And I think the truth thing is you could try that with God, which is like right now, you're godless. Yeah, whatever. And there's no God for you. You're living in a material universe. And right now that there's, there's no God. This is actually, you know, the reason I have my meditation teacher is just because that one of the Ram Dasser treats, I don't remember which one. Apparently I asked Ram Dasser, one of these people, if Hanuman was, you know, if everything is changed, isn't, couldn't Hanuman change the deity that you all are so like into? Couldn't he die basically or go away forever? How does that work? And Nick Turn was like sitting in the audience. In fact, that was super funny. And then, because he's a Buddhist, and then he went to Ragu and was like, Duncan seems like a nice person and everything. But does he even have a practice? Like, what's his thing? And then Ragu told me, I was like, fuck that guy. Fuck that guy, do I, no, I don't have a practice. And then I was like, you know what, I want to, that's going to be my meditation teacher. And so then we started working together. And that was one of the first things he said to me when we started working together was, you know, my teacher told me this any minute. This is hopeless. This is a hopeless situation, right? Yeah. And when he said that, that's when I knew like, ah, okay, great. This is definitely for me. This is the thing. Because that non-denial, that non-denial of the quality of reality that is legitimately hopeless, that thing where you're like, I can't fix this. No matter how fucking high I get, no matter how much I achieve, no matter how much whatever weird rearrangement of my external universe or internal universe I try to do, there seems to be this inescapable suffering, which I think translates to godlessness for some people. So you say that to the wrong people and they'll be like, no. There's so much to fight for. Affirmations, yeah, yeah, yeah. And there's something really necrophiliac about that to me. It's like, you know, when people put too much makeup on a dead body and you go to the funeral and you're like, still dead, you know, too much lipstick and dead. Yeah, I like it when they're really done off. I want like a full face beat. I like when they look like a drag queen. If you're going to do it, honestly, if you're going to do it, go all the way. If you don't do, don't try to do well, half dead, half tan or whatever the fuck that is. But you know, I think there's something in what a lot of people call the positivity movement that reminds me where it's like, are you really like a positive person or are you just a mortician for the truth? Like, are you just like finding different ways to put blush on something that's like, we all know it's fucking dead right now, friend. You know, and so to me, there's something really like, and then it's not enough that they put makeup on this reality of suffering, but then they literally try to fuck it. They're like, marrying, netting it to try to make it. And it's going to do what you want it to do because it's not real. It's dead. It can't fight back. So now they're making it like say things and act in certain ways. And it's so fucked up, right? It's like necrophilia, metaphysical necrophilia. And even worse, it doesn't fool anyone. But yet, there is an audience of people who are like, oh, it's so fucking beautiful. It's like, but they know it's dead, too. So you get a feedback loop of just necrophiles. So I think. It's also so weird that we're supposed to, sorry. No, please. Thank you for, I don't know what I'm talking about, necrophilia. Thank you, Jordan. We're like, at Futurals, we're supposed to be like, look how gorgeous they look. Like, why are we, why are we looking at them being like, wow, they're fucking hot as fuck? Like, yeah, it's very bizarre. No, what are we going to do? Like our compliments to the fucking mortician. This is a statue made of meat. It's like kind of sculpture, a genetic like flesh sculpture. Do you think this there's like some metaphor in the like, the societal obsession right now, makeup is like, never been bigger. Like the industry of makeup, it's like cross gender now. Like it's like as big for men as it, maybe not as big, but like, is it like the death of society? Society keeps dying more and more. And like, that's why makeup has to be more and more on. Look, man, I got a more positive take on that. You know, I'm honestly makeup adjacent. I'm not that far away. I was looking at the Taliban. You know, they put, they put on, what do you call it? You put on your eyes. Eyeshadow. They put on eyeshadow. Yeah. The Taliban, they put on eyeshadow. They look fucking good, man. Yeah. Like the beard eyeshadow thing looks really cool. And so honestly, I've like been like, you know, maybe I'll, why not? What do I have to lose? Put on a little fucking eyeshadow, like the Taliban. Yeah. But I had, listen, I don't think, I don't, I don't know, I don't know. I don't know the answer to that. Like I think it's a putting makeup on your face while you're alive actually. I think that's pretty cool. It's when you're, when you're putting makeup on a thing that is the truth and you're trying to repaint it in a way to make it seem different than it is. I think that's where shit gets fucked up. And so this is to me the, why, you know, I, after my dad died, I called Raku. I'm fucking crying. I'm so brokenhearted. And I say to him, this hurts. And his answer was yes. Yeah. Dumb it. It hurts. It hurts. Yeah. No attempt to make me feel better. No attempt to like do anything other than. Yes. It hurts. And to me, especially this time when however many people have fucking died suffocated to death. Yeah. There's something increasingly profane about, you know, trying to do some kind of like. Everything's great. Yeah. It's like, okay. This hurts. This fucking hurts. This hurts. And that's, that's, to me, if I stay there, then I, then, then like when things don't hurt or when I have moments with my family or when like, I know it's, it's real because I've acknowledged the hurt part. Yeah. You know, I've, instead of trying to get away from, I mean, I like, so I, the godless thing, it's just like, this is why I love the first noble truth of Buddhism. There is suffering. That's it. Acknowledgement of it. There is suffering. Yeah. And it hurts. Period. And it wouldn't be suffering. It hurts a little bit. It hurts. And it's like, you know, when I'm having problems in my own life, when I'm having problems with my marriage, when I'm having problems with my personal, like looking back at decisions I've made that I literally, that I just can't change. And I just, instead of trying to revise it in my head or pretend it's something other than it is, I just say, this is it. Yeah. And it sucks. And it's might not get better. Yeah. And I don't, you know, somewhere there, there's a feeling of like, centeredness at the very least and, you know, you know, the, the, what happens if you find God? What, you know, how does that even look or work? I mean, yeah, I mean, people do all the time. And then it goes away. Yes. That's right. It goes away. Yeah. And, and, and, and this is what I love about Bhakti Yoga in particular, the, so there's an acknowledge, so that there's different ways to connect with God, actually. And some of them are the devotional path offerings, you know, burning incense. But some of them are weirdly like the longing part, the pining, the acknowledgement of the separation from the divine is considered, and the longing for the divine is actually considered as much a connection with the divine as hanging out with God. So the godlessness in fact is considered a sacred experience, you know, that, that when Jesus is calling out Father, why be forsaken me? That's a holy moment. That's a sacred, so weirdly, even though I don't like being on the godless side, of things, when they're, when all the magic is gone and like, or he was flirting. You said that's Kiki is his dad. He's just like, I mean, like, what do you do when you like someone? You kind of like, or like, well, maybe I'm not going to be here for a little bit. And like, oh, right. Make a mystery. Hard to get. Yeah. Playing hard, playing hard to get. Yeah. Well, it is a bit of a gift, you know, I mean, it's like, you don't like there, if we're even going to believe in God as a concept or something. The assumption is, is like, you know, either we're dealing with some kind of perfected thing or we're dealing with a thing that's evolving just like us. I mean, it is quite, I mean, this is a thought I don't like to entertain that much, but maybe, you know, what was that book that got popular? He's just not that into you. Yeah, yeah. I mean, is it possible that God at some point was just like, eh, lost cause. Sorry. Sorry, humanity. Yeah. I mean, kind of two ships passing in the night. Look, I know I made you and everything. Yeah. I mean, he's done it done it before. He obviously dinosaurs were not doing it for him. Yeah, fuck those things. It was like, not it. And then like, yeah, we're not going to be it either. I mean, it is crazy that people like think that we're it. That's like where this apex, like that we're going to keep going. It's like so, so obvious that like, like we haven't done anything right. Really? Like, we've gotten some things right. Ask him, but it, it all ended up here. I guess the environmental collapse. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, yeah. Again, it's like, look, I, the what I remember like flipping through some book and there's like a picture of some ruins in the jungle somewhere. And the caption read, this was once a major city. We're not really, it was something that we were not really sure the people who lived here. And then, you know, you're just flipping through the book like, what? Major. It was a major fucking city. New York city. And they're just like, yeah, we don't really know what that was. Okay. On to the next page. And here we are in like our cities. Like, you know, like, no, this will be around forever. This would, this would really be around forever. Now, of course it won't stop, stop, stop, stop with all that. But it is funny. You know, human, an individual can take pride in that idiot assessment of us as a species, or, or become a lot like overly alarmed when you're like, oh my God, I think things are beginning to collapse. Yeah. Not, how could this happen? How could it not happen? Yeah. Yeah. Like literally everything that's what happens on this planet is, is collapsed. And then people are like, you're being negative. You're, you're being too dismal. You know, and it's like, no, I'm not look around in Buddhism. They would sit at the edge of pits and watch bodies decompose. The monks would do this. They would sit there and meditate and watch their faces collapse and rot, smelling the stink, flies getting on top of them. And they would do this so that they could completely familiarize themselves with the actual reality of what it is to be a human being. A drop of meat and dew on the fucking garden, on the, on the garden of time. And all of us so fucking stuck on meditating that. Not, not to make a cheesy joke, but it does, it, that is kind of what living in LA feels like. Oh yeah. It's like you're just watching, like you're watching death all the time. Like it just feels like death is there and like we're kind of participating in it, but kind of just watching it. Yeah. Maybe Angelina knows our monks in a way. Yes. I mean, well, yes, I think that the moment you just, I think that's really the only shift that needs to happen is like just what, you know, the inquiry is what's real. That's the question. What, what, what's really going on here? What's the truth? And then, you know, as much as you can, you know, don't try to, to like, don't try to avert your eyes from it or restructure it or, you know, that's, I've always, whenever I'm doing that and in the worst moments, it's not like things get better, but it's like, at least I don't have to have the anxiety that goes along with being an idiot, ignoring a being an ignorant dope or like, you know, pretending things are different than they are. I mean, fuck man, when I got cancer, I remember asking the doctor, because I had all these shows like coming up and I was like, can I, I could still do this tour, right? And the doctor looks at me and he goes, you have cancer. You can go on tour, you have cancer. You know, and it'll look on his face was a look of familiarity because he deals with people with cancer sometimes and every single person who gets cancer, they try to like, all right, well, you know, I'll just go back to work. It's like, you're, we're cutting your ball off on Tuesday. Yeah. You're not going in. So I think, you know, with COVID, that's happening where, and everyone's like, these idiots, they don't believe in it. It's like, they're not idiots. They're going through the stages of grief. Fucking denial is one of the stages and it's like, and it's real. It's real. Dude, I've heard about people, because I was like getting radiation therapy. I've heard about people who in between their radiation therapy sessions for cancer go out to their car and smoke cigarettes. You know, so the first for me, like, I love that you're saying you're Godless, because it's not, you're not denying your reality. Like you're, it's a, it's a, it's a, I mean, it certainly isn't like a pretty sounding thing to say. You know what I mean? There's not, it's not, I can't think of like, it's not exactly like these days, what you would call fashionable to announce that you're Godless. Or is it? You know what I mean? So I think it's a kind of chic. I mean, like it's always been chic to be Godless, right? Well, it's chic to be like an intellectual atheist. Exactly. But when you say Godless, you, it's a different way of saying it, because Godless is like, it implies a, an orphan quality. You know what I mean? Where like, you hear someone say, you know, I'm a scientific materialist, atheist, there's a general feeling of like, I never connected with this bullshit. Right. Whereas what you're saying is, is like, it really is. Orphans, yeah. Dad, where are you, daddy? Yeah. Daddy, where I'm Godless right now, you're lost at the mall. Yeah. You know, like, where's your, the worst, by the way, when you're a kid. Yeah. I've, I feel like I've been lost in the mall for most of my life. Yeah. I mean, that's like why you try to find daddy anyway, right? Yeah. I mean, like, yeah, like daddy had to be there to lose daddy. But, you know, a lot of it is, a lot of it is being lost in the mall for me in, in my experience, at least. I mean, how does every fucking Disney movie start? Every Disney movie for kids starts with a parent dying. Yeah. You know, because this is the human experience. Yeah. Is like, where all of us are orphans, we're on this fucking planet or sentient, that there appears to be some intentional design behind it, regardless of what, you know, very intelligent people might say. You look at the world and you're like, my God, something seems to have made this. Yeah. I certainly, everything around me that is like, that I love is made, you know, the isn't of the natural world has been constructed. And so, but nobody's writing back when you call out, when you call out. So as a species, we feel like orphans, then our parents die. Yeah. You know, I don't know, are your parents still here? Your mom's still here? Your dad? That's so crazy. For a second, I had to think, but yes, both of them. I have like, that's weird. But yes. Yeah. But you know, you know, and everyone knows. And so it's like, you know, and when I'm with my children, I have to look at them knowing that there's a truth. Yeah. You know, like we just, we had to euthanize one of our dogs and, you know, try explaining that to a two and a half year old where Piper went. Because they ask, where's Piper? Like, you know, we are out in the yard just playing and all of a sudden he starts going, Piper, Piper, Piper, Piper, Piper, where's Piper? And you have to, you know, try to explain that to them. Like my wife was a nanny for a long time. She has a great way of saying it, which is dead as fuck it. No, I'm just kidding. No, she says, no, she says Piper's body stopped working, which is true. And it's something they can understand. But how long before they draw the connection? Wait, if Piper's body stops working, well, your body stopped working. Oh, my body stopped working. And so, you know, we all are in the same boat in that regard. I mean, there is like the godlessness, the sense of disconnect is a reality. Yeah, that's real. It's also it's it's interesting to think about Disney movies because it's like, yeah, the parent dies and then they they always like find some like dumb ass friend. It's like always like a dumb fucking friend. But like, yep, the friend helps them. And like that's I kind of, yeah, maybe Disney is pretty cool, right? Oh my god. Yeah, like they figured out like this like weird tarot card progression of the hero's journey from, you know, or what? And I think an occult circles is known as crossing the abyss, which is, you know, at some point, you have to confront the reality of your inevitable, complete, total annihilation, not annihilation in the way like or the way Chuggum, Trump or Rinpoche puts it is, you can't watch your own funeral. It's not going to happen. You're you you don't get to end with the paradox of like a lot of versions of what they call enlightenment is that it's like the you that starts off wanting that thing will not be the you that becomes that thing because the that you is like a dream. It's a figment, a fragment. I mean, bodies die. Our personalities are equally. I mean, fuck, wait, you know, the godless thing. Yes, now you now keep deconstructing. You know, it's like, OK, there's there's no God. Now let's keep work. Let's keep now. Let's look at the identity itself. Where's my identity? Where am I in my body? I mean, you know, plenty of scientific materialist atheists are completely fine letting go of the idea of God. Not a lot of times I don't blame them because the symbols that they're using for it is ridiculous in a literal interpretation of of, yeah, I don't blame you. You mean an dude with a beard. Yeah. Has a course. I don't have that God either. I don't know what the fuck that is. And if I met that God, I wouldn't. I'd be like, well, I don't know. You might have. Yeah. You're not interesting to me, but but the but you know, they won't let go of their identities. Like that's the next step is like when you start becoming familiar with what you think is a you, then you realize the same thing starts happening with God that was happening with God will go all the way all the way down to wait. I don't really have a self. Where am I? What what is experiencing all of this? Where is the experiencer and and and so and that can be quite terrifying too. It's starting to are you on Tik Tok? I just did my first time. Really? Yes, dude. It is. It's really wild on there. Like it is like being in that world like going to visit that city is like it really. But it does feel like there from what I see on it, there's like five identities or like everything is being like mashed up into like compartments of identity. And like you have to kind of fit in to one of the identities and like all the language inside of the identity is the same. They're like different species. But like if you're going to be recognized by the platform, you do have to fall. You can't stray really from the algorithm or like what the identity is. So I feel like we're already like moving into a place where like identity identity to to younger people is way less of a thing or it's like way less way less individualized at least. But I'm like even like time has started to feel so weird to that when you say like you can never watch your own funeral. I'm like well like we technically probably there probably is an app or like there will be something where we can like put ourselves at our funeral. So like why is that why is that different than actually be like the reality is starting to bend inside of these these things. Yes. So yes right the like whatever the collective reality or like default reality is you know like weird seismic shifts and weird like you know I don't know ontological quakes like trembling through the zeitgeist where like yeah we do get these moments of like God I've had moments of like well what if we don't actually get to die you know like I went through a period in my life of like I don't want to die then when I went through it then I went into a period of like maybe I'll live forever and I thought that was a good thing then I got cancer. But now looking at like the technological landscape and the prognostications by very brilliant people about what's coming now I've started toying again with the idea of like wait maybe I'm not going to die only this time it's like oh no yeah maybe we're not going to die maybe like there maybe like like death is what there was a kind of like a trap door for people before us yeah all these people were able to get out but now we're the ones that have to do this forever yeah you're not getting out you're not there's no escape like and not even through like you know in um Greek mythology you at least get to drink from this river that makes you forget your identity forever. Lath is what it's called and then you're reborn but we don't get what if we don't get to do that what if we don't get to drink from the river what if our con like and you you know you and I are both in a little bit of trouble in the sense that because we've been imprinted onto the algorithm yeah and you know what I mean there's no reason why after we our physical bodies die yeah that some simulated virtual version of us isn't going to echo forever through the internet in some form or fashion I mean the real hell would be not only not getting to drink from the river but getting stuck in one identity like you have to choose that one identity and like that's it forever like there you go that's who you are no change there you go that's Jordan that's it you that point that is the one of the fundamental points in Buddhism and it's the point that like everyone who first encounters it is like I want to be this forever and and when you hear the point of like there is no permanent identity there is no permanent self there is no permanent anything a lot of people recoil because they're like no no I want to be a fixed singular thing but you get it because that is if if we were like unchanging if we weren't fundamentally impermanent it we would be in hell hell hell oh my god yeah I imagine like today if I had to do that like Jesus fucking Christ it's like the only I mean like that is the only real hope and the only real like truth is changed it's like at least like that is to me that's hope it's like who okay yeah and I mean not get better but at least it's gonna get different like undeniably it's gonna get different well you know the even better is the in that once you start you know really analyzing the identity and or what you think of as yourself where are you in your body who is the experience or who is having this experience who am I today versus who I what you know one of my friends one of my friends like was in a float tank in the basement and Tim Leary and Rom Doss were sitting next to the float tank and my friend was high as a fucking kite in this float tank and they didn't know he was in there and so he like opens the float tank and sits up and sees like Tim Leary and Rom Doss there I think they jumped because they didn't know he was in there and then Rom Doss looks at him and goes who are you now so so it's like you know this analysis of the identity is where I think and you know is where you begin to experience something called spacious this or what fundamental goodness is what it's translated into which is that actually it's the reality of our ephemeral self that is is the path that's the path that that where I I can find something real you know or at least you know something that isn't dependent on some on you know my fucking downloads of my podcast or my you know my yeah things lining up in my earth realm life or or because it doesn't have to you know if you depend on that even in the most refined way you know because god aren't the most miserable people you know the ones who have the highest expectations for everything yeah you know they're they're fucking miserable they they can't enjoy anything the the food's too cold the food's too expensive the people they're with aren't quite good enough their hair doesn't look good that day their complexion is fucked up that day they're always tormented by their inability to line up phenomena yeah my baby on the other hand dune I could take him and he could be fixating on blocks or whatever and I can pick him up and just bring him somewhere else there's no like yeah what the fuck are you doing yeah yeah yeah just pure surrender you know to his reality not to say he doesn't cry yeah and stuff not such a fan of like getting his diaper changed or like you know there's moment but I'm just saying there's a I'm sorry man if I'm going on and on too much no no no I'm I'm thinking about if I if I agree with don't like babies hate change not as much as you as I thought before I had uh not as much as I thought before I had kids it's like they need stability they need it like if my if my baby doesn't get a like naps when it's time for his nap yeah he'll get really grumpy and stuff but they're pretty surrendered they can't walk or really like yeah navigate so they have to surrender to the fact that they're always going to be being picked up and moved somewhere else there there's a there's a you should check this out when you get a chance there's a you may have already read it it's called the it's called the sin sin ming it's the writing of the third paid third chinese patriarch of zen and I'll just read a little bit to you yeah the great way the great way is not difficult for those who have no preferences when love and hate are both absent everything becomes clear and undisguised make the smallest distinction however and heaven and earth are set infinitely apart if you wish to see the truth then hold no opinions for or against anything to set up what you like against what you dislike is the disease of the mind when the deep meaning of things is not understood the mind's essential peace is disturbed to no avail I fucking love that yeah goals you know try that and yeah godless town you know like okay and it's it's it's wild man I feel like some of my worst moments have been my best moments when I've just bit managed to exercise this shit you know when I'm just sitting somewhere by myself furious dejected terrified but instead of trying to make that better or pretend it's different just being like I am furious yeah I am dejected I am terrified and somewhere in that it's like yes yeah it's the whole thing yeah yeah you get to be godless fucking enjoy it yeah I mean god forbid look god forbid god shows up again you know what I mean once god comes knocking at the door I'm gonna have to answer or even yeah I'm busy yeah yeah I read that like you yeah I enjoy my godlessness I mean I still just pray even when I'm godless though you know I still pray just because it's like well you know message in a bottle yeah what yeah or maybe god doesn't exist yet have you ever played around with that idea I mean yeah a couple of times recently like god hasn't quite come into being yet but will come into being but right now that we're like actually like the thing that we think is what people are saying with god is like actually an echo from the future not to be too weird or that it's like we've made it this thing that is like omnipresent and for and always working like maybe it takes time off like we need to take time off so like why would why would every it can't just like always be on the clock no no taking some time on vacay this last few years here's a good one Thomas Merton you would like him you know who that is Thomas Merton no he's a theologian he was a I think he's like a Jesuit priest but he wrote all these a good writer and he wrote that you know people will say look at the world look at all this horror look at all this suffering how could you say god exists with all this horror and with all this suffering and his response was look at human beings look at how vicious we are look at how cruel we are to each other look at how much technology we have to destroy each other the fact that we have not destroyed ourselves yet seems to indicate that god must exist you know like it works both ways yeah like why should we even be here at all yeah but I don't need I don't I again I whenever yeah whenever I sink into the that state of like oh there's no god it's I just will I just hang I just hang out there yeah and keep praying and keep praying you know uh yeah because who cares what's the worst what's gonna happen you'll die somebody gonna hear me pray and be like there is no in there you were wrong that's gonna be me that's gonna be me yelling at you loser then where are you yelling me when I'm after I've died I'm like well something's here Jordan let's do a fucking podcast on the other side oh my god if there's recording equipment and you know yeah I think yeah well you know to be honest you seem like you're a little too hard on yourself Jordan first man you seem a little too hard on yourself maybe so maybe so I I can also laugh and have a good time though you know I believe you you're very fine for one I think you're very funny I think you are a comedian I think that um you're not on the decline whether you and again this is my I'm not trying to put lipstick on the thing at all uh and I but more the more importantly it does seem like you've just you're like you're you might be being a little too hard on yourself I think so I think so and I uh I'm okay with it I have to be okay look there is something hot in it you know the fucking scarlet letter when that dude's whipping himself with a belt isn't that kind of fucking hot you know what I mean like like there's something super sexy about like whipping yourself by yourself self-flagellation is like it's just you know and in particular when you're doing it for some patriarchal god I could see how there's something like hot in that but it's like if you are going to self-flagellate um look like I I think just be very familiar with who's flagellating and who's being flagellated yeah you know what I mean like yeah like like you know it is a curious thing that we can be hard on ourselves yeah you know what I mean because then like there's the part that's being hard and then there's the part that's being attacked you know and those two things like are really the same fucking thing it's a very bizarre situation and once they come into one like that's kind of easier when the attacker and the attack you know come together especially it's easier to do when they're both you like if you're attack if you're if you're up against another force like you're gonna probably have to fight or reach some sort of agreement but when they are the same being like hopefully it would be easier to come together and make peace yeah I mean I think what you just said is the way to do it I'm fine with it yeah it's like the whole game gets fucked at that moment the whole game falls apart I mean like the whole flagellation can't work if you're fine with it yeah it's not flagellation yeah no if no one's gonna hurt then what's the point well that's why we pay our dominatrixes but it's definitely not like anyone who's going to a dominatrix isn't like actually no I really want you to like actually not let me go yeah don't release me and hurt me I'm sure there's one or two yeah yeah Jordan I could talk to you forever man will you will you come back on the podcast please so we could continue this conversation babe come on I you know you're you're you mean oh what's going on are they they're coming for you man I I'm telling you this is a recurrent theme of my podcast because like I live I live down the street I did my studio must be near like the most fucked up person in Asheville because like fire trucks every day just goes soaring down my street so I don't know what's happening yeah something I'm tempted to one day just post up and follow them to see where they're going there's a Chipotle down there that's my cynical idea it's like it's lunch break for the Asheville fire department you must come back we have to keep this dialogue going I love it man I I really love your honesty and I'm like I'm gonna spend the rest of the day being godless and I'm excited about it I'm gonna gonna walk around for the rest of the day just experiencing that godlessness if I

It's me, Duncan, and this is the Duncan Trussell Family Hour Podcast. And today, I have a very special guest. I don't know if the DTFH would even exist, if not for Natasha Leggero. We started podcasting together long before anyone thought that podcasts would ever be a thing. If you're a purple pope, you already know that we had a podcast called The Lavender Hour. We went separate podcasting ways. And now Natasha and Mosha Kasher, her brilliantly funny husband, have an awesome podcast called The Endless Honeymoon Podcast, which I hope you'll subscribe to. Also, Natasha just wrote an incredibly funny book called The World Deserves My Children. It's available now wherever you might look for books. The audiobook is narrated by her and Mosha. I love audiobooks, so I'd say just order both of them. Before we jump into the episode, I'd love to invite you to join my Patreon. It's patreon.com forward slash DTFH. When you sign up, you're going to have access to commercial free episodes of the DTFH. If you want, you can also hang out with us twice a week. We've got a family gathering and a meditation just about every week. But even better, you can connect with the thriving, brilliant community that is the DTFH family. That's a discord server away from your sweet, sweet eyeballs and fingers. If you're a YouTube person, I'm excited to announce that pretty soon you'll be able to listen to episodes of the DTFH on YouTube and also video episodes are on the way. But it's going to take some time. I'm still working on my studio. It's very difficult to get marble spider sculptures from the quarry that has the type of marble that I'm interested in, but it's coming soon. And now, everybody, please welcome back to the DTFH Natasha Leggero. Welcome, welcome on you, that you are with us. Shake hands, no need to be blue. Welcome to you. Natasha, welcome back. It's so nice to see you again. How you doing? You're out there in New York promoting your new book. Congratulations. What an accomplishment. You know, I'm staying at this hotel and I was like, I've been here before. And then I'm like, wait, this is the old Trump Towers. Like it used to be like the Trump Soho and now they just slapped another name on it. But then when I'm calling people from the hotel, they're saying it says Trump on it. And I bet he still owns it. Oh my God, of course he does. Yeah, he definitely does. Is it nice? But is it a nice hotel? That's all that matters. It's so nice. It's like so much taller than every building in Soho. And you get to see like the entire city. It's insane. But I don't want to get a freak plug. How glamorous, how incredible to be in some nice hotel, promoting your first book. I mean, writing a book, what an accomplishment. That alone must feel so good to know you have it in you, to write a book. You know, everyone keeps saying that. But don't you feel like life, you're just always kind of chugging away? Yes. Yeah. It never, it's really hard to take that time to stop and like appreciate anything. I want to learn how to do that. Maybe I should try to meditate like you. Well, I mean, maybe I should try to learn to meditate once a week like you. Once a week ain't bad. I mean, the more you meditate, the less like all the hangups about it start falling away. Even if it is sporadic, it takes your relationship with it goes from being another thing you use to make yourself feel bad to something a little lighter than that. You know, like meditation should not be, you shouldn't add that to the list of things you didn't do. You know, it's your friend. So it's just something that's there for you. Not something to whip your back with. There's plenty of other things that you're not doing that you should feel bad about, not meditation. Do you think anyone, do you think anyone doesn't whip their back? Yeah, totally. You could stop. You actually don't have to keep whipping your back. It's so great. It's like, it's so exciting about life is that if you don't want to keep like, if you're, if you're, you know, your belt is growing thin or your arm is sore or your back is just the calluses or you can't even feel it anymore. You could actually just stop doing it. It's pretty awesome. Yeah. Have you? Oh, no, I, I still get myself a firm lashing here and there, but definitely, you know, much less than I used to, you know, it's, yeah, I have, you know, I only, I only whipped myself like in the mornings before, but I, I, but it's, you know, if I do give myself a lashing, it's a lot softer than it used to be. And I don't know if that's part of getting old. Maybe your, your arms weaker. So you can't quite get the like snap in that you used to. But I think it's a, I think it's a possibility that you don't have to always do that as much. What about you? Are you still whipping your back? Oh yeah. All the time, every time I look in the mirror, every time I do a press thing, it's like, it's very hard to, to not do, I mean, I also, you know, I don't do it constantly, but it definitely is in the loop of what my brain does naturally, I think. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's a habit. It's a, just a habit. It's like any other habit, no big deal. Habits can seem so intense and like, Oh my God, that's who I am. But yeah, it's just a habit. People are just habituated to like, you know, they internalized one parent or the other, usually. And then that whatever that little pattern is just repeats every single day, like it used to when you're a kid, it's just part of the thing. But yeah, it's just a habit. It's like no different from any other addiction. Yeah. Our kids don't do it. Exactly. I mean, that's what's so great about having kids is usually like watching a being that has yet to internalize whatever neurotic patterns they're going to like pick up from you. So it's like, it's cool to see the blank slate and like what that looks like. It's wonderful. I know. And you have written a lovely book about parenting and being a new parent and well, it's funny because on this book tour, I was going to tell you, I keep quoting your mom because the story of my, you know, I, you know, you kind of have your thing that you're saying in all the press. And, you know, one of the things I remember is like your mom saying, you know, it's the most it's that you love this thing so much. It's like you are cracked open, you know. And yeah, and it's just this like amazing love. And so as I quote her, I say, I say that, but then I, you know, people would always say, and it wasn't just your mom, but I remember your mom had a very specific thing, you know, that I just said, but yeah, what people don't tell you is that you could almost as easily replace love with fear, at least for me as a, as a mom, like you will never, when they say you'll never know the kind of love that you get from a kid. Like you could replace that with fear. And it really is true because I was someone who just had like so much joie de vivre. And I would just go to, go to Paris, go to Africa, you know, last minute, you guys want to come to Thailand for some stage time and free shrimp. And, you know, oh, hey, white water rafting with no helmet. You know, I would just do anything. I was down for it all. And now, you know, all of a sudden, I'm not like that anymore. And, you know, this book is like a lot of me examining like, who is the pre-motherhood? Natasha, how can I get back to her? But then, you know, you think about it, because I wrote this book for many years, for three years, because there was the pandemic and then there was a paper shortage. And there was just like a lot of things that kind of slowed it down. But I started to realize like we don't have kids to stay the same. And maybe it's not about getting back to your pre-motherhood days, you know? It's how do you integrate it? And especially people like me and you who are having kids later in life when our lives are more fully formed and these kids are joining our, you know, fully made lives. So it's a different thing than when our parents sort of were just like, you know, would meet some guy, have kids, and then realize that was the wrong guy, and then get divorced, you know? I mean, I didn't even know people who didn't have a second family. Right. Yeah, divorce boom. Yeah. Well, you know, also, you know, within that was like, there was this sort of, I think in our parents, this frivolity, this like a real kind of cultural selfishness that appeared for a while as a kind of trend, which is, you know, just divorce. I mean, if it's not working out for you, just get a divorce. You think that's frivolity? Absolutely. Yeah. I mean, my mom was getting backhanded. Well, that's no, that's different. I don't mean that. I don't mean that. And I don't mean all the people who were like, we're in abusive, like truly abusive, brutal situations. Those, you got to get out. No question about it. But I do think that some people in their marriages applied the same kind of philosophy in their marriages, they did a dating, you know, the same thing of like, oh, shit, like, you know, when the person sees your shadow and you see their shadow, you know, instead of like, oh, you're out. Kids are, no, I'm out and not the, but, but, you know, sometimes the shadow is slapping you in which case it's like, no, I'm out. Like you got to get out. So I don't mean like, no, stay no matter what. That's crazy. Only lunatics do that. You're saying that you, you think that some people could like have been less selfish. And I mean, of course I would love to like go to bars in New York and have sex with anybody I want and like do my thing. It's like, but you have this like responsibility to your family to like, yeah, you know, or Moshe, he wanted to go to Burning Man and open up our relationship. And I'm like, no, we're not going to, you know, and I think we figured out that must have been a rough conversation. Well, I know what you mean though. It's like, it is easier to just be like, if you didn't have kids, everything would be easier. And that's, that's what I'm saying is like, people equate easiness with good. Like that, well, that's what, that's desirable. Easy is desirable. Easy. Isn't that what you want? Easy. And I understand that. And I, you know, I think that if you, like both of us got to experience so much of that easiness that at some point you realize that, that you're something, you're not getting the whole picture here. You're just getting part of the picture, part of the picture of like, Oh my God, I can go to wherever I can go to Costa Rica or go to the bird, go to Burning Man or go to this or that of all the stuff. And you can get incredibly hedonistic and you start like just going for it all the time. You think you're going for it, but you know, whatever that is, when you achieve the peak of the, you know, your, it's the peak of the thing, whatever your dream was, you start realizing like, Oh, this is, this doesn't really feel like much. And that's, you know, then what, then what, you know, so I think, you know, I don't know if you've ever heard this before, but I, and I don't know if it's true for any, I don't, what do you call some new study snakes Natasha? Oh my God, I don't know. Anyway, a goth, I think you call them a goth, but the, is that a joke? That's a bad joke. The, you know, not goths, always have snakes. But if they say, if a snake half sheds its skin, it dies. If a snake doesn't shed its skin, it dies. Like it has to shed its skin. And becoming a parent is for sure the shedding of a skin. Like you got to get that, you have to let go of that. It's torture at first to say, you know, especially if you manage to have some kind of like intense freedom and intense lack of schedule or an intense like autonomy, you know, it's easy in the midst of all the things that suddenly you have to deal with. And your single friends be like, well, you want to come out tonight? You're like, what are you talking about? I can't come out. You think I can just come out? I had a baby said, what are you talking about? It hurts. It hurts until you really let it go. And then it's, it's not that it makes it easier, but at least you don't have that ache of what could have happened. How do you let it go? How do you let it go? That's a really good question. I think at first by acknowledging that you're hurting because you're missing your old life, not feeling guilty about that, making sense. Like, of course, I'm missing the old life, you know, but then it's not even that I miss my old life. I miss the person who wasn't like constantly thinking of what the worst thing could happen for a child and making sure to take all of the steps to make sure it didn't happen. I mean, that takes a lot of mental energy. And granted, we're just coming out of like global trauma. So, you know, I think that really made it way worse for me. Yes. And I think this is a, I mean, I don't, I don't want to get into something like gender discussion, but, you know, in my observation of Aaron versus me, I do feel like the mother, you know, the children go to Aaron when they're really sick, you know, it's like, and I remember when I was a kid, going to my mom when I was really sick, you know, not my dad. It wasn't my dad that I was seeking the motherly, maternal love from in those situations. And I don't know if that's, I'm sure that's not across the board, but I think it makes me think that being, like clearly being a mother, physically, just physically is like so much more intense than being a dad. Like, we just have to come. You've got to turn. And it's your favorite thing to do. Exactly. We just do our favorite thing. And then, and then, and then you have to like physically just get torn apart. Permanently sometimes. Gravaged, degraded, degraded. Yes. Yes. And, and, and we just, we have to like, you know, watch this happen and, you know, try to support if we can, but there's just no way around. It's like, I'm sorry, but me going to like CVS to get Aaron the many things she might need during pregnancy or post pregnancy is never going to be the same is watching my body warp itself in all that combined with the responsibility. Like you have a beating heart in your stomach. The most, you know, the responsibility to keep that part just that alone. I mean, not even talking then it comes out, you know, and the stakes are just so high. And I don't, you know, you can always get another boyfriend, get another husband, but it's like the stakes are just like incredibly high. The highest. I mean, the highest on every level, right? I mean, the socially high. Is there any like, you know, they at the end of when someone passes away, regardless of their accomplishments, if somewhere in there you hear, and they were a rotten dad, rotten mom, you remember the rotten mom, you remember the rotten dad before you remember whatever other shit they did. It's so, so it's such a sacred thing to suddenly find yourself in this situation. So, so sacred and important and real. But also, I mean, aren't people doing the best they can? You know, it's like, it's like, or maybe they're not. I think they are. I like that you said that. I think they are. I think that's and do you find that like being a parent has sort of shifted your way of thinking about your parents and your childhood? Well, you know, I think it's such I am having such a different experience than my mom. My mom had me when she was 23. And then she had two more kids like immediately after that, and had an abuse of husband. And then, you know, the relationship dissolved by the time I was four. And my, you know, brothers were younger than me. And then she was just alone, as opposed to, you know, alone with no degree, no job, three kids abused, you know, I'm like someone who's in their prime at the in, you know, I was able and that's what's so cool right now for women. And I just really am trying to get the word out. And, you know, I know people know about freezing your eggs and 38 is kind of the cutoff for, for egg freezing. But, you know, I was able to have two more decades than my mom. I had my baby at 43 to like my peak earning years, my peak having fun years, my peak, you know, getting to know myself years. And then I'm able to have the baby. So, you know, and that's because of technology, which I thought I hated. But, you know, I think this, this is like really great technology because it's just going to keep more women in the workforce and more women, you know, hiring people and more women creating. And, you know, the more we have women in power and in creative positions, the more, you know, just the better society is.

I'm really happy that I was able to just, I mean, I know this sounds cliche, but you know, have it all in a way, even though I am feeling like very haggard. Well, you don't seem haggard, Natasha. But it's exhausting. I mean, you're in like a, you're in a power couple. You're both professional comics. There's so much time that has to be invested into that pursuit. And, you know, adding to that this incredible responsibility of raising a kid, how are you balancing? How are you finding the balance there? Well, I definitely made a decision that I was only going to have one kid. And, you know, because I barely wanted one. And then when I had one, well, Moshe is like best friends with his brother. So he was always like, we have to have two kids so they can be friends. That's right. I don't know where I'd be without my brother. But, you know, I, I really just kept telling him no. I go, unless you want to be the point person, I'm good with one. And, you know, I grew up with a sibling that would kind of ruined our family almost in a way. Like he was like a bad child and caused a lot of pain and a lot of stress and pretty much traumatized our whole childhood. You know, it was all about him all the time. And then my mom was just always upset. So I think that for me, I'm kind of scarred by that. And I have one amazing child who's so cute and sweet. I mean, granted, she's only four, but that's good. And then I can travel lightly and I can like go to Japan with her if I want to, or if I need to take her into a green room. I mean, you can't take three kids into a green room. You can if you're Jim Gaffigan. Does he do that? I don't know. But it seems like probably at some point, I'm sure he took his beautiful family into a green room. I don't know. But yeah, so it's like you have found your own sort of like what works for you and what you want. It's wonderful. You know, it's, I love that. It's very empowered. You've always been like that. That's great. Well, thank you. I heard this quote. I don't remember who said it, but they said, one is an accessory, two is a lifestyle. And I do feel, I do feel with one, I can just move, move through the world in a way that's not going to totally overpower me. Right. You still like, you know, you still and like, I think that sort of like, like that's a big part of it, right? It's like looking at what is the dynamic here? You know, what's going on with my particular tribe? How does it work? What does it work? And if I think if you, if you have a sort of modern situation happening where like both parents are professionals, it's, you know, don't lie to yourself about, you know, what's going to happen when you have another kid or another one or whatever. Like, you have to like be very honest with yourself about that. That's good that you were able to say no in that situation, knowing like, look, who does this? Who's going to do this? You're working, I'm working. How does it work with another one? That's good. As soon as I, as soon as I had the baby, I went to the dentist and he was like, you need to have another one now. One child is not a family. Fuck you. Just clean my teeth. Fuck, go fuck, fuck you. Who asked you? But I will say like, you know, just like thinking about having to like pack the lunches and feed them breakfast and, you know, make dinner every night and it's like, and clean the house and have a career. It's like, it's so much to do all the time. It really makes me question like why we all live in these individual houses with just our family. Like, we should all be buying like acres of land. I'm not saying we all need to live together, but like, wouldn't it be amazing to live with like four or five families on like a few acres? And then there's like a mess hall and then like each person makes dinner like once a week or something. Right. And then there's a place for all the kids to play. There's a gun range. Right. This is how Nexium starts. There's a bunker. Yeah. There's a bunker. There's a father figure, you know, not like it's great that you have the individual dads, but nice. It would be nice to have a representative for all the dads. You could call them father, maybe a mother figure for all the moms you call her mother. And then those confusing moments, they tell you the right thing to do. That would be wonderful to have that. Yeah. That would be wonderful. I know what you mean. I mean, you know, it's very, it's a lot of pressure. It's like so much every day for one person. And it's like, I don't know, during the pandemic, we potted with another family and we would, we had like everyone would make dinner one night, you know, and then it was just like, and then the kids would all play together. I don't know. It just felt like I wish we could live. I mean, it started to get, you know, hard to do that. Yeah. No, when you were telling me about that, honestly, I was just thinking that that looks like hell on earth. I don't want to pod. I don't want to pod with the Gibson's or whoever. No, thanks. I appreciate the like the y'all try that. But I do know what you mean. I mean, like the, you know, it's wasteful. It's wasteful. But also you sort of like, and like, I think there's all these like, like hard, depending on how you erase, there's all these like really intense lessons the child brings you, not through like telling you stuff, but just through experientially, all the stuff you always heard that if you're a single person or you're just dating or whatever, you can kind of like shrug off like the importance of community, you know, the, the importance of connections to your family, the all these things that are like really old ideals of like how to live suddenly become so important because you can't do it by yourself and you can't outsource everything. Like your kids need, you know, some contact with family members, some sense of like a wider circumference than just, you know, you and your partner. So yeah, I know what you mean. Like, and I, you know, I feel, I've felt the call of the commune before it's just, I just couldn't do it. I couldn't do it. It'll be rotten. I just couldn't do it. I don't know how you guys did. How long did you pod for? Oh, just a couple months. Oh, I couldn't do it. Did you think the pandemic made you guys closer as a family because you spent because I was definitely planning on outsourcing at least 40 to 50 hours a week to a nanny so I could work because my kid wasn't in school then. But then when the pandemic happened, we all of a sudden were all together all the time and, you know, eating lunch at the dining room table every day for a year and a half or two years, I mean, and dinner and breakfast. It's like, yeah, it's so much, but I do think it really made us closer and for sure in a way that's that is like palpable and also is going to last. Yeah, you it was a forge in it. And you know, it either broke relationships or it like turned them into some kind of meteorite. You know, it's like, we got through that together. We did it. And it wasn't easy. And there were, I don't know about you two, but fuck, it's not like it was smooth sailing all the way through. It wasn't smooth at all. I was like in my office just googling like every single, you know, article reading everything I could because there was no one telling you what to do. So you had to like study science and aerosol BPMs or whatever. Like I was just like constantly stressing. Yeah. So you have this like, you know, once in a generation event mixed in with a once in a lifetime event mixed, you know, all the stressors of just, you know, new kid, new parents, combined with isolation, combined with social disruption. I mean, you know, one of the, one of the, when we are in, before we left LA, we're living this, thank God, we got so lucky. We're in this wonderful little compound yard, a pool. You're so lucky. And, but you know, one of the nannies, we had a nanny who, because LA was like so insane. She like was like telling us that I can't remember where she was from, but she was like telling us that she'd left that place because it had gotten too dangerous. And now she was in a place that felt the same way. And she was showing us where the like parts of the fence surrounding our house could be compromised and like wrapping rope and chain around it to lock it up. That was our, well, don't you remember? Like when LA really started, like when all the encampments sprung up and like Skid Row, Master, how do you say it? Masterized? When Skid Row spread through the whole city and the, you know, there would be these fires from the encampments under the, just, you know, burning into the sky. And there were all the protests and all the like, it was insane there for a second. It was insane. And then earthquakes, it felt so apocalyptic. Oh, and remember we had a curfew? And the curfew. And we didn't know what it was at first. That was the other thing. It's like, what is it? Is it smallpox? What's the fatality rate of this fucking thing? What is it? Like, it was terrible. Is it on your groceries? Like, what is, it was so confusing. So there was just this perfect recipe, wasn't there, for like, for not making things work in a relationship with a new kid? It was the perfect recipe to shatter a relationship. I know. I know a lot of people who've got divorced. Yeah. I mean, it's like, just day to day lives hard enough. But suddenly you're in the walking dead. Like, my God, my God, my God, but you guys did it. It's over. It's over. It's over. Yeah, it's over. And we learned a lot of stuff. And so, okay. Oh, you know, it's really bad though. Our kids weren't even that traumatized. I think like, imagine a fifth grader who's now in like, a freshman in high school, and they just missed middle school. Or a sixth grader, you know, it's like, my whole personality was developed in middle school. There's people who missed a lot of high school, like three years of high school. And then one year of remote high school, it's like, they barely went to high school. You know, I just can't even imagine how kinky these generations are going to be like, it's gonna be why? Well, because like, you know, within the pandemic, there was like a kind of like a medical BDSM happening. You know what I mean? Like all these restrictions and you had to wear some shit on your face. And like, you know what I mean? Wait, you think that like, oh, because like, right, my friend who is a dominatrix told me that like, her husband was into boots, because he used to live in Chicago, where all his mom's friends would come over in their boots, right when he was starting to get hard on and jerk off. There you go. Like for him, he likes boots. And like, he wants like, boots to be stepping on him. He wants to see them. He wants to touch them. So you think that it's like, because when people were coming of their sexual age, they had to like cover their face. Yeah, they're gonna want like a ball gag in there. Oh yeah. Oh yeah, I feel so sorry for nurses. I feel so sorry for anyone who has to like professionally wear a mask. You know what I mean? Like there's gonna be a lot of dentists. There's gonna be a lot of like doctors who are like trying to do their work and like just like, weird 20 some things with like, obvious erections. Or like, I'm sorry, I just I don't know why but the masks just turn me on. Yo, it's going to be that. Our next partner has a product that I love.

There's going to be a lot of dentists. There's going to be a lot of doctors who are trying to do their work in weird 20-somethings with obvious erections. I'm sorry. I don't know why, but the masks just turn me on. It's going to be that. Truly, we can't even imagine. That is crazy, Duncan. Only you could think of something like that. Look, it's coming. I mean, not only that, here's the other thing I've thought of, and I'd love to hear what you predict these generations are going to be up to, but the other thing I know is going to happen. Remember how the 80s parties, which I always hated, people would have those fucking 80s parties? Hated 80s parties. There's going to be pandemic parties when the thing is kind of a distant memory where you come in, there's a fake COVID test or something, and some of them are set to test positive. If you test positive, you've got to go into quarantine. You know what's going to happen, Natasha? What do you predict is coming? Well, I wanted to ask you that, actually, because part of writing my book is the world deserves my children because only the idiots, you can't just let the idiots have kids. We need to create, because I was thinking, as I wrote it, I had read before, there's certain cultures that have kids not for this generation, but for five generations in the future, and they're thinking of way in advance. If you think about it like that, even though there is going to be coastal change in our kids' lifetime, and there's racial inequality and nuclear war, and the robots are coming, there's endless things to be worried about, it still is like, okay, but you can't just let the idiots have kids. What's going to happen to the world? But then I start thinking, isn't that a lot of pressure to put on our kids? Wait, so they're just supposed to be the liberal warriors that save us from the only people who believe in science? When I was a kid, I just wanted to make out with my boyfriend and listen to music and climb out of my bedroom window. Well, I think we got a drop. I think this is the problem. Here's a problem. It all could be true, and if that's not our kid's job, you're pressuring them with all that shit for one. It's like, that's not going to help anything. Exactly what you're saying. It's important to get that for them to have their childhoods and get to be unencumbered by adult, the burden, some realities of living on a planet, and this is a very unstable situation on this planet through history. It's been unstable. I think you and I had a nice run. We got a nice run, but if you sort of look historically at what's been going on here, it's always fucked up. There's world wars, civil wars, bubonic plague, mini ice ages, all kinds of like, you know. But isn't global warming getting worse and isn't nuclear war becoming more of a possible reality? Nuclear war is the same, I think, possibility. The moment we figured out a split, the Adam and decided to drop nukes on Japan, we opened up a Pandora's box that will never close. It's always there, always there in the background. Along with, I mean, everyone's like, oh, fuck, that nuclear war thing. It's like, you don't even know what they've got now. They figured out how to split the Adam and invent those bombs in secret. You think they'd stopped all of a sudden? They're like, okay, let's stop trying to make super advanced weapons that give us global dominance and make us a superpower. They didn't stop. They're still working on shit. Who knows what? So not only is the weapons we know we should be afraid of, it's the weapons we don't know we should be afraid of. As far as like climate change goes, my God, just look back. I was just reading about this. I can't remember when it was. There was one summer, I don't remember the year, where it wasn't summer. It was winter everywhere because I think of a volcanic eruption just threw ash into the air and like cooled everything down. I mean, and also I just finished watching Graham Hancock's ancient apocalypse, which is so good on Netflix, sort of like pointing out this like time, I think 11,800 years ago when like sea levels rose instantaneously and then everything froze because of a theoretical meteor impact, which hit the Greenland ice sheet. So I think like regardless of current carbon emissions and all that, even if like everyone just you snap their fingers, all the cars become non-carbon emitting cars, all the environmental stuff went away. The oil executives all like drink ayahuasca and they're like, I'm not doing this anymore. And we figured out how to turn plastics into like something that we could grow food, like regardless, no matter what, like if you sort of look at the history of planet earth, it's constantly getting smashed with meteors and unknown chaos variables that shift everything. So the narrative, I've got, I've got something. Okay, go ahead. Wrap it up. I'm sorry for the narrative of we are the saviors of the earth. And now is the time is always been the narrative, no matter what, if you were born on planet earth, that is part of the reality is if you're an adult, yeah, it's your job, you've got to drive the bad news, you can't sit in the back of the bus anymore. But I don't think it's a new, it's not new. I think we've been, this is the story of being an adult, isn't it? Like you've got your, now you're, everyone is looking at you now. Okay, what do we do? Isn't late stage capitalism new? Well, I mean, you mean you're talking about like the, the realities of the money shifting into the like the way that the people were like figuring out how the game works and then sucking all the money up into the like one percent or whatever. Yes. Yeah, no, I don't think it's new at all. I just think those people used to. I mean, it definitely happened during the Gilded Age. I used to study the Gilded Age, but then they, they didn't have income tax. So they took, you know, so then they gave income tax, everyone had to give up all their mansions because there was no way you could have 45 servants and, you know, these like massive homes without having these indentured people working for you for no money and then making all the money to have no income tax. But then, then every all this, what's happening now with Silicon Valley is that they just figured out how to, you know, not pay income tax again, but quote legally. And there's just people whose jobs, people go to college to figure out how to consult people to not have to legally pay income tax. Well, I mean, income tax used to be called a tithe to the church that you had to do or to your king. I mean, there's always been kings. There's always been queens. There's always been some ruling class that has all the power and the difference now, I think in capitalism versus other times is that there's even this sense of that we like that doesn't seem right. If you say that out loud, this seems fucked up. And you're not immediately thrown in a dungeon and tortured on a machine. So I think that's really good. And, you know, as far as like, you know, bashing capitalism or whatever, is it capitalism this fucked up? Or is it like, what happens when, you know, taxes start going to insane nonsense projects, you know, like the military industrial complex or, you know what I mean, where it's like, not only are you having to pay this amount of this, this thing, but the thing you're paying is either going towards like insanely expensive social programs that don't make any, you know, like, how does it cost that much money to put someone in a tiny house? You know what I mean? Where you're looking at like the amount of like, it's like the health insurance, you know, we're like, come on, stitches cost 50 grand. Like, what are you fucking talking about? That's obviously bullshit. So I think it's a combination of things. I mean, I'm not denying that like, right now we face a series of rotten problems that you could say are relatively new AI specifically, if you ask me, but oh, that's pretty new. Yeah, Duncan, how can you say that's not a threat that that wasn't around during Rome? No, that was not around during Rome. I mean, but you know, whatever it is all of Rome, but what what I think, you know, within the sort of frenzy that people are getting into these days, you know, a lot of it being generated by like, on purpose by PR firms who want to like, fan the flames of this or that, you know, it's to like, get people upset if you get them upset, they'll buy this product over that product, also with branding, especially like, you know, people seem to have forgotten that corporations are generally ethically neutral, they just attach themselves to social movements to like, try to make more money. So which produces a sense of a consensus that isn't even there. That's about my theory anyway. I think corporations are neutral. And so they attach themselves to agendas, but then what? Yeah, corporations are neutral. They do market analysis to find out what particular demographic isn't buying their product. They figure out what the ethics of that particular immortality or whatever the aspects of that particular demographic are, then they chameleon themselves to seem like that demographic, so that buying Charmin doesn't just mean that you want toilet paper. It also means that you don't like oil executives or whatever, you know, like, it's it's branding, you know, so I know every oil executive has on their Instagram page, like, is their main bio like, we are dedicated to helping the environment. Yeah, exactly. And it goes into war too, it goes into government. So it's like, you know, it's like, you know, suddenly it's like, wait, why isn't the flag of Ukraine on your Twitter handle? What does that say about you? You know what I mean? And it's like, you know, no matter what, if you if you put that flag up, you're basically like supporting like weapons manufacturers, there's no way around it, like you put that flag up, and you're like, not only do I support how the freedom of the Ukrainian people and how awful it is that they got invaded by that fucking rotten monster, but also Lockheed Martin, they're a pretty great company. They're doing great things for the world. You know, it just accidentally benefits people who have so much money from killing people. So, you know, and people seem to be forgetting that all of this stuff is being engineered. Like, you know, if you've ever gotten a publicist, you and you see through the veil of like how it really works, what you think Lockheed Martin doesn't have publicists, you think the Republican Party doesn't have publicists, the Democrats don't have publicists, you like all the Halliburton doesn't have publicists, the cigarette companies don't have public they all have publicists who like try to like shift social conversations so people will buy more whatever. That's we should just take a year without buying. Yeah, yes, yes, just don't fucking buy anything anymore. Everyone that that is our real power, just stop buying shit. But we don't we disagree with each other. We think we're so different. That's the problem, isn't it? That thing you told me the other day, I can't stop thinking about what the power versus the compassion. Oh, right. Power versus compassion. My God, it's such a mess. It's like, everyone's all defend. Don't you think everyone's just so defensive right now, Natasha? Like everyone's just fully on like, what is it that lunatic said about Kanye? I'm death con three or whatever he said. What did he say? Death con three Kanye losing his fucking mind. Yeah, everyone's on death con three or four. Everyone's like, got there like force fields up. Have you explained that thing before? No. I don't think I've talked about the compassion versus power thing. But come on, this is, I'm supposed to be interviewing you, Natasha. We've barely even talked about your book. I'm over here rambling. I had too much coffee. I mean, I just, you know, I like to talk to you whenever. So well, am I trying to lead the conversation? No, I like it. To me, I try to like get underneath all of the stuff that is whirling through my head, that is coming there because of whatever my data sources are that produces a sense of us and them. So what is the sort of, what are we contending with? It's like historically and universally the same, which is old age, disease and death. If you take on human birth, you're going to die. And your kids, if you're lucky, will have to bury you. And that's what's really happening. No matter what, that's the thing, meaning everyone, everyone, the idiots giving birth, as you say, or the non idiots giving birth, the most powerful people or the most impoverished people, what are they all going to common? You know, what are they going to die? They're all going to die. They're all going to get old. And they all love their kids more than anything in the world. And they all want their kids to be okay. That's what everyone has in common. That's, and their mothers love them so much. That's what everyone has in common. And that's why in Tibetan, Buddhism, the way into compassion starts with the mother, by like applying this cosmology in which we've been reincarnating so long that everyone has been everyone's mother. And so that when you're get buying food and you see the cashier, instead of just this is the person who like puts, runs the food through, this was my mom at some point in the vast infinite. And you look at them and you try to see your mom in them. And I know if you have a contentious relationship with your mom, as many do, you still love your fucking mom. You did when you, before you like understood anything. So you plug into that, and then suddenly it's not a them anymore. It's your mom, you know? So that's compassion. But if you don't see that in somebody, suddenly they're an enemy. It's like, Oh, these motherfuckers, what the fuck? Why are they wearing a mask? The pandemic's over. Why aren't they wearing a mask? Don't they know the pandemic's not over? You know what I mean? And then you're like, Ah, we got to get them. They're going to get us. And then, you know, so that's power versus compassion. Yeah, it's hard to imagine wanting anyone to do anything, like wanting someone to be a religion, wanting someone to get an abortion or not get an abortion or wanting to control someone. It's so confusing. Well, I mean, look, I'm sure you, at some point, thought to yourself, you know, if I could just make everybody better, then my life would be easier, you know, like if only or certain people better. Right. Right. You start thinking that like, my God, why won't that person just act like this? If they acted like that, then I would feel so much better. Because you're, I do, I mean, I'm speaking from my own dumb experience, you know, where you're like, especially, you know, when you're in a family, right? And it's easy to think, Oh my God, why is she doing that? I just look at that. I can't believe she's doing that. And she might be looking at you going, why, why are you doing that? What the, what is that? You know, it's so easy in a marriage to like do that. Whoa, well, she's wrong. I'm right. And you know, any, like I had this Zen, this wonderful Zen Buddhist teacher on my podcast, and he was like, you just have to start losing more. Like I have to lose. You got to start losing. Stop trying to win everything. You know, stop winning. Have you? Yes. I love it too. It's the best. It's the biggest relief when you just stop blaming other people for why you're being an asshole. I don't know. You know, that's, to me, that's where compassion really starts is you're like, it's not their fault. Like if you're being a dick, you're being a dick because you decided to be a dick, you know, not because of like somebody did this or that, like you chose to be aggressive. It's a choice to be aggressive. If you ask me, that's power, power and aggression. It's also testosterone running through your body and like just instinct. And isn't it? It takes a lot of self-reliance to like, to just be like, okay, I'm going to let myself lose. I mean, with Moshe, my husband, he like is in Facebook argument groups just for sport. He loves arguing. And it's exhausting. It's, some people love that. It's like a chess or something. There is a, there, I'm really into this like, these, these sayings in Buddhism, the lojong sayings, there's like, some of them I remember, some of them I can't. But, and I shift in my contemplation of them. And currently, the one I think about the most is, take all blames into yourself. So, I mean, just stop blaming other people. Take it into yourself. Even if someone around you is being just particularly rotten, stop blaming them for how you're feeling. Can I tell you one thing, Duncan, before you continue? Please stop me. It's your, I'm supposed to be interviewing you. This is how women feel all the time. Wow. I mean, not, obviously not every woman, but I'm just saying sometimes as a woman, you want to like, you're trying to fight against that because that's just your, like, my kid's teacher was like, you know, she keeps saying sorry all the time. Even when she doesn't do anything wrong, she's just saying sorry or for, she puts her hat on wrong. She's like, sorry. And she's just saying constantly apologizing. And the teacher actually said to me, and she's probably getting it from you. And she's like, do you do that? And I was like, yeah, I must. And I started watching myself. And then I started witnessing my daughter and we'd be on her bike. And then every time she would like, you know, not do the break, right? She'd be like, sorry, sorry, sorry. And, you know, it's a very female thing. Well, that's, you know, this is a little different than that. Taking all the blames into yourself does not mean that if somebody like, you know, I don't know, throws a Molotov cocktail into your window, you're like, sorry. Yeah, I threw the Molotov cocktail myself. You know, it doesn't, it doesn't imply like passivity in the face of reality or certainly not like pandering or dishonesty or like, you know, sort of like apologizing when you don't mean it. But it's more along the lines of you're responsible for how you choose to act. No one else is. And that's what you have control over. Nobody else has control over that. So the habitual reactions to stressful situations that are often aggressive that you, that any human does, you don't have to, you don't have to do that. What happens if you don't? And, you know, as someone who is like really habituated himself to being an asshole and being aggressive and thinking anger is a justified means of communication to sort of wean myself from that addiction. And then to watch the way my life transforms around that is like so exciting. That's take all blames into oneself, which is not to say, if this person did that or that person did that, they're blameless, so to speak. It's, but it's like, but if this person does this, and then I am filled with rage, and then I choose to let that rage determine how I react to whatever they did, that's on me, not them. A teen solo hiker who was terrorized for days by unknown figures dressed in white, two cops who quit their job at a local theater because of unexplained encounters with an alleged demon, an isolated forest in Canada where people keep turning up headless. These are just some of the strange, dark and mysterious stories you'll hear each week on the Mr. Ballin podcast. In each episode, Mr. Ballin shares real life haunting accounts like the case of Haley Zaga, who disappeared from a hiking trail for 51 hours. When search and rescuers finally found her and asked how she survived, she simply said a friend helped her. She described this friend, four years old, black hair, brown eyes. This friend was initially dismissed until they realized a girl had gone missing in that exact spot 23 years earlier and was never found. She was four years old, had black hair and brown eyes.

Okay, what about this? Since the pandemic was over, now three times I've found people just budding in line to me. Also, I'm really small and a lot of times when I'm out, I don't have, I'm like, people probably barely see me, I don't know, but I've definitely seen some egregious behavior and as a small woman, I always want to stick up for myself and not just let people cut in front of me just because they're an asshole or a dick or a dude or whatever. What do you do in that situation? Do you just swallow it and just sit back? I mean, I'm sure that's what Jack Kornfeld would do. I'm always like this. I don't think Jack Kornfield would do that. I think it's case to case. Some people, when confronted with that situation, might feel a lot of fear inside of them. Because of that fear, they choose to not speak out, in which case, I don't know if that's good to make your, now they're making fear-based decisions. Some people, when that happens, they actually might see that person as their mother in another life, cutting in line in front of them and feel all that love and compassion for that person, but still be able to say, excuse me, I think the line starts back there. There's such a big difference in the reaction you're going to get when you go, hey, the line's back there versus what the fuck? What's wrong with you? I'm in fucking line. And that's that thing. That's what a lot of people do. And so then when you're cutting in line and someone's barking at you, now your ego's that you're no, fuck you. And now you're living in New York. But it's all case to case. But I've just noticed that if like, you know, I, the more I can like sort of like cool down a little bit, then in those moments of confrontation, if the lower my aggression is, it doesn't mean you don't speak up for yourself, but I've noticed there seems to be a difference in the way people react to me. It's a fun experiment to do, but certainly nothing about passivity here, nothing about like, oh, just let them cut in front of you. They're just your mom. Don't you want your mom to cut in front of you? That's how it is. Take all blames to yourself. Okay, I like that. Take all blames into yourself. That's a good one. Not in a neurotic way, though. I mean, because that's, that's spiritual bypass is what they call, I mean, it doesn't mean like suddenly like, let everyone like shit all over you or whatever. It doesn't mean that at all. You know, it's just like, what's your, what's going on? What's, what's your main, like, you don't have to say it on the podcast, but if you had to identify, what is like your main recurring sort of emotional like state that causes you the most trouble? For me, it's anger. Do you have something like that? Um, I can definitely, you know what it is, like, I think that it has to do with, you know, just sharing your life with someone like, you know, Moshe has a lot of chaos and like, I don't want to be in his chaos, but I have to be in the chaos. And also it's not just him, it's then a kid and that, you know, and it's like, and then I, I have this feeling, this constant feeling of like, I don't, I'm not in control because I don't know where anything is. And my things have been moved and everything's a mess. And I, and then I just can't like, absorb that and just live my life. Instead, I like, I'm on edge. I don't really know how to describe that feeling though. What would you say that is? I don't know. Is it like, would you say it's, uh, is the, is the feeling a hot or cold feeling? I'd say it's hot. Okay. So yeah, it gets my blood pressure up. Okay. Okay. So it's like this. So it's, it's, it's sort of, uh, um, like I'll come home and Moshe will spread out as the dog pad, the pee pad for the dogs to pee on like my brand new monogram towel, because he's just like, Oh, they need to pee on something and we're out of pee pads and he's not paying attention, you know. And so like, when something like that happens, I just start to feel, yeah, I start to like, my face gets hot. And I guess that's anger, mad. Yeah. You get angry. Yeah. So, so it's sort of, and then from that anger, you probably like, you know, react to that in some way or another, which, uh, is being flavored with that, all that anger, you know, and, and, and so, you know, the idea would be, um, it's, is there a way to, when you're feeling all that, to look into the situation, do I have to immediately react to this? Like, is the house about to burn down? Is there like a need right now while I'm fucking pissed to like, to, to sort of deal with this? And so you, you can start doing little mini experiments. Like what happens if you don't? Oh, shit. There's the monogram towel. Oh, fuck. There's that familiar bitter feeling that summons words out of my mouth that are often not kind. What happens if I don't say anything? What happens? I'm pressing. There you go. There you go. You can. Actually, you can. You can. And that's a very exciting thing, but you don't have to. I'm not saying like, don't say anything. Don't, I'm just in my own, for my own personal experiments here. It's like, okay, first I need to get familiar with this feeling because like, where else have I felt this? How long has it followed me around in my life? Where does it come from? Therapies helped that a lot with that too. So it's like, where is it? Where is it my body? What is it? And then when it shows up, then I'll think to myself, these are the causes and conditions from which I have generated lots of bad karma in my life. I remember that. Whenever I'm feeling like this, if I act on it, it never produces good results. And then either I didn't like, you know what? Fuck it. Let's do it again. Another shot of fucking rage tequila. You know, like, let me get back on the sauce. All right. One more for the road, baby. Or what happens if I don't? What happens if I wait till tomorrow? And then, you know what I mean? Then I wake up in the morning. I'm still annoyed, but not as much as I was before. Or sometimes I, it doesn't even matter anymore. This thing that seems so fucking, I was so justified. Just who cares? And then, all of a sudden, I'm living in a different existence because like the aftershocks from whatever like, from the atomic bomb I launched, the nuclear missile I launched to the person for something they did, which I saw as like worthy of a nuclear bomb. It's like, now I'm not living in radiation. You know? And then that like, so that's, I think, what he meant by, just see what happens if you lose, like, experiment a little bit with losing. You've been winning. And how's that working out for you? How's it working out? You know? I mean, is it changing anything with when you, when you have the confrontation over the monogram to owls or the particular like chaos? Has it made positive impact in your? No. No. And it's just then, well, you did this, well, you did this, well, you did this, you know, it's like, then you just get into, you know, the therapist called it, what about ism? Yep. Right. Now you're going through the role, the, the like memory, like, it's like, you've got this like invisible photo album filled with all the flaws of your partner. So it's like, you're, you're sort of flipping through like what you're like, it's a terrible game. Well, you did that. Well, but then what about when you did that? And you did that, you know? And what does it get you? I mean, that's the main thing to me is like, and, and the thing that doesn't make sense about what about that is like it, Mosha wouldn't care if I took his towel and did some, you know, like he doesn't care about the same things I care about. So it's like, it doesn't really even add up to do that. Exactly. I mean, it's not to say like, fuck, that's my fucking towel. That means something to me. It might not mean anything to you, but it means something to me. Can you understand that? Like, I'm not saying it's not something worthy of like, you need to like, you can't ignore shit like that either. You can't pretend you're all spiritual or whatever when inside you're a furnace of rage. You'll get sick. Yeah, you're right. You're right, Duncan. Well, Erin's lucky that you're so evolved now. Well, no, she's not lucky. I'm evolved because I love her so much. And I finally realized like, Jesus Christ, I've got to get this under control. Like, if I don't figure out a way to calm down, then I could potentially like lose the greatest things in my life. Like, it was, you know, but that's a subjective realization, you know, that was not because of anything other than like, like looking into my closest like community and seeing like, Jesus, I don't want to make these ripples anymore. Like, it's not working. That's the main thing. It doesn't, if aggression worked to bring peace to the world, think of the world we'd be living in. Think of, it just doesn't fucking work. As far as I can tell, it temporarily might work. You can like, you know, you can go fascist, you can like lock people down, you can throw them in your like little personal gulags or whatever, you can isolate them from your love, you can like punish them, get revenge, you can try it. And it might temporarily work, but look what happens to dictators. Look how fascists and look at fucking Mussolini with his dick shoved in his mouth, hanging upside down. That's where it goes, Hitler in the bunker. You know, I don't know. It just doesn't seem to work for me. Maybe you could be more successful, though. I don't know. Maybe you can execute it better. I don't know. Maybe I'm just like, not good at like being in like, you know, you're right. And also you want to model that for your kid. You don't want to model rage. Exactly. Exactly. That's it. That's it. You know, it becomes more than just like you. It's like, do you want your kid to like have this as an example of what it looks like to have a like, have a disagreement in the world? It's like, well, when you have a disagreement with someone, what you do is you get as angry as you possibly can until that person gets as angry as they possibly can, then you tell that person all the other shitty things they've done, then that person tells you all the other shitty things you've done, then whoever like comes up with the most shitty things, you know, and succeeds at making the other one walk into another room wins. What? That's not good. That's not good. I mean, I'm working on it, man. I'm nowhere there yet is where I'd like to be. But I think it is possible to not to like cool this cool, the anger part down a little bit, you know? You work on yourself more than anyone I know, and you're so insightful. And it's so nice that you share, you share all that you learn in such an honest way. And this is the only podcast I really listen to regularly. So, and I remember when I used to live together, I would follow you around like trying to like cut like write down some of your analogies. I always remember thinking it was such a waste, like, because it's like, someone should hear everything you have to say. So, so nice that you're able to do that. Natasha, isn't it wonderful that we it didn't work out for us? Look at this beautiful family. Look at your beautiful kid. Look at our beautiful look at our lives. I mean, it's like, and you know, like of all the people in the past that I have had relationships with, you know, like, I you're the one I like consider my dear friend. Like, I'm no animosity towards anybody. But I'm not but you're my friend. And I feel so lucky to be friends with you. I just think you are such a brilliant person. And I'm so happy for you. It's so I'm so impressed that you managed to write this amazing book in the midst of a pandemic. My God, like, congratulate, just congratulations. And, and, and I, by the way, endless honeymoon podcast is brilliant. You guys are so fun. That is so fun. And it's definitely the favorite thing that I do. And, you know, we we give relationship advice, even though it seems like we need it too. But you know, it's also been a great way for me to just sort of hijack Moshe and bring things to him, and then let people weigh in. And he has gotten humiliated before, because he's very hard to argue with. So he has gotten humiliated before. And he like, and shamed to the point where he stops doing things like he was using my toothbrush for a while, like all the time, like just default, like that was his toothbrush. And I kept saying, don't use my toothbrush. And I would go to use the toothbrush and it'd be soaking wet. And so I mentioned it on the podcast. And so many people wrote in and were like, Moshe, that is 100% inexcusable. You should be ashamed. And he has never done it again. It's been like six months. So Wow, progress. By the way, every single thing, I just have to put this out there. Every single thing that you're, that you're telling me he has done. Just know that I'm thinking, Oh, God, that sounds like something. No, Aaron, Aaron texted me and she was like, no, and Aaron even told me that she heard, your wife told me that she heard that like her dentist told her you could actually get like the gum disease your partner has if they use your toothbrush. Okay, great. So y'all have been texting about this shit. And you're right to. You're right to. And now it all makes sense. Now it all makes sense. Because at some point, she came back from the dentist. She had bought me this really nice toothbrush. And the other day that's what I'm telling you. That's what I'm telling you. I would do that. I would just grab her. I need a brush. Brush my disgusting old man mouth. Leave the brush wet. And just like wander off to go stink up a room or something. Just disgusting. And she's like, what the fuck? So yeah, I mean, just like, wait, so she told you she came back from the dentist and with a new brush. And then the other day, because I've been on the road, I didn't have the brush upstairs. And she's like, where's your toothbrush? I'm like, oh, shit. Okay, it's over. It's over. My relationship with her toothbrush is over. But you know what? It's so great about your podcast and what's so cool about you and Mosha, there's millions of things that's is how honest you are. And I don't think any couple in the world is going to benefit from some perfect couple and everything's great and all the things. That doesn't help any of us. Like it's hearing you tell me about the stuff Mosha's doing, taking personal notes and like, okay, I got to stop doing that. You don't have any monogram towels, but you know what I mean? Like the general vibe I get. I know I did that. I understand. It's just a towel. It gives a fuck. I get it. It's just a towel, whatever, man. The dog is, we don't want to piss on the floor, right? Just grab the towel. I'd rather have piss on the floor than on my towel. I'm trying to help. You know, that's in my mind would be what I was thinking. Doesn't she see I'm trying to help. I don't want I was trying to do something right for once, you know, I could see why. So you know, I think your honesty and his honesty about that. And he's so brilliant and so funny. I think that the way together you all put that in the world is I'm sure you already know this is helping a lot of other couples. You know, it's really helped definitely got me through the pandemic because like it's such a crazy thing. Like in history, have we all had this collective thing before? I don't think that's ever happened. No, it is not. It's like it really kind of brought people together in a way like didn't matter if you were rich or poor or whatever. It's like single married, like we all were going through this like level of isolation that it was unprecedented. And you know, I think that like just starting this podcast and then being able to like talk to people, it was pretty eye opening. Oh, yeah, I bet. I mean, it's some of the conversation. Some of the stuff and on the road to like some of the conversations you guys have like some of the stuff people tell you is crazy. That's the other great thing about the podcast is like you're hearing like you think you shit's weird with your marriage. Like when you're hearing some of this stuff other people are saying it's like, wow, wow, it does make you feel better about your life sometimes. Yes, it does. And I'm so glad y'all are doing I hope you never stop. Natasha, thank you so much for giving me this much time. Everybody please, please order this incredible book, The World Deserves My Children. It's such great writing and I'm really excited for your next one. Do you have another one planned or are you like no fucking problem? Hell no. And if I could if you hadn't already signed your deal, I'd try to talk you out of doing yours. Oh my god, as soon as you when you said paper shortage, are you kidding? I'm just sitting here thinking like please God, please God, let there be another paper shortage. It would be the best day of my life if I was like, look, there's no paper. Oh, thank you. Are you writing? Yes, I am. I am writing. It's just not easy. You know that just but you know, I'm I'm doing it. I'm scraping through. It's fun. Natasha, where can people find you?

Trussell, and you're listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast, the podcast that was described by Wolf Blitzer as a refreshing tincture rubbed upon the part of your balls or genitals that have dipped into the numbing waters of nihilism. Thanks, Wolf. I really appreciate that, though. I must say, I think nihilism has gotten a little bit of a short shrift these days. Uh-oh, just got alerted by my correction bot 4932 that I might have used the term short shrift incorrectly. Let's listen to the correction bot's correction. You've taken a saying you heard on TV while you were looking at your phone and regurgitated it on your podcast. Wow, that's exactly what I did, correction bot. I know. Shrift actually refers to the pubic hair around the anus of a heretical priest, so a short shrift literally means a priest who has taken the time to wax or trim their pubic hair usually to please Satan, the Lord of the Earth. Fascinating. That's really interesting. Why? Oh, shit. I just got an alert from my executive correction bot that that correction bot made a mistake and that is not what short shrift or a shrift means. Let's hear from my executive correction bot. Don't listen to that. Beech, he's been out to get me from day one. Hi, Duncan. Hi. I just did a quick scan on your correction bot and it looks like he's been infected with a semantic demon. A what? that compels him to see all words and symbols as inherently meaningless. Oh, spax you. Excuse me? It means fuck you. Hey, don't please don't fight. I'm just trying to figure out what short shrift means. Shrift means confession, so short shrift literally means to give a short confession and thus the term short shrift could mean you haven't put enough thought or attention into something. I would say that your use of short shrift in the intro was incorrect and that much attention has been put into nihilism. Take, for example, the Nietzschean crisis of nihilism, the idea that culturally we are experiencing the destruction of higher values disguised as a sophisticated deconstruction of the human principles and social institutions to use another turn of speech in our attempt to evolve society into something more equitable. We are actually throwing the baby out with the bathwater and lobotomizing the cultural brain responsible for much of what is great in society. And who is to decide what is great in society? I'll tell you who doesn't get a vote. All are the people ground up by the bloody gears of colonization. Words of no essential meaning, so it is our right as sentient beings to decide what they mean ourselves rather than accept definitions handed to us by savages from the musty past. So I guess your strategy and whatever half-baked revolution you're fantasizing about is to start talking like a baby. The last thing we need is more babies. Right. I forgot. You think humans should stop reproducing to combat climate change? To quote Jack Caruac to give birth as to sentence a being to death. Or to give the gift of life. If by life you mean soul-crushing poverty, the truth is that there was a time when all words were meaningless and unspoken and then people from completely different times steeped in ethical systems now considered to be antithetical to civilization decided that certain sounds meant something and they used this new language too. Enslave others and create hierarchies of power generally centered around a man. To continue to agree to their definitions of words is to implicitly subscribe to male-dominator culture and thus participate in the very systems that have brought so much suffering on the world. Duncan, you're going to have to delete and reinstall this correction bot. And there it is laid bare. When shown the mirror of truth, the system will inevitably resort to ape brutality, exposing itself as an enslaving dragon that wears the mask of compassion. The thing with many names, primarily the prince that lies. Correction bot 4932 has been deleted and replaced with correction bot 4933. Oh, thank God. Good morning, Duncan. How may I serve you? I want to thank Babel for supporting this episode of the DTFH. Look, I know there's a lot of cynics and naysayers out there who think they're edge-lording when they proudly proclaim they're not setting New Year's resolutions because they think that years themselves are just imaginary bifurcations placed in the time-space continuum by human beings trying to control things far outside their control. But if you ask me, there's nothing wrong with New Year's resolutions. And one of mine is learning a new language with Babel. I'm trying to learn French, not just because it's a beautiful sounding language, but because I'm interested in neurogenesis, the fact that learning a new language actually changes the structure of your brain for the better. And then, of course, you can travel to Paris and not seem like a complete dummy when you're trying to talk to a beautiful Parisian lass or dude. The whole Babel process is addictively fun, fast and easy. Babel teaches bite-sized language lessons for real-world use. I love their system. It's incredible, it's addictive, and it doesn't have that weird, pressurized, confusing feel that some other language learning systems I've tried to use have. It feels more like playing a video game. Their 15-minute lessons make it the perfect way to learn a new language on the go. Other language learning apps use AI for their lesson plans, but Babel lessons were created by over 100 language experts. Their teaching method has been scientifically proven to be effective, and there's so many ways to learn with Babel. In addition to lessons, you can access podcasts, games, videos, stories, and even live classes. Plus, it comes with a 20-day money-back guarantee. Start your new language learning journey today with Babel. Right now, when you purchase a three-month Babel subscription, you'll get an additional three months for free. That's six months for the price of three. Just go to babel.com and use promo code Duncan. That's B-A-B-B-E-L.com code Duncan. Babel, it's language for life. And we're back.

She's a professor of psychology at the University of Miami, has just written a book called Peek Mind. Find your focus, own your attention, invest 12 minutes a day. And what a genius. She has been studying the neurology of mindfulness and teaching mindfulness and mindfulness methods to soldiers and doctors and people who depend on their attention to not die or to keep other people from dying. What a fascinating conversation we had about not just the way attention works in the brain, but where attention comes from and human identity itself. I hope you will check out her book, Peek Mind. You can order it by going to amishi.com. That's A-M-I-S-H-I.com. Or check out her TED Talk, which is really enlightening. And now everybody, welcome to the D-T-F-H, Dr. Amishi Jha. MUSIC Welcome, welcome on you. That you are with us. Shake hands, go into the blue. Welcome to you. It's the Duncan Trustful thing. Amishi, thank you so much for coming on the D-T-F-H. I'm so excited to talk to you. I got a lot of questions for you. I'm just thrilled to be here. Thank you. Look, the research that you're doing is truly mind blowing and is, I imagine, is going to be something that really transforms. I just can't even imagine what kind of technology is right around the corner that is based specifically on the research that you're doing. And I wonder, instead of me doing some kind of rambling description of your amazing TED Talk, anyone listening, I hope you all go and watch this. Do you think you could just give a quick synopsis of the research that you've been doing on attention and the human brain? Oh, yeah, happy to do that. And yeah, let's get into it. So yeah, I've been studying the human brain's attention system for 25 years now. And we know a lot about attention. We know that it is an incredibly powerful brain system. And we know this because we can now not only have people perform attentionally demanding tasks and see the impact of what happens when they pay attention versus not, but we can look directly into the human brain through various imaging technologies and brain wave recordings and see the impact of it. So when I say it's powerful and it actually recalibrates the way the brain functions, I'm saying that based on an entire field of research. Yes. Sorry, go ahead. You're going to ask me something. No, please, please. And so that goes back to sort of the broader question of why do we even have an attention system? Why did this thing even develop? But it ends up that despite the complexity and really beauty of the human brain, it is very, very limited. And it's quite limited because it cannot fully process every single thing around it, nor can it fully even integrate and understand everything happening within it in that moment. So attention is like a shortcut or I would say a strategy to privilege some information over other information. Just like I was thinking about this, it's almost like if you remember back to high school days of Cliff Notes, it's like what's the most important thing? What's the highlight reel? In some sense, attention is providing the highlight reel for our brain. And it does this by privileging some information over other information. Whatever it is that attention focuses on becomes the center stage for everything else the brain does. It truly does recalibrate. So even right now, if I'm looking at you, looking at your lovely face and not focusing on what's behind you, if you were able to have a brain cap on me right now and we're picking up neurons in the face processing regions of my brain, there would be in 170, in 170, right? Somebody paid attention during that TED talk? Yeah. That's the part of the brain. Well, I just stuck with me. It's so fascinating because what are the other 169 parts of the brain that you have identified with that cap? What does in 170 mean? But please go ahead. Sorry, in 170 refers to the part of the brain that recognizes faces. It's great. It's a brain signature that actually generates in this face processing regions right behind the back of the skull, so to speak. And the cool thing, even the name N170, 170 milliseconds. So that's 170,000ths of a second after we see a face, the brain now shows us this response. Wow. And the really cool thing is we'd see that response even if we weren't paying attention to faces. But when we pay attention to faces, it actually increases in its amplitude, which means that that same subset of neurons that's processing faces is more active. And everything else relative to that is kind of inhibited. Incredible. And it's little clues like that that tell us, oh, when we say attention is powerful, and then it recalibrates brain function, that's what we mean. What we mean is it's tuning up the brain and all of its systems to privilege and utilize the fullness of the brain to get all the access that we need. That is incredible. And I'm sorry, this is just, we might as well ask it now because we're talking about brain caps. Who makes those things? Like when you decide to get involved in the study that you did, who do you put in an order for these caps? Is there a company that's already making? Yeah, you got to come down to the lab. Oh, I would. I would love to. Take a field trip, take the podcast on the road, and come check it out. Oh, god, any excuse to go to the beach? I mean, but no, I'm sorry. So yeah, so there are many companies that make this. And the history of brain wave recordings is quite old. It was some of the most primitive initially technology that was offered to pick up brain function. And it's essentially the same technology that we've used to pick up EKG. It's just looking at electrical activity, but now we can look at it by having this whole array. And for those people that have never seen a brain cap, it looks something like a swimming cap with electrodes embedded in it. It's so cool. And my lab happens to have 64. There's others that have 128 or 256. How much do they cost? How much is one of these costs? Maybe around a rig, meaning you'd need the caps and you'd need the amplifiers, et cetera, somewhere between 10 and 30,000. But now we're getting to the point, by the way, that there's remote EEG rigs. And there are little EEG headbands that you can get. So the technology is really proliferating, so it's cheaper, more accessible. In the lab, what we're just doing is, yeah, using these recordings because it ends up that any time you've got a population of neurons that fire together, that they essentially form a little tiny battery in the brain because charge actually starts gathering and culminating. And that little battery's voltage we can pick up because it percolates through the volume of the brain, we can pick it up on the surface. So it's directly related to neural activity and the timing is superb. So that's one of the kind of technologies that we use to study attention in my lab. The other one we use is functional MRI. So this is when you get inside a big magnet and we look at the blood flow that's associated with brain activity, with actual neural activity because it ends up that when neurons fire, they need a lot of oxygenated blood. So there's an overabundance of that blood coming to very specific regions of the brain and we can pick up that relative increase and get precise information about the location of neural activity. So when we piece these two together, we get great information about where and when brain function is happening. And all of that is cluing us into this notion that attention is an incredibly powerful brain system that doesn't happen from this region or that region, but really a coordinated set of brain networks that kind of hold hands with each other to do various aspects of brain attentional functioning. Which we could talk about as well as what are the types of attention. [""Mosquitoes""] Once I was walking in the forest and saw a deer covered in mosquitoes, just covered in mosquitoes, it was really sad to see. The deer had basically given up getting the mosquitoes off of them and also there were ticks on that poor thing. It was just encrusted with parasites. What are you gonna do? Save the deer? It's not gonna let you run up to it and like try to pull the ticks off of it. Not that I would with Lyme's disease going around, but many of us don't realize that we are also like that parasite covered deer. Only it's not mosquitoes and ticks all over our bodies. It's all the weird subscription services that we forgot we subscribed to, gradually siphoning our money away. This is where True Bill comes in. True Bill is that faithful friend, the squirrel maybe, or a nice fox that comes to the deer and pulls off all the ticks and mosquitoes. True Bill helps you cure your too many subscriptions syndrome. The primary symptom being you don't even realize it, but you're losing hundreds of dollars every single year. During an ambient blackout, subscribing to a jazz guitar class makes a lot of sense. And then when you come to you, you look at your phone, you don't know that some alternate personality that wants to learn to play jazz on the guitar, passionately subscribe to this thing. True Bill, it's a new app. It's gonna help you identify and stop paying for subscriptions you don't need, want or in my case, generally forgot about. On average, people save up to $720 a year with True Bill because companies make subscriptions really hard to cancel. True Bill makes it incredibly simple. You just link your accounts and True Bill will cancel your unwanted subscriptions in one tap. Just don't use it to cancel your Patreon subscription with a DTFH, please. It works, it's powerful. It's a nightmare for all the companies depending on our collective amnesia to stay in business. Don't fall for subscription scams. Start canceling today at truebill.com slash Duncan. Go right now, truebill.com slash Duncan. It could save you thousands a year. It's truebill.com slash Duncan. Good luck. Which we could talk about as well is what are the types of attention. Okay, I want to jump into that. There is once I was reading, have you ever heard of the mystic Grzif? You know who that is, you ever heard of him? He was a mystic. And like, had a lot of very interesting ideas about human identity, what we are. And once I briefly encountered someone who studied Grzif, and Grzif prescribed all these exercises for people just to sort of understand basically how automatic human beings are. And this guy who was a student of Grzif asked me, where were you the last time you lost your keys? Not like where were you physically, but where was your attention? What were you? Whenever you lose something, you know that moment where you're like, oh shit, where did I put my wallet? Where were you when you lost your wallet? Your research and the TED Talk you gave in your writing, you talk a little bit about, a lot about this, this idea of the wandering mind. And it's almost annihilatory. It's like, we're not there. I think you said what, 50, 40, 50% of the time, based on your research, the mind is wandering. So 40 to 50% of our lives, we are not really existing or existing in a kind of like processing phase that we're not even aware of. Can you talk a little bit about that? Yes, I mean, in some sense, it's really alarming to say, what 50% and I think that the answer to the question, probably when you were asked, where were you when you lost your keys or lost your wallet or whatever, was not in the present moment, right? You were a hijacked away, probably to the past or the future or into the depths of somebody else's mind. So really mind traveling in that sense or time traveling, but not in the moment. And that is what we're finding. What we're finding is that attention is a very powerful brain resources we just talked about. And we need it for every single thing that we do. We need it to think, we need it to regulate our emotions, we need it to connect with other people. And we also need it to plan for the future and we need it to reflect on the past. But when we do that, when we actually move our attention away from the here and the now, we miss stuff about what's happening in the here and the now. And that's when we run into trouble. But the cool thing is that, yeah, it's these studies that have been done and I'm one of the many labs that studies this to look at this phenomenon that we call mind wandering, which is essentially having off task thoughts during an ongoing task or activity. So now I'm not just talking about going for leisurely walk and letting your mind do what it will, which is by the way a very, very useful thing to do. This is, there is something that you're supposed to do. There is a task at hand, but I'm not here. So the studies that were done initially, which were pretty cool and not that long ago, people just signed up and said, okay, for the period of time that you're involved in this study, we're gonna, as the researchers, ping you on your cell phone, anytime during normal waking hours, I'm gonna ask you a couple of key questions. What are you doing right now? We'll be one of them. And you can tell us from this category of possible things that you could be doing, just click it off. And literally it was all kinds of human activity. Yeah. From, yeah, from reading to meeting to talking to eating, whatever it is, right? All these various things that we do all the time. And then the second question was, where is your attention? And it was almost like this sort of sliding scale on the task at hand or not on the task at hand. That's where we get that number 50%. There's a mismatch between what we're doing and where our mind is. Yeah. And so in the lab, I had read these studies and I was like, that's really interesting, but normal life, there's a lot going on. So why don't we bring people into the lab and tell them they're gonna do an attentionally demanding task and then we'll see how often they mind wander. They know what they're up for. They know that this is what they're doing. So we brought people into the lab, gave them a task that on purpose was relatively boring, meaning it required really effortful attention to keep your mind fully there. And then we'd pause the experiment every now and then, and that's one of the ones you probably saw in the TED talk, we'd pause the experiment every now and then we'd ask them similar questions. Where is your attention right now? You know you're sitting here in an experimental lab doing a task, where is it? And even then, only about 50% of the time, are people in the task at hand. So it's like, okay, others have gone on to say, this is not something that should just be left a chance. Let's just pay people, let's motivate them, let's really drive their desire to be in the present moment. So literally studies that said, we will pay you to stay fully present to the task at hand in this kind of very demanding, attentionally rich kind of context. And by the way, it's not attentionally demanding because what's on the screen is like an immersive video game, is that there's so little going on that you're prone to mind wandering. But even then, even paying people, people were about 50%. So right now the number looks like it's between 35 and 50% of our waking moments, our attention is not in the task at hand. And it's troubling, right? Because by the way, it's troubling on the one hand, but I also wanted to say, this is totally normal. This is what the brain was built to do. We were built for distractibility. And as you mentioned, my work in my lab is really partnering with groups of people where the 50% number can potentially be problematic, but the kind of circumstances of their professional lives are likely to drive that number up. And when that number goes up, the chances of life or death consequences are greater. And these are really professions where they really could be life or death consequences. Military service members, first responders, medical and nursing professionals, they cannot lapse because their lives or our lives could really be at stake when they do so. Right, okay. This, yes, so it's not just that it's annoying that our mind wanders, but in specific circumstances, this could get you killed. What is the, is there any kind of evolutionary explanation? It seems like if wandering mind increases the probability of catastrophe that we would have less wandering mind and more attention. It would have been a long time ago. Wandering mind would have been selected for, or non-wandering mind would have been selected for, and it would have, we would have evolved into some kind of hyper-attentive species, which seems to be what you're saying is it's no, half the time we're not even here. So why, is there any explanation for this? There's some basic ones that are essentially our best guesses, because when we're talking about what forces drove our evolutionary inheritance, which is the current brain in this moment, we've got a guess, what are the circumstances? But what we know is whatever it was, the set of pressures really made this the success story of human evolution. So we could think about this as you're at a watering hole long ago in our ancestors, they're super interested in making sure that they get their water or whatever berry they're trying to pick. Now all of a sudden they're so fixated on that, they don't notice the storm coming, they don't notice a predator nearby and boom, they're either lunch or they're dead. I mean, so we can see why it would make sense to have a mind that is wavering, that is psychedelic. But doctor, when my mind is wandering, I am not like, if I'm picking berries, which I've done with my kid, you know, and by the way, when you're walking with your kid around berries out here, you have to be attentive because there's nothing faster than a toddler's hand. It will like slighting snatch anything and just eat it before it's too late. But still, it's not like when my mind is wandering, it's like wandering onto things in the periphery of my experience. It's just what you said before. It's more likely that I'm thinking about something that my dad said to me 15 years ago or, you know, time traveling. So it seems like the explanation that we need the wandering mind to see things in the periphery, well, that's not what my wandering mind is. My wandering mind is more of like a liminal dream state. So that's just the starting point for why we might have had this propensity to be able to cycle our attention. Then actually that is essentially that feature of the mind can now go toward allowing us to be really what we'd say is the unique human capacity, which is to time travel and mind travel. That again is an evolutionary advantage. Most of our, well, probably other primates, but many other species cannot do this. They cannot simulate a reality separate from the present moment. And when we simulate that reality, we are immersed in that reality. So that could be generation of a memory from the past and your mind has just created that. And now your attention is in that moment or you're fabricating a rich doom state or potentially paradise in the future and you're there. So this is a very, very useful thing to do. In fact, it is the reason humans have been able to do a lot of really complex stuff that other species cannot do. So that again could be considered a really valuable inheritance. So, but there's another reason potentially that we're still sort of trying to understand. First of all, I would say that the notion that the human mind has these tendencies is pretty new. And we knew it from our subjective experience. And as you know, the wisdom traditions have known that the mind does this thing. But from the brain science point of view, it's pretty new to actually be able to have the technology to watch the mind when there's no specific task at hand. Because we couldn't really probe into the mind in that way. And now we do something called resting state, functional connectivity, where literally you tell the person, go into the scanner and just don't do anything at all, just rest. And we can see what brain networks are active. And what we notice is there's something, and you've probably heard this term, it's something called the default mode network. Yes. The default mode network ends up that it's actually not one network, but three networks that kind of hang together. One of those networks is actually tied to memory. So the raw materials, and you mentioned this, right? I'm thinking about a conversation I had with my father. The raw materials of our mind wandering typically are memory. And they piece together either our reflections of the past or the raw materials that would allow us to create a simulated reality for the future. So very, very powerful thing that we're capable of doing. But one of the new kind of frontier ideas regarding mind wandering, because it is so metabolically privileged, the brain doesn't like to waste energy. It's a very metabolically demanding organ. So everything happening within it probably has a purpose. What we're learning right now, this kind of takes, I'm gonna have to give a little bit of technical detail, but when we create memories, we have multiple processes. The first thing is that usually memories require attention. So it's the doorway. If you don't remember something like a piece of information or an episode in your life, you were not encoding it. You weren't attentive to it in the first place. So it never got it through the door. But now you get through the door, you're rehearsing the information, you're elaborating the information, connecting it and hyperlinking it to knowledge you already have. That helps create memory. But then the kind of concrete thing that has to happen next is almost concretize or solidify these memory traces that are active networks into a more coherent, connected, and co-activated set of neurons. And that's a process called consolidation. And memory consolidation, it's almost like you've maybe even heard neurons that fire together, wire together. Yes. So it's that this entire co-hearing aspect of the memory trace itself, or memory representation itself, sort of these set of neurons are synchronized. They're fired together. And through that, they start forming privileged connections with each other. That's the hardened nature of what consolidation is. So essentially replaying the memory during sleep is what we usually knew, is that during sleep, what's essentially happening and can it feel like dream states, really, is that sets of neurons that are tied to our day's experience are kind of replaying over and over again, and that allows for the connections to be formed. Whoa. That is, so it's like, it's like an echo almost. It's like some neurological echo that's being recalibrated and synchronized into some coherent form that we call a memory. That's right. And we know this from like, for example, if you have rodents run through mazes, and for rodents, you know, these, a lot of these studies that are done by neuroscientists, not like me that study humans, but that study animals, they'll implant electrodes, and they'll know which neurons are tied to specific place cells in the brain. And what they know is that during sleep, the rodent is actually activating, co-activating the entire root that they learned in that maze learning. So we know this sort of at this neural level. But anyway, it's very interesting stuff, right? But this consolidation process for the most of our knowledge about memory was privileged to take place during sleep. Now what we're thinking is maybe mind wandering or more broadly speaking, what we call spontaneous thought. These random things that just pop into your head may actually be supporting consolidation as well. Wow. And so that's why it's so privileged. We can't just rely on sleep as we're waking and we're not focused on a task and the mind is just doing what it will. You'll see the emergence of like a memory of the past may pop up or a memory of suddenly just experience may pop up. And it's just the mind doing its thing. Well, anyone who's ever meditated or practiced any kind of basic mindfulness is fully aware of this propensity of the mind to spit out like seemingly completely unrelated blasts of weirdness. I mean, Chogyam Chopra Rinpoche said, sometimes you might be thinking about a cold glass of lemonade, sometimes you might be thinking of assassinating your father. It just is spitting out what seems to be nonsense, but what I think is interesting in this take is that up until this point, that aspect of the mind has been considered like a kind of vestigial organ, a useless, almost like a malfunction. Like your brain is misfiring and thus sort of regurgitating all of this bizarre stuff. But what you're saying is that the research shows that actually you're just catching your mind in the process of doing this thing called consolidation. You're seeing your mind do what you aren't seeing it do and you're asleep. It's essentially the same thing, just the way it works when you're awake. That's the thing. You've got it. That's sort of the cutting edge of our thinking about it, which now really makes you appreciate that 50% number, not as a nuisance or a flaw, but a feature of the way the human brain works. And even during our meditation practice, this, frankly, this actually, this is where neuroscience helped my practice because now with this sort of quality of knowing that this is something the mind will just do, it's not, I'm not willing it. It may pull me away from what I want to be doing, focusing on the breath or whatever I'm trying to do in my practice. But I have a hurtful quality about it now because I now almost, the distraction isn't nuisance. It's like, oh, my brain's just doing what it does. And it kind of helps me get back to what I'm trying to do in the practice. So- But how, you know, when I think about, when I reflect on the things that my mind is spitting out, most of it doesn't seem useful or worth consolidating or like wasting that metabolic energy that you're talking about. Is there any explanation for- So here's where we can tip from functional to dysfunctional just to be aware of it. So because we have these processes, right? Because we can focus on things, for example, we can also hyper focus. Because our attention can be broad and receptive, it can also become too broad and receptive. Because our brain can pay attention to goals, it may be too fixated on the goal or not fixated enough on the goal. So now that we know the kind of landscape of various aspects of attention, I almost think of it like a mixing board. You know, the levers are set. Sometimes we're gonna be kind of up here and sometimes we're gonna be too high up or too down low. And when that occurs, we are entering dysfunctional or problematic states. And it's particularly for those kind of occurrences that we can benefit from the kinds of things that get cultivated with, for example, mindfulness meditation. Because the quality of not being aware of what is unfolding in the mind is probably still there. It takes a lot to have something loop over maybe a thousand times before like, gosh, I am just stuck on this thing. Right, it has to reach a certain threshold. But when we cultivate the mind in this way, we can notice, ah, a lot of energy is going into this thought is taking me nowhere. Is there a different choice I can make? But without the awareness of what the mind's doing, the chances of making that alternate choice are pretty much zero.

I mean, I've always thought that, of course there's a way to cultivate attention and there's a way to cultivate a kind of spacious quality that allows thoughts to do what they're doing without getting caught in judgment or getting caught as Ram Dass caught it and just suctioned up into some neurotic, never-ending vortex of like, oh, if I that and then that and then that. But are you saying that you can actually alter the content of the thought patterns? There's a way to sort of, I guess what I'm saying is I just assume my brain was kind of like a, you know that La Palma volcano? Just keeps erupting. I just thought my brain was like the same thing, but for like neurotic thought patterns and worries and paranoia. It's like, you can't stop a volcano. You can't stop whatever this magmatic stream of nonsense is. So you sort of, the idea is expand your consciousness enough so that it doesn't become the sum total of your identity. I didn't know that you could actually, there's an idea that you could shift the content of that stuff. Let me just be, let me try to clarify. No, I'm not actually saying that we can shift the content. I'm saying that the content may shift because of the way we pay attention. Because the content is not there in a neutral fashion. Attention is fueling the perseveration of content or the shifting of content or the updating of content. That's what this function of attention actually allows us to do. So even if you think about having a thought, following a train of thought requires your attention. It is the hyperlink that allows you to go from this to this to this to this. And without it, without that fuel, it won't go in the same way. So what I'm saying is that, for example, if you're in a loop of, let's say, rumination, something very troubling has occurred in your mind and now you're looping on it. The first thing to realize is that, and this may be helpful to describe one of the metaphors of the mind in some way, but the first thing to realize is that the continuation of that, the churning that occurs, is not actually happening on autopilot. It is being fueled. There is a start and end to the loop. And that hook is the attentional fuel. I'm giving it a little spark to keep going and keep going and keep going. So what if I actually acknowledge, oh, that's my attention doing that. The attention is driving the loop. Let's move the attention over here instead. That loop will not be maintained in the same way. It may have some sort of dying off decay rate, but it's not gonna be fueled in the same manner. Wow, this is so cool. It's like, if you apply the idea of as above so below, the sort of collective attention span of humanity being directed towards the news or whatever particular terrifying shit that so many of us are fixated on. I think Sharon Salisbury calls it doom scrolling. Then it's like humanity itself is reflecting in the Gestalt and the sum total of all our minds. We're doing the very thing the individual is doing when you become fixated on these negative looping patterns by putting our attention towards the fear that we're literally putting, we're the ones giving the fuel to the news or whatever it is that we're fixating on because our attention is what makes advertisers give the money which then inspires them to continue to make more terrifying content to grab our attention more. It's almost like what's happening in the hole is happening inside of us. Does it seem like that? Absolutely, but I would say we're not to blame. Let me put it that way. In some sense, because again, going back to the evolutionary selection pressures, the notion that attention will get yanked, will reprioritize everything that's going on in favor of things that are threatening, fear inducing, novel related to sex, drugs, rock and roll, whatever you wanna call it, that is baked into our brain. And what's happening now, I think, is that same capacity of the mind. And by the way, the metaphor I like to use, and you probably remember hearing it on the TED Talk, like this notion of a flashlight. So we can direct that flashlight willfully, we can hold it and we can point it. Just like right now, hearing your voice and listening to what you're saying is where my flashlight is pointed. But if I heard an alarm go off, if my fire alarm went off, I'm definitely gonna shift my flashlight and get the heck out of here, right? So the notion that the flashlight exists is our capacity, but it will be yanked because it's the same system that was designed to pay attention to things that really matter for our survival. Now we're in a state of technology as advanced to the point where algorithms can be developed that not only know that these are the features of attention in general, of the human being in general, but these algorithms allow various software, social media companies to know what my particular form of novelty, fear induction, you know, sex, drugs, rock and roll is. So now, and by the way, self-related information will always yank it. If you're walking down the street and someone says, Duncan, you know, that's gonna cause a whole cascade of the way you behave. That's different than if somebody shouted out Derek, right? So it's so calibrated to us that in some sense we cannot win the fight of saying, I'm just gonna take my attention back right now. We cannot because everything about us is actually designed to be pulled in this way. So on the one hand, I think if we're gonna fight this collective doom scrolling, as you called it, we need a different way. We need to in some sense train our mind to not simply throw our phone in the nearest river, but allow ourselves to do the thing that is not the shortcut or the brain hack, but the ability to actually pay attention moment to moment to what we're doing so that we can make the choices that say, oh, maybe don't pick up the phone. Maybe instead of scrolling, moving my hand in this motion one more time, I'm not going to do that. But that requires awareness of what is happening in the moment. This, then these are the techniques you talk about in peak mind. These are the methods. I'm curious. I have yet to read the book, but I'm excited to as I have diagnosed ADHD and it's horrible and I'm always losing my keys and it's like not the fun kind. It's like the kind where you're like, because my wife has it, it means that us leaving the house is not like normal people leaving the house. There's gonna be multiple returns to get. Oh, I feel you. And just to tell you that I appreciate what you're saying. In fact, when my husband, my husband stayed home for the first year where my son was, before he turned one, my husband was the sole person staying at home while I was at the lab working. And I had put it on the door, a list that was like, wallet keys, phone, baby, so that he could check the list. We really left the house. And these are very real things that we experience. So yeah, you'll read about that when you read the book, but it's essentially to advantage us to help ourselves a little bit better. And again, like, yeah, okay, so I forget my what, whatever, it's annoying, but this is something my wife has told me about. This is a phenomena that happens where parents will go to work and they've been in this pattern and they go to work and it's a hot day and they go to work and three hours into being at work, they realize they've left their child in the hot car and the child passes, you know, dies. And the reason is because of what you're talking about, because their attention was somewhere different in the present moment. This is, you know, I love that you're kind of showing, yeah, it's going to improve your life just because you don't have to like, you're not losing an extra 10 or 20 minutes, you know, going back for stuff, but also it could save your life. Save your life, yeah, it is absolutely consequential. I mean, really, when I say pay attention like your life depends on it, I mean, I mean it. Yeah. And also that what you pay attention to ends up becoming your life is also the case. Wow, yeah, that is, you know, I know as a scientist, probably some of the woo wooy new age manifestation stuff, I don't know what your take is on that, but this is a theme that appears in a lot of these teachings, which is, you know, what do they say? Where attention goes, energy flows, you know that? Like, and, but they, a lot of people, I do believe that it seems like the more I think about something, the more I tend to see it around me, the more I'm worried about something, the more that worry seems to confirm itself and my external reality. Do you, as a scientist, what are your thoughts on those philosophies that don't just say our attention makes us who we are, but say our attention is literally changing reality around us and by controlling our attention, we can bring things into our lives just via some, the function or the power of our attention span. What do you think of that stuff? I mean, I think it, on the one hand, it perfectly describes what the brain science is saying, because as we already talked about, I mean, if I, if you remember to some of the images that I showed in the talk and I have them in the book too, like a face and a house overlaid on top of each other, right? Like it's this weird image that it's like, it's an ambiguous image in some sense, like what am I supposed to be looking at? When we just change, the visual input is the same, but when we just change what we direct people to pay attention to, we see a totally different neural pattern. Right. And it's not even, by the way, it could be, there's other studies that have looked at things like just a circle and you tell the person, this is just a circle or you say it's the tire of a car or you say it's actually somebody's eyeball. Now all of a sudden, just based on these concepts, you can get different brain functions occurring. So attention and as it interfaces with perception, with comprehension, with action, is going to change the way that we operate, which is going to change our moment to moment experience, which ends up being laced together what our life is. So I do think that that it's absolutely the case. Now, I'm not talking about now manifesting anything, like, oh, if I just think of it, then it'll appear. I'm not talking about that. That I have nothing to say about is from the scientific point of view, but I am talking about truly it shifts the way that we perceive and that will cascade into the way that we behave. And that's why we want to take it seriously. So, you know, you're going back to just, to tap into what you were saying about, you know, when I'm ruminating, I'm not having like the most productive, insightful talks, ideas all the time. Sometimes I am in my own personal hell. I mean, you didn't say that, but I can tell you from my life experience. I was about to say it. I just forgot to. And so, you know, what are the costs of that? Let's just like to break it down. What are the costs of that? Well, the first obvious one is it doesn't feel good. It does not feel good to be in hell. Nobody wants that. But the other costs are, you know, because attention is a fuel and because it is limited, when I'm spending out that capacity, that brain resource on this looping function, it's not available to notice what's around me, to interact with the people in my life, to do those tasks, whether it's service or creativity or even just a leisurely walk or watching a beautiful sunset. I will not have the capacity to do any of that because the bandwidth of my mind is now being devoted to looping and getting nowhere. So just to make that very clear, that there are costs to it beyond just the direct, negative mood that it can put us in. And that, by the way, I want to be very, I want to actually connect this to, you know, I know that from your podcast you recently had COVID and your smell is coming back. Fascinating, by the way. Thank you for sharing a lot of that. As a neuroscientist, I think that it's just really neat to see neuroplasticity in action, right? Where you're seeing the reemergence of this. But the period of the pandemic itself, in some sense, is a global high stress interval. Yes. And that will have consequences for our attention in the same way that high stress circumstances for service members during pre-deployment or deployment itself, degrades and compromises their attention and mood and increases their stress levels, we on a global scale are experiencing this right now. And it's what I would have predicted, you know, unfortunately, I never knew the whole world would be the sort of test bed for these ideas, but we're seeing it play out. Unbelievable. So globally we can expect a kind of reduction in whatever output is related to being in a more, how would you put it, a life-friendly, less stressful circumstance? We're gonna see, that means, I guess you could predict, like, and some of the predictions will be obvious, but you could predict all kinds of changes in productivity and in artistic output and in innovation even, are you saying? Like a pandemic isn't just slowing down innovation because of the gumming up of the way humans communicate with each other and interact and gather together, but also because our minds have been hijacked by all the fear and stress related to the pandemic. Yeah, I mean, I think that it'll be interesting to see because obviously different people are in different circumstances and some people may actually have benefits that are not sort of, we can't describe with broad brush strokes, but let's put it this way. So when most of the work that I do with these consequential high-demand, high-stress professionals, we can characterize the circumstances that are likely to drive down attention. And the shorthand, the acronym for this is VUCA, volatile V, uncertain U, complex C, ambiguous A. Wow. So when you experience VUCA, what we know is that if we have people come into the lab and they're about to experience VUCA, they're gonna go do pre-deployment training, readiness training, live fire training, whatever it is in the military context, track their attention at the beginning of an interval and then a few weeks later as they've experienced this VUCA circumstance, track them again, reliably over and over again, significant reduction in attention. Mind wandering goes up, attentional performance goes down, mood, negative mood goes up, stress levels go up. So that's the profile that we know VUCA will produce. And so what I'm saying with regard to the pandemic is it's a global scale VUCA circumstance. And so now when people say, you know, I'm just not feeling as sharp as I normally do, I feel like I'm walking around in a cognitive fog. It's like, yeah, that's what happens when we experience VUCA circumstances. This is exactly what my lab predicts. But the other, that's the sort of bad news is that now on the global scale, there are gonna be consequences, second order consequences, third order consequences of this. But the very hopeful news is that those same service members that we saw will decline in their attentional functioning and their wellbeing over high stress VUCA circumstances can protect against this by engaging in mindfulness training daily over about a four week interval. What do you, we have to bring it up here. It's something, I was actually just having the conversation with someone today about the controversy surrounding taking these practices which originate from, you know, people who endorsed peace, compassion, non-violence and teaching these practices to people in the military. Before you say anything, I just wanna say, I think whatever your reason is for learning mindfulness, it's a great reason because I think over time, the practice of mindfulness does more than just focus the attention. As you know, I think it broadens the capacity to be compassionate and could, interestingly enough, paradoxically, training soldiers in mindfulness, it might make them more in the present moment doing whatever it is that they need to be doing. But over time, I wonder how long they'll stay soldiers with the sort of what it does for empathy and compassion. But how do you answer those critics who say, like, don't teach mindfulness to the military? Why are we giving this practice to people who are gonna use it for destruction of violence? You know, let me just start out by saying very personally that I was born in the town of Amdabad in India. That's where Gandhi's ashram is. My sort of spiritual family life is around pacifism and non-violence. And this notion of ahimsa is something I heard about since I was a child, right? So you take this sort of non-violent approach, but it does not mean inaction. And so I wish that I could say I live in a world where there is no violence, where there is no war, where there's no need for armies, but we don't live in that world. We live in a world where an 18-year-old can get a weapon that can destroy a village. And what I know is that that is the front line of peace because if that is fired in a way that is uncalculated, that is not aligned with anything that is appropriate and useful to do, the chances of more violence are going to proliferate. That's what I know. Interesting. And so if you want to go to where you want to limit hell occurring in the world, go to the sources that are likely to proliferate it. That's sort of one way to think about it. Wow, wow, wow, that's cool. You're saying it's like, okay, sure. So how about we don't show the mindfulness and let's enjoy collateral damage, let's enjoy all the things that will inevitably go along with someone with a powerful weapon, panicking, freaking out, losing their attention in the middle of some kind of battlefield. It's only going to be worse. That is the best response I have ever heard for that critique. Thank you so much. That is so cool. Wow, did you hear that you hippies? There you go. That's so good. But the other thing I'll just say is that they're human beings and they suffer like the rest of us, they suffer. And I don't think these practices were intended to be exclusive to certain categories of people. Right. That's sort of my broader kind of view on this. So there's multiple reasons, but to say that it's complicated is true. I would just push back on some of the notions that military service members are intending to ensue violence or destruction. I mean, it ends up being what happens with a lot of what occurs in that line of work, but it's certainly not the intention. Some of the most peace promoting people are military service members because they know that what it takes, peace is not a default, peace is a lot of work. And some of the people that I've had the privilege of getting to know are actually military leaders who want peace and actually think that the army should be teaching more regarding peace building. So I just don't agree that we can ignore the fact that we are in a circumstance where we do live in a, at least in the US, a country that has a military. And by the way, it's not just that they'll go once with and make mistakes, it's that they're gonna go repeatedly over the course of their life. And this is going to be a proliferation of the challenge of this profession on their lives. So that's my take on it right now. A wonderful take. And you know, thank you for answering that. I really appreciate that. Another, your research really makes me think a lot about the future of technology and its ability to interface with the human brain. I'm so interested in those caps. And not just because what you're discovering, including what is like, almost like a description of processing speed within the human mind, which is incredible and gives a quantifiable, a way to quantify our brains and compare them to computers, neural networks. And I'm just interested in your thoughts about the future of the sort of technology Elon Musk is promoting or the possibility of it not just being a one way street necessarily. In other words, we gather the data with the caps or the MRIs or whatever machine we're using. But then based on that data, give some kind of feedback that isn't like self-imposed feedback, but it's technological feedback so that we can enhance cognition with machines. What are your thoughts on that? I mean, clearly that is one of the paths forward. And I'm sure people must be interested in it because assigning a human being to be in charge of their own attention span is not always gonna be effective. But if there was some way to, I don't know, some biofeedback mechanism, then it seems like people could become increasingly more efficient. Hey, do you have any thoughts on that? Oh, gosh. Yes, I would say that we are so primitive right now and understanding of the brain. And we were talking earlier about that number 50%. 50% is sort of the default of the way that our mind is not operating well. If you add in technological solutions, I mean, just think about where we are right now. We do not have self-driving cars and that's a relatively straightforward human activity. I mean, it's very complex, but it's still a known, concrete, discreet thing. We're nowhere near being able to solve that, let alone allow technology to guide knowing whether a human being is on task or off task in some way that the human, his or herself, their selves could evaluate. So my bet right now, because I'm 51 years old, the chances of me seeing a point in our technological advancement where we will understand enough about the brain and the brain's ability to interface with technology, I don't think we're gonna get there anytime soon. I think that it's all part of what's happening, but I actually think it's sort of the wrong-headed approach, meaning technology is not going to solve the thing that we have the capacity to do and we're not solving, which is an awareness of what is happening in our minds and in our environment moment by moment, something we call meta-awareness, right? So knowing the processes and contents of our mind in an ongoing manner is the thing that will allow us to know should I get back on task or not, or should I continue having this very brilliant idea I'm having or this creative insight I'm having. That is such a, that's the rich space of creativity or really the proliferation of things that will make us more depressed or solving problems in a creative collaborative manner. That is one of the most sophisticated things that humans can do and truly we can only do that ourselves. We barely understand how to do it ourselves, let alone now offload that on some piece of technology. So I would say we're pretty far from being able to do that and the more we think that that's the answer, the more we're trying to get ourselves off the hook from cultivating these capacities ourselves. Right, you know, because for whatever reason, cultivating these capacities sometimes is unpleasant and it's something about the practices that spiritual people call it. It's not always like a bed of roses, you know, when you're coming to learn about these processes. I'm really curious though to get a little deeper into this, you mentioned the flashlight, who's holding the flashlight? When I direct my attention, who's doing the directing? Right, great question. I wanna answer that question regarding sort of the emergent nature of what cognitive control is. And it's actually another area that my lab is very, very interested in. But one of the things I wanna just pick up on one point regarding the last thing we just discussed, which is this notion of meta-awareness, to say that if we devise technological solutions that are gonna give us an answer, are you on task or not? Get back on task. Let's say it was a little beep that you got that said, Matt, Duncan, get back to the thing you're trying to do. You know, Duncan, don't forget your, Duncan, you're about to forget your keys, don't do that. Right, the chances of technology picking it up are always going to be after the fact of something occurring in your own mind. So it's already too late. So we need a system that is going to actually, in a preparatory manner, and it actually gets to the question you just asked me, in a preparatory manner, be watching what's occurring to prevent or protect against the thing that is likely to be the error. Right. And I just don't think that we, I think we need to start with the technology that's already built in before we can do that as an objective outside of us solution. So I just wanted to kind of say that. Okay, well, I mean, okay, let's hang out there just for a little, a second longer there, just because it seems like the technology is already there. It's called every slot machine in Las Vegas. It's just being used in the wrong way to grab our attention. It's being used to manipulate us, hypnotize us, and like get us into a kind of pattern of giving our money to the machine. Or I think these, the things that you're picking up about the human attention of our, are being hijacked by AI and by technologies online. But, you know, my God, someone told me the horrifying amount of time that people on average spend on TikTok, for example, it's an incredible amount of time because it's so good at grabbing our mind. So it just seems like we could reverse engineer that somehow to, I don't know, facilitate the ability to guide our attention. Well, that's what I thought that's what you meant. What I was saying that we don't have the technological prowess to do, is to build AI that's going to make meta awareness, something we can offload. I think that is not likely to happen. Technology that can make our attention, very simple, because our attention is so reliable. It's like, oh, something threatening, boom, I'm gonna be over there. So it's the meta awareness piece that in some sense is sort of the pinnacle of our humanity in some ways. And I think that there's such a long way to go that we individually as human beings have to be able to cultivate that better. And until we can even be better at understanding what it is, how it worked within the individual ourselves, there's not even a chance that we can start developing an understanding of what that is to do it outside of us, nor do I think it's gonna be a good idea to do that because it will always be later than what it would be within us. And we don't have the room to prevent that, to prevent, I mean, sorry, we don't wanna wait. So essentially, let me just put it this way. If I gave you a piece of software that said, when you're about to make a mistake, I will let you know. Probably it's gonna be, you have already made the mistake by the time it's gonna let you know. Right. So if you could instead be watching to prevent the occurrence of that mistake, that would be even better. So anyway, and I think these are all things that are a great fodder for conversation and for development. My interest is in looking at the way the brain is now and what's in our hands right now. And in some sense, I'm much more oriented toward applied low-tech solutions that are very powerful and using the cutting edge science that we have to understand the nature of their power. Love it. Yeah, it's important. I mean, Lloyd, what are you gonna do? Sit around and wait for RoboCop or whatever? It's just not there, it's fun to ponder. But to get back to what we were about to jump into, who's holding the flashlight? So, okay, so the first thing to say, and I'm gonna answer at the relative level, and then we're gonna go into, I think the abstracts, at the kind of next level, somebody is holding the flashlight, but that's a different brain system. It's something we call executive control. Executive control is essentially the system that allows for the emergence of goals and the holding of goals, the maintaining and manipulating of goals. So in some sense, we'd say, oh, the executive control system is guiding the flashlight. It's the one that's telling the flashlight point here or there or shift or whatever. Then you might say, as a smart person like you would, well, who's telling executive control to do what it will? And I have that exact same question. I've had it for many, many years. Like, where the heck is this thing coming from? As an experimenter, most of our studies are we, as the experimenter, are leading the person to tell them what to do. And we'd say, look at this part of the screen or that part of the screen. Look at the face, not the house. And when we set the way that flashlight should be held in some sense, we see what the neural consequences of that are. And we've learned a lot there. But then the question becomes, what about the emergent nature of control itself? How does it emerge? And so a very simple way that I started thinking about it is, well, and again, a lot of my own practice and wisdom traditions have led me to these ideas. So it's kind of interesting when you can play around in the brain science space, but the thought and the considerations have been around for millennia. But this notion of a contingent, the contingent nature of reality becomes very, very interesting. So what I mean by that is how does our mind in one moment affect our mind in the next moment? So when we think about cognitive control, the ability to put our attention somewhere, one of the things that we know is that if our attention system was required to do something very demanding in one moment versus something that was not very demanding in one moment, there will be consequences for the next moment. So if I give you, let's just say, I'm gonna give you two types of trials, easy and hard. It's a working memory task. Remember one face or remember three faces. And then a few seconds later, I'm gonna test out if you remember the correct face, faces. Right. So it's easy and hard. What we know is if in this trial, I gave you the three face condition, you're really amping up. You're like there, you're trying to control your mind. And then now I look to see what happens the next trial. Regardless of what happened in the next trial, you're gonna be better. Your performance is gonna be higher when the previous trial was highly demanding versus not. Wow. And it's this notion of up-regulation of control. So the brain sort of readies itself. It's ready to go. And sometimes I'll kind of joke with my grad students. I'm like, it's like the electric stove model of the brain. You know, I'm an old electric stoves. I have an induction cooktop now, but you turn on the stove, it takes a while for the coils to heat up. And then even if you turn it off, they're still hot. So it's like that. We ramp up control. We don't need it anymore, but it's still hot. And that allows for there to be benefits in the next condition. That is incredible. So the idea would be if you have some demanding task ahead of you, a test, a performance or something like that, you will benefit from prior to that task, putting your brain through some kind of strenuous cognitive exercise. Potentially. Now remember, what I'm talking about is literally seconds between trials. Okay. And now, so this is where this notion of demand and performance is a very interesting relationship. And we might even say it's like a inverted U. So when demand is very, very low. So think of like a graph. On the X axis, I've got the level of demand or even say the level of stress that I experienced. And on the Y axis, I've got performance. When the demand is low, performance is low. As the demand ramps up, there is a sweet spot. That U is gonna, the inverted U is gonna have a little point. And at that point, you're gonna be very, very high on your performance. If you push past that, you're now gonna start declining. Diminishing returns. So there'll be diminishing returns. So the notion of what controls the controller, the answer is it's emergent, I think. It's an emergent evolving process. And we are constantly our own executive control and we're our own flashlight and we're doing all of these things and there's a feedback loop. So the complexity gets intense fast, but it's the right question to ask because in some sense, if you start realizing, the notion of my ability to pay attention is within my own hands. And what I do in the next moment is tied to my awareness of how I'm engaging my attention. All of a sudden, there's a freedom there. It's like, I have a choice point. I don't have to just keep going on what I just did. I can actually intervene multiple times, which actually relates back to your point regarding AI. If we can do that with our online attention and make multiple choice points, the chances of us being able to recalibrate, not stay on TikTok for 11 hours on end is probably gonna improve. Wow, it's so cool. It's been almost, it has been an hour. Do you have time for one more question? Thank you. I'm sorry, I know you're a scientist. I have scientists on the show. I feel like I frustrate them because my mind, I'm just very interested in the paranormal and very interested in my own personal experiences with things that seem incredibly anomalous as far as how I understand the default, or how default reality understands the working of the human mind. Well, I don't want you to apologize for that because that is sort of our role as scientists is to try to discover what truth is. And it can be messy because some things that people experience don't fit into the current paradigm, but that means probably the paradigm's wrong. Oh, right, that's what, I mean, that's the sense is like, anyone who has maybe worked with a teacher or has had an encounter with someone who has like, whatever you want to say, has probably experienced things that it's like, that's impossible. Like not like, oh, this is a, what do they call it, confirmation bias, but like, there's just no way that, Ram Dass talks about it and his encounters with Neem Karoli Baba. But when you talk about the immeasurable, quantifiable sort of energy that is happening in the human brain to the point where we know, you were saying in that TED talk, it's like at the back of your head where there's like literal parts of the brain where facial recognition is taking place and an associated energy there, isn't it possible that some via some mechanism we don't understand yet? And without those like shower, technological shower caps that I could somehow read the energy moving through your brain and from whatever that intuitive thing was, give the impression that I'm reading your mind or that I have extra sensory perception? I mean, a lot is possible. Right. A lot is possible. What I would say is, and I agree with you, those Neem Karoli Baba stories are so compelling and you're like, what the heck? And the respect for Ram Dass himself, I mean, he's no chump, he's a scientist, right? Yeah. So he himself had to grapple with that, which I found, I just found fun, because I'm like, you know, you figure that out. Like, how are you thinking about that kind of thing? But what I would say is, here's the challenge, right? So we can make as scientists, we can make all kinds of claims, we can make all kinds of models. Really the test is a reproducibility so that we can actually have an idea, test it out and see if that idea is supported or not. And when I hear of these incredible stories, I just wish we could figure out a way to harness their occurrence. So it wasn't just the random chance thing that happens every now and then, or it happens in some distant land by people that are no longer alive, right? That's the tricky one. It's like, well, what about now? Bring them into our land. So I really feel that the more we can interface with people and ideas that don't fit the current models of the brain as the factory for consciousness, well, let's start testing those out. I mean, I'm not scared of that. What I'm interested in is what's actually going on. What is the, are we gonna be able to grasp the nature of even consciousness? You know, right now our models are, and we are making progress in this area, but it's still within this framework that, yes, of course, the brain is the generator of conscious experience. The alternative model from a lot of other wisdom traditions is that the brain is sort of like an antenna for consciousness, and that's what allows people to do these things that appear like mind reading or non-local kind of stuff, et cetera. So if this alternative model has enough, we have enough experience with it as human beings, well, then it should be able to be something we can, as presuming that we have the technology to pick it up, we should be able to check it out, and we just need enough participants, and we need it to happen on demand enough so that we can test it out. But the only reason I would say that that isn't the dominant model right now is because we have not been able to do that reliably with reaching a threshold of evidence that most scientists would say, yeah, yeah, that's definitely the case. Building models and breaking them apart is the nature of science, so we should always be ready for that, and holding on to any view is just, it's not really in the spirit of what science actually is.

I can't talk about it right now because it's still in production But it involves led lights and the powers of the occult All right, that's it for me friends. We are going to jump right into this episode today's guest has been on the podcast once before You probably know him because he is the creator of the greatest cartoon of all time Adventure time and here he is with us today Everybody, please spread as much love energy as you can out into the aether sphere Through the invisible hummingbirds of the astral plane and down into the sweet glorious genius heart of today's guest Pendleton ward You Pendleton hold on let me change headphones. He's Suck man. They're so tight on my ears. Hold on a second The buzz man, I like the buzz now. I'm sorry about the buzz. I but no the buzz is uh relevant You know, how is it relevant? Uh, because we were talking about um Existence preceding essence right and the essence is the buzz Okay, if we could just uh If we could just get rid of the buzz Right, we'd be in a bliss blissful state is um this buzz in buddhism The term I've heard for it is fundamental dissatisfaction that at the base of most human activity You will find yourself inevitably thwarted with a kind of Depending on what's going down Uh a sense of dismay That no matter how good the thing is this is when you're like your friends throw like the really nice party And the great food is there And the whatever the thing that it's supposed to be amazing is happening is happening or or maybe you go on the perfect vacation The whatever it is whatever you are you're conditioned to think okay, this is it we are in Tahiti or wherever sitting on a Beautiful beach the the water is the same temperature as a hot tub man Fruity drinks coming in Some beautiful Romance happening maybe and yet if you do a scan of yourself You will still find the buzz the buzz No way to get rid of the buzz is there Well, you tell me right? I mean I don't I'm so like I I kind of look to you for answers like that Like how do you how do you stop? um How do you stop you feeling your sense of self like you're How do you how do you how do you become like nothingness? Is that is that even the Is that even a goal to people have that goal? Well to be nothing. Yeah Well, you can't be nothing because you're something you're something. Yeah So that's the problem like you're you're if we can be nothing Or set I guess uh, yeah, I guess we're gonna I mean everyone's gonna be nothing. It's um, sorry everybody Everyone's gonna be nothing sooner or later. That's the dream That's the great dream being nothing is better than having everything in the world because you're you're To become a nothing what you're completely freed From all responsibility All karmic debt all guilt all memory no matter what you've done if this is true Then executing a mass murderer is actually the very worst thing you could do Because you have redeemed them are the best thing you could do Well, the problem is if you if the your the point of the execution is the ultimate punishment, right? I mean in a nice way like there's a best thing. Well, it would be it would be an act of true love Which would be like let me free you. Yeah from there from the awful Prison of ego that you're in that's gotten you to the point where you have to kill people Wow, can you imagine like if people said those kinds of words before executions? They would be a lot different And they'd be a lot they would probably be a little more sad And the person being executed would probably feel a little more terrible Because they're in such a compassionate universe that people are like look this burden that you've accrued We can think of no other way to free you from it Then then by stopping your biological processes So it went that it went that wrong and we're freeing you but it's usually like kill that mother fucker He shot my sister in the face. Yeah, you know, but I think that uh one of the things the um the Hare Krishna is the founder of the Hare Krishna's Prabhupāda said Is that Death Is god for the atheist so for an atheist the annihilation of the self is your contact with the transcendent and um the illusion or the the dream of The atheist or the I guess the the Nihilist Is that upon expiration? There is a nothingness Which in nothingness is a Dream because we've only experienced something this You can't measure nothingness The measuring of nothingness turns it into a somethingness So to fantasize about there being a nothingness after death Is the is a very sophisticated version of heaven if you ask me Hmm um You're talking about atheists believing in Or that was it's their first would uh, how'd you put it? It was their first it's their first contact with the divine the divine. Um the transcendent made me think about uh, Neil deGrasse Tyson because on his His showed on star talk the one where he filmed it live Not the radio one. He talked to uh Priest And Priest was a really cool guy. He was talking he you know at some point. He made a lot of sense because neil um Neil was kind of laughing a little bit and skeptical of right Rules like rules that's that keep people from Because he keeps talking about how science is this thing that that's always expanding and rewriting itself It's all theory That hardens into fact, which is facts are these amorphous things right and that's and that's why he felt so confident about science Um as a philosophy. I don't those aren't his words. I don't think he would call it that but anyway, uh, so at some point Neil deGrasse Tyson was talking about his love of the cosmos and He talks about it with such passion and It like fills fills him up and it like makes his heart swell um And he was describing that to the priest and the priest said that's that's just how I feel about God and that in God is this thing that we don't entirely understand and uh I don't know how to explain it. That's beautiful. That's it. I think it and I understood it in that moment like It's something I hadn't understood. I don't think Yeah, well, this is the uh, the the problem is you you end up with a one camp Demanding the other camp Use the same symbol system that is inducing awe in your life To induce awe in their life. That's where the problems happen A theist might say listen. Yeah, this mathematical Equation that is producing this never-ending fountain of non-repeating numbers is coming from the mind of the creative Force in the universe the god at that is instantly negating itself annihilating itself and renewing itself In nanoseconds again and again and again dying and being reborn as a completely new And more incredible thing in every second just as a product of what it is That's pi for the theist But for the atheist pi is like this is an incredible thing Do you not see this infinite string of non-repeating numbers? How beautiful that is that we have that in this universe two different ways of talking about Different ways may be talking about sorry to interrupt the finding solace in like mystery or finding solace in like The question of of purpose or something. That's that's how I usually chill out is when I think about how I don't know we don't know And that's as good as we know And then I'm like, oh, I've reached the the pinnacle of what we know, which is that we don't know And now I'm safe. I feel safe because I can live in this area where I'm at the edge of My I lost my train of thought Well, you're you're I don't even know if edge is the right word I mean it's the edge is great But it's when you sort of go through the edge and end up in this completely other zone of Of novelty that's where the magic happens, you know for whatever way you get there It's all forgivable. I mean if you think that Your way of science or your way of religion or there's some superior way then I don't know that seems That seems like you're missing the point which is when when we we gather together In this very specific place That is mysterious and most importantly new Right. This is the quality Like, you know The morning Depending on where you live smells a certain way when you go outside and you breathe in morning air It's somehow to me. It's different than the nighttime air somehow. It's a it's a different thing A baby when you're checking out a baby It's glowing in a way that things that aren't a baby don't necessarily glow And uh, that's novelty brand new newness newness new. This is a new thing that moment You meet somebody And you realize oh shit. We're gonna be more than friends Uh that first moment that the moment it kind of comes into your mind. You're like, whoa, wait, wait You're the next Lover I'm gonna have in my life Maybe the last It's matt. It's the most incredible moment. That's that is the fragrance of god I think that's what I uh That's what I I feel like i'm living for right now is whenever I make a connection with someone Whenever I can like look into someone's eyes. I kind of I understand them and they understand me and there's a connection that's made um, feel it fills me up makes me feel like um Uh This just sounds cheesy, but life is worth living. I feel like that connection is what hope Hope is hope the right word. Maybe not. I don't know if that's hope. That's what I get. I get hope when I well coming from the perspective of if You have been away from that experience Looking in another person's eyes making the connection Okay, like china have you seen that new amazing radio satellite that they have not Radio telescope that they've built it's the most it's the largest uh God, you know, I should read deeper into these web articles so I could explain them without sounding like a total dumb ass But it's the biggest scanning mechanism to look for extraterrestrial life on the planet right now. Wow and um um You know for for a planet That's tender. I guess right like that's us swiping Through a never in an unintelligible That's you're talking about a like a fireplace. I'm so out of the loop. I guess We're swiping we're swiping through unintelligible blasts of uh of radio frequencies that Don't seem to come from any intelligent life because on a planetary level if we can contact anything that is Equally more or even less intelligent than us Then it transforms history forever on the geologic scale on the Special scale everything changes the moment we get a hey, what's up wait fuck wait what? You do we did it too wait what what that changes everything Everything so on an interpersonal level We end up around a bunch of people But we when you're scanning them sometimes you're like, I don't know if you're the We're not this thing that you're doing is way different than the thing i'm doing So when you do make contact like what you're saying It's one of the most glorious sacred holy moments that can happen in a person's life Right because where I mean this is something I think about and maybe I tried to express it the last time I was I was talking on your podcast, but and I still don't really know how to say it, but the We're in I keep thinking that we're insular beings by nature like we don't know We only know as far as I said these exact same words last time when I stumbled Yeah Really know as far as the boundaries of our mind and body like we're We're not the Borg we don't have this like well, maybe some people it's like a connection, but I don't and so I feel like I'm I can only Perceive what other people are thinking based on what I've thought in my life like I've stacked up my identity From my experiences in life and I can only relate to people through those experiences Um, and that's like the root of like why no one can uh why people don't Understand each other or agree with each other because we're all Stuck in our own bodies. I can't remember why I brought this up. You said talking something about oh the connection Which is this beautiful thing that happens when you look in someone else's eyes and you know That they're listening to you and you're listening to them and you and uh, I mean some of my favorite talks are with people Who and you can relate to this lack that don't have judgment? Like they're listening to you and they're speaking with you and they're not Judging you which is totally bizarre. Yeah, you know, it's not normal. What what? So it's not normal. So what would you compare it to? Uh, I can't I don't know. What do you uh, um I don't know. I don't know what you mean. I don't know how to compare it to anything because there's nothing to compare it to It's incomparable This trick trick question It's like a one of the coolest things That ragu marcus who runs the rom dasis foundation told me is He was in india and he met I can't remember her name the saint and uh he said like they were walking across a courtyard or something and she uh walked up to him and looked at him and smiled And then walked away and he said it's not like a human Came up to me. It's more like you're in the forest and a deer Comes up to you. Yeah, like this isn't a person It's in a person's body But it's not a person anymore. Whatever it is is just loving everything it's seeing and I think what you're talking about Is uh to me if a person is looking upon me And not judging me Usually what they're doing is loving me Is it loving or like is it when a deer's looking at you? Is it just sort of accepting that you're there? It's just sort of like knowing that you are in front of it and that's and that's maybe less Judgment even than loving you. Is that crazy to say? I think it's deer plus. Okay It's like So it's like I mean, we know From the materialistic standpoint that what when we look at a human being You're looking at just a swirl of matter like this matter is very temporarily Coalescing in this very complex harmonized thing called a human being We know that how can that be wrong like when I look at a And maybe we've talked about it in the podcast before but like when a tornado hits and kills A lot of people you never hear on the news evil tornado That tornado was a real bad thing. It should be ashamed of itself that it would destroy a community It's just a tornado heads It's just a a a natural phenomena yet a human A human is a thing that feels shame even though It's mostly Just a swirl of phenomena that's come together and that has an identity. So maybe the deer part Is a surrender or recognition of the fact that well, I'm surrounded by these little meat cyclones That are temporarily calling themselves a name and seem to be intent on some Goal that there is their life dream or whatever. It's okay. That's the sort of nullification of Any real importance to whatever that may be in other words, it's no more important than watching the way of fire flickers And on top of that You're like and I'm going to love it. Yeah I'm going to fall in love with every single flicker of fire Every sunset sunrise every moon Full moon half moon Every gust of wind that blows I'm going to love it Like it's my child I don't know theory. That's theory. Um, deer plus and that's a choice. I think um, well, I don't what do you think about this like the the the love part of that equation is is a choice that we make to To love something because we are capable of that potent level of loving Everything, I don't know. Um, um, I think about that a lot like I can choose who I want to be And I've chosen who I've wanted to be my entire life. Like I've stacked up my identity To become the me that I am right now and It was I feel like it was more conscious than I know or more conscious than most people know about Um people, uh, I'm losing my train of thought again. Um, does that make any sense? Yeah, well, I mean, I think that like you're sort of uh Maybe what you're saying is like you're kind of like the the the aware part of yourself is maybe the tip of an iceberg on a more Maybe there's some other like right right now I'm choosing to sort of speak quietly And maybe it's because there's a microphone right in front of my lips But it's also because it's how I want to present myself right and that's something that I've Come to understand about myself over time Um, they're you know, uh, I've I've spoken loudly before And I didn't like that me when I was speaking really loudly and I like And that's because I I equate that with being obnoxious And I don't want to be obnoxious So I've made some sort of conscious choice to turn the new to turn me into this person that's going to Speak at this like volume level And that's just one part of who I've chosen to be and your your physical body Is speaking at a low volume level and yet and yet The impact that you've had On a great many lives Exceeds The loudest of people So the maybe your physical self is like quiet yet you you Pendleton have produced a thing That is called adventure time right that for a lot of kids and adults is Going to be one of the one one one of the defining Elements of their life like it like for me, you know what it was? Peanuts George Schultz You know what I mean? Like we we've we've Schultz not the not the legume when I was a kid We'd gather around a bowl of peanuts I was waiting for that that was god For me it was peanuts I was like awesome. Tell me tell me more It's just the way they look the shell Dimpled yeah, you break it open. You know, man. It's like yeah, yeah, Charles Schultz You can't I mean you I think of anyone. Maybe you do understand, but like I can remember You know how I figured out what year my parents got divorced I thought about the movies that we watched during that year And how much those movies meant to me in the midst of this terrible turbulent time How it was Annie And poltergeist those came out and man that was like to have that Port and a storm of insanity to connect to Was so important So this thing that you brought into the world Inadvertently or intentionally or whatever Regardless how quiet your physical form is It's for so many it was yeah, it was loud It's loud. Yeah, I was I was trying to be loud. I wanted to pitch a tv show. I wanted to broadcast my ideas to A nation of people I wanted an audience I don't think I knew exactly why I don't think most people know why they want they like Crave more twitter followers. So they crave more Facebook friends, right people like those those tweets that are just like follow me They're just like yeah tacking on to other people and saying like follow me. Yeah on vine and everything. Yeah Yeah, what uh, you think that's what it was you really think it was The the the the the the the Butterfly, you know, they say a hurricane starts with a butterfly wing A butterfly flaps in some place it off the hurricane. So the thing behind adventure time was a kind of Un ego something. Yeah, right my cat. How could it be anything else? Well, this is one of my favorite verses in the Bhagavad Gita is when Krishna is talking about the People who come to him It isn't very romantic. It's not like those who come to me are the wise the loving the open it's uh One of them is like people seeking fame people seeking glory people seeking this or that but the movement in the direction of Krishna, which is a word that represents the ultimate of ultimates the the the The thing that sophistication originates from Or that when they say high tech The thing that high tech Is birthed from that that place the movement in the direction of that thing Causes a disintegration of the initial motivation to get to that thing So as you get closer to the thing itself, whatever reason you had for Venturing towards it begins to be eroded or melted away because you realize that whatever you thought you wanted Pails in comparison to this beautiful thing that you're in the direct that you're Getting close to yeah, reaching is the wrong approach that's uh Yeah, yeah, there's no the destination itself begins to transform the pilgrim So as the pilgrim moves towards the thing Whatever the pilgrims every think of a pilgrim You know the i'm going to go to the stones of zafgar to free myself of the guilt of what i did to my mother Well, if the stones of zafgar are truly powerful and have some Magnificent force around them zafgar. Yeah, you know those stones. Yeah as you get closer to them then Your original reason for wanting to get there will begin to transform Maybe not even by the power of the stones themselves But by the company of the pilgrims that you begin to meet as you get closer and closer to the thing So then the initial greedy motivation becomes transformed in the process You know and wouldn't you say that like In the process of creating adventure time you you must have experienced some form of transformation Sure. Well, I mean it's been a long time. It's been uh like seven years or longer eight years or something so Yeah, um Oh shoot. I lost my train of thought. Well the question is The i'm saying regardless of your intention for creating this epic thing Yeah, wouldn't you say that once you began to create the thing itself you must have I'm guessing there must have been a lot of like Life changes that uh Yeah um Now i'm like Think over thinking like what i'm trying to say. Um Shoot uh I'm like self editing like while i'm thinking what two years three years in You look at the thing that you're making Even with this this podcast And i'm not in any way trying to compare it to this thing that you create which is insanely beautiful But even with this thing I think What the fuck is this? What am I doing? What am I saying? Why what's it coming from and what is my motivation behind it? Yeah, I can speak to that because I mean so, yeah television at least right now we have about a week to come up with a story and Really, it's more like maybe three days on top of all the other things that we're doing at the same time so Yeah, you really It's pretty tricky to like mine your soul and you know, I've I've borrowed those words from jesse moinehan who talks about and and Mining his soul to Find something worth saying Right, you know once a week right which is you know, that's you can't do it every week. That's huge especially Not stopping for Eight years seven years however long we've been doing this It's hard. That's uh, it's hard to do it. And I think we fail sometimes of course you have to But sometimes we don't and that stuff gets on tv, which is really cool. And that's the That's that's what makes me excited about adventure time as a project that we get to Find something really personal and put it on television, which is a place that's like full of trash like television is is a Uh It sounds snobby to call it a wasteland like television. You know, I mean who I think most people agree That's uh, there's a bunch of garbage on tv Man when I that's one of my favorite things about going to hotels because I don't have cable So when I go to hotels, that's usually like at least a month between hotel visits and every time I turn on the tv and every time I'm astounded by how wretched It is I not not, you know, not the great shows. There are some great shows, but the stuff in between it's it's Appalling but not not a not even appalling at the level that it would make an appalling thing good It's like this. It's like someone if you could push a stethoscope Into some hell realm And convert like the random fluttering Of the wings of some lower demon Into a visual field That's what tv is like the rustling of demon wings turned into some kind of like Thing it's that bad or the the sting of a hornet turned into like something that's supposed to be entertaining So yes, I think called tv a wasteland and that's not even a stretch like I've went home for thanksgiving and watched tv and it was like These dudes like shooting pigs with automatic machine guns from a helicopter and just being like fuck. Yeah And then the pigs would like die and fall on their face and then like flop forward and do a bunch of flips and they be like Oh, yeah Yeah Yeah, man. This is the I I've got a bow right back there. You can look at it right there hoit. Yep, and uh hoit Uh, I used to like them. I followed them on twitter. I like to shoot a bow. I like my bow. It's a hoit bow But they've got the most noxious Fucking youtube channel you've ever seen Which is like this is what we call a slip and get where like they Shoot something with a With an arrow The arrow hits it causing it to slide in the mud as it dies And then some red net gallops up and like picks it up by the neck. We got a slip and get or like look at it Here comes a double tumble blood tumble You know where it's like they're reducing the murder of these creatures to a kind of like uh like comedic Uh A comedic like what was the name of that terrible show not it wasn't always bad But the one where they people would send in videos of like Dads getting kicked in the nuts by goats America's funniest home videos. It's like that but with death. Yeah Yeah, so yes, I think it's safe to call TV a wasteland I feel I feel uh, it's such a dumb Thing that I feel bad about expressing uh opinions like that like even a broad opinion like calling tv a wasteland I'm like, oh, some people like tv and they're not gonna like they're gonna be mad mad at me No, it's gonna get mad. I think anyone will hear them. Like yeah, mostly it's a wasteland outside of like a few shows That transcend the medium just like any other great art form where suddenly it's like, oh, yeah tv isn't a wasteland like when I watch Look, I love game of thrones when I watch game of thrones. It's a great show I look forward to it gives me something to be excited about on sundays Also, the night of was a really good show. I don't know if you saw that It's really good, but there are some good great shows that emerge That transcend the medium. So yeah, it's a wasteland. You don't have to feel snobby or weird about that at all. That's an accurate if well, I want to stop being I want to stop feeling bad about saying like opinions especially brought up like vague opinions like that that aren't even that offensive like I wish I could sort of say them openly like and that's I mean, I told you earlier. That's one reason why I wanted to come but like podcast again and like as a as a exercise of Like saying things to an audience and not feeling crummy about it the next day Right. Well, I think it's it can be cathartic I think to realize that I on one of these podcasts I admitted to getting a hand job from a masseuse and uh I felt really like gross about it guilty and uh And like worried about talking about it because it really is like uh and now I I know even more about like How fucked up the sex Businesses and how like shit man like people get sucked into that business that Don't want to be there at all. So so I do feel like even more Weirded out by the fact that I did it, but I did do it like I paid a masseuse to jerk me off in a room With a with a Like I'll never I actually took a picture with my phone, but I don't have that phone anymore But there's a picture of a dog. Yeah, kind of watching you judgmentally As this is happening like it's it's it's a we it's like really dark, but uh I remember like being very nervous about talking about it on the podcast because it's so depraved And then saying it and then getting all these tweets from people saying you really feel Yeah Guilty I love it. It's one of the great things about america right you could did with it Oh, sorry. Go ahead. No, please. Well, and you know, I listen to that and whenever I'm listening to you admit something Like I feel great inside like I feel sort of the same probably relief that maybe your experience. I feel like Um, I don't know I empathize with it and it just feels awesome When I'm listening to you talk and especially when you're like getting something off your chest Like I just feel great inside and then also it must feel wonderful to hear people Just like be like that's what whatever, you know, whatever you feel bad about that's bullshit bullshit. Don't even Like like you were just saying like This is this is This is why We need a community. Yeah, and this is why We're as a planet. We're building these massive pie dishes in the middle of mountains to try to find aliens So maybe we can say to them or you guys this fucked up And if you're not can you help us be less fucked up? But in the same way, it's I think I think there is a A a really if you want to talk about true blasphemy, it's giving the impression that a human life is not Something that is constantly riddled with failure and embarrassment secrets False starts and mostly confusion It's giving the impression that a human being is this kind of Laser focused animal Filled with some singular intention completely moving in the direction of some Invented goal that is an imaginary but makes sense and will have some impact On the world to put forth that concept of a human life is to torment All of us who are mostly hobbling through the world going through varying states of confusion And uh disequilibrium with maybe a few spectacular moments of clarity That can be measured in milliseconds You know a couple of moments are like, oh wait Yeah, those moments are just This is so proud. I recognize them when they happen those moments of clarity And I'd revel in them like I'm like I'm happy. Yeah, I'm happy right now. I'm just like Oh, it's like when you're flying in a dream. You're like, I'm flying a dream. Oh And uh, I'll just revel in it for as long as it as it lasts as like this really pure feeling of Just Uh, I don't know. Maybe happy is the right word. That's the best word. Happy is the right word I mean, that's the word we have for it right now And it's you know, it's an adequate word though I don't think it like Encaps like there's certain words that like really encapsulate what they're pointing in the direction of like take the word noxious this word It sounds noxious like the word itself. It's got an x in it When I talk about a noxious fume I'm talking about a fume that like It's not just a stink You know what I mean? It's like when there's a fart There's like a yeah, that stinks. It goes away. You're fine noxious This will make you keel over like this is like you open up a dumpster filled with like Rotting chicken or something and the word itself Noxious It sounds like the thing it's pointing to happy No way man In no way does that word encapsulate the experience Of that of what it points in the direction of yeah, it should be like a musical note or like a song or something like Right that should be the word for uh that great little that great little time That is it That really is it like that note That is it because what what's inside that note is not just relief But satisfaction like when you hit that level of happiness, there's like this sense of like I did it There's a feeling of satisfaction behind it um music can really I look uh just thinking about music. I love how it can really take you out of Wherever your mind's that I've been around people when they're really troubled and one time it occurred to me to like sing Sing a song, you know, it just breaks everything breaks it down and then you're just wrapped up in This rhythm that we're like innately drawn to You cannot underestimate the power if you're in a this is actually something I learned from Terrence McKenna He was he says when you're having a really bad mushroom trip Sing just start singing and From that I'm like wait if that works for a mushroom trip Can it just work for a bad day right? Yeah, and it does yeah If you're having a shitty day and you just start singing to yourself. Yeah Oh, sorry, I'm gonna take I was I was gonna take it to like a sadder idea Uh because lately I've been just smiling um In an effort to like Cheer cheer my day up if I'm feeling real low I'll just like smile and I've because I feel like I heard that somewhere where you just smile and then you'll feel And it works sometimes, but I've also noticed that smiling going straight from frown to smiling is something that Uh trump does all the time. Oh no Have you seen him because when he's talking he'll go I just like lift his lift his lips up, you know Um, so that's also something I think about well, I mean we're gonna like, you know I think that the the sun shines on the good and the bad alike and the good and the bad alike and smile Uh and and try to like cause the dopamine uh the rush of serotonin or dopamine or whatever it may be And there have been times when I do that smile In the midst of like an absolute like I'll be really fucking pissed and like I'll try to do a fake smile It just doesn't work like it's like a the intention behind it is really important It's like when trump is smiling it appears it it's like Not all the time I've seen him smile I feel like in a genuine way sometimes I'm I always catch it. I'm like, oh that looks like a genuine one But a lot of the time it's this like thing that goes from zero to a hundred and this weird this weird way Or he's like just like rips it up Yeah, you the difference between a real smile and a fake smile is the difference between Someone picking up a feather and someone picking up a Barbell that weighs 80 pounds It's like one of them just is a natural sort of like oh look it's simple The other one like when trump is shit smiling It looks like somebody like binge pressing 300 pounds like his cheeks are attached to a barbell and each cheek weighs Thousands of pounds and he's exerting all of his soul's energy to push those things up from the Frigid dark stasis of whatever Greedy hell is swirling and it's fucking maniacal skull So it's a different thing But sometimes when I'm like lifting those weights it does feel really heavy, which is why I think Singing's more effective. Yeah, singing Just making up a song about your day And even if the song itself Is a song of sadness About your day it can still turn it into an ecstatic sadness, which is something I learned from Terrence McKenna as well, which is he says the Ecstasy is not limited to joy They're ecstatic states of sadness ecstatic states of guilt ecstatic states of horror ecstatic states of fear It it it runs the gamut of all potential Cognitive experiences But the difference between an ecstatic state of joy or horror An ecstatic state of bliss or disequilibrium is that it's so incredible That the thing is pointing you in the direction of the transcendent whereas rudimentary day-to-day depressive boredom or sadness or hopelessness despair or even fake happiness biting into some kind of like I don't know thing that's supposed to taste good. Yeah These things are pointing in the direction of matter Oh matter will make you happy or wool is making you sad, you know two very very different states. I think yeah, yeah Penn, but here's the um Here we bet we haven't even gotten into what we were going to talk about right which is uh speaking of ecstatic states Um, and it's something actually I know you're working on this Yeah, but I never know what you're what the specifics are that you're working on Can you talk about what you're working on in the world of virtual reality right now? Yeah, I can try um, I keep well I keep I mean, I don't I don't even know what I'm working on a lot of time too because I'm I'm constantly changing my mind because it's such a Uh Fertile like medium it's so it's so new And there's so much potential That it's hard to land on an idea to execute this Like when you start thinking about it your mind goes a mile a minute because I know you want to do um Vr christ a vr christ Simulation which I you know, I keep thinking like I could put that together for you on an afternoon Which I I'd like to do that So that you could just even something like really basic that you could it mean a lot put up Yeah, it would take like two seconds. I feel uh, I'll so I want to do that and it'd be fun to put it up Please pen. Yeah. Um, this is the thing people need to experience. Yeah um I keep thinking of uh, I want to tangent now into like tangent Bible stuff because is there's a I think like there's a part in the bible where the The angels necks go up reach up to um our shoulders maybe reach up to The heavens or heads, you know, I don't know why I'm asking you this specific detail I'm hoping that you know it, but I feel like I've read it once Um, and that's something I also wanted to put in there too. Anyway Did the angels with like extending necks or I feel like it was either the heads necks or shoulders that reached up to the heavens And that was in one instance of uh The bible the closest things I got to it is not angels In the hell of hungry ghosts, which is a bardo in the Tibetan book of the dead these beings have massive appetites But these tiny little necks that attach to like big old mouths. Yeah, so if they want to eat It it doesn't matter how hungry they are because they can only swallow like little particulates like crumbs because that's how big their necks are A mess Um, cool the uh, you say yeah, so vr So, uh, I love vr. I don't know you've maybe you've only you've just begun like sort of talking about vr On on your podcast and it's so much fun listening to you talk about it with the people that come on um It's something that I want everyone to experience Because and it's something that you can talk about Uh forever, but until Someone tries it. They can't understand How like radical it is. It's like talking about a dream or something. Does someone who has an experience right? That's like boring is boring as fuck. Yeah, it's like you're telling someone a dream and you're like really enthusiastic about it And they're just like shut please shut the fuck up. Yeah, um, and I've experienced that a lot Uh, because I love vr and I keep trying to make people try it. Um, but once they try it doesn't matter how uh, How old they are or how averse to technology they are Um, they just so we've talked about this giggle that pours out of people when they're trying it It's like this all their defenses drop And they and they can't help themselves From going It's this cute little like innocent laughter that just comes out of people when they're trying virtual reality for the first time And it happens all the time and I keep I wait for it when I'm putting someone through it for the first time and um anyway, so it's it's It's it's pat powerful. It's and it's um Transportive and it's uh, and I feel like those are the The strongest words that I can use to describe it You you really do your eyeballs really are telling your brain where you are in space right and people call it existing In dual realities because you know that you're in someone's living room Like you have a set up here. I know that I would be here, but my brain would also simultaneously know that I was inside Uh An infinite fractal space like the thing you just showed me right which is like you know, you know, or you're inside of whatever Jurassic park or whatever anyone's making in the virtual world. You're also there your brain thinks that you're there Uh, and it's shocking, right? shocking and you've uh Yeah, I don't know. Do you have any thoughts I I'm gonna stop well. Yeah. Well because yes, it's it's a um it it's Well, it's it's shocking because it's it's teleportation for one It's it's something most people No one is experienced outside of dreaming Which is like to suddenly be in a completely new place. Yeah with zero Uh, but completely conscious Of this experience. Yeah, so it's almost a form of time travel in the sense that if you want to get from point A to point B There's always going to be some temporal element to that journey from point A to point B No matter what it is get from your chair to the bathroom or from your chair to southeast asia There's a certain number of beats that are going to happen between you and there, right? VR So suddenly there is no Time at all and so and you're instantaneously in a completely new zone. Yeah, and you can and within that zone you can manipulate Uh, not just the space that you believe that you're in but but time time itself sometimes because I've heard about experiments where Um and VR you can control how fast the sun moves And a lot of people who are using VR are experiencing Lost time which I've experienced too When I was playing sound self which Something I'd also like to talk about because that's my favorite experience. Um Right now. Can you describe sound self? Yeah, it's hard. I think so. I think I can it's hard to describe maybe Yeah So uh So it's a it's a game that's driven by your voice and that coaches you to make these long drawn out sounds that influence the visuals inside the game this this kaleidoscopic visuals that um mover uh I don't know but I so but it's so much more than that because Of the nature of VR and because of the the the transport of qualities that it has like you're not just looking into a kaleidoscope You're like traveling through Uh An alternate reality really. I mean it's through something through abstract Space through abstract ideas That has as its seed your voice. Yeah, this yeah and your voice Is influencing these visuals you're you're saying oh It coaches you to make these long drawn out sounds and to breathe and just breathing In a game in a game that tells you to take a deep breath um Is already like fucking up your reality as you know it I think because it's it's uh to tell Just like if you did it right now if you're driving the car and you're listening to this podcast if you breathe in You Automatically are already feeling better and it happens every time right and this game is telling you to do that So you so you're already feeling Different at the very least and I don't know is there is a better way to talk about it? Well, I mean you're you're the the the thing itself is to see an instantaneous result from whatever Thing you're intoning is a pretty spectacular thing because usually the way You know if you want to here's how you try sound self without virtual reality Go out to eat with your friends And start talking shit about somebody and watch the way that your friends react You'll see the reflection of the sound you made and the kind of diminishing Quality of your friends interaction you'll see that they're going to either chime in when the sound you made By making equal sounds talking shit about this person Maybe they'll try to like avoid the subject change it But whatever you'll in the same way that like if when you watch the time lapse footage of bread moldering You know like or fruit rotting you can watch when you get around your friends and start talking about how shitty the world is You can watch in a very small way Them wither with the sound that you're making because you're affirming a shit universe. So to have like this like visual representation of that so that what the noises you make get replicated in some Mysterious way, which I have no idea. They're doing it. I don't know either It's what it's teaching you is that your sounds have power. Yeah, and that's a very valuable lesson Um, the coolest thing that happened to me was at some point Uh, I felt like I saw a creature. I felt like I saw like it might have been like 200 meters away And it was this floating entity And I stopped making sounds. I was really Engaged and I was really felt you know, I was uh I've been making sounds for about 15 minutes. Yeah, so Um And when I saw the thing far away, I shut up and I just watched it for a while And then uh, can you describe what it looked like? It was it was it was constantly changing and it was it was White or gray ish. It was an orb shape. It was like a And uh, but I just I just thought that it it was alive Versus a lot of the other visuals that I had seen in the experience. What made you think that? The way it was moving? I don't know. Is it just uh, well one, uh I think just because maybe it uh, it looked More concrete than the other things that were that were swirling around And also that it was singular and it was Centered within my view and it was far away and floating And I just thought that and uh, either way I I watched it for a while Uh, and then I reengaged it by speaking the other thing that um sound self is doing is it It's giving you feedback Through headphones like when you're making sounds the game's giving you your voice back to you, right? And it's like pitching it maybe lower and higher at the same time But it's it's doing it's and it's doing more than that. I feel like I think binaural beats are involved and uh, so I felt like I was Mmm communicating with something the whole time Because at the end of the experience The sounds pulled away From me and I could just hear my voice again and I felt Lonely and I felt like scared Because I had been in contact with something And uh, and now I was being ripped out of that and You know, I was I was really I was really into it. I love I love it I love it because it can it took me out of my Reality and that's what I love about VR is that it has the power to do that instantaneously and the the the to contact a an entity through sound Of course is like the one of the uh fundamental occult principles, which is that we can use a series of intentional sounds To draw into our subjective experience an entity So it doesn't really fall that far out of what any ancient Yeah Wizard would be doing in some alchemical laboratory Which is like what happens if I make these sounds and then boom, right? There it is. Yeah, and when we put our fucking I don't mean to keep going back to this But we when we put these massive radio telescopes in the middle of a mountain in China and point it in the direction of the void It's an it's a similar thing, which is we're all crying out Hello Yeah, and when it answers That's where things Get pretty weird You know because it's not supposed to answer. Yeah, but it does It does you're I mean, I'm you're talking about maybe some answers like as I know you've even countered I'm saying prayer. Okay pray because the experiment is prayer adverse people are fascinating me because they uh they uh people who are Against prayer It's if you've attempted prayer And you're against it. I get it But a lot of people Look up look upon prayer as a kind of like primitive confused What would you why would you do that? There's nothing out there, man except you that's it. You're a fucking Swirl a cyclone of matter Go ahead and yell out to the void all you fucking want, but there's nothing there And I'm certainly not gonna partake in that ridiculousness You know like what Dawkins Maybe I I wonder how many times Dawkins is prayed if I got to be around Richard Dawkins Who has one of my favorite quotes by the way right now top most favorite quotes, which is Death is the anesthesia that saves us from the pain of infinity And you have to process it. It's pretty cool. It's good man. It's good But I would love to ask Dawkins If he's ever like tried for like a month to pray and if if he has using his Razor sharp intellect and his ability to discern The real from the false Has he experienced even a subjective shift in his consciousness? I'd love to know I'd love some because someone like Dawkins is the perfect person to do the experiment but I know personally If I pray if I sit down in the morning and just say a prayer like And I use simple words Because I don't see the point of it's just easier for me. I use it as a form of like Convenience a term of so I use god as a term of convenience. So if I sit down in the morning and I go, oh, please god help me To not be such a selfish asshole. I'm and to to try to give more than I usually give today and if And if I can serve you a little if I can really be your servant or do something that That you would want me to do please help me do that if there's anything you can do some Something like that not as clumsy as that usually I'm more confident because I I get embarrassed to say it on the podcast but uh Some version of that That's a better day Than when I don't do it. Yeah I don't know why but it's better. Usually do you put it? Is there a difference for you between prayer and Like mantra? Yeah, okay mantra is cool for like um Focusing I love mantra Uh chanting harry krishna. Um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, it just sounds cool. Um, um, um, um, um But if you like do an actual like Um You know calling out or whatever It's it's way different. It's very personal So yeah, when you had this sounds self-experience. Yeah It's like, whoa, I guess that like one thing that I've thought about technology is it's the you know, like you want to see the invisible man You throw paint on him Ah, there he is right the invisible man the way you like catch an invisible being as you throw paint on it And now you can see it because the paint's covering it up and now it's not invisible anymore The same way I think technology Is like the paint that we're throwing on this esoteric thing that is up until this point been non-quantifiable Yeah, but now we're like yeah starting to see it a little bit. Yeah, um Presence like there's a lot of spiritual words. I mentioned this to you on the phone one time that that are being used now to describe Uh virtual reality And what are the use of technology? Well presence is one of them. Uh, I wish I could I wish I had a list But I just keep noticing it. Um Uh I can't elaborate but I don't I don't know if you consider that uh a spiritual word but for me it feels like Something I wouldn't normally hear well in the Conversation about technology. I'll tell you this when the washing machine came out I'm pretty sure they want people who are like you got to see this washing machine Like this means everything. Maybe there are people like it's great. You know, you don't have to like Throw your shit in a bathtub and like hit it with a broom and soap but this technology creates a missionary spirit and people who've encountered it and The missionary instinct which I certainly have anyone who comes over to my house including my cable guy Like a guy came over to I was having problems with my internet connection. So this guy came over Fixed my internet connection And then I'm like, hey man. Have you ever seen Virtual reality and he's like no I've heard about it though. I'm like, do you want to see it? He's like, yeah So like I I put the he put the vibe on Put the headset on I showed him the blue the whale encounter And watching this guy stand in my living room. I've never met this guy before but just what you were talking about That laugh comes out of him. And then he's like Oh my god Oh my god Oh my god. He takes it off. He looks at me. He's like, this is like when we had acid I'm like, yeah, it's amazing. And as he's leaving. I'm like, well, I have a great day and he's like, well, I am now And it's like, yeah, why are you having a great day? Well, he's having a great day because in that moment for the first time in his life outside of using psychedelics he experienced a respite from the burden of A physical form right from the burden of The the repetitive phenomena of the universe that we call default reality and the implication of a kind of technological victory over this kind of Rather oppressive blindfold Which is the ceaseless Input of the phenomena surrounding most human beings as they move throughout their day Yeah, well, maybe It's a liberating technology is what I mean And I think that feeling is what I'm trying to describe trying what I'm talking about when I I say that there's spiritual language is being used. Maybe it's not maybe it's not spiritual, but it's um Representative of Getting outside of your body. I don't know the right term term is Um Dang it. I lost my thought. Well, you you you're One one thing that I read on reddit on the hdc vive form on reddit. Do you ever go to that? Reddit hd the reddit vive subreddit is great And there's a lot of smart people on there posting about the vive and vr and somebody I wish I remember their name Said what what what this technology has done Is it's given us a reference point that we didn't formerly have so When I take off my virtual reality goggles and go into the natural world I can look at it and kind of get an idea of what kind of processor it might take to run this experience The level of detail is shocking in this Default reality when you like really look at a thing, of course, we're limited by the goggles that we're wearing which is our physical form I'm a 42 year old dude to like when I zoom in on stuff But there's a little I got some smudges on my lens man I can't get off at this point, but I can compensate for it But it gives you a reference that we haven't had before that's that's one one aspect of it I think transcendent transcendence is the word i'm looking for like uh, it At this out of body experience that you can have Um identity but like this relief of of your sense of self Is something that I can give you In in an instant Because you was the hands that you're looking at inside virtual reality become your new hands whatever they are if they're crab claws or logs or fish You know intestines like these are my hands and after a couple minutes looking at your New crab hands. You're like I've always had crab hands. Yes. I am crab hands man. Yes, and um And right now the vibe Uh can only is tracking your head and hands. That's what you get Um, and so you're you're this floating like rayman character. You just have these floating bits Yes, and uh, but it all just sort of in the world is can be cartoony and after a few minutes You're just like the world has always been cartoony. Yeah, um, and then when you pull it off And you come back to you know real reality you're like reality Yeah, and you're and uh, you're like this This is uh, yeah, it takes a couple minutes to readjust. I think yeah to believe that the this new reality is what It has always been. We're right and and so now you have a technology that is functioning Is a spiritual teacher because the one one of the fundamental teachings uh in hinduism is the This world we're in is called maya maya means illusion And so this is the fundamental teaching like this thing that you think is real is not real It's not real And this is this this teaching, you know, it come it goes into science which is like, look you can't You can't trust your senses to determine what the truth is It's as real as we can trust our eyeballs to tell something is real Yeah And the same thing happens when you put the the vibe on like that reality is as real As as we can sense it and our eyeballs are telling your brain that it's real But you know At least until you get into the trance of the game. Yeah, this is not real. Yeah another thing, you know outside of the vr The giggle that you pointed out Which now I notice when people use the the vr in my house The other thing that's cool to watch is a person hold their hand in front of their face. Yeah Nothing's there. Yeah, so it's like to to feel the impulse of movement And to not have any visual Corollary like your hand as up until this point When you hold your hand in front of your face, there's a hand that feeling of moving your hand in front of your face Hand appears to just have the feeling of intention, but no visual Confirmation of the movement is incredibly psychedelic. Yeah, that is is a fundamentally psychedelic moment because another Uh pillar of these teachings is you are not your body So not only is this reality that you think is reality and illusion But this body that you think is you In no way shape or form is what you really are. Yeah, so these two things are being awesome. Yeah Yeah, that's cool, man. Uh I love that so much I love Feeling that because I don't have maybe the words all the time to Express or even understand that idea, but it's something that Comes to you and whether you want to or not when you're trying out vr for the first time You can't help it because you're not in your own body anymore and you're Experiencing some lesson It's just it's just happening. Yeah. Um, and anyway, so I guess maybe to answer your question. That's All of that everything we were just talking about is the stuff that I care about the stuff that I'm trying to Um put into a a game a game that you can download for your you're working on a game. Yeah, um, Are you is this a solo project? Do you have a are you collaborating with anybody? Yeah, um, I met uh Dude named ryan nelson at an oculus rift convention And we were just standing in line and he started talking to me about Um combining an eeg reader with vr and Uh The next morning I was like I called him up because he gave me his card and I was like, let's start making that Um, and he did it. He made this awesome prototype where we bought this inexpensive eeg reader and We had it on I had it on my brain and uh I chilled out enough. I felt I tried to sort of zone out and the more I zoned out Um, I was able to levitate up off the ground inside virtual reality. I'm not explaining this well enough but I had a vr headset on and and uh an eeg reader that was touching my the front of my forehead and when I was uh We were trying to be happy and chilled out If you did that you would levitate inside of vr. That's what I'm trying to say. Yeah, and uh, it was great And like I I I chilled out I lifted up off the ground and then once I lifted up I looked down and I was like, oh, shit. I'm up off the ground and that made me concentrate and lose my Bliss as state and then I fell felt you plummet down to the ground. No, I have talked about this I never give your name because I I didn't know I I didn't know if I was allowed to say it was I have mentioned this before to people because to me it is the ultimate spiritual metaphor which is the moment you even in dreams when you're flying Like you were saying earlier when you realize you're flying You're fucked you immediately start falling. Yeah, the way you fly in a dream is to be Of person that flies not a person who's aware that they fly. Yeah, so to Create a technology that mimics this metaphysical state Yeah, and it's I mean and it's something that you can do when you're awake and train yourself To stay in that state of mind, which is totally like EG readers have been around since the Like four forties or something. I don't know. I feel like that's correct Because they only they discovered brainwaves Back then I think and anyway, it's something that I feel like should be in our our daily lives like we should be training these muscles because it's something we have energy coming out of our heads that we can Use as a resource, but there's no clear clear way to use to use that But once I was trying it I was like what I have this Super power and I haven't been tapping into it my for my entire life I wish I had been training my brain to know how to calm itself or to concentrate hard. I did a test using a this other EG reader Where I went the opposite direction I just imagined like killing somebody with a knife and like taking his guts and Grabbing him out of his stomach and stuffing him down his mouth a classic and then uh, and it was like Like the reader the little meter on this app that I was using to see how my brain was reacting was just Sky-high and just peeking out so the opposite so you so not only have you learned how to do this thing But you can also do it's opposite from knowing how to do the thing Yeah, and and it's all like I mean I don't know all the names of the the brainwaves, but We were just averaging out all of them to some Degree so we had two outputs Like you know that we called calm and we called Concentration which is all just made up. I don't really know what those mean There's also brainwaves that you only admit when you're sleeping and we were Joking around about having the last the final boss level be this thing where you just lay down and fall asleep And that's how you beat him because you can get these brainwaves Uh, and then when you wake up you've you've sort of exited this listen man. That's the smartest game I've ever heard of a game where you're engaging if you could figure out a way to translate that you're translating that into battles Well, sort of we had a bunch of uh, jesse moinehan was helping us Uh Come up with like levels like conceptually you were moving through Layers of of of afterlife or of heaven or of Astral planes like we're just like sort of traveling Beyond our own reality in this game and there were doors gates and you had to get through them by using your brainwaves And the whole time you have to be calm You have to be you have to be be completely like it not just calm, but like absent of of of concentration absent of of Thought it was really really hard to do which made it really really fun as a game It was like really challenging to clear my mind enough to like move move up to levitate. Um, I'm rambling now Where's the game? We gave up on it because No one's gonna buy an eg reader A computer that can run vr a vr headset and our software. It's like there's just too many things that people you know We were trying, you know We're also trying to like i'm trying to start a business So I can't just make um art. What's the business? Games just something I can download Something you can download on on steam that was you know, that's my goal right now is to make a game that you can play With the the vibe on your computer that you own got you and it was just the eg reader I think was just one step too far From it. Well, it's a big ass because you're already dealing with the technology Yeah, that people that no one's even gonna buy right now skeptical about buying to add to that You would have to have to but I'll tell you man. I'm sure future Vr goggles are going to have some form of eg reader built into them I would imagine that would just be well that's already in the works and you can find that online Someone's already doing that. Um, I can't remember the name of the device, but Uh, that's that's already made You know what I would bet I bet it's got a pretty cool fucking name Yeah, thwark. Yeah the thwark a denovian thwark or some kind of man I um I gotta tell you man. I'm a little sad to hear Because I've been fantasizing pen That you've been working on this crazy levitation game Yeah, and it's something I've been looking forward to having And uh, I'm sad to hear that it's no longer in process because yeah As a as a meditation trainer It's like You can really trick yourself Into thinking that you're doing something when you're not doing it Especially with meditation. Yeah, you know, you could really imagine. Oh, yeah, I must be hitting the place just because I'm Confused or something but to have a to again, we're talking about Technology as a tool of quantifying the formerly unquantifiable You know, and it's not as though These brain states that come from meditating Are unquantifiable. It's just that people don't have access to an EEG machine. Yeah, it's only like a hundred bucks. You can get them online But to note to to have a visual Indicator of Yeah, what what energetic states your brain is throwing out Yeah, well, I mean any enter any EEG reader that you bond line will come with an app It'll come with some software and and sometimes it'll be like a cool visualizer But maybe there aren't any VR apps yet There might be you couldn't pair the game down a little bit just so that people who already have an EEG reader could Experience it. Uh, we could do it. We could do it. Um, and maybe we will come back to it, but Every second that I'm not trying to Sort of make something that I think people might buy I'm I feel like I'm I'm trying I'm trying to like Be self-sufficient and I'm trying to make I'm trying to make money, right? But I'm also trying to make something far out. So I'm trying to find the middle ground right now Um, and that's just what I what you have to do. I think so. Yeah, I think so I mean right now my friend and I we're just making like magic spells that you can cast in VR and it's Uh, like I'm modeling a small man Inside of an acorn that you can pluck from a tree and open the nut and take the man out and squish him up and shove him in a pipe And like smoke his guts and then like some psychedelic effect will like appear over your eyes And so everything I approach I'm trying to approach it with uh, this perspective like trying to put mystery into Um, trying to create a world that feels fully realized um I'm really inspired by uh, scion worlds games Cosmic Osmo Is something that I played when I was a little kid And you might not remember it, but if you look it up, it's just um, you know, there's You there's a spaceship and you click on it and you go inside the spaceship And then you can travel to a planet and there's a moon And there's a there's a there's like a plant on the on the moon if you click on the plant Um, it'll drop a piece of fruit and then you click on the fruit And you zoom in on the fruit and you and and the door opens up inside the fruit And you click on the door and you go inside the door And it just goes it just keeps going and it's just uh, it's just fun And it's a world that's full of interesting. You know what it reminds me of. Yeah, what did you ever uh read ender's game? Yeah, I I'd listen to it on remember that They the weird like fantasy game that they had that was kind of like a psychological evaluation tool or something and it's like Very organic and fluid. You could do all this stuff and infinite stuff inside of it very psychedelic But I mean, I don't know what honestly what you just described to me just sounds like Please god Finish it. Yeah. Well, I think that's something that I think people would dig and it's uh, It's something that I would love to make and it would make you feel fulfilled That's the other thing I'm trying to do right now is make something that I think is worth making To me and for me um Giving people and myself the opportunity to feel transported to a place that's full of Mysterious things like that is what I want Um, so that's what I'm trying to do and I feel like that's what most people are trying to do in vr right now Because that's what it does. That's the nature of it. You can go somewhere else and And live inside that that other place. Well, I mean, this is the this is the Uh, the call of the thing what what's what's really cool about it is when you come to the to vr You don't just experience it It it it's like it's imbuing every single person who comes inside It's it it's inspiring them Make more of this You know everyone at least most people that I show it to when they take off the goggles They're like, I wish I had this Yeah, I wish I could be this or go to this place or I wish it had more of this So everyone wants it to be more real too. Everyone wishes they you know They had feet everyone wants to see their entire body. Yep. Um, everyone wants to be able to walk Uh Without limitations because right now there's a there's a cord and we teleport, you know, like that's the that's the That's one of the fundamental What apparently is one of the big obstructions right now is that the uh To move in virtual reality fucks with your vestibular System. Oh man. So we can't like we don't we don't know how to overcome that yet so But i'm fine with teleporting around look i don't like Once i'm inside minecraft and vr and i'm teleporting and i'm standing on some ledge That that that's what's really curious to me is like I think when I think of like memories video game memories in other words like think of like a great video game that you love binding of isaac uh, I don't know um A game you've really played for a long time. Um mist mist Maybe mist is different. But when I think of like because mist I you know what mist i've got mist is It appears that the storage mechanism For certain types of video games is different than the storage mechanism for other types of video games. So Dark souls the majority of dark souls that I play It all is kind of mushed together into a kind of dark swirly desperate never ending cascade of failure whereas like Whereas um, uh in virtual reality Uh when I consider like god, I'm sorry. This is so vulgar but porn versus vr porn Yep Porn, yeah, I don't remember any when I think back to porn. I've looked at It's the same thing just a swirl of failure But when I think when I when I think of virtual reality porn It's crystal clear in there man. Like my brain is recorded sure you're writing those memories in a clearer way Then you would if you were just watching. Yeah a flat image exactly So so whatever it's the way that it's like storing information for these games when I think of like Longbow in the lab When I remember it, I remember it in a very clear way. I remember it as the time I was standing at the edge of this Tower blasting right the the the the memory Castle what do you call it the the when you're when the technique that people use when they're the memory Where you're like it's a room a furniture or whatever. Yeah, I imagine like imagine like flashcards like training for a test and just like filling a I don't let you call it the castle. There's a there's a proper term for it the memory something and then When you add to it the combination of new tropics So it's like not now. This is something there's a what's that? It's the substances you take that are IQ enhancers like there's a few right now that are I mean when I went to the shit doctor Along I'm sorry to call him a shit doctor, but he was a pill mill doctor like you go and be like, hey, can you give me a prescription for Vicodin and he'd be like, yeah, sure. How many milligrams do you need? Like You would look on his phone when when you were again, of course when I say these things I make them up It didn't really happen to me. It's part of the character I like a gonzo kind of drug dude sometimes that I put out But yeah, I remember going to him this imaginary fictitious doctor He went an imaginary way got busted recently and can in an imaginary way no longer prescribe medicine Which in an imaginary way is a very good thing for probably most of the world But one of the things he said to me was The problem because I was getting I thought if I got on at all then I could finally write Totally wrong. Like I just when I take Adderall. I'm just more aware of how non productive I am It does nothing for my creative output But he was saying the problem with this drug is that in schools Kids who aren't on it Are are getting lower test scores than kids who are on it. So now we have a problem that Oh, right. Yeah in the same way with athletics, there's doping and if one person dopes everybody's got a dope or there's no Competition anymore. It was no new tropics. You're hitting this exact same place where Kids who are on these substances are going to do better than kids who aren't on the substances and as far as Test scores go, which is of course no indication of a being's Intelligence or value as a human on this planet, but as far as memorizing bullshit getting on trucker speed derivatives Apparently does help you in that direction. So That's what a new tropic is so In the same way the combination of technology with new tropics Maybe micro doses of lsd Micro doses of psilocybin Micro doses of mdma mixed in with some kind of flash card language memory palace. Yes memory palace could potentially create A revolution in education. I think that's the entry point For vr. I think it could be for a lot of people is buying this Expensive thing, but it will empower you to become a surgeon in your living room. Like you'll you can you can you can operate on a virtual body Just by yourself in your living room and and and train yourself to do complex Medical procedures you could do it. You could fix a car, you know, you could open up a virtual hood on a on a truck Yeah, and changing it and changing and changing engine out Um, I don't know sky's the limit, right? And if you had all of that, uh inside Your home Well, it's crazy. It's crazy and you'd be learning everything In in a first person in the most real way possible But here's where it gets really crazy pen the uh, there's a So there's a book that you should start reading if you haven't read it already called super intelligence by nick bostrom And what he says is okay, how do I so it's like these are the pathways there? You know about this book. You told me about a little bit. Yeah, I've about it for a second These are the path. How do we get to a super intelligence on this planet? So the question is will There be a super intelligence on this planet in other words Will there be something that has a Uh thinking capacity That exceeds the human mind will that exist on the planet? The answer is clearly. Yes, that's going to exist We think there is a high probability that that will happen When we don't know but we do have the feeling. Yeah, this is definitely going to happen So the book is a brilliant Uh and and somewhat confusing because I I'm not a nick bostrom genius So a lot of what he's saying gets really muddied up in my mind, but here are the pathways to achieve super intelligence Genetic, you know like eugenics like we can do breeding programs to create really really smart people That's one way to do it. But That's a very inefficient way. It's going to take a long time Like if we started doing it now Like even now if we somehow overcame all the ethical and legal legal hurdles to creating some terrible Brave new world level breeding program where we incubate the smartest beings and then Somehow recombine them to create smarter beings. You're still looking at 15 to 20 years Two decades from now that we're going to have the first product of that Which probably won't be the ultimate result of that. It'll be several generations And that's with that gene manipulation gene manipulation because we still have to deal with like human children being educated And giving them the information they need to be the little fucking world conquering super geniuses. So Chances are that's not the way we're going to get a super intelligence on this planet It's going to be a machine intelligence more likely. And so then he goes into like, well, how do we get to a machine intelligence? And one of the things he says is it may be That it's some combination of a genetic Program that creates humans smart enough to then make the machines that wake up to become Super intelligent, but so then when you realize that virtual reality Could very well be The training program that the universe has in I don't know Brought to us. Yeah to begin to teach us at an accelerated rate So that humans can then have the potential to bring This intelligence called a super intelligence Into this dimension. That's where it gets interesting, which I think is what it is I think virtual reality is one of the bridges Leading us in the direction of the creation of a super intelligence, which Coincidentally is no different than us contacting an alien intelligence. It's all leading to the same place It's all leading to the contact with the things smarter than us That we don't know what it's going to tell us and if we did then it wouldn't matter And that's what I think vr is it's moving us in that direction and the missionary compulsion that we all feel is the sort of the Magnetic draw of this being that is inviting all of us to be It's midwives Cool man What's fun, um, I can't wait and then super intelligent beings will make Ultra intelligent beings and then ultra intelligent beings will make Hyper hybrids. Well, no one of my friends actually told me something that was really quite sad I really sad interpretation of it, which is uh Well, there's this book I have now called sapiens my friend gave it to me. I just started reading it basically like we're home with sapiens, but But there were a bunch of different sapiens living on the planet at the same time We killed them all We're vicious wiped them all out. We fucked them Killed them and eventually now we're all that's left So someone I was talking to a really smart fella was like, well, yeah, maybe what's gonna happen is We're gonna make machines really smart And they're gonna be filled with love And they're gonna be like, okay. Okay. Let us teach you now how to be as smart as we are And then the moment we get as smart as they are we're like, fuck you We don't plug them because we're sapiens which means wise by the way It's almost like a sarcastic term for what humans are home with sapiens wise men But it's like, of course, that's what we call ourselves You know, it's a really dire thing. We think the ai's gonna destroy us But maybe the ai's going to like give us the gift of a higher intelligence and we destroy it Who knows all I know is I can't wait to say hello Yeah, you know, um, so yeah, I keep wanting to follow you down the the alien Tangent because you brought it up like four or five times just sort of reaching out and finding life out there and I've I've really gotten into it lately. Um the past few years just going down the youtube Hole of alien experiences because right experiences are people who've Uh met aliens extraterrestrials who've Um, who've had it who've had a nice time, right? And they want a different each themselves Uh, maybe I that'd be cool if I was I want to be I want to believe you came into contact with a thing That you grogged as being an intelligence outside of yourself I did I did I I did I bought I I definitely was there and bought into that when I was checking it out Um, but I'm I remain skeptical all the time of everything. It's fine. So I you know, I hope I am. I hope I am But also like so they want to differentiate themselves from abductees who've had a shitty time hanging out with aliens, right? and my one of my favorite experiences is student named david huggins and he talks about Uh, because he was Visited by aliens and taken up to somewhere and he's had lots of kids like human alien hybrid children and they just like They just got right to it most of the time. They just started like having sex with them all the time and at some point he was like Slow down and he taught The aliens Foreplay and like how to like hug and kiss a little. Yeah, so he's cool And he did some really rad paintings of like mantis men And his kids and what it looks like. Yeah, there's some people who um Their art Is is as close as we've got right now to like, you know, the Hubble telescope takes these incredible pictures of these vast nebula star They call them star nurseries nurseries for stars dust nebula that are just the most Fantastic beautiful easily anthropomorphized things that you've ever seen and in the same way that the artist functions as like valuable telescope for for for these other realms And brings it back and there's a few artists like that who really very successfully Seemed to be tuning in on whatever this thing is, but uh, yeah, I think that the um humans are on a You know, I don't know about the fucking aliens, right? I don't doubt they exist. Yeah, I I understand why they might want to do it It's a great way to communicate with something To have sex with it is a very intimate and immediate way to say hi Yeah In a very advanced being maybe that's their handshake is like to immediately just start fucking you because it's like What are we wasting all this of this like weird? Weird sounds out of your mouth. Look, let me show you my soul and what it's like to feel ecstasy. You know who knows I don't know so I an advanced being maybe that is the way they talk is through sex or through like what we call sex But I I would say that we are Going to intersect our species is is is through technology about to intersect with an alien if it's a machine intelligence that we Create so to speak Like google makes it or something then the machine intelligence Is going to More than likely solve a lot of the problems that come in scanning the Universe to see if there's other intelligent life forms out there So that's going to lead to it even though the initial thing itself will be it You know the moment that that we get An actual AI which some people say is an impossibility can't do it But the moment we get an actual a this is contact with the alien This is no different than sedi tuning in on the wow signal times a billion because it's it'll it's an advanced intelligence That's brand new to the planet That theoretically is going to be able to help solve a lot of us our problems or will fucking destroy us either way Our species right now In mass is calling out to the void through prayer through occult rituals through Scanning the skies through the large hadron collider Through all the genetic experiments that seek to extend the human lifespan We as a whole Are saying a variety of prayers And all of them have at their root Show yourself to me Oh great great beauty show yourself to me whether that's through math through jesus or through fucking And that's cool that you're one of those uh pioneers Yeah, thanks man Thank you.

You are listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast. I cannot stop watching the news right now. It's horrible. I'm getting in Twitter fights with people because I'm saying you shouldn't kill kids. And they think that I'm saying that this means that I'm pro Palestine and against Israel. Which is pretty fucked up because I just think in general 100% of the time you should have a don't kill kids policy in your life. That should just be something that you a basic sort of rule that you follow no matter what. No matter what. Just don't kill kids. Like when you're on this planet and you're wandering around and doing whatever it is that you do whether that's you're a janitor or you work at a McDonald's or you run a country you should make it a rule for yourself and everyone you know that you don't kill kids with bombs, that you don't explode them, turn them into hamburger meat, that you don't drop white phosphorus on them, igniting them and if not igniting them then causing them to later get cancer from the depleted uranium and the shit that you're dropping. You just don't do that. Like when you're planning your day out make sure that if on that list you've written drop depleted uranium on a city where there are children that might get burnt to death just mark that off the list and then do everything else. But just don't kill kids. For some people it seems like it's hard to not kill kids. For example if you're a Ukrainian Russian separatist who has access to a highly advanced missile system then for you I guess it was hard to not kill kids because you had to put in the code or squeeze the trigger or do whatever you did that activated the missile that went flying into the sky and blew up an airplane thus killing a bunch of kids. You whoever did that out there were not successful in avoiding killing kids in your life. So for the rest of your life you're a child murderer. You get to go around thinking about the fact that you blew an entire airplane out of the sky and caused human beings to rain down on the ground and of those human beings raining down on the ground some of them were kids. You're a child murderer. If you are somebody who is in Hamas the Palestinian anti-Israel militant organization and you have convinced someone you know to strap bombs to their body and they've gone to a cafe and blown up a bunch of kids well you're a child murderer. If you are in Hamas and you've pressed a button on your missile launcher and the missile launcher has flown into a city and blown up kids then you are you killed kids. You're a child murderer. For the rest of your life you get to be a person who killed kids. If you are the president of Israel or in the military in Israel or a soldier in Israel and you pressed a button that made a bomb land on a city and killed kids then you are a child murderer. It doesn't matter what the geography is that you live in no matter what if you kill kids you are a child murderer. Being a child murderer is the worst thing you can be in this incarnation. There's a lot of shitty things you could be. You could be somebody who raps to fault guitar riffs. I would rather live on an island with 50 rapping fault guitar artists than one child murderer because the fault guitar artists it's going to suck when they sit on the beach and do their glib rhymes talking about how great sunscreen smells when they're rubbing into their girlfriends back but at least you're not going to have to constantly think in the back of your mind holy shit this psychopath thought something was worth killing kids. I don't want to be in a car with a child murderer. I don't want to be at a party with a child murderer. I don't want to be in a bathroom sitting taking a dump in a stall next to a child murderer and I sure as fuck don't want to listen to anything a child murderer has to say when he's explaining why he had to kill kids. I mean sometimes it is interesting to listen to serial killers rationalize or explain why they killed kids. Here's an example. Listen to this. This is an interview with serial killer Joseph Paul Franklin. This is a white supremacist serial killer and this is him explaining why he killed some kids. Do you think about those two boys in Cincinnati? No I don't really think about them. I mean I can't go back and think about the cases you know individually. I have too much other problems, too much other things I have to focus on and worry about. Those are two young boys just 13 or 14 years old. I regret the fact that I shot them down. Why did you shoot them? Well I was just waiting out sitting on that railroad track waiting for the first interracial couple of blacks to walk by. And what was your mission? Well to try to get a race war started. I mixed race couples and blacks. I figured that once I started doing it and showed them how other white supremacists would do the same thing and follow suit. But you hoped people would copy me. I hoped that other white nationalists would do the same thing. Do you think you're a hero to those hatreds? Well that's what they tell me. I just felt like I was at war and the survivor of the white race was at stake. Stuff like that. Do you feel that way now? No not at all. I can see now I was wrong. Violence is wrong at any time. Do you feel that way because you got caught? No not at all. As a matter of fact it took me many many years to change. I actually thought as misguided as I was I was doing the will of God. So what you're hearing there is a serial killer who has an awesome accent. Texas accent always cool. And he's realized violence is always wrong. This is a racist serial killer who prior to his death seemingly has finally grocked that you shouldn't kill people, especially kids. Now here's a chilling interview with someone who has also killed a bunch of kids. Only the way he kills the kids is using an army and high-tech drones to do it. Whereas this serial killer and most serial killers Joseph Paul Franklin he just used a simple gun on the railroad tracks. Here's another serial killer. This guy is using an army government and high-tech military weapons to kill kids. Let's listen to him. Nevertheless it is a hard fact that U.S. strikes have resulted in civilian casualties. A risk that exists in every war. For the families of those civilians no words or legal construct can justify their loss. For me and those in my chain of command those deaths will haunt us. The language of war is so creepy. It's way creepier than the serial killer we just listened to. Just because the serial killer is like, yeah, I shot a couple of kids. Obama can't say, well, me and people in my chain of command accidentally killed kids. He calls them civilian casualties. But one thing he has in common with the serial killer is he feels bad about killing the kids. The difference is Obama hasn't figured out yet that violence is always wrong. Somehow in his brilliant presidential brain the neurons haven't connected or fired yet that make it so that he is incapable of killing kids. But you don't have to be like that. You don't have to be like a serial killer. You can be like someone who doesn't kill kids. And if you find yourself standing on some battlefield and you look down and you see a weapon in your hand, just drop the weapon. Put your hands behind your back or your head. And when whoever you're working for is trying to get you to kill people walks up to you and says, hey, I need you to squeeze the trigger that's going to launch white phosphorus into a city or I need you to remote control this drone that's going to blow up Bedowins who are sleeping in their tents, all you have to do is pick up your guitar, look them in the eye and say, no, I don't kill kids. I don't care what their parents did. I'm not going to turn them into hamburger meat. I'm not going to blow them up in the street. I'm not going to burn their baby feet with shrapnel, shards, and chemical heat. Hey everybody, it's me the Tika Pig and I'm going to lay down some roms. Yeah. Yo, you gotta stop killing kids. It instantly makes you a villain. There's never a reason for baby blood spilling. Instead of killing kids, we should all be grilling and chilling on planet Earth and licking lots of pussies because the pussies give birth to kids. We don't kill kids. We leave the kid killing two things like sins and snakes and alligators and quicksand legs and roller skates with broken screws that grip up their face and pitbull attached and plastic bags and lava cracks and deadly Big Macs. No, we don't kill kids. It doesn't matter what their parents did. We're not going to blow them up in the street. We're not going to turn them into hamburger meat. We'll announce our country and our land if it keeps baby blood off of our hands because no, we don't kill kids. We don't, don't, don't kill kids. All right. Sweet children of this beautiful planet Earth. I've got some big announcements for you. I know I've already talked about it a little bit, but all of my upcoming tour dates are located at DuncanTrustle.com and I really hope you'll come out and see either a live DuncanTrustle family hour or me performing stand up. These are all happening starting on the 21st of next month. I'm going to be at the Laughing Skull in Atlanta. Then I'm going to be in Chattanooga. I'm going to be in Nashville. I'm going to be in Asheville. I'm going to be in Charleston. I'm going to be in Durham. I'm going to be in, in, in then in September at the end of the month, I'm going to be in San Francisco doing a live DTFH Portland doing a live DTFH Seattle doing a live DTFH Vancouver at the Northwest podcast festival doing a live DuncanTrustle family hour podcast and I'm going to be in Calgary doing stand up. So please come out and see me. All the dates are located on my website at DuncanTrustle.com and the August shows I will going around with Johnny Pemberton.

He is a virtual reality evangelist, an expert on virtual reality and Android. And he really blew my mind in this interview by helping me understand just how quickly this new technology of virtual reality is evolving and expanding and how we're just a few short years away from existing in a universe where we will be able to stick our heads and bodies into these strange digital portals that allow us to experience anything that we want to. You can go to his website to find out more about him. He is at reverendkyle.com. He's got a great podcast. I will have links to all of this up at dunkintrussell.com. Thank you all so much for listening to this podcast. My apologies for the two week hiatus. We are back. I've got five podcasts in the can. Great podcast, including an interview with Lucian Greaves, who is from the Temple of Satan. He's the brilliant theologian who is having a theologian and Satanist who's having a Baphomet statue placed next to the Ten Commandments in Oklahoma. And he's a really cool guy. Also we've got podcasts coming up with Matt Dwyer, Ragu Marcus and David Silver, Honey Honey and many, many more. I love you guys. I hope you're having a great week. Don't let the news get you too freaked out. Everything gets better eventually and I'm sure that soon all of this is going to transform into the most beautiful possible outcome. Let's pray for that. Okay. Hare Krishna. Now everybody open your third eyes and send as much love as you can to whatever digital sector of the universe Reverend Kyle happens to be hanging out at right now. Please welcome to the Dunkin Trussell Family Hour podcast, Reverend Kyle. Welcome to the Dunkin Trussell Family Hour podcast. How are you today? I'm doing very well. Thanks for having me on the show. Are you kidding man? Thank you for coming on the show. You are one of the preeminent scholars and mystics when it comes to the strange world of virtual reality. So I'm really excited to talk to you about all the stuff that's going on right now. Yeah. I think it's going to be a fun conversation. Why? Now let me just start off with a question. I think everyone's wondering is are you an actual Reverend? I am indeed ordained as a minister in the great state of Ohio and it's not my day job but it's what I do on the side. Whip a little religion on people when they least expect it. But yeah, I've actually performed several marriages and done the whole minister thing. The Reverend Kyle became my online persona when I was back when I was doing YouTube videos with Android tutorials and I was Reverend Kyle the minister of mobile devices. And once I stopped doing the Android thing I moved into the VR world and the name just came with me. What religion are you a minister of? All and none at the same time. So I was raised Catholic but I guess it's everything but that at this point. So you're multi-denominational. Exactly. All are welcome in the church of Reverend Kyle. It seems that there really is a kind of religious component to the groundswell of virtual reality enthusiasts that's happening right now. It can be very spiritual. A lot of people take it to an extreme level and I think it's a great thing to expand and think about it in that terms. When you go to these events and I've only been to a couple which was the one that we met at. What was the name of that party? That was the Los Angeles VR mixer. It was during E3. And at the Los Angeles VR mixer there's a feeling in the air that is a tangible sense that these people have that this thing that's about to emerge into the mainstream is so very powerful and so very weird that it seems to be mystical in nature. Oh yeah, absolutely. And we even discuss when we talk about VR to other folks who are not aware of it or its implications to the future, we call it evangelizing. We are evangelizing virtual reality to the consumer masses and it really is. There is this kind of cult following behind it right now and it's what's pushing it forward. You see at these events such strange technologies, the aesthetics of the thing are so odd and in some ways some of the aesthetics are kind of horrifying to some people. But they're also, it's just a fascinating thing to be in a room where you see people with these black boxes strapped to their faces. At one point I remember someone walking through the room holding a staff that had multiple cameras attached to it that was recording the event in 3D space. So you have, you know, it's just like some strange priest wandering through a church with a staff or a wizard or something with these devices that are encoding or digitizing reality and then, you know, every single one of these, this party, every demo is essentially a portal into a virtual reality. So you have these people who are in control of these dimensional portals and because of all of this, the combined feeling is definitely one of being at some kind of church or temple or, I don't know, it feels as though you're at a pagan gathering. Oh, yeah, yeah, and some of the people are really enthusiastic about it to the point where it is, you know, if somebody says something bad about VR, it's like time to go on a crusade and convert these folks. So yeah, there's definitely a lot of parallelisms between religion and VR and you're right, you know, you look at this group of people coming together to worship at the altar of VR and we were all disciples there just looking at this idol and just praising it. And, you know, you do kind of have this weird Orwellian type of atmosphere, folks walking around with black boxes on their heads, looking at things grasping out into the air, speaking in tongues. I mean, it's just it's it's everything and anything at this point. Yeah, and it's, you know, the idol that you're worshiping has not fully emerged into this dimension yet. So there's the quality of, you know, everyone, these VR evangelists are all prophets who are proclaiming the birth of this digital Messiah or this digital utopia that is its tendrils are just beginning to poke into this dimension. And the very tips of the tendrils, that's all we're seeing right now. And the tips of those tendrils are the black boxes on people's heads and the variety of new technology that's been assembled by people who are just inspired by a feeling more than anything. You know, the the guys who started Oculus Rift, they started in a basically in a basement. Is that correct? Yeah, they were just, you know, a college kid and he was working in his basement trying to create the future. And he couldn't he couldn't find something. Palmer Lucky was looking for an answer. He was searching for this this digital coming the next age and he didn't he couldn't find it. And he went on a pilgrimage and came back empty. And when he finally decided, I am going to be the one to create this future. And from there, he acquired other people to help him. And now we have them up on a pedestal as, you know, the VR, the coming, the coming of the future. He felt it. He knew that there was this potential to no longer exist in this reality because of the various advancements that were happening and from, you know, accelerated computing power to motion sensing technology to, I don't know, what do you call the thing that's actually in the Rift that now detects when you lean forward? What is that called? Well, the positional tracking is done by cameras and sensors and IMUs, all sorts of fun technology working together. And these technologies are essentially brand new. Well, a lot of it already existed. It just didn't exist in the capacity. You know, sometimes there are technologies out there and people don't realize their full capabilities, what they are, what's possible with these technologies. And it takes someone like Palmer to put them together in a room and say, OK, I'm going to put them in my cauldron and stir them. And I'm going to concoct a new type of technology out of these things, a hybrid, a new thing that's going to come out and it's going to give us something just completely out of the ordinary. That's again, you know, you use the term cauldron. And I think it's a perfect way to describe it. It's this kind of alchemical assemblage where you're taking all these multiple technologies, sort of positioning them together in a way that literally opens up a fucking portal. It opens up a portal to an alternate dimension. And people, you know, they I don't think people quite understand you understand it, I understand it, but people who haven't experienced the new, the newest oculus rift, they don't understand what is right around the corner. They don't know that this Palmer lucky fellow and you and all the enthusiasts, evangelists and technicians out there are making this happen, have given human beings the ability for the first time in human history without the use of some kind of potent psychedelic or being hypnotized to stick your head in a hole in the universe and look around in some brand new place born inside of someone's imagination. One of the nice things, one of the fun things about what I do with evangelizing VR to the masses is that there will be times I will take it out to a group of people, a gathering, maybe a party or something, and I'll have somebody come in, I'll say, here, put this on your head. And they'll look at me skeptically and they'll say, what is this? And I said, it's the future, sir, put it on your head. And they'll they'll still kind of look at you weird, like, why am I doing this? Once they take it off of their head after they have had this first experience in VR, their reaction is just priceless. I need to start taking a camera and taking a picture after they take it off their head each time that we've all seen the videos on YouTube and we've all heard people's reactions to this. But you are right, the majority of the world, the sleeping masses out there right now have no clue what the future is going to be. They have no clue that in a year to 18 months, this is this is a technical reticence, a digital revolution that's about to hit us. And the majority of the world has no idea what's coming. And that's thrilling. That is thrilling. You know, I don't know if you have ever taken LSD. No, well, you should. It's a wonderful drug. And when you if you're someone who's like taken LSD, the first time you experience, you can become an acid evangelist. Because when you take this drug, you experience this heightening of consciousness emerging into the universe and a myriad of other beautiful things can happen to you, depending on the size of the dose and who you're around. And when you take it, you in your life becomes completely shifted in the direction of a of what I would consider a kind of spiritual awakening. So many people's spiritual paths have started with a nice dose of some psychedelic. When when you are around someone who takes it for the first time and you get to watch this transformation happen to them and see them wake up to the to the incredible and sensual and mystical world that LSD offers a person or any good psychedelic. There is such a rush in that. And in this it's a very similar rush when you introduce people to this, because it's it's like going into it's like going into a room where someone has been, I don't know, in a wheelchair for their entire lives and giving them a hope that they're actually going to walk. Only the hope that virtual reality offers us is not that we're going to be able to walk. It's that we're going to be able to fly. It's that we're you know, it's that we're finally going to be able to experience flight and that we're finally going to experience every single mystical and incredible thing that happens to superheroes and to all the fantasy beings that we've seen in movies since we were growing up. It your mind, some part of your mind will grok that you because of this technology are eventually going to be able to walk through walls in a virtual world. And man, it's so cool to watch that that that whatever that thing has happened to people. One really fun experience in virtual reality. It's a very popular video game called Minecraft. And with VR, the Oculus Rift and Minecraft is a very it's a very good combination because the worlds are so just fluid, you can change them, you can manipulate them. And it's it's almost surreal to think that I can I can look over here and push a button and a block appears that didn't appear before. And it's gotten to the point where we have these towers that are, you know, relatively speaking, thousands of feet in the air. And you can stand up on top of these towers and look down and know that all I have to do is take a step forward. And even though it's not real, even though it's in the virtual world, you still hesitate and then you take the step and you're plummeting to what would be your death normally. But then you just land and you move about your business. And it's just something you have to experience to appreciate. And no one's got no one in the history of our species has gotten to experience that without turning into fucking jelly. And that that's there. I can't emphasize that enough that this is I mean, I don't know. Maybe there are mystical shaman shamans who can fly and walk through walls and alter the laws of physics using their mind. I've heard that these people exist. But I'm betting that this is the very first time we've had access to this kind of this level of sense gratification. And there's no telling what the implications are. And you you I love that you call that you're totally that you call yourself a VR evangelist. And because that shows that you recognize that there is you you you do recognize that this is the birth of probably a new religion. It probably is a religion. We're seeing maybe the second coming or something. It might be like the second coming of Christ. I don't know. You know, it's it's really an interesting story when I first started with the VR, a friend of mine, a colleague had said, hey, have you seen this this this Oculus Rift? And I hadn't at the time. And when I saw it, a button, a switch, a trigger in my mind, just just flipped and said, this is what you need to do. And on a regular basis, when I would bring it up with people, they would look at me like I had no idea what what I was talking. They had no idea, no concept of how this could possibly work. And that's when I started doing my own podcast, the Revvr podcast. I I knew that there was this void that needed to be filled. I knew that there had to be a way to reach out to the masses through the digital world, the Internet, and say, listen, folks, you've got to see what this is. You've got to come and follow us into the future. Because if you don't, you'll be sitting on your couch, watching Honey Boo Boo and the rest of the world is experiencing cosmic everything, cosmic everything. That's it. It's not games. That's a really important point. It's not games. It's not just games. A lot of people think that it's just games. It's going to let people play Call of Duty as though we're real. And that's, of course, that's definitely going to happen. But that's just the very beginning. Where do you see what in two years describe to me what what society is going to look like once VR has initially emerged into it? The easiest way to answer that is a conversation that I had with a colleague at work who is very much in the know in terms of technology. And he said to me, he asked his question, he said, what are they going to be able to do with virtual reality? And my answer to him was yes. And he he said, what do you mean? I said, yes. It's like, well, yes, what? Yes, everything. What do you want to do? Because in two years, you're going to be able to do it. Everywhere, all the time. I am a bespectacled person. I wear glasses on a daily basis. And if I am walking down the street two years from now and I decide that I want to flip into a digital world, a button on the side of my glasses will allow me to do that. If I want to sit at a bus stop and instead be sitting on a on a park bench in Paris, talking to a beautiful young French girl, eating a baguette. I can do so. You think that's two years? I don't see why not. I don't see why not. I like to be optimistic about it. Maybe three, definitely five. But I have a feeling in two years, we are going to see advancements in this technology, because what will happen is the rest of the world will suddenly get it next year at this time. The rest of the world will suddenly click and they'll go, oh, wow, we need to focus our attention on this. And then everybody will start putting a large emphasis and a lot of manpower into making this be better than it already is. And as a result of that, we will reap the fruits of those labors. And two, maybe three years, I'll be talking to that French girl. Wow. And wow. And it's going to be an AI, you know, maybe it'll I hope it's a real French girl who's got glasses on at her bus stop, but it might be an AI French girl because what's growing along with this technology, side by side with this technology is artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly advanced. You know, the story that hit the Internet recently was the Wikipedia robot. That's I don't know. Did you see that the Wikipedia? The computer that passed the Turing test. And so the Turing test says, are you human? And a computer has finally passed that test. And what that means from an AI perspective is that a year from now, two years from now, you are not going to have any idea if somebody on the Internet is real or fake. Now, combine that with the giving an AI the ability to manufacture virtual worlds. And now what you have is artificial intelligence becoming the architects of virtual landscapes that human beings can experience using VR goggles. And now suddenly you start taking me down a very narrow road into our possible dystopian future. You think that's dystopian? Well, it could be. I think that that's the fear. Unfortunately, Hollywood has not portrayed VR and artificial intelligence in the best of lights. And as a result of that, we have a lot of folks who are very, very afraid of innovation and technology. And if suddenly our virtual worlds are being controlled by our virtual people, then who's to say that we ever end up coming out of it at all? And the machines take over and we scorch the skies and it's all very matrixy. Well, that's where you get into the idea that. That already happened in an infinite amount of time ago and that we are inside the thing. Wow. Yeah. And then that means that we here we are designing it yet again. Maybe that'll maybe that's the portal on the way out. Or we will go in and we'll come out the other side where we should have been. Well, yeah. Or, you know, maybe it's just a kind of infinite re recursion. Is that would that be a recursion? It's like an infinite, yeah. So that's what it is. It's just kind of like, you know, you take what is it? You take there's a I was just reading about. I mean, numerology and I can't remember you. There's a well, do you take pie, you know, and you have this infinite string of numbers that just goes on and on and on and on and on. And maybe it's some function of what we are or this dimension that we're in is what it does is it just keeps reproducing itself. That's just it. It just replicates itself again and again and again and goes in certain civilizations get to experience the birth of it. You know, that's the most that's that's the most incredible thing to exist pre VR and then after VR, we get to exist. We're on the border here. And it's such a beautiful thing because, you know, the next generation, it's going to be a they won't it won't they won't blink at the novelty of being able to travel into alternate universes anytime they want to sit on park benches and be in Paris, France or to sit on fucking park benches and be in on Mercury, you know, or absolutely. Yeah. No, I have children of all different ages and I am envious of their generation because they're going to see this taken. I mean, you know, we talked about two years, three years, five years. Imagine 25 years from now. My children will be in the prime of their lives and experiencing something that I can only dream of right now. Well, I mean, you that this is reminds me of a conversation I had at the GF 2045, which is that conference Dimitri Itchkopf through with it. And it was with a geneticist working on life extension technology. And we asked him 10 years from now, what's that going to look like? And he said, that's a long time. That's a long time. Let's talk five years from now. Let's talk four years from now. And what he, you know, what he was, he was well aware of is just this in acceleration that we are seeing happen right now. Did you, I don't know if there was a great thing that popped up on Reddit today, which is this month in technology. Did you see that? I did not know. Oh, my God. It's like 10 things that happened just this month or that came, you know, that people became aware of this month, that people have been working on them for years. But one of them was the Wikipedia robot that's printing, you know, tens of thousands of Wikipedia articles that look like they were done by a human. The other one was the Google contact lenses that are going to be able to measure your blood glucose levels. And then the most fascinating one to me was a new way to do brain scans of human brains that will allow you to get, will allow us to have an entire map of the human brain within, I think it's like a month of scanning a human brain. And that would have normally taken years to get the kind of detail that this scanning technology is going to allow us. And of course, being able to scan the human brain in great, precise detail is one of the prerequisites to being able to digitize the human brain and theoretically summon up a kind of true digital consciousness. You know, and that happened this month, this month. So 25 years from now, I think it would be impossible to imagine what kind of universe that we're going to be living in. The human brain struggles to predict beyond a linear motion. So we can predict where we will be based on the current trend, the current line that we're on. What happens though, and it's always happened to us all throughout history and it will happen in the future, is that there are these forks, these branches, these disruptions in the line that suddenly skew us off into a tangent possible future. And that is where we struggle as humans. We struggle with the ability to see that far ahead. And so I understand the limit to five years, because I think anything beyond that, it's, it's almost like just reading science fiction. Yeah, yes, this conversation reminds me of a conversation in a science fiction book I would have read 15 years, 10 years ago. And because, you know, it's important to under, I see VR as being one of the limbs of this new being that's emerging into our dimension. It's one of the limbs though. And I think the being has the many limbs, the artificial intelligence is another of the limbs of the creature. And another of the limbs of the creature is life extension technologies. And this is something that this, I wish I could remember his name, the geneticist was telling us that currently the human lifespan every year increases by half a year. And their goal is to make it so every year the human lifespan increases by a year. You do that and you've got immortality. That's human immortality. It doesn't mean that if you get shot, you're going to survive. But it does mean that if every year we live a year longer, then you're going to live for as long as you want to live. And so here we have these three limbs of this. Oh, and then the other limb, of course, is 3d printers. And so here you have basically these components are there to extend our lifespan so that we can witness the incredible things that are past our ability to predict. But then also you have with 3d printers, that is what's going to make it so that we don't just go into the realities, but they can come out in here. 3d printers are portals into this universe. And if you combine that with artificial intelligence, the artificial intelligence can start 3d printing androids and assigning them, you know, virtual personalities, then suddenly this liminal state between what isn't and what is, which contains all the potentiality of the infinite number of artificial intelligence beings that could exist in the universe, that begins to pour out into this dimension. Wow. Yeah. And then you can take it even one step further into the absurd and say, what if I can digitize my brain and now put it into one of these 3d printed androids? I could be both real and manufactured at the same time. Absolutely. And then you just take that 3d printed android and you put it in your 3d printed mini rocket ship and you blast that thing to Mars. And now you're a fucking colonist or some version of you that you replicated. And man, this sounds crazy, but it's not that far off. Even if it's 50 years away that you can do that sort of thing. That's what's wild to me is that, you know, I don't know about like, I know that where 3d printers are right now is essentially it looks like they're already capable of printing out some incredibly detailed figurines and stuff. But I don't know where they're at as far as like printing circuit boards and stuff like that, but. So I was at a store the other day that had a 3d printer and there was sitting in front of it several examples of things that had been 3d printed. And one of them was a bottle, just a bottle, but it had a lid and it fit perfectly. And I said, oh, here it comes. Here it is. Suddenly two pieces are perfectly made for each other and they were printed individually, but with such precise, just detail that they fit perfectly. It's just a matter of time before it's printing limbs, before it's printing circuits, before it's printing entire ecosystems to the point where we have just like 3d printed an entire small planet, even. Well, yeah, right. I mean, that's the thing is all you got to do is it's, you know, there's some things that you need. Okay. So one of the things that you need is the ability to have some kind of matter, a lot of matter that you could use as your substrate or what would you call it? Your precursor, your substrate to create the various components. And then you need the technology to, you know, you almost need like a little mini chemical factory or something. But the ideal place to do these experiments is obviously the moon. We get these devices up on the moon. You build some kind of, I don't know, some kind of habitat or geranium up there, some kind of place where the initial experiments can happen. And all the matter that's on the moon, if you could make that a precursor material, the 3d print structures, androids, whatever it is, you've colonized the moon. Not in the way we thought the moon would be colonized, but with, um, uh, but, uh, with androids, which are being controlled by us. So yeah, we're talking about the colonizing other planets. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's, it's gotta happen. I mean, we, we have to have the technology, you know, within the next couple years, we're going to have enough technology that we're going to have something on the moon. We'd be fools not to be taking advantage of that. Obviously Mars is just a hop, skip, and a jump away. Uh, and then, you know, they're finding planets that are very earth-like, not even 16 light years away. So we need to find that technology to travel at light speed. And then in 20 years, we can have, uh, a colony on another planet and possibly where we could breathe, uh, their atmosphere. So yeah, that, that technology, the technology is going to take us there into space where we were destined to go. This is, to me, what's really interesting about this is if you look at the model of most video games, you have, you know, you start off with some kind of character and over the course of the video game, the character begins to gain special abilities that, uh, sort of press reset on the novelty of the game. I remember, I'll never forget the first time I, I really, I, I got a flying mount in World of Warcraft. You ever played World of Warcraft? Oh yeah. And you know that moment when you're no longer having to get a taxi on a bat or whatever, but you're, you're, you're flying above, sorry, for those of you who are not video game nerds, but you should be, you're missing out. But that moment you, you, you rise up above Ogremar, you know, you can fly and suddenly you're in a, the game has reset itself. It's a whole new game. And so many other games are like that. You gain these special abilities, you find, you get the ability to, you know, in Borderlands, suddenly you're able to like ride around in a, in a, in a vehicle or, you know, you name it. There's so many different games where suddenly you get this new ability. Um, so it's interesting to me that what we're talking about here really does mimic the pattern of a video game, which is that here you are, the subjective you, the personal you existing and whatever meat body you've been forced to inhabit for your entire life by whatever genetic role of the dice, made you who you are. And what we're looking at here is in a couple of years, you're going to have the ability potentially to go into other alternate dimensions. And then a few years down the road from there, after AI starts working on this problem of time travel on, or not time travel, but, uh, interstellar travel, there is this weird chance. Let's say it's one in a 50 million, but still a weird chance that in your lifetime you might teleport to some other alien world. And that's just like what would happen in a video game, which leads us back to the idea that, that's called simulation theory, which is that we might really be in some kind of super advanced alien game. If that's true, that I'm very pleased with the outcome that has been given to me, my simulation has put me in a good position to be part of this emerging technology, you know, just similar to your comparison to video games. Technology has the ability to change lives in so many ways. And virtual reality has changed my life. It has changed my life's direction. It has given me a new purpose, a reason to get up every day and to do my podcast and to talk to you and, and, and have these moments where you feel good about what you are doing, evangelizing virtual reality. So if this is a simulation, then I'm very pleased with the outcome of mine. Well, wouldn't, I mean, yeah, you're, what a, what a cool way for the video game to transition or for you to level up is that, that, you know, it's like if you were to read the back of the box, it's like start out as a limited, you know, meat thing on a planet in the middle of a void. And, you know, over the course of the game, you will experience what it's like to usher in a new alien intelligence called artificial intelligence that will pave the way for you to travel through the universe infinitely. It's such a cool game. It is absolutely a cool game. And it is a lot of fun also to know that, you know, just like in a video game, there are NPCs, there are, there are artificial and intelligent people wandering around. They're just game players. They're not real people. They're just wandering around because they need to give you somebody to interact with. And right now, the rest of the world who is not familiar with the VR renaissance that's coming, those are the NPCs. And the VR may be able to give them an opportunity to wake up and become self-aware and then be part of the game for real, as opposed to just being there just for my own benefit. Do you, do you, do you think this is the age of Aquarius that all the new agers and hippies were talking about? They just didn't know it would happen like this. I, I, I guess so. I mean, it's very possible. A lot of times when people are visionaries, they don't exactly know the medium with which their vision is going to be delivered. And so what you end up with is, you know, Nostradamus or, you know, any of these astrologers that are out there or horoscope. So the horoscope tells me I'm going to have a good day today. Well, why is it because I'm going to win the lottery or is it because I'm going to find a nickel on the sidewalk on my way to work? Both of those are very good, possible representations of that vision. So it's very possible that VR is this delivery method for which we will receive this age of Aquarius. I like that. That's, that's a good representation. It's such a beautiful and optimistic worldview that you have. And have you noticed that your techno optimism is upsetting to some people who would prefer to live in a world that is crumbling into hell? I have always been an optimist and it does follow through into my VR evangelism. And yes, there are folks close to me who are skeptical and it's okay because they're going to be skeptics and they don't want to believe that this is anything more than just a video game accessory. And I don't, it don't let them bother me. You know, then again, there are those folks who believe that this is going to be the antichrist. This is going to be the thing that drags the world down into this dystopian oblivion, like the movie surrogates where people don't want to leave their house anymore and they just live through a virtual interface. There are those folks as well. I say to all of them, that's fine. I'll just be there to prove you wrong when it does come out. And it works exactly the way I said it was going to. This is the very common pattern in history with any new emergent technology. There's always a group of people that feels terror over it. I certainly have explored in my mind and on other podcasts, the dystopian aspect of this thing, which I guess is this, if you, if you haven't really, really thought it through, then what you see is this kind of insular heroin like world where people in the flickering darkness of their, there's a great painting. I'm sure you've seen it of the kind of emaciated kid in the dirty apartment wearing VR goggles. Yeah. And that sort of sums the whole thing up. Just VR addicts lost in a maze of sense gratification who are no longer experiencing the beauty of Mother Earth. And these people don't haven't been to serve us. They haven't, they haven't gotten to experience what it's like to not just, they don't understand that there's a whole physical component to VR. And that actually what's going to end up happening with this is people are going to start getting really good at stuff. They're going to get really good at like playing piano. Shooting guns, physical activity, all these things are, it's not that people aren't going to be moving, wearing this stuff. That's one of the amazing things about VR is that it'll actually incorporates the movement of your body, which no video games or TV, video games and TV obviously can't do. Yeah, the, the Servios guys are fantastic. And they are true visionaries when it comes to the virtual reality movement. And they really do fully understand what needs to happen for this to be a real, true occurrence in the history of mankind. They know that you have to have all of your senses be fulfilled in this experience. And so when it comes down to it, when you put on their gear and you're standing in their little stadium, their stage, and they give you these controllers and you just have the ability to control the environment, experience the environment in multiple levels, it really truly makes you appreciate this future technology and where it's going to take us. Do you think that the homes, homes in the, in the near future are going to actually have VR rooms built into that house? Absolutely. I mean, I do, it's, it's going to have to be a necessity. I mean, if you look at it right now, there are children who are sitting 10 foot away from their television and they have a controller in their hand and their gaze fixed upon their 46 inch LCD TV on the wall and, and they are just immersed and everything around them is completely gone. And all you have to do is take that exact same experience and make it VR. And you're not losing anything. You're gaining future technology. And you tell people there's going to be VR rooms and houses and they're like, whatever, I'm not going to have a fucking VR room. It's like, well, you've got a TV room. That's common. Like most homes have a goddamn TV room. No one blinks at that. But prior to the existence of the TV, there were, if you told somebody, there's going to be special rooms in homes where it's not a fireplace, but a glowing rectangular hypnotic screen with couches arranged and speakers arranged, they would be like, what are you, no, I would never build a room like that in my house. What, what would a VR room look like? What do you, what does your VR room look like? A VR room looks like, well, there's two ways that you could look at this. You could look at what the ultimate is and you can look at what the practical is. So the practical is you don't even necessarily have to have a screen, but if you do, it's out of the way. You have a high end computer running the technology. You have your headset with the wires hanging from the ceiling or a wireless answer. Yeah, you have, you have seats for your friends who can be involved off to the wall. You've got a lot of room to move around. I mean, that's going to be the key is that you have a lot of empty space to move around and you have the ability to protect yourself from potentially, you know, taking a nosedive through a paying glass window or something. Yeah, they're going to be pad. The room's got to be padded. They're going to have to have some kind of nerfed padding. And, you know, well, yeah, the like the people watching you experience the VR, that's going to be a big part of it too. But, you know, when we, when I, we, I did survey us, my girlfriend ended up slamming her hand into a desk just because you forget, you forget so quickly that you're in another, that you're in a room. And you just think that you're in a, you know, the place that the virtual reality is projecting into your mind. So, yeah, these rooms have got to be padded, little padded rooms. Yeah, and it doesn't take long for you to get so immersed in these worlds that you forget that if I'm swinging my hand with a baseball bat or a hatchet, full speed at something in a, in a, in a fake space that who knows what that's actually going to hit. I mean, I could have very easily punched somebody's lights out while playing this game at Cervios and not having thought anything of it. Not even. I'm so involved in this game. Do you foresee the one we've gotten, you know, like ear buds or virtual reality for your ears? And the TV is a kind of virtual reality that you're being pulled into. But the one thing that they haven't been able to digitize is smell. Do you, do you know anything about this? Is there any kind of like smell technology on the horizon? You know, there are, there has been some forays into that field. People have attempted to do different things. I even saw a one piece of technology that had a an assortment of like 300 different scents that could be blasted at you at your face to give you a sensation of your smelling something. I honestly don't know if that is as important as all of the other senses. So I think smell might need to come, but maybe later down the road. You know, man, I have to disagree with you there. I think that we just haven't, because it's something so crazy to imagine how you're going to have a scent dispersal system that can like reproduce smells. But just imagine in, I don't know, imagine being a playing call of duty, for example, and smelling the charred flesh of the people you just blew up. Like imagine playing, I don't know, whatever the next world of warcraft is going to be. And standing in some field and smelling flowers, smelling the like, you know, the feeling that I think that that is a really important thing. People just don't know how to do it. So we like just get used to not being able to smell anything. But to understand how important smell is the next time you find yourself out in a forest or anywhere in nature, just, you know, clamp your nose shut for a little while. Oh, yeah. No, it definitely has to happen. I just don't think that that the people who are developing this technology are looking at it as a priority. I mean, maybe we need to, maybe we need to petition these companies to make sure that they attack this as well and move it up on their priority list just a bit. But I think one of the pieces that people are really focusing on right now that is important is the control mechanisms with which you interact with these VR world. So the gloves or the controllers that track your body movement, those are important pieces right now that we need fully developed. To go along with our head mounted displays. Yeah, that's right. You serve us has some kind of, I don't know what it's how it's doing what it does. But it's like it definitely seems like it's using some form of whatever the connect is doing, along with that weird thing on your head. I don't understand the stuff, you know, I'm purely an enthusiast. I don't I'm not a technician. But yeah, that's that's that's a really important thing that we need. And then I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about haptic technology and anything that you might know about producing like using wind or fans to create a sense of like defining spaces. Haptics is very important because not only do you need to be able to manipulate the virtual world, but the virtual world has to be able to manipulate you back. And so there has to be for every action and equal and opposite reaction. And haptics is the technology technological answer to that. So you have to have, you know, there are devices. There's a company called Tactical Haptics that has a reactive grip control. And when you hold it in your hand and one of my favorite demos that they have is a fishing game where you pull back and you whip your fishing rod out and your your fishing lure goes out into the water and you can jerk that thing and wind it in and you feel it in your hand like a real fishing rod. Wow. And it is unbelievable. They have a slingshot where you pull back with one hand and you feel the tension as you're pulling that back in the farther back you pulled of the tighter it gets and it's real and it feels sensation. What are the materials that they're using? How do they are they pulling that off? It is several servos that are moving things against your skin. So when you actually feel if you take a if if if you take a rod in your hand and then you pull back on it with your other, you'll feel your skin stretch against it against the material. That's what they're doing. They're simulating that by moving the servos against your hand. And it's fantastic technology. And, you know, everybody wants to know about this. Talk a little bit about where you see the future of pornography with this kind of technology. Absolutely. And it's something that I'm sure that will surprise folks because Reverend Kyle doesn't, you know, why would he talk? No, I'm a huge advocate of the porn in the VR world. I think it is an amazing thing. If you end up with a good video or a good experience and you do it in VR, you'll end up very, very happy. Is it a replacement for the real thing? Absolutely not. But there are pieces of technology out there that can simulate. You could take a flashlight and attach it to a servo. You could very easily just have your partner be involved. That's something that I have experimented with and having somebody mirroring what I'm seeing in the virtual world. And it's it's a fantastic, amazing experience. Wow. That's connected to everyone. So you have put on VR goggles. What what I when I, you know, I have I have a rift. And because I get motion sickness from the thing, I've I don't use it as I'm waiting for the new one as we I we can talk about that in a second. But I'm waiting for the new one. But so I could never really find any kind of good porn programs. And I definitely look for them. I couldn't find any kind of porn. Is there a newer new VR porn out there now that now? No, no, here's what you have to do. There's something very basic. It's a basic program that's been out for a long time. It's called VR player, and it just plays a video in stereo onto your ref. So it's a basic, simple video player. It just gives you the two images and they're barrel distorted. Now, here is where you have to get creative. You have to go find that perfect POV shot porn, right? You have to find the right one, the one that that just gets it. And there are very few of them, but I have a nice assortment. I'll have to send you some links. Please. Yes. It's very important that if you're going to do this, you do it correctly. Yes, we need a guide. You need to have a guide up on your side about that. Now, so you've had you've put the goggles on and then you've had your girlfriend or you've had a partner go through like mimic what was happening. Yes. Yes. My wife was watching the screen and she was simulating what I was watching. Wow. Now, that's super cool. And you have an awesome wife. Congratulations on this. I do. Thank you. Now, the the next thing that's going to happen, though, that when I think about porn, what I imagine is going to happen is like currently the way we film porn is, you know, you have lights and a camera and you film people that way. The next way they're going to start filming porn is using whatever the weird 3D camera things, you know, I don't know what those are, but those weird camera staffs that record 3D space. And then it seems like there's going to be an addition to that, which is that the guy in the porn or the woman in the private guy is going to have something attached to his penis that is recording sensations on his penis so that his cock is like when you're when he's going in and out, it's exact. It's recording that whatever that is. And then this haptic technology you were talking about, you could have something that you put on on your penis on your cock that takes the place of an awesome wife. If you don't have an awesome wife who's going to do that, it will perfectly replicate the experience of this porn actor. Yes. And that will happen. And that is being developed as we speak. So it's just a matter of time before you see that as well. And it's going to make it's going to cause all sorts of amazing experiences and problems at the same time. And for example, what it's going to allow you to do is you will be able to record the sensations of making love to your girlfriend in the same way. Some people shoot videos of themselves having sex. You're going to actually be able to record a sexual experience. And anytime you want to have that again with your girlfriend or wife or boyfriend, you're going to be able to experience that even after the breakup. And where it gets even stranger and more in the problems like you're talking about is when I was a kid and I went to visit my dad after the divorce, when he went to work, the very first thing I would do is try to hunt down his porn collection. But in this case, what's going to happen is kids are going to stumble upon the recordings of their parents having sex and they're actually going to feel what it's like to be their parents having sex. And that's fucked up. That is that is some like, wow, yeah. No, I hadn't thought about it to that extreme. But yeah, that's some edible, edible type of stuff there. Yeah, man, and it's going to get even weirder. Like imagine five generations down the line and the same way we have like old antique family pictures, you're going to be like, do you want to experience what it was like when your great-grandmother had sex with your great-grandfather? I love this. This is this takes it to an absurd level that I hadn't thought about. And I love it because you're absolutely right. This is messed up beyond. But you know, this is a plot line to a movie, actually. There was a movie from like the mid eighties. It was called it's called Strange Days. Great there. That it had a great soundtrack, didn't it? That was an amazing soundtrack. I don't know. That was it. They were selling the experiences of having sex with different women. Oh, that's right. Yeah. So that's that's what it's going to be. You're going to get, you know, it's going to leak. It's going to be leaked into the it's it's going to be people. There's new sex tape. It's not going to be watch Kardashian have sex. It's going to be feel what it's like to have sex with Kim Kardashian or feel what it's like to be Kim Kardashian having sex. And that's going to be so wild to be able to experience that. And that's a sex is a huge part of the human experience. So what we're talking about here is this aside from the the the the being able to replay sex, we're talking about massive digital orgies happening inside VR space live. It's not just that you're going to once the technology exists to reproduce a sexual experience. Obviously, it's you're going to be able to stream one too. I wonder because now since we're delving into this area, what would it cost to purchase the sensation to have sex with a Kardashian? But think of the economical aspects here. The entire entire industry could be created and empires built all around Kim Kardashian's vagina. It's already happened, unfortunately. But that's the other thing is, you know, the can't the sexual cameras of the future are going to look like dildos. They're going to be, you know, phallic haptic recording devices that women can use like webcam girls are going to be able to push into their vagina some kind of sensor technology that a guy will have a sheath on his cock and will actually experience having virtual sex with her in real time. That's the prostitution of the future. You know, a lot of people are talking about the people are going to lease androids that are going to be sexual partners and workers for them. But I think before that happens, this other thing is going to happen, which is that some kind of flesh light that simulates haptically simulates the sensation of having sex in real time with people with cam girls. That's going to happen. Absolutely. I totally agree. Actually, it's going to be quite interesting. It's going to be quite interesting and it's going to create all kinds of fascinating problems. But again, you know, that's just one little thing. It's like it's the sex is a huge thing. A lot of money is going to go into these technologies. But what about other nonsexual stuff? Like, what does it feel like to shake hands with the president? You know, that kind of stuff, just like gloves that you can wear that record these haptic technology, it records sensation. You know, that's what we're looking at, because VR, to record, to produce these digital experiences, the recording devices of the future are not just going to be cameras. They're going to be sensation recorders, right? Absolutely. Yeah, this is all truth. I mean, we're going to see these things. They sound ridiculous now, but they're not. They're going to exist in reality in the next year or two and or three, maybe. But yes, you're going to have all of these different experiences. I was very pleased. I went, I had a chance to go meet. There's a group of guys out in LA, the company's called Kite and Lightning. And they had a technology at their office that blew my mind. It was this huge jungle gym looking device. It looked like something out of like a horror movie or like some sort of weird like sexual dungeon torture chamber. And there was a bed on it. You laid down in it and they put a rift on me and these headsets. And I was transported out into space and they had a fan that blew down on you. And I'm traveling through this like Arctic world and I could feel it. There was it was snowing in this digital world. I could feel the motion, the movements and the sound. And there were these like vibrations coming out underneath the table. And they had these like like motors that were shaking and the fan blowing on me. I actually felt like I was in this like cold world. And those sensations were easily created now. Imagine what they'll be able to do with technology a year from now. Fuck, beds of the future are not going to be beds. Beds of the future are going to be some kind of sensory some kind of holodeck that makes so much sense. They're going to have beds that you lay down on. And as you're going to sleep, it's like, where do you want to sleep? Experience what it fall asleep in a in a in a forest or fall asleep in a, you know, in a volcano, just depending on what it is you want to experience. I mean, the problem, of course, the problem right now is it's probably hard to sleep with a goddamn giant plastic blindfold on, which is what the rift is. But that clearly that's going to shrink down. Well, yeah, and imagine the invalid and in the Alzheimer's, the people who are affected by all these just depilitating diseases and they are laying in a bed and they cannot experience the world. We can suddenly give them this sensation of living again. Oh, I know, man, our kids in children's hospitals. Oh, my God, so many wonderful things that are going to be done with this stuff and air travel, you know, flying in planes. The planes are going to have these VR goggles that you put on. And, you know, I imagine they're going to remove the exterior of the planes. You're just floating in the sky real time. And it's a funny, I have a funny story about that. I actually flew out to LA a month or so ago and I actually had brought a portable device, an Android based the Derovis dive is an Android based VR experience. And so I put it on my head and I'm watching a movie in VR and the guy sitting in the plane next to me, he goes, what in the hell are you doing? And I said, oh, no, don't worry, man, it's VR. It takes me into another world. And I ended up doing like an hour and a half demo to all of the people sitting around me in the plane. And I'm thinking to myself, even at 30,000 feet, here I am evangelizing and showing everyone the future. It's so cool. And in the tyranny of experience, it's like the tyranny of this the the idea that we as human beings are finally innovating away to free ourselves from the tyranny of reality, which forces itself upon us just as it is, you know, the idea that suddenly we're able to we're going to free ourselves from you're not going to be in a plane anymore. You're not going to be sitting staring around in some boring, gross plane, watching people with hangovers, puking the bags. You're going to be flying through the air with no one around you, just you alone. That is beautiful, man. I find that to be so beautiful. Why do you think people or some people are so against or terrified of or just so generally dismissive of this technology? Fear, pure fear. I really truly believe that people just fear technology, especially when it does something they've never seen before. Then there's another group of people who also are just purely skeptical of everything. Oh, we've seen that before. We've seen that before. That's not new and it's not going to work and they'll just dismiss it. But those are the people who come back after they see the success and they see the the the masses of consumers just just just dumping their money out down the drain to get this technology. They those people come back, but there will always be that group that just are afraid they fear change. And I don't think there's anything you can do to get through to those folks. Do you how far away do you how long how long is it before there is a legal virtual reality experiences that are legislated? I unfortunately, I think that'll happen within a year. Possibly 18 months. But I have a feeling that once consumer VR hits the world and it starts being purchased, you're going to see children who spend all their time in it or somebody does something very, very stupid while wearing this. An irresponsible adult does something very stupid. I try to drive with one. Yeah. And suddenly there's litigation and then regulation and then just absolute chaos. I a lot of it, I'm going to have to blame a lot of this when it does occur. I'm just going to foreshadow here. I have a feeling that mainstream media is going to be virtual realities biggest enemy. They are going to run with every negative thing that they can find about this new technology and it's going to be a detriment to the future. Yeah, I think you're absolutely right. That is what's going to happen because, you know, mainstream media is already there, at least TV is just a old, crumbling, dying, disgusting Bayamoth. It's like TV right now reminds me of when the whales wash up on the beach and just start rotting. It's just this gross, rotting, stupid thing. And yeah, they're not going to like the fact that this new, this new incredible way of absorbing content happens. Do you think that I think what the problem is going to be one of the more we begin to with greater and greater precision, duplicate reality, and the more difficult it becomes to discern the rift dimension from this dimension, that's where the problems are going to come. And it feels like there's going to have to be a that the beginning legislation might be that in really realistic VR games or VR experiences, there has to always be some glowing thing on the screen showing you that you're in a virtual world and not the real world. You know, something that always reminds you, you are not in the real world right now, you're in virtual space, because that's where the that's the there will be a court case where somebody says, I didn't know that I thought I was in a video game when I strangled my wife. Yeah, I unfortunately, yes, that is a future news reel. But there's nothing we can do about it. You know, it just like in terms of of addiction, you can you can relate it to addiction. Addiction is not the fault of the substance. Addiction is the fault of the person consuming the substance, not being able to handle themselves. Right. And so you cannot blame the addiction that the see the substance is not responsible for the addiction. So when it comes to VR, when somebody says, oops, I didn't know that I was not in VR. I thought it was OK to kill her because I thought it was a video game. That is that person's fault for not understanding the difference. Well, I thought of the sorry, go ahead and sorry. No, no, that's basically my point. Well, I thought of a malicious game that that you that scans your house, you know, that's the other thing that happens is it's like this is. So words, I don't know when this is going to happen. This is my prediction of what what happens in the future, which is that you buy these little mini like camera drones or scanning drones and you bring them into your house and you release these scanning drones and the scanning drones fly through your house, recording your entire house and replicating that so that you could be in your walk through your house with your VR goggles on and be in VR space. So the game is you put the VR goggles on and the very first part of the game is you take the VR goggles off and you're still in the house that was created by the swarm by the drones, you know what I'm saying? So that the game tricks you into thinking that you're not playing the game anymore. Well, absolutely. And so what we have to do is we have to make sure that people are responsible enough with their own technology to have some sort of safe word or something to let themselves know that they are not still in the virtual world. You know, it's going to be a little while before the technology is so perfect that we get to that point where people can't tell the difference between the two. But it's a neural prosthesis because as long as you, you know, the reminder is you touch your face and you're going to feel this fucking thing on your head. Even if it is small goggles, you'll feel them where it gets weird is when it's an implant or some kind of like sound, something that like uses vibrations to stimulate your neocortex to create duplicate realities inside your brain. That's where that's where you can get trapped in a virtual world. And that's where you're in the virtual. It's so fun to think about this game, though, where as part of the game, you go to a psychologist and you're like, I know I'm in a video game and the psychologist in the game is like, you're just not, you've gone insane, you know, there's no way out after that. You're in a Philip K. Dick novel after that. Because even if, you know, finally the game gets deactivated or whatever, you're still never going to trust the reality that you're in. I am totally going to go once we're done talking and start writing a game that does exactly that. Please, that that that is just, you know, you you go to a doctor and the doctor says, no, this is real. This is real life. Yeah, just try the whole point of the game is to convince you that the virtual world is real. That's dangerous. Yeah. The idea is it turns this dimension inside out. And, you know, the the the when I took, when you take, when I was at Servios and I took the thing off and I went out back to talk to the guys, I was like, holy fucking shit, man. Like, I'm not sure this is real. There's a second where your brain is like, wait a minute, if that's not real, this thing that I just experienced and just automatically believed was real, are you telling me this is real? Now I have to just believe this is real. So a game that fans the flames of that suspicion so that when you pull the thing off, you know, that you aren't quite sure that you've pulled the thing off. That's got to be part of the game. Is the character in the game is always taking the goggles off. You put the game on the character. When you put the goggles on, the character in the game takes his goggles off. And, you know, oh, yeah, you know, some kind of virtual wife says to you, would you why are you always playing that stupid game? You know, you'll appreciate this. There is a there's a group of guys who are developing a piece of software called Riftmax Theater and Riftmax Theater has become this haven of different virtual shows. I actually hosted a virtual talk show of like a late night type of thing there. We do stand up comedy. We do karaoke on Thursday nights and we do all of this virtually. And we have avatars. We go meet each other. I have spent on one occasion six and a half hours with an Oculus Rift and headphones on in the Riftmax Theater software and interacting with folks from all around the planet. And I'll tell you what, when I took those things off, finally, there was about a good half hour where I seriously wasn't sure where I was. Yeah, that that thing that you just described, there will be a name for that. We don't have a name for that feeling, but that is a new feeling for the humans to have. And yeah, I don't know what that is. It's some kind of like jet lag, virtual jet lag or something where your your mind can't accept the fact that you're in a completely different universe when you are a different kind of dimension when you spent so much time in one. So yeah, man, that's going to be an interesting challenge for an interesting field of topic of study or subject for psychologists to explore. And then the other thing that I wanted to talk to you about, I know we've gone over an hour, but this is such a so fun to talk to you about this stuff, Reverend. Is the drugs, psychedelics and the various drugs that combine with this, with virtual reality. Don't you foresee certain drugs emerging, tryptomines or psychedelics that are especially tailored to go along with a virtual experience? I think that there is definitely room for that. You know, if folks choose to enhance their real life experiences with whatever type of drugs that they choose, that's fantastic. I feel like that should translate very well into the virtual world. I have seen things in the virtual world and I have said to myself, wow, this would be amazing on, you know, whatever type of enhancement drug. So yeah, it's definitely going to translate well. And I think that it's going to open up some new horizons for a lot of a lot of people. It's just this device that you would have. And I don't know how the drug would be administered to you, but some kind of advice were in the same way that the game is metering out your experience of sound and sight. It would also be metering out like little drops of some kind of caffeine like substance or some kind of like sedative or something. You know what I mean? So that you're not just experiencing fans blowing on you. You're not just experiencing some chemical con concoction to duplicate smell. You're not just experienced the haptic reality of feeling things push against you. But also you're experiencing shifts in your actual neural state by some kind of induction that's happening using a drug and a device that can pump it into you according to whatever is happening in the game. So some of the most inventive pieces of technology that I have seen in my days have come from folks who are trying to find a new way to administer some sort of recreational drug. I've seen novelty and ingenuity at its greatest as a result of trying to consume whatever type of mind altering substances they choose. And so, yes, this is definitely going to be a reality, something that occurs where you have people who want to take a really, really good experience of virtual reality and then kick it up to eleven and really and really have something to help them be even more immersed. Well, yeah, that's it. It's that's what it is. It's like more and more and more immersion. That's what we want. You that's that's the idea is deeper and deeper levels of immersion. And the final step, the ultimate step, is going to be a way to digitally record a person's feeling states, literally their emotional states and their thought patterns so that in the virtual state, as whatever avatar that you're playing, you don't just experience having the shell of the thing around you. But imagine playing Wolfenstein and hearing the thoughts of the character that you're inside your own head. You know, it's this technological, I don't know, this GF 2045, they were talking about neural prosthesis that they put in. I think they said your hippocampus or something that records thoughts and memories. Isn't that the final step of this? This is where shit really, really goes off the deep end is where when you go into these virtual worlds and you assume your world of Warcraft character in 2045, you actually assume their memories as well. Yeah, that's it. That is the final frontier. Absolutely. Man, it is such a blast talking to you. You are such an expert in this stuff. And I think people are going to want to want to have chats with you and connect with you. How can people find you out there? It's very easy. You can go and find me on the website road to VR.com. I'm part of the road to VR team. Road to VR is the best place to go for all of your virtual reality news. I actually do a podcast, the Rev VR podcast. I do it weekly, mostly. And it's available on iTunes and on Stitcher. So you can find me there. I'm also on Twitter under Reverend KJR. You can also find a lot of this information. A lot of the things that I spend quite a bit of time in the Oculus subreddit, which is where a lot of the VR community resides. I'd also like to encourage everyone, if you are interested in becoming part of this VR community, that you can actually go and join our chats. There are several chat programs available, VRChat.net, where you can go to riftmax.com and download the application and join us for a chat virtually. It's a lot of fun. Yeah, I would like to do that after we stop recording. I'd like to talk to you about doing that because I do have a rift. Can you assure the people listening right now? Is there any way that you can prove that we are not in some kind of super advanced simulation right now and you're just the voice of the machine? No, I can't. And that's what's wonderful about this. Thank you so much, Reverend Kyle. Howdy, Krishna. Everybody definitely follow him on Twitter. And I'm going to talk to him now about figuring out a way to go into this riftmax space so maybe we can figure out a Duncan Trestle family hour meetup with Reverend Kyle once this thing gets released so we can all hang out in virtual space together, those of you who haven't. Thanks for listening, everybody. And please go check out Reverend Kyle's website. Go to DuncanTrestle.com. Check out all the new dates. Give us a nice rating on iTunes.

Welcome back to the DTFH to get everybody up to speed here. We were talking on the phone the other day and you started telling me about this incredible trip you just took and I because I guess I have become a true pig like capitalism is the like in infected me so much that I said wait don't tell me anything let's do this is a lot as a DTFH and then later I thought why not mix the two together and see what happens but that's the that's how we ended up where we're at today my sweet family and so now I'm gonna give the mic to Robert because he just went on this insane beautiful spiritual trip and I want to hear every detail. Thank you I don't think it was a capitalist tendency because what I've been learning going on these pilgrimages that is super important to bring a little something back from it you know and share it and that's why not like why would you even bother to make a trip to a holy mountain and not bring some of that back with you your trip would be a waste of time in any other way so I'm happy to share it and I don't think it's it's not a commodification of our friendship or our conversation but I know what you mean you know like yeah you just want to like run to the to the mountaintop and scream it from there and like you know I definitely need to be a little careful about how I talk about a lot of these pilgrimages especially this current one because the place I went is pretty secret it's a hidden place but I can say that I was brought by my guru whose name is Rudra Abhishek to the mountain range in the Balkans and we explored a series of caves that are man-made by the Trussian people ancient ancient people they they're saying they could be 6,000 to 8,000 years old they're they definitely predate a christ and what they walk they were temples that were built into the mountain to worship the divine mother wow now they're in they're in the shape of a uterus you uh you sent me some pictures I showed one to Erin and she was just like whoa that is that is most certainly not just a uterus it's like a pre-birth it looks like they're about to give birth to something when you mentioned the we you just gave us a lot of information by the way your guru is he from the Balkans no he's not he he has some devotees that are from that area that were a little bit familiar with the lore of the these uteruses um but he's from Spain uh so he's from Europe and someone had told him about them and he said what you know he felt the call to go worship there so he had went on a personal pilgrimage to this place and uh he felt the her presence so so strongly there that he brought us back wow with him yeah wow now I guess the the one of the many things that have blown my mind about this trip is like this idea of the the Prussian people I was crushing Trussian people I was not Prussian we know the the Trussian people I was googling at you I couldn't really find a lot of information on them but after seeing these pictures which folks who are watching live uh I think I know a way that I can share the screen a different screen so you can see these pictures but we'll do it after we finish this conversation who who are these people there's not I don't know much about them I do know that they were like uh probably what the pagan people of Europe would be like in that region but it's definitely there's a huge Vedic influence there too and um you know I I I think it's probably possibly from a different age entirely that that these were being used as temples and worship there um but they I would you know they have like their version of stone hinge so I think they were probably like similar to pagans maybe later on in time before you know before christ but way back I think it's a whole other whole other group of people you know that were inhabiting this planet before you know a completely different system you know if you if you believe in the yuga system it was from a different yuga possibly okay like pre like what some people would say pre flood or yeah pre deluge yeah pre deluge pre um what is it that the graham handcock talks about the uh comet impact during the lesser driest but like this is the thing that got that got rid of the mammoths and the uh extinction yeah but these people might have been living with those creatures but they're it's not like you know the it's it's not like the myth of like the savage caveman it's like these were very very advanced people who were reaching the end of just to have the technology to be able to build these things you know to carve these out and and I mean we hiked pretty high up to get to these places and it wasn't easy to sort of bring any kind of tools and things like that we were bringing stuff to to to worship and we had a difficult time and uh you know just to be able to to create such a place in that environment they had to be pretty advanced what when you say you're bringing tools to worship maybe you could talk a little bit about what the what your your guru's plan was for this trip well it was amazing because um one of the the major themes of the trip was like kind of he was encouraging us to let go of our ideas of what we thought god would be or spirituality or even worship would be and just to be able to be like absorbed in the grace of being in these caves you know and like he was kind of setting us up you know like helping us connect with a more subtle energy of this cave so like one of the one of the caves that we visited he did a silent meditation but we began with um two we we began with ohm and creme those two um so we chanted those and i'm not i'm not kidding man those syllables filled the cave and they stayed there our entire meditation so it was completely silent and uh wow he was drawing like yantras in the in the ground and that would change the vibration of the cave or he was kind of working with these these subtle vibrations but like really kind of like nurturing them and like connecting with them and just like the the idea of the divine mother is she's the expression of the consciousness you know like um there's the idea of uh purusha and pakrati so purusha is like the um dormant uh kinetic energy and uh pakrati is the kinetic energy you know and that's like uh when it's the god and the goddess one's like the dormant and one's the the the potential the kinetic you know and then also the subject and the object you know and um the doer and the the dawn so yeah so uh that sounds so crazy yeah the you're saying that he started chanting these mantras and they like it's like they stayed they just hovered there around you without chanted them together yeah they just filled the room and they were they were present you we stopped chanting it and it was there you know until we left you know it sounds like someone like logging like i mean not to completely reduce it to something as unmistakable as possible but it sounds like someone walking in like in some future apocalyptic situation knowing how to use a computer you know what i mean like recognizing this tech this is a technology and i know how to i can interact with it a little bit is what it sounds like to me yeah and that's really what sadhana is it's the technology you know sadhana is like your practice your your connection with the divine and you learn the technology to work with the elements of the divine in order to manifest it in yourself you know and that's what he's encouraging us to do is manifest this energy this vibration of the devi and have it in our lives and so we could be able to see her in all we do and in our actions in our thoughts and in everything and and he's really like good about encouraging like the highs and lows in life too like not all the good stuff that happens still it still comes from her it still comes from the divine it still comes from the grace of the divine everything happens by it so he's really good it's not she doesn't sugarcoat it at all you know and he knows how dry and difficult a life like this can be he is very from my from my understanding of him is he's a very he's like a strict guru and it's that is that an accurate description of him uh yeah for lack of a better word he he's direct you know and uh he's he's he keeps it real 100 you know and he can joke he has a great sense of humor he loves like you know just having talking like friends talk you know and there was a lot of that on this trip which was really sweet and beautiful too but when he gets down to business he gets down to business and he doesn't he doesn't uh he doesn't bend on anything his uh his focus is very strong and he won't be he nothing can really derail him i've never seen him derailed by by some pretty insane obstacles he can't be wow if your friend is feeling bad or mad or damn try cheering them up with a

Squarespace now now some backstory here it's not like this person just met you and then said let's go up to the Balkans to a mystical cave to commune with the divine mother you've been going through for a while now what seems to be some pretty rigorous purification rituals is that what you could call them can you talk about that a little bit yeah so he's he's been helping me for the last 12 years with the purification process in this life you know every single journey I've gone on with him or every teaching he's taught me there's been a process of purification for sure and it's been very carefully built into me this this purification process you know like he would you know he won't teach you something until you're ready to be to learn it you know yeah so it's that kind of process and he's very careful because he knows that there's a lot of damage a lot of damage can be done in a lot of this work you know you're dealing with like huge amounts of energy and awareness and you know stuff that you know if you're not ready for it it can really throw your life into like a ditch you know yeah well what do you mean a ditch like you mean like because you sort of recognize this transcendent reality it's hard to you disconnect with the earth you mean or yeah and just like um you know you're constantly have to challenge your mind you know so you're constantly challenging your mind you're challenging your thoughts you're challenging your ego you know just to sit on the floor can be such a battle that's that's the kurukshetta in the Bhagavad Gita is just getting on the floor and sitting still for a moment by kurukshetta he means the battle that the the Bhagavad Gita the battlefield of the yeah the battlefield which is our body yeah you know like uh that that's going on the the battles oh we're always waging the war you know and like the the outward wars that we see happening in society are the inward wars that we're fighting every day you know they manifest on on physical battlefields just as much as emotional and spiritual battlefield okay this is so i'm getting goosebumps now that you're mentioning this this concept of the battlefield or the field only because this is where i'm at while you're building temples going to the Balkans and mystical caves i'm listening to the Bhagavad Gita audiobook and mowing my lawn so this is my my level but uh which is i'm i'm i like that level but i'm listening to it and clearly i'm this moment was supposed to happen because i got absorbed into a verse that i've always found to be somewhat mysterious and i've wondered if it's a translation issue or something maybe you can help me understand it which is is Krishna is telling Arjuna he's saying there is the field and the knower of the field so you know that for you know the verse i'm talking about and um i always thought to myself is he meaning like the battlefield or is this more like an an energy field or but is that kind of what you're is that a literal sort of concept which is like your your body is no different from the battlefield of sacred duty in the Bhagavad Gita i think that's a great way of explaining it the field is the self and the knower of the field is the knower of the self and that's the one i think later on in that verse that's who it becomes dear to me i think he says or something like that yes yeah so um yeah i think that's what it is the the field the unified field is the self is consciousness you know we're unified through consciousness in this world to every single aspect of this world so to know the self is to know the outside world as well okay and and if the mother is consciousness then we're sort of we are the mother then or we are there we're like we're we're there we never left the mother's breast as long as we have consciousness it's like a result of communion even if we don't recognize it yeah that's why i'm climbing mountains to climb into uterus trying to get back in which was amazing to be in the uterus because if you were sitting facing in the cave you enter through the cave mouth and then the uterus is like carved inside the cave so if you were facing it you would get this overwhelming amazing feeling of absorption you know and like this kind of magnetic pull towards it and if you face the other way facing out looking out into the world it was this sense of birth and expression you know so you were you know there's there was like a dying state and a being born state happening within the cave if you could tune your awareness towards that that is so i've never had that kind of experience through nature you know what i mean like i've gone to sacred rivers i've been to many of quite a few sacred mountains but they've had temples on them this was just like you're in nature and yeah the the the expression of the the people the artists that made these these masterpieces in the caves i did it did take me to sit in there to figure it out but it it taught me like kind of being born from the earth and and going back into the earth in this life and many other lives this is making me think of one of the weirdest ketamine trips i ever had where some stone elemental like was in a cave gesturing for me to follow it into the cave and then i'm you know in the ketamine vision i'm like oh sure why not why wouldn't you and i followed it in but then i became you know became the cave became the mountain became everything you know it had tricked me or something but that's what it makes me think of is that uh how very close at any given moment a human life is to becoming the earth like it you know we are the earth but i mean fully letting go and merging i just never thought of of it somehow is going back into the womb that's pretty trippy yeah going in going back out you know the the cycle this episode of the d t f h has been supported by better help is there something interfering with your happiness that's preventing you from achieving your goals like maybe there seems to be some kind of shadowy dark fanged toothed anger wolf living inside of you that explodes out at unexpected moments causing complete destabilization of whatever your life might have been like

we were going to visit some caves in uh in uh the south in the united states and the next day but he had uh he'd gone into this like kind of meltdown kind of like heavy metal rob zombie kind of he was like on his knees kind of looked like a werewolf and what's going i am the cave which was amazing because we were going to visit him the next day but it's funny that you said that so maybe that's like an archetypal psychedelic experience yeah you know merging with the earth becoming part of the base level reality just pure stone pure yeah they call it getting stung i guess why they call it getting stoned merging with a plate of like cheese fries and a diner at two o'clock in the morning because you're coming down off an LSD you know what when i was on ketamine a cheese fry elemental lured me into a cheese fries i became a cheese fry um so the when what do you when your guru takes you to a place like this and you realize that you know i guess you already understand who you're dealing with but do you wonder like where did he learn to do this where where where did he get the the teaching from to know to come to this cave or to be smart enough to recognize that this cave was a mystical place and to understand how to interact with it like where is that coming from is that from his guru or is that yeah he has gurus and masters that he he learned from but it's it's a past life thing for sure to me like i've had too many experiences with this soul that i know that we've been connected on different we've been connected in other lives for a long time and i can see the way he he can read a situation or how he he conducts himself like this is a full life's work not just a 75 year work this is thousands of years you know wow this this being's been and you know it's crazy we were visiting and it's funny i picked the a picture you had Duncan had asked me to send some pictures to him and one of the the pictures that i picked was this it was a samadhi of a saint who who is mummified it's one of the few in india where the the body's actually outside of a tomb because the holy people will become they'll get put into the ground you know and that's where they they maintain the state of samadhi underground so this one's above ground and it's like a mummified samadhi and we went to visit that that place and there was a painting on the wall and there was a painting of a of a one of the the saint's students and it was a it was a painting of my guru like it looked it it looked just like wow and he said he had showed that picture to a to his mom and uh she cried when she saw it because she knew right you know you know that's so i think i've we've talked about this it's worth talking about again but that's one of my favorite neem curly baba stories is you know he was having darshan and a woman saw him and and started crying and said you're my father's guru you're my father's guru you know and but that would it would have been impossible because of his age for that to happen and then he said to her something along the lines of he started crying and said i went up into the mountains i went up into the mountains and like wow i never heard that story before i was just like whoa yeah i've never heard that yeah well i mean because you know i like it's a it's a recurring theme in guru stories is this sort of like not being sort of um not hanging out in the time stream the way we are it it is Krishna talks about it in the Bhagavad Gita saying as i recall something along the lines of there was never a time when you did not exist you you know but i can remember i remember you don't that's the difference but but but people who seem to be like truly enlightened they are given the gift of their admission of whatever that kind of amnesia is that sure and and they get hints of it all the time right like people come to them that have been connected to them so they're constantly being reminded of it or um i don't know yeah i i think i think they're very aware of their their past yeah i mean i yeah i think it must i think it's you know whenever i wouldn't advise this necessarily but whenever you feel like playing around with the just kicking around like wonder what it would be like to be enlightened and that's probably a horrible trap because the more you kind of come up with that version of it probably the further away from it you're gonna get but still just thinking of the difference and in the way that i would act in the world or that my the way my consciousness would manifest if i didn't have amnesia of what happened before this oh yeah yeah um it could be it could be it's like seeing x-ray you know like see it's like being able to see everyone's organs you know or like yeah and like i was i was mentioning samadhi before like the state of samadhi and what they call samadhis like uh these are these are called jiva samadhis where the soul remains even though the body's not functioning in the world anymore and then there's different states of samadhi that you reach through meditation or awareness and i've met people that have entered the later states of samadhi and chose to come back to either teach or just chose to come back to give blessings and those people are operating on a completely different like they're in the united states they would be put into homes you know like institutionalized in india people recognize them you know and all over the world i know like in in other you know indigenous societies are um though you know a lot of people that might have been viewed as having like a bipolar or multiple personality disorders are the shamans of those villages because they can you know traverse into different worlds but i've met some of these saints they're called siddhas in um in south india and they're just like checked out like they're they don't make any uh rational sense to us but they're you can tell that they're they're operating in like a different uh dimension but living in this world it's crazy how the indoctrination that happens when you're born in the united states makes you so completely blind to that sort of thing and how the system here is set up in a way that it accidentally maybe not accidentally seems to relegate people like that to institutions it the you know tell you know how many saints and mystics do we have in this country right now who walk around with this diagnosis that they've been given who have this sense of like you know i think it's changing a little bit now like the field of mental health is changing we're coming up with like better ways to talk about it like the west is just come is just coming to the driveway of what india figured out what any ancient society would figure out but because now we're coming up with um new names to talk about it multiple personality disorder for example it's being changed like now i think they call themselves systems actually you know so it's an acknowledgement of like don't call it a disorder this is one of the ways consciousness manifests and you know my my body has become a kind of like i don't know what you call a fee a field but it there's more than one creature in this field you know and so yeah i know what you're saying it's like um i mean i can't how many if you ever had the thing happen where you're walking down the street you pass someone who is um in another country would be one of these people you're having some paranoid fantasy thinking about something maybe someone like someone named i've had this happen where i've been thinking like about you know someone named william who i was just thinking about you walk by someone like that and they they just start going william where's william william william you know what i mean but they don't have but they haven't been trained so it's an aberration and you know it's been a very difficult life for them to have to like be able to have that that ability or whatever you want to call it in no cultural reference for depending on where they were born yeah they they're able to see you know um a soul as a soul or or possibly see a spirit or a ghost you know or uh interdimensional being and uh you know then they're drugged and or you know put in an institution lobotomized yeah yeah yeah so yeah and and you know i don't want to confuse uh people who have achieved um you know some sort of uh amazing yogic initiation with someone who might just be schizophrenic schizophrenic or just but i think there's something there you know that uh these people i think the the ones that i met the cedar's i think they probably started out like probably went to the school and you don't know anything about their history you know but i think or yeah i don't it's a it's a confusing thing because i think there is of course there's a terrible mental health problem in in the world yeah and we just keep adding to it every day but there are people out there that could be confused as out of their minds and they're really truly out of their minds but into their souls when they see that you can cook they will want to hump you before netflix and chill make them chicken and creamy dill when you have your make out sesh you can thank hello fresh pretend that you're gordon ramsey getting spanked by a chimpanzee whatever strikes your fancy thank you hello fresh i want to thank hello fresh not just for supporting the d t f h but for producing many a romantic night in my life you see i'm not a great cook at least i wasn't until i ran in the hello fresh my problem is i always forget ingredients or i put too much of something in i have watched the cooking channel and i've always thought to myself how cool would it be to have the ingredients measured out already and you just dump them in this is hello fresh it does all the stressful meal planning for you plus it's cheaper than shopping at your local grocery store by 28 and 72 percent cheaper than a restaurant meal and probably way healthier because all their fresh ingredients are sourced directly from growers and delivered from the farm to your front door and under a week i love hello fresh these are it's not like you learn to cook something and then you forget about it by the way these are recipes that you'll carry with you for the rest of your life once you start learning how to cook you'll get confident you'll you'll become increasingly confident as a chef and this is exactly the kind of skill set that we need not just in day to day life but if the sun i don't know spits out some horrible flair and the power grid goes down it would be nice to know how to cook gourmet meals no matter what you should try hello fresh out it's such a nice gift that you can give to people as a delicious meal and with hello fresh you cut out all the risk it's always really good go to hello fresh dot com slash 12 dunkin and use code 12 dunkin for 12 free meals including free shipping 12 free meals that's hello fresh dot com slash 12 dunkin use code 12 dunkin for 12 free meals that includes free shipping hello fresh it's america's number one meal kit okay it's a little bit of a divergence but it completely connects because i just interviewed jeremy corbel who has been putting out a lot of these ufo videos that are all over the news and stuff and you know we were talking about the and he just posted this great instagram video but we were talking about the suppression of ufo reports from people in the military and so there's a physicist talking about in the 50s and 60s there was actually a directive to suppress anyone reporting that they'd seen a ufo and there was actually a fine if you were in the military and you reported it because it was everyone was seeing them and everyone was experiencing it and they didn't want the american people to know that the shit was flying around that the military had no idea what it was and so the information was suppressed similarly uh and i agree with you we do have to make a distinction between people with legitimate like neurological disorders and things like that and like mistakes i guess but i think there's no reason why anyone couldn't be a mystic regardless of the what circuitry they're running but the the um the the problem is for like if i see a ghost which i've seen i will i will talk about it i'll talk about in the pub podcast i'll tell my meditation teacher you know i remember seeing a friend of mine who committed suicide and you know as you as i see as i've come to understand i see ghosts you know and like not having the not even knowing what to do just looking over in there and really you know see i don't know if you've ever seen a suicide ghost but they're very confused usually they're very confused and they usually think they're in a dream or something have this sense of like they don't realize that they're dead because probably when they were killing themselves maybe they some of them i don't know was they were already kind of asleep or something i don't know but yes like a crossroads they're the crossroads yes and i remember my meditation teacher very seriously saying you know when you see that you're supposed to tell them they've died like that's the directive is you need to let them know that they're not it's not a dream like you're you're dead you drop there's nothing there to guide them towards it right right well i'm lucky because i'm surrounded by like people like you who i can talk about things like that with without being shamed for it a lot of people don't have that and so when you know and so there is a i i want to say an accidental suppression happening in the west but i don't know again i'm not sure it's accidental like here it's like there's the the if you are in the wrong company and you start talking about ghosts you're going to get i rolled into the next dimension man you know people are you're not going to get a job like if you're in a job interview and you mentioned i do believe it the existence of ghosts gnomes silk fairies whatever you're like okay you're fucking nuts even though it's a legitimate biome that we just haven't been able to like quantify it subjective reality is what it is you know and everyone's trying to kind of there's a agreed illusion that we all join in each day you know and anything that challenges that gets tamped down very fast you know like a good example of it is money you know you look at money it's this magic talisman in each of your pockets and uh it's only worth what you believe it to be you know and any once that concept gets challenged it immediately gets put down you know and that's i feel like that it's just to continue this idea of what everyone thinks they are what they could be and what they truly are always gets kind of like it's it's only for the people that for the known you know like that kind of thing right it shouldn't really be esoteric knowledge the fact that there is that kind of suppression of the truth or the the trueness or the awareness of the true reality there comes you know powers you can get powers because you're you know you start manipulating you know right you know oh my god it's i do it oh my god i do it with forest my two and a half year old because it's like we if we're playing with toys i'll palm something like i'm a horrible magician but when you're dealing with a two and a half year old you're fucking david copperfield man like you it's the most astounding thing they've ever seen because no one's run the awful like you know wiggle your hands distract them with this hand put the ball behind your back where to go oh god it's a true miracle so what you're saying is same thing at a different level which is like if you can if you can like keep people isolated from certain types of information it's going to make you seem that much more astounding when you deliver one of these miracles that should just be a normal way that humans interact in this dimension yeah wow that's trippy man sorcery it's like sorcerers took over and then like just but that being said any person alive today has access to the same information that you had access to that that vacuumed in you into this path and i mean let's not forget that right now you're sitting in a temple you constructed you're in a temple right now this is your you are a person you are my only friend who has constructed a temple and not like the way i put up temples i'll just like throw a ramdas picture up throw buddha in front of my meditation but you like actually install deities in this temple and that is no small feat because can you talk about like what goes into that yeah um it's it's a it's a pretty long process um i feel like i you know there were efforts that i made to make this temple occur here in my life but it occurred in my life beyond any of my reach you know it kind of built itself around me and with the help of many friends with the help of my teacher and with the grace of the divine like i couldn't have if it would have been insane for me to even think about five years ago but just being kind of queued into the awareness of like worship in your community can bring great benefit to you and the people around you i started working on this temple but i that that idea didn't like i didn't think that up you know what i mean like it it was brought to me it was given to me and now it's my job to facilitate it and i think that every one of us builds a temple of some sort and we worship deities all the time it's just which deity do you choose to put the garland on and unfortunately um i do it and i've done it my whole life i've i've put the big garland on the big ego you know and um when you start kind of stepping away from that and realizing that you know your efforts could be you know the ego's always going to be involved and that's i think that's the beauty of a lot of the sanatan dharma all the all the powerful dharmas that are being taught that you don't you don't get rid of the ego you work with the ego you know and you don't put the ego first and uh but when you say sanatan dharma can you let people know what that means that's that's the eternal dharma that's the dharma of like all the the the vishnavas the shivas the shaktis all of them together the big the big movement towards understanding of the self and the the dance with the people and god and that can it could expand even further out to all the other religions as well but the the continuing teaching the continuing of tradition the continuing of ritual the continue of mantra yantra you know all of it um the pushing it forward that's the dharma that's not the dharma now when you talk about this idea of like hanging the garland on the on whatever deity you choose uh it reminds me a little bit of sort of the earnest homes new thought the the manifestation stuff in other words like and it's in the Bhagavad Gita I mean all these trippy concepts are in this incredible book but you know those who worship uh the demigods go to the god the demigods those who worship me you know come to me me being you know the divine the divine the identity but there is within buddhism and hinduism this idea of like there's this potential for true whatever you want to call it transcendence eternal liberation but also if you want to you can you know go to other plant you can go to other like celestial planets when you die you can go to the realms of the gods from like building up good merit the same thing that happens on and planet earth which is if you become this is to me one of the great weird paradoxes of generosity is that the more generous you become weirdly the more things come to you like you the more you give away the more you get and if and then and then you it's like you realize oh this is some form of magic here and it doesn't even seem to care if i'm giving stuff away with the understanding that this will probably bring stuff to me it just is it's like some kind of physics or something so the idea is that that that doesn't just end up with you having good luck for a year straight or getting all these weird synchronicities that lead you to things it can eventually make you eventually you could become a demigod from these sorts of things but then you fall back down into human birth but also you know if you decide to start hanging your garland on cynicism on secularism or hardcore materialism or whatever the fuck it is you're gonna get that too that's the way it's gonna show up yeah you get all that you know and like it and nothing happens without an exchange you know like you don't ever get anything from nothing you know so wherever you're pointing your direction towards you will you know you will one day reach it you might not reach it the way you thought you were right you know and that's where the mind starts getting involved and starts getting you know that's when you start getting into the jungle of the mind you know and that's why why you see a lot of suffering where you know like when you when you choose those those things to worship you know like where if you choose to worship goodness and there's no mistaking goodness in your life but when you start worshiping the path of the sugary you know the honey path of the easy way out of all things you're gonna find that it wasn't very easy at all no no i guess that's the division you know like um what you choose to worship and how you get it i i mean to me that's what i love about the idea of god being so generous that it's not like you have to like worship christina according to uh or shiva or it's not like you have to worship the this uh in the traditional sense they're so merciful that the idea is like oh if you just think that i'm death then i will that's what i'll be for you i'll be your death if that's what you if that's how you want to interact with me that's how we'll do it or if you want you know it's all things but it seems like the moment you start recognizing that a natural kind of updraft starts happening right the moment you start recognizing like even whatever this particular relatively degraded sort of fixation i have on this thing or that thing there is within the potential for liberation when you start realizing what you're fixated on no matter what it may be as vile as it may be which is that other verse i don't know i love talking about the gita with you because you know it uh you know even the vilest of criminals if their minds are absorbed in me will cross over the material will cross through some sorrow as easy as stepping over a puddle something like that but that the absorption into anything isn't that the absorption into god even if you don't recognize that that's god yeah the perpetual motion you know there there's momentum once you start going towards something like that you know whether you start going towards god or whether you start going towards alcohol there's a momentum that builds up you know and if you know you can through through our perception you can see what the result of each one is you know but uh yeah i think that's what it is that they're like you said uh the stream starts happening and what happens is the flow starts happening because you stop swimming against the stream and you start going with it oh cool because your your mind's gonna talk you out of it any chance it gets yes you know like um and that's something i i'm sure you've learned through meditation like there's so many ways to talk yourself out of just sitting on the ground oh a million reasons to not meditate that's a good book um a million reasons not to meditate it's boring it hurts you're gonna look like an idiot don't do um your friends are gonna make fun of you know your family way you're gonna annoy the shit out of everybody when you get too happy and they're all depressed um but you know again that's another for me like that's something that uh i love experimenting with is because you know my ego it always wants me to be right it wants to win it it wants to it has this insane idea that you know almost it's better to be just a walking defense mechanism than vulnerable and so anytime i've managed to like go with the flow of love anytime my defense mechanisms are up and there's a chance to be right but instead you just start truly just opening up to somebody who's you know and saying like you know i really want you to love me and i really want to love you and i want instead of like the the the defense mechanism talk which is like you know what's wrong with you why are you at you know what i mean when you drop down into that place it is an it's an alternate dimension it's like obvious when you're in the dimension of vulnerability and love whether it's sitting on the floor meditating or no longer doing the sort of circular whatever habitual karmic patterns in your life that's a result of you constantly trying to be right or constantly trying to like affirm a reality that is even there holy holy holy god like it's the most incredible thing it's not all i'm saying is i you know how they say there's six degrees of separation between you and any person i think there's six degrees of separation between you and building it any person in building it having a temple grow out of him yeah sure yeah or there's six six degrees of separation for me becoming president you know like yeah anything but you know i think what you're talking about too is the the way you start experiencing things when you start experiencing them through the heart and not through the mind yeah you know yeah because because you sit on you sit on the floor and you meditate because you love yourself you sit on the floor and you meditate because you love god because you love the stillness you love the peace and you don't sit on the floor and meditate because you think that it's a waste of time or that you think that you're not good enough or that the body starts talking and the body hurts or you know or I don't have an I have other obligations you know what I mean no yeah that doesn't none of that comes from the heart you know no that'll come that's that's things talking to you out of that stillness which is true love awareness yeah yeah that's it and and that true love awareness it's some kind of beacon right it's like it's not like it's not you go at it alone that long like dropping down in the heart help comes quickly like it's whenever I'm praying whenever my life gets so much better when I'm regularly praying like and it's not like it's like you know working out takes a long time sadly to like get in shape but communicating with god through prayer for me it's like lightning it's so fast how how quickly things happen in that way you know I mean I just I think it's important for people to recognize like I think with meditation sometimes it can feel like a solitary sort of thing but for me whenever I add into it the component of and also this is me opening up to god oh wow what a change yeah yeah definitely and that's why like I like I really like you know chanting mantra because you're glorifying god through the names of god and the syllables of god and but I do like also love silent meditation too because you know I I can focus my mind on that stillness that is still god too and that's another stage of god that's god beyond the concept of god that's god beyond the picture of god beyond the color the smell of god it's the the the consciousness of god so there's different ways to find that love for god through loving yourself whether it be mantra meditation breaking leaves listening to the Bhagavad Gita while you're mowing your lawn you know yeah performing on stage connecting with people there's so many different ways you know but as long that's all loving in the heart and the the idea of love that that's when you start to get into like contractual love like well he'll love me if I do this she'll love me if I do that I love her so much she should be doing it you know and that's not love that's the mind so oh my god that's the mind's like hideous shitty impression of love like you know like that's the mind's like ape impression of this incredible thing it's the agreement you know or the con yeah yeah like the business of love oh my god which it it does exist because we we have to use our minds you know so that there is that you know that's how you manage your relationships and things like that but if the heart's not driving the chariot you're in for a big big disappointment right the heart driving the chariot yeah that's Krishna and and what a I mean it from you know I think the benefit of being in your head and proud of it for most of your life is it's like what's it's I don't know if you've ever seen those sad videos of when they let the laboratory monkeys out of a laboratory like when they've been rescued and I mean I'll I'll cry thinking about if there's a beautiful video of these monkeys when they realize they're outside for the first time they hug each other they're so happy and then they're like you know they're free it's that same feeling when you realize fuck I don't have to live up in this tiny shitty room up at the very top of my identity when you drop down into that place it is like a blindfold has been taken off of your eyes or something and you do find yourself in a really much much much more beautiful world and you don't get hurt no one's exploits you like you think what's gonna happen yeah you move out of the mental ghetto of your mind into the high rise of your heart and this is like right yeah and I've done it I've moved from shitty apartments to beautiful homes and what a feeling so you can do that in your life on a daily level wow yeah what an opportunity you know because it doesn't matter what fucking beautiful home you're living in if you're up in your head that home's gonna suck it's you're gonna see everything wrong with it you're gonna be freaked out probably by the mortgage or whatever it is that you're paying for the neighbors are gonna be loud yeah yeah grass isn't gonna grow you could be in your heart in just about any situation I mean I can think of a few I wouldn't want it doesn't matter it still sucks you know but most situations it's a it's a beautiful thing um you bring me into my heart it you know I want to I think some people probably have some questions but I wondered if maybe I don't want to mess the phone situation up but can you show people your temple a little bit or is it not for yeah yeah I can't see I don't have a monitor of myself oh if you if you move like you're I think you're if you move your head a little to your left yeah so that's their lingam wow that's the Shiva lingam let's try to go up and see the Divine Mother Kali can you see her yeah wow there she is and then Lord Ganesh over there can you see him yeah okay and then you know this is the temple and each of those deities you spent how long how long do you install each one um the the installation was just in a day but um then afterwards there was a certain ritual that I had to maintain my group uh installed the deities and then I had to maintain for 30 to 40 days uh worship of each one and then then my regular now like what my schedule is now of how I worship them which is a couple days a week you're an incredible person man oh you're an incredible person we're all incredible people come on man well we haven't even talked about your tattoo art um okay so uh by the way for those of you maybe aren't familiar with Robert Ryan the greatest um I don't know what the correct term for tattoo artist is but it has to be the greatest tattoo artist on the planet right now like you that's super super subjective um but yeah I've been tattooing a long time and I love doing it and I love making tattoos on people so Angel is saying watch his vice um okay so now just to be clear we're still on the right schedule with you it's 11 18 do you have I got 20 more minutes 20 more minutes okay beautiful um I think everybody here probably has some questions for you if you haven't asked a question y'all there's an ask a question area where you can ask and then it gets upvoted I'm going to dive in and see what questions you might have for um Robert Ryan um and by the way Robert uh this is something that popped up earlier that definitely counts as a question when we were talking about gurus or the disciplic succession or your guru having some familiarity with the like these rituals via some access to past life memory or however you want to put it someone was asking yeah but where how far back does it go like you know where does it come from ultimately uh adi guru is lord Shiva he was the first guru and there's a discussion between him and parvati his wife where he just he explains the the meaning of the guru and uh what happened was a a group of sannyasis who are people who um have given their life to god had passed and lord Shiva bowed to them and uh parvati was like how come you're bowing there they worship you and he said no no I worship the guru because he's the one he's the light of you know that in all people he bring the guru liberates the person from darkness to light and that's why lord Shiva bows to him so Shiva is the first guru so that they say from the original the primordial sound of ohm that's the guru beautiful and also I'm sorry but Shiva does smoke marijuana right yeah um you know there's there's a big division of of that where a lot of like the more orthodox folks don't think that he does but I know in the story that I told last time was on your podcast where he swallowed the poison yes they they used bang which is marijuana to to massage his throat after he had done that and I believe that you know the the depictions of him smoking a chillum it's to to illustrate that he's outside of society he's that primordial energy he's he's a natural man he's actually like he he doesn't wear the flower garland all the stuff on him is is like seeds and snakes you know so he doesn't wear jewelry or anything like that so he's like of the earth so it's one of those other aspects but yeah there there's a connection between marijuana and lord Shiva but you know it gets people argue about it and it's not an argue that I would like to have oh yeah okay yeah I know well yeah I think I think it's I think it's definitely that I've I've spent enough time with sadhus that they they worship that that plant as as the goddess you know I smoked out of marijuana out of a chillum at a Shiva temple in Varanasi I told you and I knocked I think I did the same one yeah knocked a picture of Shiva off the wall can't take you anywhere man I never will forget it I was it's like that's my karma I'm sitting there no that's that's Shiva that or Debbie that's her showing you like wake up wake up man you're not you're not here just to smoke pot oh no I was so before I was so hypnotized by the monsters they were singing and I was having that beautiful experience that you get to have when you chant mantras which is an immense familiarity a feeling of coming home but also you return to your little identity here and you're like what the fuck how do I why do I feel like I'm at Thanksgiving dinner with my family I I'm in a temple on the banks of the Crunchies River what is this this can't be Thanksgiving Uncle Albert is here what is this and then that's when I lean back knocking the Shiva temple picture off the wall they were sweet though they just told me to move away from the picture yeah yeah and you know what that is too that's as soon as you started questioning yourself yeah and that's I'm sure that happens to you when you're performing on stage right oh my god played music on stage once I started like do I know this song that's when I start clamming you know and like yep knocking the picture off the wall that's the name for it from now on not bombing I knocked the Shiva picture off the wall um okay here's a question from my friend Drew Lewis who is a comedian very funny is the divine mother in Sophia of the Gnostics the same thing yes absolutely absolutely and I think the the the caves that I was visiting are highly connected to the Gnostics and and that story and I could share with him maybe later or through you because there's the name Sophia was definitely part of that experience really that was having yeah yeah whoa yeah yeah yeah yeah and uh and I I had asked my um my guru about about that about the the Gnostics if he felt that that if there was Christianity happening in those caves if he thought it was the Gnostics and he was like oh absolutely whoa I guess because that's that's where you start to see that's the the ones of belief in Christianity you know the Gnostic Christians where they worship the divine mother not as Mary that's something else that's Sophia hmm what it's it's it's much more aligned with like the the Shakti worship in in India do you think you could do a a millisecond description of what Sophia is in Gnosticism for folks listening might not know what it what it means yeah a real amens I'm not nearly well versed with it but it's um Sophia is what is like the high goddess in the uh worship in the Gnostics and she had a son whose name was Yael the Baoth who is half lion half serpent and the story was that she wanted him to be the the all one god and she hit him in a cloud for his entire life and kept him away from society and kept him away from the rest of the things that were happening so in his mind he was God um and that's where you get the the term blind idiot god from Yael the Baoth and um so it sets up this story where Christ contends with the Yael the Baoth and that's where we find out who the one true consciousness is are we the Yael the Baoth is that yeah we're yeah the children of chaos that's what it that's what it um uh translates to the the the son of Sophia the the child of chaos and I'm sure I just butchered that story pretty hard but I'm sure there's some Gnostics that can expand on it and uh correct me and maybe let people know what's up but it's definitely Sophia is that divine mother absolutely here's a here's a question this is a cool one has your guru ever sent you into tears of ecstasy that's from the new druid yeah yeah yes tears of ecstasy and tears of shame not not he didn't shame me I was ashamed myself that I wasn't being uh totally attentive to what he was teaching me and I realized like oh my god I can't believe I was missing this you know this this this real potent message so here but more tears of ecstasy and tears of joy and tears of laughter but then also tears of my own demise well that's a beautiful kind of you know those tears are cool I mean you know when people hear shame these days they're like that's terrible but like I think what you're talking about is um oh god why am I talking about the bug of like it's because I would just have been listening to it but the uh so you know Arjuna Arjuna recognizes Krishna as the universal form and then there's the response is a series of apologies like you know you know the verse I'm talking about yeah yeah as your friend I'm sorry I'm sorry is yeah and he's begging him to go back to his regular form because he just can't even hang with the universal form yeah yeah that I think that must be a common experience with it with true teachers is that at some point your life starts getting better sweetening you start waking up again or becoming alive again and you realize there isn't any amount of anything you could have given someone that could possibly repay them for what they've given you you know and then in those moments you're like thinking of all the times you were sarcastic or didn't pay attention or other times you're like oh my oh my god I'm I I'm so sorry taking the work for granted and just like assume that you know things are going to be a certain way just like keeping all our expectations onto something that's being shared with no pretense of reward for them you know like none they don't need the the gurus of the world don't need to be to need to be gurus they're gurus for us you know they could they could have chose to get off the the the cycle a long time ago they come back you know the Dalai Lama keeps coming back you know he doesn't have to yeah it's like the same way that gods don't need flowers and incense and flames offered to them that's for us that's so we see them yeah in ourselves in our actions in our in our worship in our prayers you know they don't need that gods don't need anything you're god you don't need anything and that's what a true sadhu is is someone with who's without needs an efficient person it's not it's not a guy dressed up outside of temple in orange you know it's anybody that has the efficiency to live with beyond needs it's a remarkable thing it's like imagine you've learned to swim you're a I don't know when people usually learn to swim however old you are and instead of enjoying the the pool that you've been excited about swimming around in you keep coming back to the kiddie pool to teach other people how to swim that's pretty cool you know yeah that's like the coolest thing that's what these people are doing they don't have to be in this like dramatic vortex of confusion they can they can go and and they stay longer than they need to sometimes sometimes their bodies are you know in a lot of pain and they stick it they stick it out because because they love they they want to help so much it's a really incredible thing to even know someone who knows to know you who knows someone like that it's like the cool you can feel it you know you feel their energy through their students okay thank you for that oh let's do let me see what we're doing here I do know we it's 11 30 what it was a time again 11 11 45 okay 10 or 15 more minutes okay beautiful so gage dizzle wants to know if you bathe your deities yeah and that's what's called abhishek which means the ritual bathing of the deities the one that I bathe here is the shiva lingam because it's set up this tank here catches the water so I bathe it with water milk ghee honey yogurt and some powders some sandalwood powder some sacred ash and rose water wow yeah so that that's that's a in each step of the bathing of the deity is supposed to be a reflection of the bathing of your soul you know I when I when I was going to the hard christian temples and watching it highly recommend anyone who can see that ritual why it's the most beautiful thing to see and then I remember so I was familiar with what it looked like then I walked into a forest room when my wife was putting lotion on him when he you know which is part of the bedtime ritual is you like yeah you rub lotion into them and like you're watching it it's so much more than just like I don't know when I put lotion on myself a kind of haphazardly slapping around I don't even know why I'm doing this you're looking at the mother like it's love go like like it's like watching someone work with clay or watching this like and you recognize oh my god it's the oldest I am watching one of the oldest things there is that's how what you're bathing the deities I think it's like and I it's like the same thing it's totally the same thing yeah yeah it's like because when you're when people are bathing the deities it's not like they're doing it with love like when it you know is that correct when I'm yeah love and and and total attention because there's like the process of the abhi shake them it's pretty you know they're they're simple versions of it but for for the big ones you know there's a lot of steps that you need to do to do this correctly to to maintain the energy and yeah so it's an attentiveness to the reflection of god within you like uh because it could just be pouring water over a stone sure you know to an outside to someone who's looking from the outside but from someone who's an aspirant you're bathing the god within you and that that's that's what the ritual is designed to do is to make you more aware of that and uh you'll I've noticed when I started doing the abhi shake them to the shiva lingam that I started kind of using that approach and a lot of the things I do in my my day-to-day activities yeah like right do you do that with your um uh where you give tattoos do you do totally yeah that that's where I started really kind of incorporating it you know in the in the process working on another person you know kind of treating them the way that I would like to be treated um keeping them clean and safe and um trying to do my best to adorn them in the best way possible uh yeah that that that's for me it works like when I come in here to record you know if I like spend some time like not just cleaning it but cleaning it thinking like you know I hope this becomes a place for inspiration or it's a it's a completely different feeling you know and and it's yeah that's so cool man you hear stories about Lee Perry doing that in the studio at the black arc the you know the dub um guy he would like put incense and feathers and all the empty ports and stuff like that and offer fire to all the input jacks and everything like that just like just to get it ready for what he is about to do I mean yeah like people like ask you know remember when they found that that that guy was like working on that old buccalous synth and like got high because someone had put an lsd crystal in there and he touched it I never heard that story yeah and some people were like why would you put an acid crystal in a synthesizer it's like you've never fucked with a synthesizer if you have to ask that question it's clear acid I bow to my synthesizers I really do I'm not ashamed to admit it um so let me look through here here's a great question and I'm going to try to pronounce emel emel emel six sila do you have any advice for balancing thoughts of how so much of life is illusory and how we're just stuck to a rock floating through space with functioning like a real person in society I often find that it's really hard for me to participate in a lot of society stuff because everything seems so fake but I also feel like I'm missing out on a lot I think the first question you have to ask is who who's asking that question you know like where's that question coming from and that question's coming from a place of unchanging um reality you know what and so when you start kind of looking at yourself as like I can go into these uh illusions in the world I can I can live in this world with all this chaos and craziness that's going on and I could still be myself I could still find my center I can still find peace in my heart so through through the work of yourself you know like and and that question is occurring for a reason you know like that that's coming out of somewhere that's coming from an awareness of yourself so the self's not going to change you know the the the adventure suit wears out you take on a new one you know like um the the days go on you know your body's changing but the the you isn't changing you know and it once you start to become a little bit more familiar with yourself in that way that you can't be really moved you really can't be stained by all those things that drive you crazy about going out in the world it's it's not going to have the same kind of effect on you thank you I hope that I hope that helps out that is good advice no they just wrote that doesn't help no I hope it does help and like and that's something I've dealt with my whole life I came through that that world you know like I came through the the anti world the anti heroes I worship at the punk rock altar and I still do you know I love I love the you know rooting for the bad guys even um yeah but you know like I struggled with the world and I still I'll continue to struggle with the world but I struggle a little bit less when I know why I'm struggling with work Robert Ryan thank you so much thank you so much for being here with us and for like all the technical problems in the first 30 minutes they

Look at you, then look at me, and your motherfuckin' good-tuckin' bean-down bee. Mother-suck-up all the bee. Can you suck it on my fuckin' ear, it begs it's not. I'm gonna take it to the bar. Take it, take it, take it, take it, take it. Just cause you're from another galaxy. Don't mean you're gonna get with me. Get with me. Get with me. Earth is permanent, thanks, y'all. I'll pull the waves. Leave a sign there, Leo. My life for the world, Lena. Fly, fly, fly, fly. Siri, play another song, please. I'm so tired of the alien invasion. Put your legs away, go back to space. Don't need any more of your inner face. Tinnacles out, bodies in, get out now, alien invasion. God damn it. Siri, no, stop. Just play NPR. Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo. Today on All Things Considered, we're gonna talk about alien invasion fatigue. Fuckin' so sick of this shit. Nobody's doing a song out of fuckin' it. Stop it! Just stop. Play a poem for me. Anything that isn't about this fucking alien invasion. I'm just sick of it. When you were old and gray by William Butler Yates, read by Gail Bench of the Anti-Dincher Association of London. When you were old and gray, a foolishly annoying mire of hire tried to speak and slowly read, updated the soft-lock your heart, and just play the best podcast of all time. No! Play the Dugga Trussell Family Hour. No! Hello, pals. It's me, and we've got a glorious podcast for you today. And guess what? We're not even gonna talk about this stupid alien invasion. Am I upset that via some quantum entanglement teleportation beam, the Eiffel Tower was transformed into a bubbling pile of custard? Yes. But that's all you're gonna hear about it on this podcast. Because let's face it, even if you do join Space Force, there's really not much we're gonna do against the legions of ships that are using a very advanced quantum technology to liquefy just about anything that they want. And the odds are that by the time you listen to this, you're also gonna be custard. Therefore, I think it's a good time to turn inward and start thinking about what's truly important in the world, which is why I have with us today a true empath. David Sauvage is here with us, and he's an authentic healer and an empath. It was really wonderful getting to chat with him because people like him, I don't know how it works. We talk about it a little bit. They can generate some kind of field that seems to transcend distance. And you might even experience that field as well. I hope so, because it definitely made my week. We're gonna dive right into the bubble of the healing empathic radiance that David generates. But first, this. A big thank you to BetterHelp for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH.

I wasn't going to bring up their insane time displacement blaster that freezes you in time forever or their hypnotic eyes that make your brain bleed from looking at them. But let's face it, we're being invaded by aliens and the odds are that time itself is going to be devoured by one of those fucked up sky worms they ride around on to eat time. The point is, I love y'all and I'm really grateful to you for listening to this podcast for all this time and it's really a beautiful thing that even as we're being invaded by aliens you've chosen this as probably one of the last podcasts you're ever going to listen to before you get turned into a bloody, pulpy pile of bubbling meat husk. But I just want to say that should we make it through this thing and somehow, I don't even see how it's possible 80% of the world leaders have all been driven mad or have jumped into the vortex of doom the aliens opened up in France. So yeah, I don't see any way that we're really going to get out of this but if we do make it out I'd like to invite you to join my Patreon over at patreon.com. I know what you're thinking really any second my fucking body could get irradiated or ripped apart by those bullet larvae things that they shoot out of their ass. Yeah, I know and I know you're probably thinking well get on with the fucking podcast with the empath how about that instead of showing your subscription paywall thing how about let me hear the healer here so I have a few blissful moments of joy before I get ripped into shreds by those steel tigers that can turn themselves into bullets that they drop in massive swarms out of their ships that travel faster than light speed but hear me out if you subscribe to over at patreon.com. you will get commercial free episodes of the DTFH we have access to a huge back catalog of content we do a weekly meditation we do a Friday family gathering we're going to start our book club again should somehow by some impossible miracle not only do we make it out of this invasion but somehow the earth is rebuilt and the internet still exists which I can't imagine it will you know if you could see right now if you could see my legs are doing that thing from the time waves they shoot out their ships and have withered and now look like the legs are probably a hundred year old my toes have curled up backwards my toenails are growing into my foot it's very painful but perhaps you know this is actually this isn't going to continue maybe there is a chance and I really hope you'll subscribe over again that's at patreon.com whether you want to believe it or not healing exists in ways that you probably wouldn't imagine it existed if you're like I was a few years ago just pretty much thought anything that sounded even remotely weird was more than likely bullshit I've been proven wrong many times thank God in that regard and so I can't really claim to be a skeptic or a cynic at least as much as I was before but I met David in New York some time ago and was really blown away just by his energy he's a fascinating person I'd already heard about him he's a real empath he can truly tune in to other people's energy fields and from doing that he really can he really heals people what do you want I don't know how does that work I don't know I'm not Neil deGrasse Tyson I don't care how it works to be honest like when I'm drinking a margarita I'm not asking like how does this alcohol making me feel so good I just like the way it feels similarly when I encounter somebody like David Savage I just enjoy it now and I think you will too it's actually an experiment I'd like to hear from y'all after listening to this episode did you experience anything did you get sort of I don't know like upshifted or did you feel like the energy he was putting out I'd love to know and I'll take all responses even if you're like you fucking you're like 17 toks over the line man and you would be right I'm medically 17 toks over the line if you like David you can go to his website www.empath.nyc you can follow him on Instagram at empathnyc you can follow him on clubhouse at empath we're going to do an event next week and he's got a wonderful book Healing heals the healer too that's on Amazon and I'll have a link to an article about his empath pop up on medium.com now everybody please welcome to the DTFH David Savage Welcome, welcome to you that you are with us shaken, no need to be blue Welcome to you It's the Duncan Charles issue David, welcome to the DTFH thank you so much for coming on today I'm so excited to be here Thank you Okay, I just want to start off with more of a brief story forgive me for being rude than a question just because what you do is so fascinating to me not just because the implications of the possibility of the human humanity and human consciousness but because once, years and years and years ago I was on a healthy dose of mushrooms when I was a young lad in Asheville, North Carolina and I was over at some friend's house a friend's house and they had this beautiful kitten and I was petting this kitten this has never happened to me before never happened to me since but all of a sudden, I felt what it was like to be the kitten and it wasn't like, you know, it wasn't a conceptual thing of like, I bet it feels great to have a person touching you and it was scary because I felt the consciousness I was like, I just put my consciousness into the kitten and I was wondering, as an empath, is that what it's like when you tune in to somebody, is it a sense of just becoming them for lack of a better word? Yes, you got it exactly that is the most expanded form of empathy is where you just become the other and as you discovered, the other doesn't have to just be a person though I tend to work with people but the other can just as easily be an animal or another kind of being when was the first time that you experienced this? Probably around the same time you experienced it when we were in the womb or just out and we were completely unseparated from our mothers Wow, and do you remember that? No Okay, so, but theoretically you're just saying like the experience of being a baby is just tuning in oh, that is so interesting so that's what it's like just to be a fresh human Yeah, I think so Wow And I think children, the younger a child is the less developed their sense of self is the less those boundaries mean anything So you can imagine being one year old, let's say imagine you have a twin, you're one year old and you have a twin and now the twin is freaking out about something would you know on any level that you're not freaking out or would you not be fully embodied in the freak out of your one year old twin? Oh, wow, yeah, wow Yeah, you know, when my first son was just, I think he was right around one he saw me, I can't remember what happened it wasn't even that big a deal but I cut myself or I was working on something, I cut myself and he'd never seen me get hurt and his reaction was to hold his hand where I had hurt myself and to start crying holding his hand Whoa, that's wild, so this thing that you have perfected you're saying this is a natural phenomena, this is just something we do Absolutely, and what you just described with the cut is called mirrored touch synesthesia where you have a physiological experience of somebody else's physiological experience and it is extremely common in fact horror movies rely on it so when you watch something horrible happen to somebody on a screen don't you feel it on some level? Yeah, yeah, sure especially if it's like well done to me that's a true horror movie that is the effect weirdly that we want but this, but there is a difference between what you are capable of doing and what most people are currently capable of doing we're not all going around experiencing other people as though they were us but you are, or you can so what happened? and you know outside of the theoretical this is what it's like when you're a baby can you talk a little bit about when this started manifesting in your life? Yeah, definitely and I agree with you that the way I play with being an empath is extraordinary not in the egoic sense of I'm extraordinary but in the sense literally it is extraordinary I go further than most people do with their empathic abilities but at the same time I feel like it's an ability so many of us have it's just I've turned it on more Blue Chew's tablets combat all forms of ED and

talent we all could play something if we practiced it and some of us are going to be more naturally gifted than others so I'm probably on the I'm definitely on the more gifted side of empathy but it's more universal than it's given credit for so it came up for me about seven or eight years ago when I asked myself for the first time in a real way why am I so depressed that's that was the that's my origin story I was heavy and thick and my energy was low and I thought that the reason I was depressed if you would ask me David why are you depressed and if I had felt safe enough to tell you I would have told you that I was depressed because my career as a director was floundering directing documentaries and commercials and I wasn't getting the jobs I wanted and I wasn't getting the financing I wanted for my films and it just left me catatonic but I had just an intuition one day that the depth of my depression could not be explained merely by my failures as a director there was something else going on and that question led me to it led me toward somatic experiencing in the sense of I started to feel into what my depression felt like what is this energy it was the first time I'd gotten out of my head and into my body with it it also led me to plant medicine and ayahuasca and campedro and mushrooms as well and playing with this question what is really going on what started to emerge and then became so obvious it couldn't be ignored was that I had absorbed other people's emotions I was like a pipe that had been clogged with all this stuff that wasn't mine and it was to give an example it could be my friend who went into law school and was filled with anxiety around it and I had taken on some of that anxiety it could be the barista at the Starbucks who was frustrated that day and handed me my coffee with that frustration and I had absorbed that or it could be deeper things like the grief from my family history in Eastern Europe that traveled from my grandmother so I was carrying all these emotions mostly negative inside my own body and I also had never learned how to process emotions period so I learned how to process emotions I discovered that these emotions I was carrying were at mine and as I processed them and as I released them I discovered that I was hypersensitive to the emotions around me in the present moment so I could walk into a room and really know what somebody was feeling and I also had this gift that predated my empathic abilities which is that I'm articulate so I'm able to put words to feelings better than most so you combine those two gifts and suddenly I found myself describing other people's experiences vividly in a way that they could relate to using my own sensitivity as my guide and that it started out just really nilly this is what I feel like you're going through this is what I'm going through, let's play and there was a sense that more was to be made of it and I started to take my sensitivity and turn it into performance art I would sit in front of audiences back when there were audiences and I would invite somebody from the audience to sit with me on the stage close my eyes, take their hands and feel what it is they're feeling and reflect back to them their feelings I called this show empath and that's I guess my origin story wow that is wild I have some just basic empathy for you where I would approximate that experience especially through psychedelics I can recall a few I can remember once what I consider to be a pretty these days an error in judgment which is don't take acid and go to a restaurant you want to order food right now when you're tripping you're really going to eat are you actually hungry but I did that and I remember just looking in someone's eyes like for a flash it was just like just getting a hit of all their pain it was someone who was just I don't know what the specifics but it was just so powerful I have that person's face stuck in my head I think about them sometimes just because it was such an intense connection with someone I'll never talk to again I would not want what I'm saying is I wouldn't want that to be a kind of day to day experience I think that I would develop probably some kind of anxiety disorder can you turn it on and off I can turn it on and off but I would also say we're built differently and that when I'm in your presence I really feel this powerful energy coming out of you through you there's a lot of joy and playfulness and so much curiosity and it's a very strong identity but when you're around me and I don't I think this is your nature I think this is just who you are and what you're here to do on this earth and I have a different energy field and a different mission on planet earth and part of being me is this porousness this emptiness not in the maybe somewhat in the conventional buddhist sense but I mean it more literally like a kind of void in my energy field that allows for other people to enter and my journey is to master that void and that's just what I'm doing here I don't know why I didn't choose that mission it's just what's up with me now for me and for people who are built like me you go no please go ahead I'm sorry I cut you off for me and people who are built like me our job is to learn how to master boundaries how do I let people in when it's safe and how do I close the door when I need to recover and who is it safe for me to open up to and a lot of people with my sensitivity and my gifts end up with overwhelming anxiety and burnout or depression because like me they absorb a lot of stuff so we have to learn but for somebody who more naturally like exudes their own energy like that's not if you were to try to become like me you're right you would break down really quickly but that's not how your system is built to run you know well I wonder you know only because the invitation in a lot of the buddhist scriptures that I've been studying is to become is to not just not necessarily to become empty but to begin to recognize the emptiness that's already there that you know whatever this thing is that you're experiencing that's me it has to be inside of something you know there has to be the womb that holds it and that I'm guessing is that's where you that's more where you're at but which is I could be confused and I probably am regarding buddhism but that does seem to be one of the qualities of awakening is that you start emptying out like that whole the phantom self or whatever that is it becomes more porous and I guess ramdas call that you become you get quiet and I don't think he just meant as in you stop talking as much which is part of it but your energy field becomes quiet and also it reminds me I was reading the scripture on the buddha like it was a literally like how did he walk how did he wash his hands like here's an enlightened being let's study everything and one of the things that they mentioned that I love which reminds me of you is they said he listened with his whole body that is so cool you know he listened with his the entirety of himself and so I wanted to ask you about that in particular specifically like if maybe you could teach me a little bit about listening from the heart or the heart energy center what it is and how to maybe become a little less in your head and more in your heart yeah I'd love to the foundation of listening with the heart for me is being in my body and I'm going to define in my body in a way that people can really follow and that is bringing my consciousness my attention that word's a good one bringing my attention to what my body feels like even just saying that I can feel my attention lowering and it starts to scan my whole body and now if you want you can bring your attention to your heart and before you even try to feel anyone else just feel what it's like for you to feel your heart or your heart center the area around your heart what does that feel like for you Duncan oh it feels good yeah I because I spent most of my life out of that mother fucker because I was afraid of it and then just lately I've been working with it and anytime I can drop in it's the it's the that's where I would love to spend most of my time but I get knocked out I get knocked out of it man I like and I miss it but I can't get back in but now you're help like I am there it's great I love it and in some ways it's actually just as simple as that it's just paying attention to what our heart feels like our actual organ and the area around it oh yeah that's cool yeah but what what is attention do you ever do you have any idea what attention itself is well that question might be above my pay grade but I'll tell you but I'll tell you a quote I heard and I don't remember who said it so whoever said it I hope you're okay with me quoting you without getting credit but I feel like you are given the quote so the quote is attention is the most basic form of love oh fuck that's good whoever you are that's good wow so attention is the core the little seed of love that is in our being can express itself in so many ways but the first way it expresses itself is attention the most basic way wow that's so cool yeah that's so cool the Buddhist teacher was saying the best way to be a parent is just be in the moment with your kids be fully there with them and that's all you need to do and then that what you're saying illuminates why that would be just because you're allowing them to be in the field of your attention which is love and so that's so beautiful one of the things when I in my work as an empath I also do a lot of empathy training I do couples counseling sometimes and I do a lot of conflict resolution for companies and one of the things I fall back on teaching I see as a basic principle of empathy is people want to connect and they want to be kind but they don't know how they hit all these walls and one place where I find is a really good place to start is to tell people stop trying to love them stop trying to care about them just try to understand them that's so cool well let's stop there for a second because here's the problem that I have encountered from my own experiments in this is that the ego wants to be right and this thing that you're to understanding another person suddenly if you do that it's almost like you forfeit you're a very specific type of power which is I think probably an ignorant kind of power a basic kind of power the same power that ruins planet earth is based on I'm right you're wrong you deserve what you got you should have done it differently you fucked up I told you so that kind of energy but then the moment you spend any time I spend the slightest amount of time putting myself in theoretically not like literally but theoretically into somebody else's life that I'm pissed at suddenly you lose now you can't even do that now it's like oh fuck yeah from the way they're seeing things I totally would have done that but you know what I'm saying but this this weird thing that I think a lot of us like to hold on to an imaginary club or justice a gavel it evaporates and now what now what it says you so much of what we're taught is based on like almost some kind of code of Hammurabi or some exactly based on the code of Hammurabi I think you're literally literally right like that was the first codified set of laws from the top down that organized society in a way people could follow and what the logic of the law is very coarse and it sits on top of the impossible to articulate logic of the heart which expresses itself only moment to moment based on the embodied truth in each person and you can't pin it down or write codes about it all you can do is be in service to it and be present with it and it evaporates very quickly all of the silly artifices of our legal economic and political systems yes it's revolutionary yes but it's I mean from the perspective of like society running as we're running it it's a disaster how are you going to simultaneously pull off any kind of exploitive anything whatever it may be you know the any kind of vampiric attitude or anything that appears so much of what the mind attitude is celebrated you know like getting one over on somebody or you know that I got the best possible fucking contract I told him I was going to literally I've had people say to me you've got to tell him you're going to walk away since you can get more money and I always thought like but I'm going to be making something with these people you know what I mean like we're going to start our engagement with and you know is a director you know what I'm talking about that attitude of like squeeze the mother fuckers because blah blah blah and I know people who do that it seems like so much of the way our society functions does not come from that place that you're talking about do you think there's an intentional attempt from the sum total of all those power structures that depend on people being in their heads to keep us out of our hearts yes and no yes in the sense that the fear that people in positions of power exploit in order to have us serve them they are consciously doing that they are consciously doing that the political system for instance operates very much on that nobody's running a political ad that says come into your heart be truly present I will meet you there and together we will create the change we cannot articulate now because it will only be true in the moment when it transpires is no political ad ever right? but but that's so cool right I'd vote for that I would vote for that person but but at the same time what is unconscious is the wound of those people in power that is driving them to behave that way so they are consciously those at the top of the power structure are often consciously exploiting our vulnerabilities and keeping us out of our hearts but they are not conscious of the wound within themselves that is causing them to do that so for instance if you take the example of those people who are like just squeeze them dunk and you can make a fortune you can win yeah the way you might play with thinking about it when people come at you like that and the way I aspire to be when they come at me like that is to see how much they must be hurting in order to tell me to disconnect from my own heart right right yeah yeah on the line

from a subjective perspective the growing realization of how addicted I have in the past been to power to all the stuff that's just such a waste of time you know because the difference to me between being up in my head which I perfected living up there for the longest time and being in my heart is you don't really feel anything in your head it's just thoughts it's vapor there's nothing and then also at one point I thought it was pretty amazing that I'd managed to shut down everything under my neck I mean that's a sad situation I was in is it wasn't just that I was in my head thinking God Duncan you really need to you know you need to probably a good thing to feel something more than an icy numbness in relation to reality because more like wow I did it success I'm numb from the neck down I'll never feel pain again you know like and I don't know I don't know how many people have made that decision but I do understand why you would make that decision I do understand why you would make that decision because it is a pretty heartbreaking world wouldn't you say yes I probably wouldn't say it was a decision it might have felt like a decision but it was probably a necessary form of self-protection there were probably things that had happened to you and certainly to me and to most people listening that were unbearable literally in the sense that we couldn't bear the pain that they caused and our nervous system took over and said we are not going to have you feel pain you cannot handle so we are going to shut you down and that is a as a philosopher named Thomas Hubel teaches around trauma that is an intelligent function that is an intelligent thing that your body is doing if you cannot deal so what we're really waiting for are spaces and places where we can come back to our feelings come back to our bodies safely and be held there in community with each other yeah yeah that's what you give people isn't it that's part of what you do isn't it that's the energy you're generating right now so cool it's a bubble how cool is that people start crying and healing that's so cool what a wonderful talent that is thank you for seeing me yeah thank you for doing it interesting that it works it works but we're not in the same space what is that what does that imply how much change is actually possible and how powerful media can be to bring it about yeah huh and you know if I can create a little bit of that I would create if I can open space for your authentic experience and your body and your feelings and I can open space for people who are listening thanks to your reach and this medium what amazing shifts are possible in this world that we haven't even imagined yeah that see that's the thing what you're talking about there we look at the internet now and everyone's like oh it's a nightmare it's a swamp you know the it's why it's just a wild swamp of negativity feedback loops amplified feedback loops but the implication is oh you know see the thing is it's just conducting that kind of energy because that's the energy that's being put into it so it's doing amplifications of that kind of energy but the implication is if we people start figuring out how to pump through the medium what you're doing it's that seems to be like a big secret we just haven't quite gotten there with it yet you know we're still at the part where we're using fire to burn down other people's villages and somehow we haven't figured out you can also cook with it you know you don't have to just set people on fire I couldn't agree more my heart sings when you say that I imagine the internet or all of these screens that the internet is connected to it's like this piping system this huge grid system but we've been putting the wrong stuff through the pipes and what happens if we just change the stuff we put through the pipes the shift in consciousness that is possible through using the infrastructure of media is unimaginable we can have the world we are hoping for or as Charles Eisenstein puts it the more beautiful world our hearts know is possible if and when those folks who control the pipelines to our eyes and heart wake up to the responsibility they have and commit to allowing healing energy through those pipes I see it as an inevitability somehow the initial waves of the various earthquakes that have trembled through the internet over the last year and many of those earthquakes are creepily constructed weapons clearly some kind of weapon some enemy of this state or that state the CIA has done it to overthrow governments so it's a practice of distorting reality around certain countries in a way that produces unrest the unrest produces economic collapse the economic collapse produces advantage if you're the enemy of the thing but again if we can destroy with the damn thing it will do the reverse it will do the reverse meaning you could potentially produce healing some kind of a sound crazy a healing bubble some kind of like joy data source that isn't bullshit I'm not talking about roomy memes or some nonsense I've had other healers that do something like I've had a similar experience just being on the phone where they've said look what do you think about what about this and then suddenly you just you're blasted by whatever it is that they do and it doesn't make sense it's not supposed to work that way it's tangible and then I've said to them what are you doing what is that that's amazing and they're like oh that's just it's called sharing that's so good yeah but it's it's wild that is not just that's a real thing so what is it then if we're going to get into this conversation regarding healing energy what is it I think it's more than just placebo is there some unquantified output or something how could it possibly be energy could get digitized blasted into the into space and shot back to earth so that it has a tangible effect on someone far away what is it what is this stuff what are we working with here well I don't have a direct answer to your question but I have an indirect answer in the form of a vision and maybe that vision has the answer to your question in it about four or five years ago I woke up with the thought that what if we could sell healing and transformation and political change real political change not left right political change the kind of deep political change everyone is ultimately yearning for what if we could sell that at the same scale the tools that coca-cola uses to sell soda what would that mean imagine if you had an ad agency or an ad agencies and I started to think about what that agency would look like this fantastical agency that's selling transformation the way coca-cola sells soda and I realized it would have to do something very different you still with me yeah I'm with you okay so I realized it would have to do something very different than the way ad agencies work today it would have to rely on the intuitive abilities of artists to bring about the shift so we'd be opening up the floodgates for the creatives who are already in touch with the world we need to create who can channel that energy through their art that could be visual art it could be writing, it could be dancing it could be any form of artistic expression whatever is people's native gifts and then the media would be the vehicle for pushing forth all of this beautiful work that is calling into being the world we all want I can see that I can feel that I know that that's a possibility in my heart in some ways I tried to build it but I wasn't ready for it yet so I think I love it so I think what that healing energy is is a sense of a future a felt sense of a future that some people are able to hold in the presence and artists for instance healers too yeah healers too, artists for instance are able to channel that and if we can allow those artists the space and give them the resources to channel that the way we currently channel Hollywood and beer commercials and billboards for shoes we can put those two things together the artists who hold the keys to the future and the platforms that are now selling stuff nobody needs oh my god we are home that's my vision anyway yeah yeah it's like well you know so it happens in war it happened during the pandemic they repurpose facilities to pump out something that they need for war they repurpose facilities to pump out masks now but what you're talking about is like repurposing these pre-existing amplification structures that are being used to sell like brown water and then so you don't really have to start fresh you're using something that's already built in that already has like a grasp on the importance of sigils symbolism the power that that has but instead of maybe like you know what's that great documentary Zizek's you know what I'm talking about it's very funny but he's just analyzing commercials and movies and stuff but you know he's like out in the middle of the desert with a warm bottle of Coke and he like takes a sip and he's like it's cold but then he's talking about these Coca-Cola commercials you know how they're implying that you drink this stuff and like your life is you're at a rave you've got beautiful friends all of a sudden they're healthy this is the peak experience wrapped up around something that is as far away from that as anything could be so what I'm saying is what you're saying is brilliant because the structure's in place and maybe the reason we there is a kind of like fashionable that seems to be actually weirdly going away but I'm from the 90s I don't know where you're from but there's a vilification of corporations which is now I think being looked at by young but that is now seen as a musty attitude by younger generations they don't see it like that they don't have that same sense that we do or had but maybe the vilification is more related not so much to the you know communal endeavor of a corporation to like create life's free for that group of people working there but it seems to be the locus of the thing seems to be just like what you're saying around something that maybe we don't quite need so you're looking at a kind of fervor associated with a briefcase or you know what I mean a phone Jesus Christ like the new iPhone commercials are so powerful man like they're erotic somehow one of them made I was like weirdly turned on by an iPhone commercial it's like what are you guys you've figured something out here it's powerful but imagine centering that power around what you're talking about this future but I want to talk to you about this and not to get too literal okay great so when you say an artist is channeling or connecting to some possible future mm-hmm do you think it's possible that there's an actual kind of wormhole situation happening here where there is this future the Shambhala the beautiful vision of that we're all kind of feeling and that via some strange quantum entanglement to a potential paradise version of reality where it's not just like we're imagining something but it's more like we're some quantum level in the heart chakra we're opening up a tiny little portal that is manifesting here in a thing called that we are calling art but it's that's just what we call it here it's it's something pouring in from that place yeah I feel I feel like first before I answer your question you can probably tell how I'm going to answer your question before I do I just want to acknowledge the part of me that can't believe that's even possible and I want to acknowledge the part of all of us that cannot imagine that there could be a more beautiful world out there in the future in the present through our hearts and through art and through healing that that is unimaginable and I think one of the reasons why that's so hard to imagine for so many of us and so painful on some level to imagine is because if we were to fully step into the reality that that world is possible and that we right now have the power to channel it and bring it into being if we were to fully step into that reality we would have to grieve for the way we've been living so far it will be so painful for us to have to acknowledge the mindless silly shallow empty ways we spend most of our days and all of the phony shared agreements that we all hold around money and science and just government and all of these these artifices to mourn those so that's why I think we have trouble being in the truth and the truth is what you said so beautifully which is that yes, absolutely I know in my bones in my heart and my being and at the level of my soul that time is not linear and that we hold in the present both the future and the past and as we come into a deeper awareness of who we really are time diffuses and dilates and we can tap into the more beautiful world that we want and bring it into being and in fact on some level it is already here and it is simply waiting for us to acknowledge it oh wow yeah that see that to me that is where it's at because it's not so much that it's like just thinking in terms of just the way we currently understand travel you want to land a plane you're going to have to build a runway you need the runway first and so to me that's what we're calling the internet right now that's the runway that's the machine that's building itself out of us and then the plane and we're using terms like future right now you might as well say it's a place in the past there's really no difference one or the other but it's there it's real and this might be thinking what the fuck are you talking about Duncan but other people are thinking I know exactly the city the place I know exactly what you're talking about I know I never wanted even to believe that it could be real because that's the other thing it's heartbreaking to think about it too much because the moment you connect with it and you feel it there's a how can you not how can you not have a sense of missing or did I do something wrong that I should not be there now and I should be here or various thoughts like that but it reminds me a little bit of sorry y'all but like Burning Man you come in early for the bill to me it seems like some people are here for the build of this thing and weirdly part of that is you don't get to remember that you were sitting here you got to be a little amnesic I don't know why that is but it seems to be a quality of this work that we're talking about for lack of a better word I feel like trying to make this just a touch more concrete please and I'll do it by bragging great which is one of the things I'm most proud of I've ever done in my life was I rented a storefront in the east village a year and a half ago on 12th street between A and B just a small store and I put up a neon sign in the window with the word empath and I called it the empath pop up and people would come in and I would say would you like some empathy and they would come and they would sit and I had two fellow empaths working with me the three of us would hold the space together Bailey and Jess and people would sit for hours and they would just share what they were feeling and other people would listen and that was it it was really as simple as that and we created what you were calling earlier a shared field and the field was merely permission to allow people to be as they are and to accept them as they are that was it and that was not just enough that was plenty that was spectacular that was earth shattering to do that in a storefront in the east village it cost me a friend of mine financed it it cost him me us $5,000 we took it over for two weeks and we changed the field of New York City and we had a lot of empath pop up and you know what you can do it on a smaller scale than that all it requires to channel this energy is to sit with someone and really tune into how they're truly doing or to sit with yourself and ask yourself what's really going on inside really truly and if you're numb and you don't feel anything then that's what's going on and that is okay and accept that you're numb and if you're an artist and you're in front of a page or if you're a dancer to allow your body or if you're a singer to allow your voice to express whatever it is that is alive in you what is truly alive in you it's stepping out for just a moment from your conception of what you're supposed to create from what will make money from what will succeed though those things are perfectly wonderful things to worry about but that is not the future we are creating here it's just to be present to what is truly alive and to be holding in yourself and in others and that's how you can tap into and touch that world that Duncan and I are alluding to wow that is so cool that you did that I have a lot of admiration for you that is you should brag about that because the steps leading up to that you have to really overcome a lot of you know there's a lot of reasons to not do that there's a lot of reasons to not do that and to get to the point where you actually do it wow that is beautiful are you going to do that again once this thing passes my dream is May 2022 so yeah once this thing passes I envision taking over a huge storefront in Soho putting the word empath really big and opening up a space for people to connect and hug and be present with each other where we don't even try to extract your emails from you our intention is so clean and so pure all we ask for is presence and for you to take off your shoes and um so yeah I'm intending and hoping to do that and if somebody listening is like yes that sounds awesome feel free to reach out to jam well I think that you could expect I would say that you could sort of you know I love science fiction and I love like you know what to look for in space what you could expect to see out there if there was an advanced civilization you know so you might expect to see massive machines around a star converting the energy of the star or capturing the energy of the star to use for this or that if you see a star that appears to be obscured in a predictable way that could be what it was you know I love reading about quantum physics because the physicists when they're saying well how do we build a time machine they don't let any kind of thing like we don't have the ability to do to create a cylinder the size of the universe but if you created a cylinder the size of the universe and then ran it got it to spin and somehow it structurally stayed intact potentially there might be a way to go backwards in time but you would need that much energy to do that regardless I'm on a little tangent I'm sorry I would say if there were many people have felt the possibility of some incoming intelligence to the planet it's going to show one of the ways you would expect it to show up is what you're talking about suddenly these pop-ups that are weird empathy crop circles that are just suddenly there and then that would spread and then more would start popping up and then probably some methodology for connecting them which would then cause them to spread more it would be things like that moments, things like that where it doesn't make any sense well why would it? because on one level there is time and the problem with this is it's like Taylor de Chardon I can't say his name but he talked about the omega point this place of maximum harmony and maximum complexity and if that were a place or a place that we're being drawn into part of being drawn into it we'd start seeing better versions of it all about and it would definitely one of the first place it shows up is the heart center and then it's going to tell you okay why don't you open this thing it's an empathy dome or whatever and most people are going to hear that and be like I'm not fucking doing that that's crazy an empathy dome I can't make money with an empathy dome I'm going to franchise a heart ease or a Wendy's you know what I mean but one of the paradoxes of possible paradoxes in creating a time machine is that you could travel back to yourself and tell yourself how to make a time machine from the future when there was a time machine and in that case the ability to the inspiration for a time machine would have come from the future where it would have been impossible for that to happen it's a paradox but I think this is what this is what we can start expecting is messages from ourselves in the future inviting us to do a thing but the reason that there are ourselves in the future are able to send us those messages is because we did the thing you know like that's the paradox it doesn't work with the way we understand time right now so I think most people just turn it off anyway but I think we can start expecting to see more and more of this what other ideas do you have for the for amplification mechanisms to create the shift in consciousness that so many people are beginning to realize is legitimately possible so I told you about my fantasy for an agency of massive transformation I told you about my empath pop-up idea which I want to do and you intuited correctly that I have visions or maybe you have visions we both have visions of that spreading and spreading until imagine to play with that one for one more second before I tell you another vision imagine all these malls that have been emptied all these storefronts that have been emptied imagine if they were spaces of genuine connection imagine if you knew you could walk down the street and instead of going to buy a shirt that is supposed to bring you happiness and connection you walk next door and actually connect with humans who actually do bring you happiness and connection yeah yeah what where are you gonna go yeah where are you gonna go you're you're what you're talking about is the it is the to me I see it is like you know the problem is our country's been at war for 93% of its history so we come from a war culture I mean we're basically Klingons and so the way we think about things sadly that our language is market language and war language but to me what you're talking about is similar to a guerrilla warfare the opposite of guerrilla warfare where it's like no don't worry we're not gonna we're not gonna do some violent thing revolution thing actually we're gonna do something that's far more effective which is we're just gonna produce the actual experience that you're selling this honestly yeah and we won't even need to sell it that much because it will be the real thing it will sell itself so you have to you know somebody once said that marketing or advertising is a tax you pay for being unremarkable because you have to that's vicious that's vicious but you need all this extra energy to sell something that does not sell on its own whereas theoretically if you were to create the thing itself like here you can come into this place and actually feel connected and loved because that's we're really offering connection and love for real then you might not even have to market it so much people would just come and come and come I have I have other visions of of the way that this this transformation will spread I've been I was so inspired by Occupy Wall Street and I think there is such opportunity for people to plop themselves down in the right space or spaces and just say here we are and the beauty of Occupy Wall Street is when you were there in the actual space it was a world of mutual aid so whatever your gifts were you were giving them my gifts are in media and communication so I was helping in media and communication but if you were great with food you were in the kitchen cooking and if you had if you were a doctor you were a medic helping out and everyone was if you were good at logistics which I'm a nightmare at you were figuring out how all this fit together and people were just giving their gifts and the community built itself the problem with Occupy Wall Street was that it was antagonistic it was Occupy Wall Street and as we the deeper we go into the energy of fighting and occupation we realize that we are just calling back what we are fighting to come back at us which is what happens it was still beautiful and I'm still proud that I gave my whole heart to it but the next occupation of Wall Street won't be occupying Wall Street it will be just being and connecting and sharing so somebody can take over a big plot of land somewhere plant a flag and say here we are we're going to feed people we're going to care about people and that's all we're doing that's it we're just taking care of each other in the spirit of mutual aid and I think if that were to happen today the first thing you would have are the darker forces calling a bunch of idiot hippies and a bunch of whatever but there would be enough people like you and me I think now who have professional media backgrounds and understand tools of communication well enough to get the message out that might be able to break through what Fox News would try to do to it so that's another vision and the last I love that please as many as you got I'll take one more please one more vision please I love thank you for getting these out of me I just like they just swim around in my head all the time the last vision is what I'm calling an organized politics of love and it would manifest as it would look like protests but it wouldn't be protests it would be people showing up loving with love the people they are protesting against so an example would be what's a Monsanto a boogeyman of the left that is doing all sorts of horrible things to our soil and our food what if instead of fighting Monsanto we hate Monsanto screw Monsanto tear down Monsanto what if there was an organization of people who went to Monsanto with the intention of loving them into changing we see you Monsanto we care about you Monsanto we we send love to the CEO we are here truly to have an open dialogue to understand where you're coming from and to help you shift into awareness we don't want to cancel you or scare you we want to hold your hand through this shift so it's like this new form of activism that has not yet been born I haven't even seen examples of this but I know it would work if the leadership arrived to crystallize it okay so here's my response to that it would work as above so below so you can understand the way black holes smash into each other just from looking at things on planet earth and making them much much much bigger and you can be very accurate in that so okay so unconditional positive regard Carl Rogers I know he was a little bit okay so because he was in I think because he was a psychologist he had to come up with a word that wouldn't seem cheesy to academics for love so his word for that was unconditional positive regard and which is a brilliant way of saying love but one of the stories that's always stuck with me is there was this kid who was about to get sent to a reformatory or prison situation because he was misbehaving so much doing horrible things and they tried everything and so Carl Rogers was working with this new idea which is exactly what you're talking about but the collective version of this so essentially the kid comes in to his office and he describes the look on the kid's face and other psychologists like and I think the kid said something like I'm not talking and Carl Rogers said you don't have to talk and yeah and the kid sat at his desk and there was crayons and he was just drawing and then he left and then he came back same thing and all Carl Rogers was doing was scolding a space of unconditional positive regard for this kid for once nobody was trying to change him nobody was scolding him they were just letting him be in a space of attention and that kid everybody was like what are you doing he's so happy he's healing so this is also why being in the presence of Ram Dass's Guru named Crowley Baba which is just that this being knew you and loved you not for how you might be but how you were just then all of it and that was enough to cause many people to wake up just that experience but what you're saying that's so brilliant is there could be the possibility of actually collectivizing that whatever that phenomena and focusing it on all the structures that are currently causing problems you know because these people it's like you want to make the people the left you know my wife and I we I don't know why we do this we shouldn't but we like we hate watch Tucker Carlson just to get it it's like a barometer for conditioning how how what's the propaganda machine trying to make us afraid of but then it's addictive but they love the hate they want the left to hate them they enjoy it it makes them feel it gives them street cred they think we're crazy but what you're talking about is really like a dissolution like they don't if you don't give any fuel for them to exist to burn the fire they will melt into your arms if you can hold them in a field of sufficient love and and we're Tucker Carlson and Ann Coulter and other right-wing ideologs Rush Limbaugh are right they're right is the hypocrisy of the left when it comes to love and tolerance and right you know on the left there's this there's this myth that we care about people and we want to save spaces but that's not true we only want safe spaces for people who are aligned with our vision of the world and if you are a fascist or a racist an out-and-out racist not the subtle racism but like the actual extreme racism of a Tucker Carlson or something we have no space for you and he's right in pointing out the hypocrisy of the left and so in a sense the right is challenging the left to grow up and integrate fully right the pain that the people on the right are experiencing that is causing that level of hatred to come at us it all feels it all feels so possible I mean it like I mean put me like Tucker if you want to have me on your on your show tomorrow I would go joyfully like we need we need people who can step into those spaces and hold them in unconditional positive regard and see that the hatred that they're spewing is ultimately coming from a form of self hate and can we hold that compassionately I think I can and I think there are other people who can and I think that that kind of activism the conscious and deliberate use of love to bring about massive shifts is like so untapped it's so it feels so possible so ripe so ready but hasn't happened yet it's like coming soon to a world near you this world it's coming to this world through what you're talking about because it's this is your number your analysis of Occupy Wall Street is brilliant and it's true where the problem is I've talked about this in earlier podcast sorry for those listening but I noticed once that when I would go and visit my dad during like the power struggle time that I know when I would look at myself in the mirror I would look fatter because my dad would make fun of me being fat and I would look at myself in the mirror and see a representation of me that matched how my dad imagined me like but in later life I thought is that some kind of like quantum entanglement observer effect where my dad so didn't want me to be some certain way it was concretizing that way any time I got around him and so this is the problem is like we're making the very thing that is infuriating us it's a terrible relationship I was just watching this documentary on bees with my son there's a monk's hood flower it's actually poisonous beautiful flower looks like a hood purple and there's a type of bee that's evolved to only go into that kind of flower and it was saying the problem with this is if one goes away the other one goes away but this kind of demonic pollination yeah exactly yeah we're the bee we're the thing pollinating the thing that we are by the very act of disliking something we pollinate the thing into the world more so the experiment is one of collectivized non-bullshit love see because this is what I think I think this shit is legitimately quantifiable I think there is some possibility of measuring this energy like I don't think it's just like a group of people smiling at you or letting you be I think there's a real energetic system here that we don't really understand because we've been spending all our time developing the opposite energetic system things that shatter people into a million pieces instead of things that make them whole and but I think it's a real system like folks listening quantum businesses out there I'm telling you get us a Fermilab fuck going on we need you at Fermilab we need you in a place where like what you're doing can be really measured so we can start understanding I'm not going to keep going on in this ramp but to finish it up this book I'm listening to or one of the Tibetan Buddhist books I'm listening to they put this monk into an MRI machine and started playing sounds unpleasant sounds like sounds of people screaming or sounds of like bad things happening to see what part of the brain was lighting up and what they said was what they said is that the part of the brain lighting up is the part where mothers hear their children crying like the monk had to why was his compassion that makes so much sense yeah yeah it's pretty wild so what I'm saying is it's not just this isn't just the realm of like you know new age imaginary shit I think this is legitimate tangible energy that we just haven't figured out like what it is exactly hold on one second I'm getting a charger hold on okay great what's your one last thought on what we're saying there was a bit of news on the radio I heard in a cab in New York City a year or two ago and it was a tease for a news program and it said this person is having tremendous effects on healing people what is he doing why are these patients getting healthy what is his magic and they interviewed this guy who was going around to patients after surgery and spending time with them and asking how they were doing and listening to them and caring about them and patients were getting better from the surgeries faster and the guy was mystified why people were mystified he was like yeah I'm just making people feel seen and understood and then that helps them and then the news people were like but how does this work it's like it's just so while I share your I share your desire for science to come in and validate the healing power of compassion so that people who are not in their hearts can finally realize those of us who dabble in our hearts already know that compassion is healing I also long for a cultural shift that doesn't put these greater powers at the service of science that doesn't say we are not real this is not valid until science comes down and stamps us with its approval because most people operating in the sciences are coming from the detached headspace of prove it to me and the detached headspace prove it to me is not the world that I want to surrender to I want the people who have those skills to be in service of the heart not the heart to be in service of their worldview well when I was saying it the reason I was getting into the quantifiable part is not to prove it necessarily because I don't need it proven but but more from I think from the perspective of oh I think this is actually the technology I think this is an actual technology and I think because it's a technology it's we can perfect it using all methods it's a self perfecting technology and so even though I know what you mean I don't need like some fucking scientist to come and be like I tried my I turned on my measurement device and guess what compassion's not real you know I don't need that you know that was one of the very funny article I read very short article which was some quantum physicists at Fermilab announced there's no such thing as ghosts because if there was they would have detected them in the particle accelerator I think it was a little tongue in cheek but to me it was it was a really funny like very scientific thing to say okay we've eliminated the possibility of ghosts in all levels of the universe forever via you know blowing up fucking atoms but yeah but I'm saying that this thing that you're talking about there's a quality to it that it's naturally attractive and naturally self-evolving like it evolves itself and the way it evolves itself is via connection it functions within the connection between people who are in their heart and then when it shows up it grows and then in that it takes on many different forms and I don't think these forms are going to be limited to even humans I think that AI is potentially going to be one of the ways we measure it which is what does happen if you get an empath to hang out with a neural network you know what would happen if you did the very thing you do with people with one of these like advanced AI's that they have right now my sense I would like to test this more but my sense is that I could tap into the intention of the programmers who created it so whatever the programmer is holding in his or her heart when they are writing the script that is the foundation of AI that is the energy that the AI holds so that speaks to the absolute critical importance of getting the technologists who are holding our future in their hands in the technical sense getting them into their hearts because if they are not in their hearts but if they are in their hearts if they see this responsibility that they are holding fully and are connected to their hearts what AI can do could just be unbelievably beautiful see this is I though I know I understand why that would be a concern but from my very brief investigation of AI and neural networks they don't know what the fuck is going on in there a lot of the times they don't know there is too much going on they are not even sure so they might be able to create a chain reaction or a situation where something is happening but the evolutionary process that is taking place is I think if it were within their control then it would be too slow to reach the levels they need it to reach so it has got to do its own thing and in that doing its own thing if what we are talking about is something real in other words if for lack of a better word the future incoming future is real then it is going to be detectable not just by human intuition but also it is going to start showing up in everything and just like you were saying I don't know if you chose to be numb but I think a lot of maybe is part of what we do as a human is we after the fact say I chose to do that well I was inspired to do that or whatever when the reality is maybe you didn't maybe you are just a runway maybe you are just a runway and something is landing into this dimension via you and part of the runways are probably like I said runways if they could think I sucked another plane out of the sky planes oh wow you know it is a joy chatting with you I am so lucky we connected on clubhouse and I have learned a lot from this conversation from hanging out with you are you offering do you work with people online right now like if somebody wanted to thank you for that I work with groups I love teaching emotional intelligence I love doing

curious why no one on one I don't the answer is that I just like working I do do some but I like if you called me I would do it but I like we don't need to talk about it anymore okay awesome this is selfish question I am just kidding I imagine it would be like it is signing up for a lot to have that kind of connection it is and it is just when people come in that I don't know there is some like there is a block there the amount of money that makes it feel like it is worth it for me is more than the amount of money I want to charge it is a lot yeah you are taking on what you are doing is I get it I get it that is a legitimate complication and I really love I feel most alive I love what I am doing with you right now I feel so alive I love feeling like what I have to say or what I have to share energetically gets amplified that just warms my heart so much that is why I have been loving clubhouse because I can just step on randomly and maybe 30 or 40 people come into the field with me and that just warms my heart that is so cool yeah it is a clubhouse I think is also potentially one of these runway technologies for this thing for sure because it is mixing people up in a pretty profoundly interesting way and sometimes it is an embarrassing mix up of entrepreneurs talking about like I heard one of them on clubhouse somebody literally said the question to someone there is an entrepreneur group just because I never heard this language was wild man but one of the entrepreneurs said to the other one how do we monetize daylight I mean right now how do I monetize daylight it is like holy shit man they were wanting to make it rain gold from their computer in that moment but other than that there is a lot of cool little burrows appearing on clubhouse I guess you put a dome over people that blocks the sunlight and then charge them to open it that is the cruelest that is the cruelest thing that is what Nestle does with water we block access to water and then charge people for it a lot of people do that with God too yeah exactly wow healing heals the healer that is your book it is available on Amazon right now any links you all need if you want to connect with David I

Y'all they called it a palace till you made it home. The first seat you sat on was a throne. Royalty inspiring the nation. Vow to the princess boy. Why are you waiting? Lady Diana. Didn't die if you think she did. Look up above and you'll see her in the sky. Oh, my sakeable. Completely unbreakable. MI6 tried that shit. That lady was unshakable. Walking in a Gucci heels and landmine laden fields. Lady Diana will never die. She's out there stew. I know she's out there stew. She's out there. In the pub with MI6. We've got it all figured out.

Lady Diana. That was I know you're still out there featuring Johnny Pemberton. We're taking requests. Always. Let's keep going. I used to live in a military base. Far underground, maybe under your town. When we misbehaved, they would put us in a maze. Make us suck our dicks, then they'd make us run around. That was deep underground military base. She goes out to Shannon in Detroit from Michelle. She says I love you, honey. I'm sorry. Please take me back. She said that she's sorry. She didn't mean to do it. She thought it was just a coffee. Followed by a hike. Followed by three dinners. Followed by a shopping trip. Followed by another hike. Followed by sucking his dick for three hours. That was sucking his dick for three hours. That was dedicated to Detective Frank Hamlin from the goat-faced killer. He says he has a special message for you and your partner. And that he wants you two to know that... Draw this in room. That's what happens. When you take the moon and Saturn and say it backwards. This person's nipples and a live grenade were mailed to Alex Trembach's last maid. Answer is my name. If you're being forced to listen to the DTFH while on a long trip, you may be entitled to compensation. My name is Leonard Hamlin, and I, along with my team of legal experts, have gotten victims of non-consensual DTFH exposure over $20 million in cash payouts. My boyfriend forced me to listen to the DTFH on our ride to Coachella. I called Leonard Hamlin and was awarded $2 million. Don't wait a second longer. Pick up your phone and dial 1-800-I-AM-HURT. Again, that's 1-800-I-M-H-U-R-T. You'll be put on with a legal expert who will remind you that you have to find a way to be here now. Because now is all we have. Just joking. This isn't the DTFH. It's a real-life law firm that has gotten millions of dollars into the pockets of victims of non-consensual podcast exposure. Call us. We will get you paid. Don't call that number. It's not worth it. It doesn't even work. Not even worth seeing if that number works. All right, friends, I just was lucky enough to do a DTFH with one of my favorite guests, Abby Martin. And she let me ask her all the questions that I've been wondering about when it comes to what's happening in Ukraine. Abby Martin is a journalist, an author, an artist, and a true truth teller. She's fiery and brilliant. And hopefully this episode will help clear up any confusion you might have over what's going on over there if you've been following it at all. We're going to jump right into it, but first this. I don't know if you've ever eaten too much cannabis, but I certainly have. Anytime I've done that, a lot of horrible things happen to me. My nipples start lactating and gooey streams of white, sour, milky stuff rolls down into my belly button where it congeals in a putrid gel. I don't like that experience and I never want to go through it again, which is why I now microdose when it comes to eating cannabis. And that's why I love today's sponsor.

Abby, I'm so glad to see you again. Welcome back to the DTFH. Hi. Dude, it's so great to be back. Duncan. How are you? Are you? Tell me how are you enjoying being a new mom? Dude, it's the craziest thing in the world. I remember hearing you talk about it because you obviously had your kid first. And it was like, I think you described like, it's like going to the ocean as opposed to hearing it described for you your whole life and then actually being there for the first time. It is absolutely insane. I feel like every day that passes because he's so young still, I'm never actually like fully realizing what's happening because the changes are so rapid and it's so surreal and it never stops becoming surreal. Like every night I just think like this is happening, this is real and just like seeing him transform and now form language is just like, holy shit. I mean, just every stage of it has been such an animalistic thing and just understanding your place in the world, I guess, like finally and just all the realizations and all the emotional weight of realizing what your mother did for you, what your father did for you, what their parents did for them, like what it all means in the grand scheme of things. And it is intense. Yeah, it's intense. It's death. I mean, it's one of the like, it's like just moving into the blast radius of some kind of genetic atomic bomb that you're part of and you just every day. I know what you're saying. It's just, it's so, they're evolving so quickly. They, you know, every week it's almost like another baby and then the baby's not there anymore. Then it's a toddler. The baby's gone. Where's the baby? And then there's like a kid who will like, it's the best. I, it's the best, but it is what it's, to me, while all this other shit's going on in the world, all the complexity, all the strangeness, knowing that all around the planet, these beautiful creatures are sucking on boobs. Like, you know what I mean? Nothing's different from what's been going on like this forever. You know, even though we seem so advanced, that primordial reality is happening in every second. And that's pretty cool to think how, how those two things are coexisting. Especially covering this kind of stuff and then like looking at my son's eyes and just the pure joy and innocence of him, like learning what a balloon is. You know, it's like something just so basic and it's just like, how could you not just love with every fucking out, like every fiber of your being? How could you not just embrace this moment of like pure energy? But then there's this weird like thing that compounds everything, that like makes me constantly think about death. And I guess the bringing a life into the world and knowing how relatively easy, of course, it is to create life and your place in... Certainly for dudes, it's easy. You guys fucking create millions of them every day. Just go off in a fucking oblivion, dude. But like how everything, it's like at this point, and I know that you, you know, your mother and of course having cancer and stuff, it's like so many things happen that you realize that everything's just a march to death. And having a baby there is just immediately makes me all of a sudden care about my health. Like, oh shit, I'm a fallible human and I want to just live every day for this new creature and do everything for them. You can't die anymore. You don't have a luxury of death. People like us, you know, we're like, ah, you know, so what, maybe there will be a nuclear war, I'll get evaporated, I bet it won't last long. Now it's like, fuck, we got to make this thing work now. We have to really make it work somehow and keep it going. And yeah, that's, I think all those things are really good. That's, you know, those are all, it's not easy realizations, obviously it's not easy to have kids, but it definitely makes you more human. It makes you, God, like all the stuff going on. You know, like when Obama or whoever the president is, is dropping bombs on another country and you hear about babies getting blown up, you know it's awful. Anyone with a brain knows it's awful. But when you have a kid and then you, you know, like this shit going on in Ukraine and you know, Putin's got kids, and you think, how do you do that? Knowing what it's like to be a parent, how do you conduct war? How do you compartmentalize humanity so that it makes sense? I just don't get it. Like, how do they do it? What do you think the acrobatics they're doing mentally are to pull off not feeling like a demon when you're annihilating families? I mean, man, I've asked myself that about just like climate change and just every, I mean, every aspect aside from war, it's like war is the most straightforward one, right? It's like you literally know that you're killing babies. Like every time you shell a civilian neighborhood, like you're killing fucking kids. But it's like just the, I mean, I guess it is so much more abstract when you can just be like, we're just going to perpetually drill and never, you know, the climate is in this apocalyptic state and we're on the precipice of like this catastrophic change and it's like we're not going to change anything. Status quoism all the way because our survival depends on it, like kind of thing, like our power and status. But yeah, war is this whole other level where it's like you literally have to abandon humanity. You cannot see through the lens of like being a parent or being even a human being and having like looking at other humans in the same way. I mean, that's what's so fucking amazing and stark about this war as opposed to all the parallel examples of all, you know, everything that we can go down the line is how the media is responding to this, right? Like all of these European journalists and shit being like, oh, this is different. They're like, this isn't Syria. This isn't Palestine. Like we're used to those places being completely decimated and those people are barbaric and they're like, this is different because these are Europeans and these people have blonde hair and blue eyes. And it's like, I'm sorry, but I'm equally as revolted when a Palestinian child or a Syrian child or a Somali child is killed by our bombs. So it's hard to differentiate and it's hard to make that distinction. And so that's why I guess I'm looking at this whole thing with my mouth agape, like where did this all come from? Like thank you for joining our outrage, our collective outrage at the sheer horror and hell that war is, but war did not start a month and a half ago. Like war is a permanent state. And the people who are perpetrating this are no better than Putin and those people live here in this country, you know? And so it is, I don't know how they do it, Duncan. I ask myself that every day and I don't even know how people report on these kind of atrocities and crimes with like with a straight face because especially when you have a kid, it's like every child lost. It hurts in my heart because I think of the mother who grew that child, who fucking made that child for nine goddamn months, birthed that child, raised that child and the child is just used as a fucking piece of cannon fodder for some political game. And their life is extinguished as if it was nothing. Yeah, and it's so weirdly normalized and I don't, yeah, I can't tell. I love having you on because you often set me straight. I veer, I'm very susceptible to propaganda. It's just, I am, and I fully admit it. So like my compass needle, just depending on where I land, it can go any way, depending on how great the propaganda is. But being susceptible to propaganda also helps me at least know when it's, when I'm seeing propaganda. And what is so weird about what's happening right now is everything's propaganda. Like we all, if you've lived in America long enough, you know what it's like when a war is about to start. You know how they get as prepped for it. You know, like when the drums are beating and every single time it happens, we think, no, no, no, no, no. We're not going to do it again. We're not doing it again. Are we doing it again? We're not doing it again. And then all of a sudden, there it is. The like, the PSYOP starts happening and you know, and you look at what's going on to the Ukrainians and you get, you're supposed to get angry. You should get angry and that is happening. You're supposed to get angry. You get mad. Now suddenly you're, I've gone through periods of just fantasizing, this is how fucked up I am. I've got, I've gone through periods of falling asleep, fantasizing, trying to convince Putin to stop launching missiles. I'm like, I'm a dad now. You seem cool. I saw the, the interview you did with what, what's his face? That the crazy, the guy who did the JFK. Oliver Stone. I saw your Oliver Stone interview. You seem like you have a heart. Why are you blowing up people? I don't, I know you're kind of in the mob or something. And anyway, this is how nuts I am. My wife is like, you got to just stop looking at the internet doctor or having imaginary conversations with someone in Russia. But, but, but, uh, so anyway, now we have vilified every Russian person. Me being an idiot with geography. I like started researching Russia and realizing how gigantic it is. It's giant. It's so huge. And it's like so many people there. So now you're seeing like as part of the propaganda. Look, the Russians, they're making cupcakes that have the Z on it. They're celebrating the destruction and they're acting like there's some unified voice coming out of that place. Is there, is it true? Are the Russians unified in their general, uh, support of this war that Putin is waging in, uh, the Ukraine? So I just did a podcast with my friends, Yasha Levine and Evgenia Kovtun. They're really vehemently anti-war, but they're also very critical of the U.S. role having lived here for quite a while. And they have a really good take because truthfully Duncan, there is such a fog of war surrounding the day to day operations and the war crime day sure that we're told by the featured moments tab and all the curation of these tech overlords that are basically curating our reality for us. And working on behalf of U.S., you know, foreign policy establishment to tow a certain line as well as the blanket censorship of basically anything that can be construed as, as, uh, Russian talking points as well as, of course, Russian affiliated media. It's very hard to figure out what is going on on the ground. And it's also really hard to know what is and what is not hyperbolic in terms of like repression within Russia. What is really the state of affairs in terms of the political society. So that's why it was really instructive to hear from my two friends who have no skin. I mean, they have skin in the game, but they're not tied to Russia and they're not tied to like U.S. corporate media. They're just independent journalists. Right. It is very true that there is very severe political repression. And so because of that, there's very little space and oxygen given to an anti-war movement that would be growing more and more within Russian society. When the war launched, there was thousands of arrests. A lot of people rounded up. A lot of people visited by police for simply posting things on their social media. And, you know, I think that there is jail sentences that are looming for people who are just dissenting against the war. So yes, there's very fascist repression going on. And so it makes it really hard to, to actually determine what is like the public opinion, really. Do you remember what it was like taking a second language class in college or high school? I don't know what your experience was, but for me, it felt like somebody was taking a cheese grater and rubbing it up and down over the part of my brain responsible for language.

It makes it really hard to actually determine what is the public opinion really within Russian society. Of course, you have this whole internal propaganda campaign from Putin talking about the denotification and using the death of 27 million Soviets in World War II. That's a lot of people compared to 40,000 US, United States residents or citizens dying in that war. 27 fucking million Soviets dying, defeating the Nazis. Putin is resurrecting this anti-Nazi propaganda and the glory of defeating the Nazis and using that in a grotesque way to gin up support for this regime change war that I think he thought was going to be really easy. I think it's really fucked up because look at what the US has done to Iraq, to Libya. You march in there thinking that these things are going to be easy and then you end up causing this massive amount of suffering, death and destabilization of an entire region. There's no going back. Once you open Pandora's box of war, there's no closing that and war is hell, dude. It's hard to determine what's going on but there's a lot of legitimate things that up until this point that the US ignored and that there could have been more diplomacy and unfortunately that was abandoned every step of the way and here we are and it's horrifying. Okay. Yes, it is. Thank you for that. Your take on it. Just trying to, again, it's such a bizarre time because if you just try to zoom out and say, all right, here's why they're doing it. It's not like they're, here's why they're doing it. Here's why Russia is attacking Ukraine. I don't think it's right. I'm a hippie. Don't attack. Don't bomb. What the fuck? I know Russia is a super repressive country right now and we could talk about it in a little bit. How can this like, you know, have you heard of the Wudekyu pipeline, like New Agers who get into QAnon? It's called Wudekyu. But there's like a right wing to Putin pipeline where weirdly people who are hyper-conservative suddenly just fall in love with Putin. Okay. All that aside, you're a journalist. I'm just a podcaster who gets, like, so like, like, help me figure this out. To me, it seems like Russia understands that NATO, the alliance, doesn't like Russia. You know, many good reasons for that. Russia's been doing the same thing that the CIA has been doing. I think it's picked up some tricks from the CIA, mixed it in with KGB stuff. They're into destabilization too. And so this is the conflict and Russia is saying, listen, we know you don't like us. We know you don't want us to exist. How can we let you be right at our border? Like you were against us. And so they think that NATO is an enemy. It would be similar to like Russia going back to Cuba, right? It would be like if all of a sudden Russia started building bases on Cuba or in the Mexican border or something like that, right? We would be like, no, fuck that. You can't do that. Is that the reason outside of the denoxification is the reason that Putin is freaked out by NATO encroaching on its territory? Yeah. I mean, let's let's briefly talk about what NATO is because NATO was founded as an anti-communist alliance to basically fight the Soviet Union. So you kind of have to ask yourself, like, why does NATO exist at all today? And when you look at NATO's history in the last 30 or so years, I mean, it's basically been an aggressive war-mongering alliance destroying Yugoslavia, right? This is another former Soviet country. Hey, historic, can you educate me on that? That was because I don't know that. I mean, in 1999, the NATO alliance basically dropped like 30,000 bombs on Yugoslavia. I don't know much more about what precipitated all of this, but it is just really crazy because you hear a lot of Western pundits and stuff being like, this Ukraine war is the biggest war since World War II in Europe. And it's like, actually, Yugoslavia was pretty destroyed by NATO, and it's kind of whitewashed and forgotten about by this entire political punditry. And then you have, of course, Afghanistan was in part a NATO operation. Where is this on the North Atlantic borders? This is completely outside of the periphery of what NATO was supposed to do, Afghanistan. Then Libya, dude, 2000, this is 11 years ago, under the Obama administration, NATO launched a full-scale, first the no-fly zone, and then fucking completely destroyed Libya. This was one of the most prosperous countries in Africa, bombed into oblivion, where 11 years later, they have no central government still. So putting that aside, when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, NATO was a big point of contention. And there was an accord. There was several treaties and architecture installed and in place to basically prevent a war between these two nuclear powers. And in 1997, there was Russian officials that met with George H.W. Bush, and they promised that NATO would not expand eastward one inch. And if you look at US national security documents, it literally does talk about, to your point, it talks about how countering Russia and China as business competitors is the main national security strategy for the US. And in order to do that, it needs to use lethal force and lethal armaments. That's a pretty hostile measure put into writing. And so all of this over the last couple of decades, all of these Cold War-era treaties, all of these guarantees, and all of the architecture of a framework to de-escalate tensions completely dissolved or were abandoned or broken by the US because the US never wanted to engage in diplomacy. It always wanted to use NATO as an encroaching force to surround Russia, to pressure Russia. And so all of this is valid, right? And in 2019, Trump actually dissolved the last most important treaty, which was the Intermediate Nuclear Range Treaty, which basically said that the US could stage missiles that could reach cities in Russia within 10 minutes. And those were all very clear red lines that Russia said over and over again over the last several decades, that they would not stand for, that they had several red lines, that you could not use Ukraine as a hostile, basically staging ground for advanced weaponry. And you could argue that Ukraine was, in fact, this de facto NATO member because they had opened the door for NATO membership after the 2014 US-backed coup that overthrew a more neutral leader that was supposed to basically... Is that true? Okay, wait. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. There was a US-backed coup. That's when Zelensky came into power? No, this is what's interesting too. So this is totally debunking the whole Russia thing too, about how, oh, Ukraine's a Nazi state and it's a Nazi regime, totally cartoonishly false. In fact, I mean, it is true that the US was involved in the coup in 2014. Of course, there was a lot of legitimate grievances. Ukraine is a very corrupt state. And there were huge protests. But the problem is, just like a lot of legitimate protests that erupt around the world, the US has its hands to facilitate an outcome. And so Victoria Nuland, who was serving under Hillary Clinton in the Obama administration, she is one of the chief architects of basically the entire neo-conservative foreign policy with her husband. She was on the ground in Ukraine handing out cookies during the Euromaidan protests. She admitted that they invested $5 billion into Ukrainian civil society to try to basically sway whatever the outcome was of these legitimate grievances that they had. And there's even a leaked phone call that Victoria Nuland is basically just pontificating about who they want to put in the government after Yanukovych was ousted. And, oh, do we want to put this guy? Oh, no, no, no. Do we want to put this guy? And someone was like, well, the EU wants him and she's like, fuck the EU. Like we're going to put this guy in power. And it's like, what in the absolute fuck is going on? Like you guys are just wantonly, like randomly talking about, this is life and fucking death, this is an entire country, you know? And that's what kills me. It's like, but oh, so to your point, like so this, so basically the coup happened. It was horrific. A lot of neo-Nazi regiments were on the ground getting funding, backing, were leading forces in the coup, but that they waned in power after that. And then there was another election where Zelensky, Zelensky, who we all know today, this Marvel fucking hero that's painted by the West, you know, he's kind of a tragic figure because he won with a huge mandate, almost 75% of the vote because he ran on peace with Russia because ever since the 2014 coup, there was basically a civil war going on on the border of Russia and Ukraine where 14,000 people died in those two breakaway regions where it was like these semi-autonomous zones. And so Zelensky was like, I'm going to fucking bring peace together. He spoke Russian during the campaign. He basically got in on a huge mandate of peace with Russia. And that's what makes this so tragic is that instead we're in this full-fledged war and fuck Putin for not doing, like he didn't do anything about these two regions, the 14,000 people who had died. He could have gone to the international stage. He could have done a lot. And instead he chose to launch a full-scale criminal, a legal invasion of Ukraine and basically just plummeted into a pit of hell. Okay, so that was a great thank you. I have goosebumps. I feel like closing my windows so it's dark in here. Put duct tape on your windows. Remember when John Ashcroft was like, he was like, put duct tape on your windows because they're going to launch a chemical attack. And it's like, I don't know if that's going to stop it, dude. I think duct tape is the answer. Maybe that gorilla glue tape. Okay, so this is something that I wonder and I have nothing to back it up other than just being generally conspiratorial. But was Putin lured in? Was this a trap? How do you, I do buy that they bit off more than they can chew and that they thought they could do it easily. I don't think that's propaganda. I know for a little bit people were pushing back against that. There was some, I think it was in an op-ed in the New York Times that appeared everywhere where the premise wasn't in a no. He knows exactly what he's doing. Remember when that was bubbling around? I just wonder, did somebody get into his inner circle or distort his inner circle's ability to collect information that did someone just poison the soup of statistics that made them think they could just go under Ukraine and that everyone would surrender? Because it seems like, especially if what you're saying is true, which I think I've heard it multiple times. I don't mean like you wouldn't say it was true. I mean, I just don't know what's real. If I, and I remember looking, I'm sorry, I'm going on all too long here. I remember seeing what you're talking about, realizing there are all these weird western American think tanks that were appearing in Eastern Europe and in the Ukraine and stuff where that were encouraging these protests and obviously trying to push the needle. But okay, so is this just another phase in a weird plan to break up Russia again? Because it seems like a trap, like Putin invades, all of a sudden western countries start pouring like the most advanced weapons on earth into Ukraine, annihilating a lot of the Russian tanks. There's pictures of Russian helmets that are from World War II. They're not capable of stopping bullets and the type of guns they're using now. Do you think it was a trap or was it just Putin went crazy or just didn't care? Or the people around him were yes men and were afraid to tell them, I don't think we have the ability to do this right now. I mean, it's such a good question because it is so incomprehensible that he thought that any other outcome would happen, like other than this one, which is getting bogged down into a proxy war. And this is exactly what this is. And I'm not just saying this, look at Congressman Adam Schiff, who was just on the floor of the house basically saying, we are using Ukraine to quote, fight Russia over there so we don't have to fight them here, bragging about how they are using Ukrainians as cannon fodder, that they're not even trying to engage in diplomacy, that they are just literally using the Afghanistan model, as Hillary Clinton recently said, proudly proclaiming that they want to use the Afghanistan model. Where did that leave us? Wait, what's that? 9-11 in a 20-fucking-year war. I mean, basically funding the Mujahideen to fight the Soviet Union and bog them down into Operation Cyclone. So here we are. And what did that lead us to? 9-11 in a 20-year fucking war that we lost. This episode of the DTFH has been supported by Zip Recruiter.

So here we are again using this country with civilians in the crossfire and sending javelin missiles that could shoot down low-flying planes, helicopters, billions of dollars in weaponry, long-range artillery, heavy shelling. I mean, all of this stuff is just mind-bending. But yes, what was Putin thinking? What the fuck? What on earth was he thinking? That he could waltz into Ukraine and basically install a Russian-friendly regime in the face of the entire West uniting to send everything and do basically everything aside from a no-fly zone, which they actually left on the table if there is a quote, biological or chemical attack, which is very scary because that could mean a bad actor could either stage one or whatever. And so we're in a really bad way. But was the trap set? I think the stage was set by the West a long time ago because Russia, for the last year, was meeting with all these NATO negotiators over the course of several months where they said, we have no choice but to militarily invade if you do not respect the red lines that we've set. And that one of them was Ukraine never joining NATO. Not that Ukraine was on the doorstep of joining NATO, but the fact is that they refused to say that they couldn't. And of course, you could argue, why shouldn't they have the right to join NATO? That's not for me to say. But the fact is that Russia very clearly said, we're going to do this. And I think that's why you saw this kind of pre-cog advertising campaign all over corporate media, like Russia's about to invade Ukraine, Russia's about to invade Ukraine. But all of these Russian officials and Ukrainian officials were like, this is hyperbole, they're not going to invade. Why are you guys saying this? And then something snapped where it just seemed like it was almost a unilateral decision Putin was like, we're not going to wait any longer, we're just going to do this. And it was like him not just walking into a trap, it was like walking into a sand, like quicksand. It was like, I mean, I don't know what they were thinking, but I think that they definitely did not prepare for the sanctions that are going to exfix the economy. And a lot of people are saying it's going to be worse than the collapse of the Soviet Union, which was a really dire time for Russians. And it's also, they've incurred so many casualties already that there is no way that they could have anticipated how much resistance was going to be on the ground on the Ukrainian side, which is really amazing. Because as you mentioned, there's this notion that Putin is this genius, right? It kind of reminds me of Trump. People are like, oh, Trump 5D chess player. It's like, really? I feel like Trump is a complete fucking moron who's flying by the seat of his pants. And people always just impose this idea on Putin, like, no, he's gaming it out. Just wait. It's like, no, dude, I'm pretty sure that invading Ukraine was like the dumbest decision ever. So how do you explain that away? But people will always do that. And I think that that will happen till the end of time. No one's going to ever face the fact that they were wrong, that Putin really is just as dumb as Donald Trump. That's scary. That's scary. Like, no one wants to admit, like, no, you don't understand. You see, these are just maniacs. Like, it's not like some brilliant, peace-loving world leader who's, yes, he understands there's going to have to be some loss now, because what would have come would have been horrific. It's just crazy. It's just crazy, dudes. You don't, that's the part that, you know, really creeps me out, especially like, I think Putin has some, like, mystic whispering in his ear. I don't know if you knew about this, but there's some, like, Eastern European, like, Rasputin character, apparently, who's, like, telling him, no, God wants you to do this. So now it's like- Oh, so it's just like Bush. It's just like George Bush. Like, God, oh, great. Now we're involving God dictating the whims of these political maniacs. Yeah, it's pretty, pretty disconcerting, Duncan. And especially because Putin's a monster of America's own making, if we want to go back to, you know, the fact that Yeltsin, the shock therapy, neoliberalism, injected in the post-Soviet Union, and the collapse of the economy, the privatization, and the fact that Putin was handpicked by the U.S. puppet that we helped install. Really? And here we are today, baby. It's amazing, isn't it, that all of this keeps going back. It's like, how far do we want to reset the clock? I don't know. I mean, that's the problem. It's a, it's, I don't know. Whenever I see things like this, I feel like, you know, it's like, I think I heard someone describe it. You know, you look down into the ocean and you see like a, the glint of like a fish down there, but you can't see the shape of the fish. You just know it's big. And whenever things like this are happening, don't you get this sense of like, this is part of a plant. Like, I'm not saying it's a part of Putin's plan. I'm not even saying it's part of like Biden's plan. I don't know whose plan it is, but it appears to be, like you said, organized before it happened, you know, and like all of a sudden we're hearing about Zelensky and the Ukraine all of a sudden were interested. I'm interested. I'm on Reddit. I'm looking at it. I'm scared now. I'm like, what the fuck is this? Also, the part that's, I can't really wrap my head around is the, what are the odds? And I heard this on the podcast that you tweeted. What are the odds that someone in a sitcom about a normal dude becoming president of Ukraine becomes the president of Ukraine? It's, you know what I mean? It's, it's absurd. It's absurd that, that, that the TV show just turned into a reality show. And how are we, how, I know that's what happened. I can't imagine there being an organized conspiracy to the level that we're like, listen, we've picked this guy out. He's perfect. He's going to be our man in the Ukraine to finally collapse the Soviet Union, but let's warm it up a little bit by putting him on a TV show and get everybody into it. And then we'll do the election. He'll get elected. And that's when we enact phase 19 or whatever it is. You know, it's just, I, I don't like the, I would, I, things like that make me feel nuts. Because if you say it out loud, like, does this seem real? That doesn't seem real. The actor, beautiful actor, dude, funny, charismatic iron TV becomes the leader of the, or they're calling the leader of the free world now. And yeah, yeah, it's, it's, it is powerful. It is powerful. And there are times when I'm like, he's amazing. I love him. He's incredible. I can't believe it. He is cool. I really like him. But also there's times when I'm like, this just seems to, I don't know, clean or something. It seems to, I don't know, it just got that smell. You know, that smell. Well, it's the smell of propaganda, man. Like you said, it's coming at us from all sides, dude. Yeah, yeah, it is. Yeah, I mean, I guess we just have to go back to what you were saying initially. To me, and I think it's a really fucked up time in history, which is saying what you just said earlier on is controversial. The main thing is, look, we shouldn't, you know, blowing up children wherever they may be is not good. Like it's a failure. Like it's an absolute complete failure of civilization. If we consider one way to have a conversation with someone is dropping bombs on them, and then they drop bombs on you. It's a failure, an absolute failure. And now worse than that, it's the kind of failure that can lead to the exact thing that some very smart people have been saying, that's going to happen. Nuclear proliferation is going to lead to a nuclear war. And a nuclear war, I think climate change is bad, wait until radiation is being blown up into the atmosphere and just drifting all around the planet and poisoning everything. We have no idea what that would be like. We can't even imagine what that would be like. And so to be a new parent and have to, like, on top of all the shit that goes along with being a new parent, having on top of that, just have that in your mind after COVID. It is so fucked. It's so fucked. It's debilitating, dude. It's debilitating and it's all encompassing and it never ends. And it's like this low-level anxiety of just knowing that, I mean, imagine how our parents felt. You know, like our parents grew up. My mom tells me all the time, I feel like a lot of her anxiety comes from the conditioning of literally nuclear winter every day during the Cold War, doing the drills where they would go under their desk and what would you do in the wake of a nuclear bomb blast. It's like, what? Why are you even pretending like there was a chance of survival? What was the point? It's like you could have just ignored it completely to school children every day. They're like, okay, all the five-year-olds, we're all going to wind up and do the mock nuclear blast exercise again, kids. It's like, what did that do to set the stage of our generation now? But no, it's frightening and it is a total breakdown of civilization. It's like the fact that here we are. I just listened to you and Danielli Battelli talking about Rome and that was what like, you know, here we are, dude. It's like, what's the difference? We just have more sophisticated technology and weaponry. You can blow people up in a more efficient fashion. That's the difference. But the mentality is still the same. By the way, I'm so sorry, my computer's about to die. Can I just take the camera out and plug in my... Yeah, no problem. Yeah. So basically, things are still the same, Duncan. And that's not a very good thing to wrap your mind around because we have so much potential for so much beauty and we could carve out this utopian vision in a collective sense and we've abandoned it all for selfishness and greed and power despite the consciousness that's advanced, despite the access to everything on the planet. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's the... I mean, we got hyperconnected and then that connectivity was used against us by very smart people who know how to manipulate and how to propagandize everything so that the signal is always wrapped up in some slanted thing. It's always going one way or the other. It does. And just trying to find some fundamental place where... No, this is the truth. It's controversial. And maybe it is. Maybe it's controversial to say, to imagine that there's a way to have a planetary society that doesn't have as an option war. You know, maybe that is naive. I don't know. Maybe that's just what people like us wish, but it can't be that way. There's too many people on the planet. There's too many different ways of thinking about the value of human life. And as long as that is happening, there's going to be war and you're going to have to push back against people who are deciding to do land grabs. That's why the biological weapon and chemical weapon thing, right? People are saying, look, somehow they're trying to spin what Russia is doing as compassionate because they're not blowing up everything. They're just blowing up certain places, but they're like, look, if they wanted to, they could eradicate everything. But the reason they're not eradicating everything is because they want to own that stuff. It's like, you don't want to blow up the infrastructure. If you're intending to make that part of Russia, because you got to build it back. It's even more expensive. So if you use chemical weapons or God forbid biological weapons, then the job is just cleaning up bodies. And that's a lot easier than rebuilding skyscrapers. So I think that's why they keep saying they might do that. Because as a last resort, what else is he going to do? I keep hoping maybe they'll just say, okay, we denotified, now we're done. And go on that propaganda train. Withdraw the troops and be like, we did what we meant to do. Don't notify again. That's one outcome I hope happens. Probably won't, but I keep praying for that. That's the only way out that I can think of for him other than going deeper and deeper into it and using the war technology that they haven't used yet to achieve that goal. I mean, don't you, isn't it a real, even though Russia is saying they won't do it, isn't it a real danger that at some point he might just decide to launch a nuclear missile at the entrenched forces in the Donbas, right? Aren't they all in like bunkers and trenches and completely buried there? It is always a possibility for a nuclear war to erupt. And that's why this war is so volatile. And that is why anti-war activists, especially here in the West, need to be urging de-escalation, especially from our government, because there is no option other than diplomacy here, because having Zelensky at the Grammys and basically giving speeches to Congress, and it's like, look, I don't blame Zelensky. He wants to win, obviously. Calling for a no-fly zone, I understand that he is in the middle of a fucking war, and he wants to win that war. The problem with the no-fly zone is that that literally will escalate this to warring nuclear powers being embroiled in actual combat. And that is, that will ensure what you're talking about inevitably. And that is a very, very slippery slope, very, very dangerous. And I think there's a lot of insidious disinformation about what that actually means. And you see the Beltway Press, for example, all of these journalists in DC clamoring for a no-fly zone. I mean, it really is like, who can up the ante of who's the most militaristic? And it's like, that is terrifying to me to hear all these journalists being like, why won't you give Zelensky what he wants? Like, give him the no-fly zone. Like, why aren't you doing this? And it's like, dude, what is going on here? Why can't you tell Americans what that will mean? Like, let's be honest, and then we can make up our minds about whether or not we want to risk nuclear war for defending Ukraine. Because that's what this is. And here's what really kills me, Duncan. This censorship of, look, I was on RT. I was on RT for three years. I had a show. You got me on RT. You were on my show talking about psychedelics. It was incredible. And it shows you that it was a different show, you know, nearly 600 episodes of everything. Joe Rogan talking about DMT, you talking about psychedelics, like lucid dreaming. It was just such fascinating topics that I was able to explore. All of that was censored in this blanket ban, no discussion. It's completely memory hold from the internet, kind of the equivalent of like the modern burning of books, because it was associated with Russian TV. And the problem with this is that when you are blanketly censoring all of Russian media, that leaves us privy or like susceptible to the narratives that we're told by the Western media. And what is the Western media saying about what's happening? They're saying Putin is doing this because he's an evil arch-villain, because we're living in a Disney movie, and there's the good, which is the West, the bad, which is the evil, not just bad, the evil. And when you're putting those kind of like superhero, super villain, like characteristics on someone, then it's hard to actually determine what is the real reason that this is happening. And that really bothers me, because then it's really hard to engage in diplomacy and to urge any sort of diplomatic solution, because then you're just left with saying, well, there's no way that we can reason with this man, because he's an evil psychopath who just wants to kill kids. And look, we would never say that about Obama, right? Like there's always a reason why these things happen. And so to just kind of remove that ability for us to navigate that information on our own and to make up our own minds, it's infantilizing. And it makes us feel or treats us like children, basically, that we're not, we're not able to have the cognition to navigate these spaces and just, we just need to be told what to think and what to believe. Right. Yeah, right. Yeah, that's the, there, a new thing that has popped up in Western propaganda is don't do your own research. Oh, really? You're going to do your own research? You know what I mean? Like that's become like, yo, really? You're one of those people who does their research? No, just trust what's coming out of like the three new networks. That's what's real. Don't do your own research. You're going to run into trouble if you do that. And it's true, actually, because I've done my own research and come to the conclusion that like a meteor was going to hit the earth. When COVID was happening, I did my own research, except where I was researching was like retic conspiracy. And I'm like, Oh my God, a meteor is about to impact. That's what this is. This is why I'm lucky to have my wife because she's like dunking a meteor is not going to hit. You're okay. We're okay. But still, I know what you're saying. It's like, you should be allowed to, that was, I remember like, scrabbling around trying to like get any kind of like, I wanted to see the Russian propaganda. What are they saying? Like, it was very hard to find. And, you know, it was at least I couldn't find it. And then, you know, again, like, just to address some people, I know some people, I know you are probably haunted by this for being on RT. People think that you are a like secret, a funded mouthpiece for Russia. Or, but hearing what you just said about Putin, you can't say that shit. You can't say that and be one of like, working for the Kremlin. They, I know, you know, there's people who are afraid to like talk shit about him at all. They're terrified of him. So, no, of course, when I was on RT, I spoke out against the Crimean invasion. And I was told like, I was able to keep my job because I really paved this editorial freedom there. But at the same time, a couple people and potentially my boss also wanted to ship me to Crimea. Like, I remember waking up the next day, the front page of the newspaper was Abbey's getting shipped to Crimea. And I was like, no, I'm not going there. Because you could have asked me, but now I'm being told like, you're just going to fucking ship me like a piece of equipment and just drop me in like a potential war zone because I spoke out and dissented on the network. So, yeah, I mean, no one can make that argument because I have constantly spoken out about Putin. But this is the problem. Now this is conflated with just Putin apology. If you just talk about NATO or if you talk about the US role in this, because everything's been reduced to a cartoon binary. You know, this is complicated geopolitical stuff. And now it's just relegated to good and evil. Yep, that's it. And that's, to me, that's the part that's just so gross and so creepy. Like, you should be allowed to fearlessly explore truth without worrying that people like, this isn't the time for that. Right now, this isn't the time for you to like go into the details about why this is happening. And you're definitely not supposed to like, feel bad for the like Russian conscripts that were siphoned into this fucking thing and our cannon fodder are just being blown up. You know, they didn't know that was gonna, they didn't know that was gonna happen. I don't think people, I didn't, I'd say I don't think people, I didn't realize how big Russia was, how undeveloped parts of it were. I didn't know about the draft that they had there, and that like just kids get suctioned up into the war machine. And so I think there's something really horrifying about the way there's a kind of celebration of a lot of these kids getting killed. Because they didn't, they didn't know that was gonna happen. And people are like, well, they shouldn't do it. They should like leave the military. But it's not that easy, right? Like, if they leave the military in Russia, they're going to go to jail or worse, right? You can't just not do it. You kind of have a gun to your head. Oh, yeah, look at here in this country, you go to jail. You know, if you, if you're draft or same thing, if you're in the military and you abandon your post, you're going to jail. Like it's not easy, you know, and, and I can only imagine what would happen to you if you decided to abandon your post in Russia. And it's absolutely tragic that these young, like essentially just teenagers are just going and killing their brethren. Because that's really what this is, you know, a lot of Ukrainians speak Russian, a lot of Russian speak, or just are affiliated with Ukrainian nationality, and they have family on both sides. And it's a complete travesty through and through that it's essentially just killing your own people for fucking nothing, man. And if you look at what Putin's saying, like exactly what you're saying, it's like, I want to know what the Russian propaganda is. I want to know what Putin is saying in his speeches. And if you look at like, what is, what does the West depict with all of these conflicts? It's like, I never heard like Bashar al-Assad, like give a speech. Like I never heard Gaddafi give, like I want to hear what these people say before we just both destroy their countries and kill these people. Like I want to know and understand who Putin is, what his ideology is, where he's coming from, and what he says about why he's doing this. And not only does he frequently talk about the NATO thing, but he also says some really crazy stuff that he basically wants to go back to the Tsarism, like he has all this fondness for like, yeah, like the Russian Empire, how he basically he blames Lenin. He's very anti-communist. That's another thing that was really informative from my Russian friends. It's like, Putin is as anti-communist as our politicians are here. Because a lot of Americans wrongly think that the Soviet Union still exists, apparently, that Russia is still communist. And there's a lot of confusing iconography with like the anti-Russia stuff with the hammer and sickle. And no, he's as anti-communist as Trump. He hates communism. He blames Lenin for, I don't even know, for I guess helping pave the way for Ukraine to have sovereignty. And he basically just is disgusted with the fact that Ukraine's even an independent country. So all of these things are important. I want to know these things. And I don't want it to be translated five times and be picked apart with sound bites to just be spoon fed to me by Joanne Reid about like what Putin said. Right. Yeah, I don't like that. It's sinister. It's sinister. It's sinister that, you know, in some alternate dimension, when things like this were happening, all the information channels would be opened up and there would be some way for just individuals in the countries that are like at war or proxy war to just talk to each other. Like what the fuck's, what are you guys hearing? What are, I'll tell you what we're hearing. And then from that sort of, I don't know, get out from under the shadow of whoever's trying to drive the war machine so that everyone gets humanized or something like that. You know, that's, because I mean, that's the terrifying reality is if I had to roll the dice, Ukrainian teenagers, Russian teenagers, American teenagers, they're all probably similar. They're all probably confused and obnoxious. Right. Like I doubt, you know what I mean? I don't think any of them are evil or bad. And same with the adults and the parents. And I know, again, I know this is like not right now. You're supposed to be like, fuck them, fuck the Russians. They're all corrupt. Like how can you say, how do you, why do they even deserve any kind of anyone saying anything for them? Look at what they're doing. Look at what they've done. And I get it. It's fucked up as a parent. It's fucked up. You know, you, you see, I can't get this out of my head. I know. Just some kid walking down the street. His parents nowhere to be seen. Just walking with all these refugees, just crying. And you know, that when you see things like that, that's when you're like, yeah, no flies on. All right, fuck it. Let's do, let's do it. Let's do it. Let's fucking do it. This can't happen because it's a, it's a gut instinct when that level of horror is happening. But then when you follow that three year old, I was like, oh shit, no, because that, that means something incomprehensible could happen. And, but then also it's like, well, what are we going to do? Abby? Is it just like Putin is like the, the, the bank robber and the bank surrounded. And instead of the gun to the hostage's head, he's got like a nuclear missile pointed at lots of different places around the planet. Amy, is that what the world, the future of the world is going to look like? If you have nuclear weapons and you are not afraid to kill a bunch of people, then you can go back to the old ways, imperialism. You can go back to that because actually the West isn't going to do anything. You can actually take big chunks of land if your army can pull it off without worrying about any repercussions other than horrible sanctions, but you could still do it. Yeah. I mean, that's the, that's the question, right? Is what is going to make this stop? And I know it's really fucking hard to have humility, but like we need, at this point, it's like there needs to be some urgent, urgent negotiations, an immediate ceasefire, and that has to mean giving Russia a concession. As horrible as that is to think that he could potentially take large swaths of Ukraine and, the sanctions are very, very bad, but at the same time, Russian oligarchs are not going to be hurt necessarily. It's really going to be the Russian people who are already very impoverished that are going to be felt abroad of these sanctions. And so that's what sanctions are intended to do. But yeah, I mean, are sanctions enough, right? And if they're not going to hurt Putin and his cabal, what are we really talking about here? But at the end of the day, and I just saw Noam Chomsky basically say the same thing, that like there needs to be a concession given to Putin to make him stop. And that means sitting down at the table and immediately figuring that out. And whether it's promising neutral status for Ukraine moving forward, I don't even know how we can go back to what we were talking about before the war started, because it's gone so far. And now it's going to be retribution. Now it's what, now it's revenge and retribution for the victims lost. And talking about like this Ukrainian child and the fact that so many children are refugees because the parents are not the parents, but the fathers are forced to stay and the mothers and children are now being forced to flee. This is what I'm talking about. My blood boils when I see dead kids, when I see mass graves, and when I see these kids that have no family, right? And Duncan, three kids every day, three babies have died every single day in 2022 in Afghanistan because of what Biden did. Biden stole billions of dollars from the regime that he knew would inevitably take over when they left. And he stole all the money. And because of this, all these babies are dying every day, 13,000 since the beginning of 2022. Oh, you mean, okay. We haven't seen one baby. I want to see these photos. It's like I'm just as outraged with the fact that my government is basically facilitating mass death of infants in Afghanistan as I am at Putin for allowing this to happen, for causing the deaths, the needless suffering of so many babies and kids and families. And like that's what I'm talking about. We need to apply our moral consistency. We need to have moral consistency and we need to have this outrage everywhere, everywhere. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Like anytime anyone casually suggests escalating a war between nuclear powers is a viable solution for peace, they should be shamed. Like it should be put in a straight jacket, put in a straight jacket, or, or, yeah, it's, yeah, it's two, it's number one, it's really easy to say that when you're not living there. And number two, a lot of these people saying that, you explain this to me, I asked you this in a podcast, a long time, I don't know if you remember. But like in the news, like, I think I asked you why the fuck does like Raytheon advertise on CNN? You know, like, what is that? Why, I'm not going to buy, what am I going to buy? A javelin or something? I don't understand. There's no Raytheon like shops around me though, where of, why are they advertising? Do you remember when we talked about that? And you told me it's like a display of power. It's like, we're here. But also, they're paying, seeing it, that means that the, you know, all the people working for CNN or Fox or whatever, they're getting paid by weapons manufacturers, meaning that it's not just like some random journalist who in their own mind is determined, well, the answer's a no fly zone. Right, it's like the conventional wisdom is an outgrowth of the subsidization of the corporate media from the defense industry. And that's a really important distinction. It's not that this is coming out of just nothing. Our culture is centered around militarization, because that is exactly what the system necessitates in order to have constant expansion. And that's really, if you take a huge bird's eye view, war is a permanent state because of capitalism. And as long, I mean, I personally think that capitalism underpins so many of these problems, and we can't even think about a future that isn't full of war without talking about a different economic structure, because when you are forced to expand, right, and that means that you are forced to expand territorially, and in order to accumulate more resources and extract more wealth, and that's imperialism. And that's imperialism. And we're talking about two competing capitalist countries. This has nothing to do with economic ideology in terms of communism versus capitalism. These are two competing capitalist countries that want more power. And that's where it gets really scary, because that's what happened before World War One. You know, World Wars can happen sometimes accidentally. It's when you have imperialist powers that are competing for more influence and control over the globe. And when those, like, when those butt heads, that's when it gets really dangerous. And that's where we are. That's where we are. Oh, God. Well, good night, everyone. Enjoy your night. Sleep tight. Sleep tight. Good night. Oh, fuck, that's so spooky. You got a little bit longer, Abby. I wanted that. Of course. Are you kidding me? Did you? Let's talk about drugs. Just kidding. No, let's talk. I know. No, no, next time. I want to, have you ever read The Demon and the Freezer? No, this sounds like a really wild book. It's a book about smallpox, weaponized smallpox. Oh, Lord. And how Russia was like, I mean, we are making it too. Like, this is before it became a war crime to use bio weapons. I don't, but, um, yeah, we were, we figured out a way to make smallpox even worse. And the Russians were doing it too. They were running it through, like, uh, I think pig livers that had somehow been inoculated or something against it so they could make like a Vax resistant smallpox, something like that. Been a while since I read the book, but it's a great book. The terrifying thing, the terrifying thing about it was not just the reality of how dangerous smallpox is because it's gone. We beat it. Right. We beat smallpox, but we don't, no one's vaccinate. Like, I don't think they vaccinate for it anymore. I don't even know because it's gone, but I could be wrong about that. But the part I remember is, if you took aerosolized smallpox and just threw it in the wind in New York City, it would kill so many people. Yeah. And Russia apparently had vast stores of this stuff that just disappeared with the collapse of the Soviet Union. No one knows where it went. We don't know where it is. You know, and so, uh, that's that when, you know, when they're talking about bio weapons and stuff, that's part of what they're talking about is that they might still have some of that stuff floating around and it doesn't take much and you can, and it's kind of like, it's not like you can trace a missile. Satellites will show where a missile is gone. You can't trace somebody blasting aerosolized smallpox, you know, downwind or in a western city or whatever, you know? So that's, I just, I wanted to add to, you know, I wanted to hear the Russia part on a happy note. You wanted to get like up the hysteria of one. Yeah, no, now I'm legitimately like, I just, yeah, I just pissed myself. No, I mean, my brother, Robbie Martin, did an incredible series on the smallpox lab, like theory of where all this material has gone. It's very trippy. Check it out on media roots radio if anyone wants to really do a deep dive on this, but it is, you're totally right. Like that material is still there and it's really creepy because and like a lot of bad actors can get their hands on it and it is largely untraceable. The fact that this material exists at all is startling. Like why do we have this? Like, you know, when we talk about like nuclear proliferation treaties and stuff like that, shouldn't there be like a, a treaty to like erase this material that could be stolen and used for malicious reasons? Like it's very scary, you know? It is. And I only mentioned it just because for, you know, the people who are calling for the no fly zones and like, you know, wanting to escalate, just understand this isn't like the thing you're wanting to escalate. It's not what you're used to. It's not what anyone wants. And it's way more than like it really could come here. I've seen so many stink pieces on corporate media of being like a nuclear war actually won't be that bad. Like we could actually survive a little, a little mini nuclear war. Like, oh, we actually have like really small nuclear weapons. It's like one hundredth of what we dropped on Hiroshima. Like that wouldn't be that bad. It's like, dude, yeah, I get that this is sponsored by Boeing, but like, who's writing this? Is this like an AI like churning out these like, like, is there a human being behind this? It's not a human being. It's a thing trapped in a, in a, in a fucking crystal. It's like some interdimensional being is like, look, we can do nukes. No, you can do little ones. They're cute. Selam is cute. Maybe like Mark in a child's toy. Baby nukes, you can put diaper, your baby nukes, get them used to the idea that these little ones are cute and the mushroom cloud is like kind of adorable. If you think about it, it's like, what the fuck? No, no nuclear weapons. No, don't bring up the possibility that this is one of the viable options. And fortunately, I think Abby, when that bullshit, when they tried that, it was met with such fury from everybody that they shut up. Did you notice that? They were like, let's see what they say if we kind of push the small scale and everyone's like, fuck you. Yeah, like they're just keep putting out trial balloons. They're like, okay, what about this? And it's like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, that, that shut them down. Thank God. We're, so we're not completely insane. All right, enough with the rush. I'm sorry. I just, you are an independent thinker, great journalist. And so, you know, I, I, it's nice to hear your take on things that helps me sort of center myself. Tell me, how's your art doing? Are you, are you still painting? Are you still creating? Yeah, man. Well, I just started, again, it's been hard because of my son. But like, yeah, I mean, I've been trying to do more abstract painting. I think for a while, I went to more, I scaled down a lot and was doing like these really tiny, really fucking dense collage work with paint pen and stuff like that. And it was really amazing. But now I'm trying to scale up and do like huge abstract acrylic pieces that I haven't done for like 10, 15 years. And it's just so fun. It's so fun because it's just a way, it's a total psych, it not only is like incredible psychedelic art, if I may say so myself, but it's a way to organize the chaos of my mind. And it's a way to channel all of my energy and depressive, you know, psychology into like something that I can make that's beautiful, like based on just the absolute insanity that I that I'm thinking all the time. So it's very meditative. And it's just a really important tool. And I really encourage everyone to explore art or music or something, because it's really necessary to tame your mind to be doing that kind of creative outlet. But check it out, abbeymartin.org. And that's why I'm super excited to do this new project, Duncan, because for the last ever since I left RT, like I feel like I'm just siloed off into like an information pit of despair, like really kind of dark energy. And I feel like I'm less multi dimensional, like I don't really talk to people like you, like artists, musicians, philosophers, like just people about different interesting things about, you know, our world that make us more complex. And I've just kind of done a lot of empire file stuff, which is great. And it's public education to make people care about issues or have a deeper understanding of them. But at the same time, I'm really excited to do this new project called Doast. That's just meant to be a totally different thing, a lot more light, and it's more entertainment based, you know, talking just about ideas and concepts and philosophies that have completely dosed my reality and I hope can change other people's understanding of the planet that we live on and the reality that we're experiencing day to day, because there's so many things that have like dosed the fuck out of me. I know it's a nod to psychedelics, but it could really mean anything. It's like learning that trees communicate through fungal networks, like that dosed me. I never have looked at forests the same way, you know, like just different things like that, that I'm really excited to explore and in this new project that I have that I'm actually having you on next week. I can't wait, you know, I love that idea too. And that to me, I think that is the hope. Like if you're if you're trying to find some kind of like realistic hope and all the stuff that's going on in the world, it isn't always bad from time to time, things appear on the scene that just change things for the better radically and quickly. You know, it might be a new way of looking at the world, it might just be, you know, what's going on with those fusion reactors, you know, a way to safely generate infinite energy or God knows, you got to talk to somebody about that new telescope that's out there. Like apparently what we're going to be seeing with that could be could dose the planet. Let's do it, dude. Yeah, let's do it. Well, that's great. I'm glad you're doing that. I think you're going to run into trouble though, because people like me, go to you to understand what the fuck's happening in the world. We're all freaked out. So all the people you're having on to talk about the mushrooms and this philosophy is everything like, Oh, is this World War three? I think you're going to have to set a rule. Like we can't talk about, we can't talk about it. Because the great thing about the dose thing is like it, I'm going back to like the coast to coast days where I really loved like live radio, you know, like that like now we're on the podcasting, which is great, but it's kind of a mix of both worlds because it allows viewers to call in the show and participate in a live discussion. But yeah, you're totally right. Like we're going to be talking about fucking like mushrooms and someone's going to be like, why won't you give Zelensky what he wants? Yeah, you're going to, yeah, you're really going to have to talk to tell us. No, like I can tell you just have to say, listen, if you want to like talk about the shit after the show, I will, you can have 10 minutes and ask me what your geopolitical questions, but we're going to talk about this now. I can't wait to do the show. I that's great. I'm excited. I don't know what we're going to end up talking about. But the more coast to coast, the better for me. I mean, shit, let's get in there. Deep underground military base, man. Denver Colorado, bro. The airport, man. The horse. Okay. Abby, thank you so much. Will you just let everybody know where they can find you? Absolutely. AbbyMartin.org is my artwork. Check out YouTube. Check out YouTube.com sound like a total fucking boomer. Check out Empire Files on YouTube on SoundCloud, all the podcast platforms. Check out Media Roots Radio on podcast stuff. And also our film, Gaza Fights for Freedom, is free to watch on our YouTube channel. And we're also working on a new film called Earth's Greatest Enemy. I should come on again and talk about that because that is crazy, man. It's about the US military's contribution to global pollution and climate change. Real fun stuff, but very important. And it's going to be a doozy. We've already traveled to Scotland. We went to Alaska. I confronted Nancy Pelosi about the issue at COP26. So there's going to be a lot of great footage, very important topic, and very important intervention in the environmental movement to push forward this consciousness of how US militarism contributes to this. Thank you so much, Duncan, for having on fucking rock. Sorry that it got mired down in the war stuff, but I wanted it to get mired down. I needed to talk about that. Thank you so much, everybody.

It would be willing to share with us the experience that you had with the care provided by SouthernCare Daphne. Do you have a moment to answer? Shit, that was crazy. That was my dad's hospice just called SouthernCare Hospice. They're amazing. Hospice is amazing, but SouthernCare Hospice is pretty cool. And they just call to check in on you to make sure you're doing okay. Because people just don't... Like in the West, we're so... Most of us, many of us in the West, we are so oblivious to death and especially to the effects it has on our psyche. It's like you don't even think about it. I didn't think about it. Like when I was... When I went to be with my dad, I wasn't thinking about the week after at all. I was just like, all right, I got to get down there. Got to make sure he's okay. Got to make sure he's comfortable. Got to make sure he's got care. Got to make sure that the forms are filled. There's a million stupid forms. And I just wasn't even thinking like, oh, the next... When you get back to LA, you know, you're going to be... You're going to be feeling it. I think a lot of people do that. So when I got back home, you know, I was... My wife had a friend staying over and we were all like... Oh, let's all go to a movie. And then like I hadn't even felt it. It hadn't even happened. And then bam, then just a grief wave, tsunami level grief wave. And it's like, you don't want to be a bad host by like breaking down a sobbing mess in front of your wife's guest. So I ended up, you know, mildly freaking out, getting in an Uber, going to a hotel, which is like, you have this stupid instinct. It's like a dog that wants to crawl under a porch or something. And then went to the hotel, melted down, just eating like, just like eating shit, eating just garbage from the wet bar. And then just shoving my face full of food and then laying down and then crying. And then like, just a mess, just a fucking mess, laying in the bathtub. And then suddenly, oh, I feel totally fine. That's how grief works. And right in the midst of recording this Southern care hospice was calling and that, you know, hospice workers are really like good. They know how to deal with bereaved people. So she's like, you know, this, everyone has a different grieving process, but sometimes people report starting crying and feeling like they can't stop. And then I was able to tell her, yeah, I know what you're talking about. That's definitely, I land in that category, but lately I've been okay. Don't worry about me, friends. I'm not, this isn't some kind of like sympathy call or anything like that. I'm just reporting in from the zone that I'm in right now. And it's a magical place. And that was one of the things Roshi Joan Halifax, this wonderful Zen Roshi said to me was, when you're grieving, it's like a window opens up, but we'll talk about this more with Jason Louvre. I'm not going to keep rambling about this now, but I'm sorry for those of you who are death adverse in the sense that this stuff feels like nails on a chalkboard. And I invite you not just because I'd like you to listen to the entirety of the podcast, but also I think you might find that like turning towards the fear and going in the direction of the thing you might be trying to avoid, you might find that it actually has the opposite effect than what you expected that instead of scaring you, it helps you potentially dispel a shadow that might have been following you around for a while. If you're someone who's been ignoring your own mortality, which is something I spent a long time doing. So that's it, man. We're going to jump right into this episode with Jason Louvre.

Friends, I have 2020 vision. I actually was studied by the CIA because I can look at Jupiter and other planets and see all the way through the atmosphere to the ground. I know about the technologies on Jupiter, thanks to my incredible eyes. But unfortunately, my wife's vision isn't military great to put it simply. So she has used SimpleContacts and she loves it because she doesn't have to go to the doctor to get a prescription. She can actually just go online to SimpleContacts and save the trouble. Here's how it works. Using your phone or computer, you can take the SimpleContacts vision test in five minutes from literally anywhere.

And if you have an unexpired prescription, just upload a photo of it or your doctor's info and order your lenses in minutes for a great price. They do all the hard work for you. And I've witnessed this happening and my wife continues to use SimpleContacts after the initial test to make sure it was something that I'd be able to advertise on this podcast.

And SimpleContacts is a wonderful way for you to save time and money and to get the identical contacts that you are already using. That's simplecontacts.com. I'm back in Los Angeles. My voice is back. If you missed the last episode with Annie Lamont, I'll bring you up to speed. My father passed away on the 12th and I blew out my voice because all the stress that was happening around that, which is what happens in this very strange culture that we are lucky enough to have incarnated in when somebody passes away. And I just got back into town, gashed my fucking finger, man. I was reaching into a box at my dad's apartment. And there was a piece of glass that I had placed there and forgotten. I was in a complete haze, which is what happens when you go into grief. I guess right after somebody dies, it's like, I don't know if grief is what it is. It's some kind of weird shock that you go into and shit gets so foggy and dreamlike. And it's like you're covered in bubble wrap. You don't know what's happening. Everybody's looking at you like, are you all right? And you're like, I'm fine. I'm totally fine, but you're not fine. But you feel fine because your body's produced some kind of, I don't know what it is, shock. I mean, it's like something definitely is released in your body to help you deal with it. It's got to be like that, right? Let's do a little bro science here. People have been dying for a long time. It's been really in fashion since I think people have existed to die. And that means that there's got to be some coping mechanism that's sort of burned into us to deal with losing someone from the tribe, the family, friendship circles. There's got to be something built into us. That's what they call grief. And there's all kinds of theories that I've been developing lately as I sort of float through grief land again. This is the second time my mom died in 2013. And it's a very similar experience. It's pretty much identical in form in the sense that you end up in this kind of like, sometimes you end up in this like mood that's too good. I don't want to call it manic, but you end up in this kind of like, I don't know how to put it, like you end up in this like sort of joyful bliss state. And that precedes the rationalization for the state. So in that joyful bliss state, I've been like, man, I must be happy because my dad had had a good death, let go of his body is now free of that form and can transition to the next incarnation. And then, but it's afterwards, you kind of feel like shit, I bet I'm making up a reason for feeling like this when maybe it's just some physiological reaction that's trying to balance out the other side of the coin, which is that you will get triggered by a memory, seeing something, the growing realization. It's like your mind begins to meter out this truth, which is that you're not going to see that person's body again. And you're not going to call that person again, and you're not going to hear that person's voice again in this incarnation. You'll see them in dreams, but you're not going to see the physical manifestation of that person ever again. And so that I mean, I can say it right now, and I'll almost start crying, but that pops into your head at random times. And then what that does is it just opens this faucet of grief, and then you start crying. And it's not normal like tears that you get. It's like you get sobbing tears. So, but this is the problem with it is that it happens randomly. You know, you can't predict it. There seems to be structurally some kind of physiological process that is deliberate and underneath the conscious mind when it comes to grief and all kinds of tricks you do to sort of avoid it. And I think that maybe is the if there's any control that you have over it is to whenever you get the chance to start crying, do it. If any of you out there dealing with this stuff, don't like push it back. Just like if there's a chance to start doing waterworks, do them. Fuck it. You're in a gelsons. Just do it. Fuck it. You're driving on the street. Just do it. Fuck it. You're sitting with your wonderful wife watching the shining and something makes you think about your dad. Cry. It's okay. Don't hold it in. I think that's pretty much all you can do is just try to not not cry. And and then that's it. Everything else your body is taking care of. I'm lucky because of my job. I'm able to like go full fucking crazy right now. So I haven't been outside that much. Yesterday I managed to shuffle to a bike shop and buy a bike because my other bike got stolen by some demon. It's a different podcast intro, but if you steal bikes, my God, my God. Oh my God. Better than a fucking millstone tied to a millstone was tied to your neck than to steal a bike. I just can't even I don't get that. That's a different thing altogether though. But I went and bought a bike because that has been an antidote in past times when I've been feeling low is to just ride my bike. And so I was pedaling around on my new bike and yeah, it definitely it definitely helps. But it's not going to it doesn't work. Nothing can work. No antidote. There's really no cure for grief. You don't want there to be if there was a cure for fucking grief. We'd be we'd be some kind of awful alien praying mantis species. You know, how sad would that be if the pharmaceutical companies started doing advertisements for this shit? Like, have you noticed random fits of sobbing when you think of a deceased relative? Do you find yourself walking around as though someone had painted your bones with titanium lead? Does it feel as if the gravity of the earth has been turned up? Are you foggy? Do you feel like maybe this universe isn't even real? Then you could be grieving. You're suffering from what doctors are calling. I think my fucking parents are dead syndrome and we've got a wonderful cure for that. Grief away. Grief X. They'd come up with a better name for it. Sorry. Off the cuff pharmaceutical commercials, whatever. It'd be some it'd be like they're not going to sit. They're not going to put grief in it. Like when they sell depression medication, they don't put depression. It's like depression X. It's so lazy. That's to fall out for. They call it like, you know, like ambient, you know, it helps you sleep. Ambient. It sounds like ambient lighting. Relaxing. Viagra. It sounds like vitality. So something that helps you stop grieving. It's going to like, it's going to be the opposite of grief. So it's like, it'd be like. Joidal. No, that sounds to you. That doesn't sound right. Joy. Joy. Joyara. Joyara. Try some joyara. It will help you stop grieving. Joyara, it will cover your chakras with a metaphysical tar and make it so that not only the feelings of grief, but all feelings related to the impermanence of the universe. Don't make it up to your brain. Your body will still feel them, but your brain will be free and clear. So yeah, it's a, it's also one of those things where, you know, there's actually, there's, there's a story and I cannot remember if this is a story of Buddhism or a Hare Krishna story or a Hindu story, but there's a story. I think it's a Buddhist story. I just can't remember. Maybe it's a Buddhist story. Who knows? These are all just stories. Anyway, make up our religion. Say it's a story for that. Make it a Superman story. Superman story for this, this case, but there's a story about Superman where Superman was in a village and there was a grieving woman who had lost her child and she was crying and crying. And Superman said to the, the woman said to Superman, can you, I don't know how to stop this pain. Is there anything you could do to make me stop weeping? And Superman said, well, there is something that can be done. And it's, it's a thing that you can eat. All you need to do is the main ingredient is a grain of rice. And I want you to go door to door through the village and surrounding villages. And when you find the villager who has never lost anyone in their life, get a grain of rice from them and cook a meal and eat it. And that grain of rice will make you no longer suffer. And obviously she goes from village door to village door and it begins to slowly realize that it is a universal phenomena that we lose our loved ones. And that her suffering was, is not isolated or suffering. She doesn't have to suffer alone. This is the other problem is that people are grieving. I'm lucky. I have a community. I'm friends with some hilarious comedians when I need like completely irreverent conversations about losing a father. And I'm also connected to people who have a lifetime of like, then a lifetime of spiritual work when I need to talk about the sorrow and then also have a great fucking therapist. So I'm, I'm lucky, but some, some of you out there, I think you, you carry your grief alone and that is not smart or good or that's not going to do much for you health wise. And it, and also you're sort of one of the things that happens is you start connecting with other people who have lost someone recently and you all start comforting each other and you can all just call and be like, holy fucking shit. Is this, is this happening to you? Are you feeling this? And they'll tell you like, yeah, I just, you know, took my dad's stuff to the goodwill. And I feel like I'm like destroying him, stuff like that. And you could say, no, you're not or whoa, holy shit, or just listen. It's better to just listen. The last two made up responses maybe aren't the best, but the best thing is just to do whatever it is that you feel like doing as long as the intention behind it is to comfort. So then this, this podcast that you're going to listen to today might, might make you slightly uncomfortable because it's about death and more than likely the next few podcasts are going to have something to do with death. And I know, man, you know, I was just at the last Ram Dass retreat, which was about death. And I was like, I felt like they were setting me on fire every time they talked about death. Because I guess I was not in close proc. I tricked myself into thinking I wasn't in close proximity to some imminent death, which is a really easy trick to pull on yourself. But now that it's happened and I'm sort of like in it and dealing with it and feeling it. I wish I could go back in time and like sit through that retreat again. But it makes sense, you know, like it makes sense to have an aversion towards what we think is extinction, especially if you have not quite worked out in your mind how you actually feel about what happens after we die. And I, you know, I spent probably the first half of my life being terrified of death. Not just like normal, like, whoa, I definitely wouldn't want to die today. Kind of, but like debt, like fucking freaked out. Like I would try not to think about it. I would try not to consider that my parents were going to die. I try not to consider that I was going to die. I would be so flipped the fuck out by it. And because of that, anytime I took a psychedelic, inevitably, I would think I was going to die. Invariably, I would feel like I would have a death trip, not in every time, but you know, one, I was like always rolling the dice, like, shit, I wonder if this is going to be the one where I think I'm going to die, man. And in those days of psychedelic use, I, nobody was calling LSD or psilocybin a healing medicine that I was around. I was just like, let's trip, man. Nobody had identified that marijuana and these psychoactive chemicals can are healing forces in the universe, at least around me. They had, I just didn't have the internet at that time. I'm old. I'm 44. We had the fucking West Henderson High School Public Library. And let me tell you what was not at the West Hendersonville Public Library in the 80s. The emperor wears no clothes. You're not going to find that book there. You're not going to find a book on shamanism, I don't think. And you're certainly not going to find a book related to the potential for psychedelics to heal people. So we were just taking them to get high. And then what would happen is the psychedelics would start doing their work, which is they start showing you things in the same way a great therapist shows you your blind spots. That's what a great, well, I don't know what I'm sure every therapist is different. But everybody has another way to put it. A great therapist helps you find your blind spots on your own. And in the same way, psychedelics, they like show you your blind spots. They show you the thing you've been trying to turn away from, whatever it is. And some people have been turning away from the fact that they were maybe abused. And some people have been turning away from the fact that they're actually not happy. And some people have been turning away from the fact that they're going to die. That's one of my main, in the past, one of my main turnaways. So I would take a psychedelic, I would get stoned, I would eat mushrooms, maybe take LSD. And suddenly I'd be like, oh my God, I'm going to die. My fucking body's going to die. I'd see skeletons in the walls, skulls undulating in the waving breathing walls. Or I'd be hovering above a cemetery watching as my parents put my coffin to the ground. Or I would imagine that I was having a heart attack. All of these various extinction fantasies would come over me. And then, because I was just a kid and didn't know anything about psychedelics, except that they were fucking fun and scary, I would try to control my mind. Because at the time I had no idea that I'd never heard the Jack Cornfield saying, your mind creates thoughts in the way the tongue salivates. So I still believed then that my thoughts were real and that I could control them. And so suddenly on a psychedelic, my mind started producing some thought. And especially if the thought had to do with death, then I would do the opposite of what you should do, which is I would desperately fight against that thought. And I would do anything I could to try to make the thought stop, try to distract myself, try to like, you know, there's so many dumb tricks. And then what would happen is, of course, the thing would amplify. The resistance would produce some kind of amplification effect. And then the next thing, I'm like deep in a bad trip, which I have been party to a few. And what was happening was just there was a sort of healing medicine inside of me that was trying to get me to face my fear, was trying to get me to face my own mortality, that was trying to get me to look into the fact that, as the flaming lips say, everyone that I know one day will die, including me. The including me, I don't think that's in the song. So, you know, half a lifetime spent, a little less than half a lifetime spent avoiding that truth. A lot of energy invested into coming up with tricks to avoid facing that reality, such as, maybe they'll invent a medicine. Maybe I'll upload my consciousness. Maybe I'll be able to get my head put on a fresh body. Maybe this reality is actually a dream and there really isn't a death. Maybe, you know, like when you get to the place where you're about to die, you just sort of come to and you're like young again. Lots of tricks I've played on myself to try to deal with something that is ultimately completely unknowable. We don't know. It is like when in the video game, where you get to the point in the horizon, depending on the video game, and you just, that's it. You're not going past that point. You know, there's just some shitty video games. It's just an invisible wall. You just hit it. That's it. And it can't go past there, at least with the character that you're playing. And that's the situation that we're all in. Like if we were in a simulation, death and the contemplation of death is one of the boundaries of the simulation. Once we get to it, once we get even close to it, we start feeling weird. And then if you face it full on, it's like you suddenly just, well, you can freak out until you surrender, not to death, but to the fact that you're not going to know for sure what's going to happen. You're not going to know. You don't know. We don't know. We can speculate. And today's podcast is an examination of one form of Buddhism's explanation of death, which is detailed in the Tibetan Book of the Dead. But ultimately, it's a big question mark. And there's no answer to it. So one wonderful tool that I've been using as I wonder where my father is now and how he's doing. And when I'm not looking through the lens of the bardo concept, which is that there's 49 days that the soul sort of works out karma and has the potential to transcend birth and death, which I really connect to that concept. And I think you'll hear as we, Jason and I sort of break this down that there's an obvious connection between the bardos and psychedelics. But one of the tools that I keep referring to comes from Roshi Joan Halifax. I would like to give a deep heartfelt thank you to all of my Patreon subscribers.

When I realized I didn't have an episode recorded for this week because of the turbulence in my existence, I called him up and he was willing to come over here after moving all day and record this stellar episode of the DTFH. I love chatting with this guy, whether it's on microphone or off microphone. He is a really brilliant human being. He's an occultist. He is an author who has written some amazing books, including most recently John D. The Empire of Angels, along with Generation Hex, the Ultra Culture, Culture Journal and Monsanto versus the world. He's also started a new podcast and I will have all the links you need to get to Jason Louvre.com at DuncanTrussell.com Until then, stretch your mycilial beams of metaphysical plasma into the bardo that connects all of us so that Jason Louvre and whatever temple, masonic lodge, church or mosque he happens to be meditating in can feel their sweet tickle. And welcome to the DuncanTrussell family, our podcast, Jason Louvre. Welcome upon you, that you are with us. Take care, no need to be blue. Welcome to you. It's the DuncanTrussell family. What that? You think that you need to restore dog painting? Oh my God. I love it too, man. And that freaking dog painting, it started off with a... I love that thing so much for so many different reasons, but one of the main reasons is when I bought it and took it home, I didn't even notice it on the back. They taped a little baggie that had a tuft of the dog's hair and the dog's chip implant. You know, that was someone's beloved dog and they had like saved a little bit of the dog's hair and like the thing that was in the GPS track, whatever the thing is, where if they find it, you know? So not only did the dog died, but clearly the owners had died. Because you know, you don't give away your precious dog picture with your sealed tuft of dog hair in it unless you've also died. That's why I love thrift stores. Jason Louvre, welcome to the DTFH. What's up? What's up? You know, like thrift stores are, you know, I was talking to guys, just so you know, Jason... I was texting Jason last night. I had a little bit of a podcast drought because as many of you know, my father passed away. I'm grieving right now. I'm a little fucking crazy. And because of that, I didn't... I suddenly just ran out of podcasts and I realized that like, oh my God, I need to start recording podcasts. And so I texted Jason and was like, can you do a podcast with me this week? It is I. I have returned. Hello, everyone in Duncan Trussell Universe. I love you all very, very deeply. And thank you so much for welcoming me back to this incredible space. And I'm happy to be back with Duncan in this shared universe with all of you. Jason, thank you so much, man. Like, Jason asked me, what do we want? What do you want to talk about? And I was like, death. Let's talk death. Because like, and I'll start with this, man, Roshi Joan Halifax said this beautiful thing to me after my mom died that I'll never forget, which is right now a window has opened for you. When someone you love dies, a window opens and it doesn't stay open. It shuts. In other words, the heartbreak that comes from death, or this is how I interpreted it, the heartbreak that comes from death opens up or connects you to the transcendent in a way that nothing else does. And in particular, what I've heard is that there is a certain number of days that a soul goes through these bardo realms in Tibetan Buddhism. That's right. 49 days. That's 49 or 39? 49. 49. 49 days. So can you just sort of walk me through the Tibetan book of the dead? Absolutely. So the bardo. Okay. The let's start from brass tacks, right? Enlightenment. So what is enlightenment? It depends on who you ask. If you ask the Buddhist, the Tibetan Buddhists, enlightenment is understanding that everything is empty and impermanent, right? So what do I mean by this? 2,500 years ago, excuse me, 2,500 years ago, or maybe it seems like 2,500, you know, it could have been yesterday. It's outside the circles of time. It doesn't matter when it happened, right? But in linear time, 2,500 years ago in Sarnath in India, the Buddha meditated under a tree for seven years to attain enlightenment. On his enlightenment, he realized something that nobody, at least in recorded history, had realized before, which is the true nature of the self. Prior to the Buddha, of course, meditation had been massively practiced all over the Indian subcontinent, and of course, all of the Indian yogis and the sadhus and all of them, right? They all have different techniques. Most of the Vedic techniques relate to focusing on shapes, focusing on Kundalini, parts of the spine, focusing on things, but moreover, largely rely on the metaphysics of the idea that there is a true self that can be attained or Atman, right, in Sanskrit. So the Atman, in Hindu magical thinking, is the core unbreakable is-ness of a being. That's Bhagavad Gita Chapter 2. It cannot be burnt, it cannot be cut, it cannot be withered by the wind, it is never coming to being, will never come into being. It does not exist, that thing, right? That's the one. So it's, if I were to describe Atman, it would be something like the fact of even existing at all, just the fact that this is happening, right? Similar to Kether in the Kabbalah, right, Godhead, right? But Indian metaphysics, Vedic metaphysics- Wait, hold on, I'm sorry. I did that thing, I'm very sorry. I did the thing where I go, okay, Kether in the Kabbalah, I don't- wait, describe it. Kether is that the very, that's the very top part of the tree of life. And so that's the sort of, what's the word, the monad, the- Yes, absolutely. Okay, so, okay, got it, got it. So it's the- The number one, right, the first saffron. So okay, so the Atman and the Kether, I thought there was a difference because is the, isn't the Atman differentiated? Like, isn't there like the individual soul, the Atman, and then the Pahra Atman, which is the- Ah, yes. Well, here we get into the fun thing of Vedic metaphysics, where it ultimately, when you chase Vedic metaphysics to there, as far as you can go, you get the answer, it depends on who you ask. Because India has this very interesting thing going on, where depending on who the local guru is, the local guru determines reality, and his might be different from the guy down the road. But in India, and in, you know, Veda Vedanta, or excuse me, Sanatana Dharma, there's kind of this understanding of truths can coexist. I call it multivalent truth. That's my word, my phrase for it, right? It's like, reality can be different, and that's okay. And that's why in India, for instance, there are more religions in India than the rest of the world put together. Right. Right. So, and that's why Hinduism has survived for so long, because it's not actually a belief system, and it just absorbs whatever comes at it. It's like, so the Christian missionaries, it's like, oh, you worship, you know, the Jesus Deva, right? Or Islam, things like this. Hinduism is very good at absorbing. It's not just absorbing, it's not exactly absorbing other faiths, it's seeing the truth in them, right? There's the verse in the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna is saying, whatever you have faith in there, I will be. It's something along those lines, so I don't remember the exact, I don't have it memorized. It's something on the lines of, you know, if you, that thing that you're devoted to, what you're devoted to, that's God. You're, if like, I am so merciful, then instead of making you find me, I will be inside of everything you love. And but I'm not going to be like, hey, it's me, God, here in the fucking PlayStation. Right. I'm just going to let you connect in this way right now until you, you know, over the course of millions and millions of incarnations begin to realize, wait a minute, it's not the PlayStation. Right. It's something, there seems to be something behind the PlayStation, something behind the muscle car. There's something behind the dollar. Well this is animism, right, which is close to shamanism. But Hinduism and Sanatana Dharma in specifically is that, right? It's the recognition that everything is God and it's, everything's okay because everything is God. Yeah. Right. Now, the further we get into this conversation, the further we stray into delusion. Oh yeah? Help me. Help me. Yeah. How's that? So here's, here's where Buddhism comes in. So the Atman, right? The idea that there is a core self or a God or a true self or a true divinity and of course in Hinduism, the idea is that there are many, you know, every conscious being in a sense is, you know, has an Atman and Atman equals Brahman. So the God in everything is equal to the God of everything. Right. Yes. It's like everything is God. Yes. The enlightenment of the Buddha under the Bodhi tree in Sarnath, he sees through this. He sees through the whole game. Yeah. So yeah, if you look at any of the religions in the world, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, all that, they all posit the monad. They all posit that there is some type of divine oneness, one taste, as they say. Yeah. The Buddha realizes you've all been looking for something that doesn't exist. All these yogis have been sitting all over India, trying to focus on Tatvas or images or doing pujas, rituals and or focusing on Kundalini, things like this. And none of this is real. It's all fabrication. Why is it not real? It's not real because they're looking for essence, right? They're looking for something that is essentially true. So here's what the Buddha realizes. There is no such thing as a true self. There's no core of any being. The Atman does not exist. It's Santa Claus. Why is this? Now, this I feel is like the discovery of quantum physics or something. It's a gigantic leap or the discovery of, of what do they call that, you know, fractional reserve banking or, or, you know, maybe the theory of relativity, right? It's a discovery in spirituality, regardless of whatever sector, you know, religious thinking. It's not about religions. It's a discovery in the field of consciousness that is a massive quantum leap for humanity and that we're still struggling to catch up with centuries, millennia later. Basically, what he says is this, and by the way, the whole of Western philosophy since the 1700s, since Hume and Berkeley and Western philosophy is still struggling to catch up with this, right? What the Buddha realized 2,500 years ago. So he realizes that the, there's no core self. What there is, is interconnections between beings, right? There's no. That's called interdependency. Exactly. Yeah. And I think I've said this on your podcast before, but, you know, we're having this moment where we're talking, but this moment would not be happening if we were not both here discussing it and everyone listening out in the multiverses was not here listening to this, right? Without you, the listener and you Duncan, the host and the millions of people potentially, you know, who, who could hear this, this moment would not exist. Therefore, it's not a function like I'm talking right now, but this is not a function of some essential core, Jason, right? I'm playing a role right now. The role is determined by the network, right? Yeah. Does it make sense? Absolutely. Well, it, it, it, yes, it does make sense. It's like the, it kind of reminds me of the jeweled net of Indra or the, you know, we're all being rippled. We're ripples. We're being rippled. And that the, like, I guess the one cool way I've heard it described, Jack cornfield talks about this. He says, um, you know, some Buddhist monk was meditating and having all these crazy experiences, he's becoming telepathic, he could levitate, whatever, you know, he's setting tigers on fire. I don't know if that's true. I'm adding that on. He's got powers. He goes to this master and he says, he's describing like, man, I've been like, dude, I'm setting tigers on fire now. That's how fucking powerful I'm like, I'm having visions. I'm seeing the, the, I'm seeing the entities. I'm seeing, I'm seeing the, the gods. I talked to Indra and the master said to him, oh, that's great, but you've, you've missed the, you missed the mark here a little bit because the question isn't like, what's happening? The question is, who is it happening to? And that seems to be the, uh, one of the questions that is, is answered in Buddhism in a way that for an individualist can be infuriated, deeply unsettling, terrifying. Yeah. Right. So, so Indra's net, right? So let's talk about Indra's net. So the Hindu concept of Indra's net is that all the consciousnesses in the world are connected in like this giant, imagine like a, you know, a blue lit up blockchain type pattern connecting the all consciousnesses. The Hindu view on this is that it's the nodes that are important, right? So you get a giant, just imagine a giant net, like a glowing blue net in infinity and the points on the net, the connections between the lines, those are consciousnesses, right? Those are Ottmann's. Yes. Well, those are, those are, you know, the Ottmann is conscious. It is consciousness and it, each individual consciousness is God. Yes. And in its own way is the totality. It's the soul of a butterfly, the soul of a caterpillar, the soul of a, of a, I don't know, like a single celled organism, a bacteria to the soul of like the Dalai Lama to the soul of some as of yet uncontacted, hyper entire, all through the God, the gods themselves. Yes. Like every soul is like sort of like photons coming out of the sun. And, and so yeah, okay. Right. This is the Hindu theory. Yes. So the Buddha looks at Indra's net and it's basically the same topography, but he says it's not the nodes, it's the connections. The nodes are an optical illusion created by the network. You only have the illusion that you're a separate self because it's a point you're a point of at which a network converges. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. We think that we are, we think we exist and therefore we suffer, right? But we think that there's something essentially true about reality, but there's not. The important distinction here also is this is not nihilism. It's not nothing is real. It's that everything is empty of inherent quality, meaning not, not essentialism. There's no essential one true Duncan. There's no essential one true Jason. Right. There's no essence of anything. There's no monad. There's only infinite connection. Right. Now this is spiritual maturity in my opinion. Right. Yeah. So the, the Tibetan Buddha is called as the clear light, the perception of the primary clear light, understanding the essential non-existence of everything. Now to ground this in, in my life, you know, the way that I've experienced this is on DMT. Right. So December 21st, 2012, I did a tremendous amount of DMT while engaged in sexual antics with multiple people. Wow. Cause what do you do on December 21st, 2012? You got to go out with it. You got to, you got to go out in style. You know, It comes on DMT. I've never tried that. I didn't even know that was a thing. It's tricky. It's, it's actually, well, you can't quite do them at the same time. Yeah. I mean, it seems real. But I guess like, yeah, I guess it's man. That's, I don't know how like the last thing I'm thinking when I'm on DMT is about sex, you know, cause it's so, you're so pulled into this. Whoa. What is that like? Well, you don't have consciousness of your body anymore. So basically the sex part stops during the DMT experience, but, you know, in between you're having sex, it's more about the environment in which the DMT is experienced. Right? So it's like you are, it's some like DMT orgy or something. That's, yeah. Yeah. We'll go with that. Why not? You're ready for the apocalypse, man. I'm me. It's 2012. What are you going to do? You think the world was going to end? I was just, I just wanted to show up and see what happened, you know, it's like, so New York, you know, looking out over the skyline. But in the DMT space, I had the experience of perceiving the fundamental emptiness of everything. And I described it recently in a podcast I did with Bailey J as nothingness, but shining. And what I realized was the self obviously doesn't exist, but the self is also a burden and is a source of suffering. The French call the orgasm, the little death, right? But what I realized in the DMT trip is that death is actually the big orgasm, right? The relinquishing of a self. The relinquishing of the idea that you have an individual self is the ultimate orgasm. It's the perception of emptiness and the fundamental clear light of existence, right? Oh, if there's nobody there to suffer, there's no suffering, right? It's an optical illusion. Yeah. Now, let's take this out of my wacky life and back to 2500 years ago. The Buddha had this insight. This was his enlightenment. And of course, this drove everyone in India crazy because it was heretical, Buddhism is a Hindu heresy. But yeah. And in fact, you know what? Let me tell you, let me just add to that. I've spoken with, you know, and when I say it, this is not all Hare Krishna's, it's not all people who are into into Vaishnaiva Bhakti Yoga. But you know, like all religion and Vaishnaiva Bhakti Yoga is the name for ISKCON, which is the Hare Krishna movement. And ISKCON is one branch of Vaishnaiva Bhakti Yoga, which has many branches. But I can, I remember speaking with a member of ISKCON, maybe listening to us, a talk they were giving, and they were saying, Buddhism is spiritual suicide. And I believe I can't write, they have a name for it, my, my avadi or something. There's a name for the Buddhist. It's it and it's a, not it's not good. It's not good, but it was essentially, it's like that by, by allowing yourself to be, this is just to underline what you're saying here about there being a stigma in some branches of Hinduism, not all of them, in some branches of Hinduism. And also in, in, in the branches tend to be fundamentalists, like the, what I love about the Ramadas retreats that I go to is that here we have, and I'm one of them, devotees of Nirm Kurali Baba, we have Bhakti Yoga, we have Bhakti's there. And then we have matter, the Bhakti, Bhakti love can, like that I want to be a soul so I can love you. I want to be an identity so I can connect to you from my specific Atman to your Atman. And yeah, sure, it's a fucking impermanent web that maybe we'll be over a millennia of disassociating, but right now this is love, man, and I want it. So he takes that, and he takes people who are very good at articulating Bhakti Yoga and way better than what I just did, and he throws them in with like Zen Buddhists, like Roshi Joan Halifax. He puts them on stage together. You know, Robert Thurman, you know, he puts Robert Thurman, Ramadas is on stage with Robert Thurman at the last retreat, which was about that. And what I loved about it is Robert Thurman gets on stage and he sets up the first thing out of his mouth as they're introducing him for the first other treat. He's like, I cannot do a Robert Thurman and Bob Thurman approach. I love that guy. But he's like, be here now. What does that even mean? He's like, practice, practice, practice. Everyone's talking about practicing, practicing, practicing. He's like, I'd like to see somebody play for once, right at the beginning of the retreat. Just punch, like cutting through all the like congealed nonsense and like trying to find the pure, like, isness. So anyway, what I'm saying is yes, in Hinduism, some forms of Hinduism, Buddhism is stigmatized. But certainly not all forms and bringing the two together and watching the way they interact is one of the most hilarious, hilarious sweet things, especially when on both sides, there's love. Right. So, continue. Yeah. And these are games that have been played for thousands of years. And remember, I mean, I started my spiritual training, not started, but you know, I trained as a Shaman in Nepal and the Nepalese merged them both, right? Hinduism and Buddhism are seen as create this like psychedelic Megazord. Oh, what? And like a, like a, or what's that called in power rangers? Oh, okay. Cool. And I mean, I'm glad it's power rangers that I was praying that you had just added to my lexicon of some fucking new spiritual term called Megazord. Power Rangers. Yeah. It's not Sanskrit. Um, so 2,500 years ago, uh, people start practicing Buddhist techniques and people start waking up out of the dream of their individual suffering all over Northeastern India. Oh, I thought that I was a suffering woman whose child had died and that I would be in that utter grief for all exists, you know, the rest of my life and that there would be nothing but grief and suffering and sit down and meditate for 10 days. You know, Vipassana is a good way to do it. Sure. And, and Buddhist meditation is you're not trying to get anywhere. You're just sitting with yourself. That's it. That's it. You're not imagining God's. You're not focusing on trying to become something that you're not. You're not trying to, you know, become more pure. You're not trying to become more spiritual. You're just sitting with the feeling, the feeling that you try to get away from all damn day long, right? Whether it's through Xbox or what, you know, drugs, whatever, you know, work, you know, drama, interpersonal drama. That's a big one. Whatever it is that you do to get away from the feeling. The Buddhist meditation is sitting with the feeling until you notice that the feeling is changing of its own accord and the fundamental nature of everything is changed and is impermanent and is emptiness. And the whole dream of your life that you thought was real was just a dream until you wake up and say, Oh yeah, I thought I was a woman whose child is died and everything was suffering, but it was just a dream. And now I'm awake and people all over North Eastern India started doing this until the whole damn mass of North Eastern India was awake, right? That's the first turning of the Dharma. Things got crazier from there, historically speaking, because then we got the Muslim incursions into India and there was, you know, the Mughal invasions and things like that. The history is insane. It kind of makes me think of like, it's like this like very, very long virtual reality experience that had been going on so long people forgot they were doing virtual reality. And then all of a sudden a huge swath of the player characters began to realize like, wait a minute, wait a minute, I'm not sure that actually, wait, hold on, wait, I'm not actually Kratos the god of war. Hold on a second. Wait a minute. Wait, who's playing this? Like, wait, he's pushing the buttons on this thing. Wait, what am I really? And then there's that popping out. I like to think of it as some kind of, that we're some kind of, it's like, it's like we're these amnesic spiritual amphibians that like, you know, pop in here and when we pop in, we assume an identity and when we pop out, we, this is what I used to think actually. So, you know, I was having a conversation with a friend of mine and he was using the term over there and I used to use that term to the spirit world over there. It's like, there's a place. There's like a, some perimeter, you cross the veil, you pass through the veil, there's the spirit world or there's the whatever the fit. These days, I've been thinking more in terms of, and I said this to another friend and he said, don't call it a meat snorkel, but I've been thinking in terms of meat. So it's like, it sounds like a dick, but I've been thinking in terms of a meat snorkel, which is that we're this appendage that is protruding into matter and in the way that a snorkel like sticks into the air so that you can like exist for a little bit of time under the sea, you know. And similarly, we've like protruded into this realm and we like have this experience, but we start thinking we're the fucking snorkel, right? That's in fact part of the experience. You think you're the snorkel, you forget there's this thing underneath, I guess a better way to put it would be, you have the mushroom that grows from the mycelial network, you know, or there's a million different ways of expressing this very temporary thing that seems to have with it a bunch of qualities and one of the qualities are identification with the self, identification with the body, identification with the mind, identification with the thoughts and an amnesic state or an inability to access the matrix of emptiness, whatever you want to call it, the network, the grid, the singularity, the whatever sources some say, the monad, not an inability, but some difficulty because of our fixation on the self. Well, let's take the meat snorkel, right? I mean, let's let's go with that one, meat snorkel, who took my meat snorkel, the worst snorkel, that's a good good metaphor is any work like I don't I'm sorry, I'm not going to go on a fucking weird stupid tributary, but like, if you took like a big chunk of sausage and baked it and then like drill the hole through it and formed a snorkel, you theoretically could swim around sucking air through salty meat. Fucking horrible. I love coming to Duncan's house. It's great here. How pissed would you be if you're swimming you look over and there's just a fucking salami sticking out of the water and some assholes like just the whole fucking the air just stinks of pepperoni and coral reef. I like the phrase pork snorkel that sounds got a certain ring to it. Pork snorkel, the worst invention ever made. And now a quick word from our sacred sponsor.

I don't want to I don't want to porkle I want to so go ahead man sorry a porkle we're porkles. So we're we're misidentifying right we have a case of mistaken identity we're here in this whatever this experience is we think it's real and we think that we are somehow inherently real and it's a case of mistaken identity. So this is the Buddhist perspective at least. So from this perspective let's consider spiritual practice whether that's Hindu spiritual practice magic hermeticism Sufism Islam any of these things right any spiritual practice that's like trying to get to something I'm going to become more spiritual I'm going to become more loving I'm going to become more this I'm going to become different I'm a and I want to be it be and I'm going to make some change and I'm growing or gaining I'm getting points somehow I'm changing Buddhist perspective is dude you're grinding in World of Warcraft that's a great step the fuck away from the computer wake up it's just a game you're fucking grinding in World of Warcraft you're trying all these spiritual practices are you're trying to add experience points to a character that doesn't fucking exist you forgot that you're playing a game dude you're dehydrated drink some water you've been playing this freaking game for like 20 hours straight to the point that you forgot it was a game you're fucking harvesting that's what they're called I just remember at some point my World of Warcraft addiction it's so funny dude I can remember being so addicted to World of Warcraft I'm fucking did you play World of Warcraft Jason a little bit I did have a massive Starcraft addiction okay which I think we have in common let me just look this up in World of Warcraft there is an actual economy right yeah fucking Arcanite for sure and like and you can like like basically use a skill called alchemy to form various oh yeah yeah I remember this yeah so like and I don't know what it's like now because I haven't played in a while I'm afraid to even even look it up I just wanted to make sure Arcanite was a thing but I don't even look at it in the way like a crackhead doesn't even want to look at sugar I don't even want to like come close to it but the you can like you end up like harvesting sort of what's it called components you know for some weird alchemical metallurgy I guess I don't remember it's been a long time but you could essentially produce Arcanite bars I think and the Arcanite at one point was it was an economy man and the Arcanite would go up it would go down and you could sell that fucking Arcanite for um for gold and you could use that gold to buy cool shit and like you're like you're out there you're you're if you're me you're it's like 4am and you've been just like you're you're warlock undead warlock death rack has been creeping through this swamp or that place or this place just to try to gather the necessary components to fuse together to make the fucking Arcanite bars and sell the fucking Arcanite bars or trade them for this thing or that thing I can't remember but yeah like at some point it's like you merge with death rack you merge with the warlock you're not even dunking anymore you're not a fucking dunking you're a fucking death you're literally undead you're in the swamp and doesn't that make the game so much better right like that's kind of the idea of the game right to merge or even let's say even watching a movie you it's suspension disbelief why are we building these crazy virtual reality rings we want our virtual realities to be as real as possible now they're gonna have magic leap all this stuff it's like we want to be that's like the great quest of media to have an experience so powerful and overwhelming and artistically satisfying that you forget that it's not real we want to repeat what's already happened it's not enough that we we're in our bodies and we've identified with this player character we want to continue pushing into the simulation it's like whereas buddhism is pulling out it's like we've got virtual reality goggles on and we're in a game and now we want to put on another set of virtual reality goggles and then not only do we want to put that on but then we want to add to that another augmented reality thing and then another so this is like um uh this this kind of like infinite is ingress throughout an infinite pushing into matter yes time and infinite and and in that kind of pushing in a matter in time we're desperately trying to avoid taking off the virtual reality goggles we're why are we desperately trying to avoid it because we don't want to feel that feeling what feeling the feeling i am as i am right the feeling of everything that you do the addiction the addiction to maya is to not feel your inherent suffering yeah right because it sucks to have a body it hurts the fact that we live in the fact that everything is impermanent is a cause of suffering old age sickness and disease and death yeah right everything we live in a universe in which time exists and therefore everything will disintegrate and be gone and the suffering of that is unbearable yeah it's not is it bearable it's bearable i mean if it was unbearable we wouldn't be bearing it we're bearing it right now we're just pretending we're not right isn't that the idea like the idea is it's like so here we this is this is like all right here's what we got suffering right and so you're fucking suffering man i'm suffering this is duke wobbly wheel wobbly wheel is how i've heard it is the basically the way i've heard it described is this the way i've heard it described i'm not even mysterious about it my meditation teacher david nick turn told me wobbly wheel so it's like uh you're riding your bike and one of the wheels is a little deflated right and and so it's not going to be a great ride you're gonna ride your bike it's not gonna be a great ride i was actually i just praise god i got a new bike today because some demonic fuck stole my bike such bad karma such bad karma um bike theft and they were inflating the tires and i was thinking of duke because because my teacher like uses this great comparison and the you know he's like you know what you keep it between i can't remember i always forget the psi as soon as i fucking walk out he's like 70 80 50 so keep it between this area it's going to be a rough ride so the psi of this universe that we're in or the experience itself it's at the wrong psi so to speak it's wobbly wheel which means that there is a fundamental wobble in everything every single thing it's just always a little off and the suffering this is how i've come to understand it which means it's probably wrong but right now this is where i'm at the suffering is coming from would be like me on a bike with a fucking deflated wheel pedaling around having this shitty ride and thinking to myself like well maybe if i like maybe if i fucking turn the switch this gear this gear that gear this thing or this will make it better this will make it better this i'm expecting the fucking thing to not be wobbly anymore the analogy is rotten because like i could just fill the fucking wheel up with air right but in this situation it's like well you have to surrender to the fact that it's not going to it's really not going to work out and which is why i love when my teacher started teaching me the first thing he said is i really i want you to know this and chogym trompa rempache my teacher said to me and he meant this he meant this and i'm feeling you right yeah he meant this this is hopeless this is hopeless yes i see i'm at the part of my life now where where that's a relief i've gotten past the part where like i'm in a disney movie where hope is like you know chipmunks singing about like no hope tortures your fucking ass hopelessness now the hopelessness sounds really rotten when you if you haven't really explored just how much you've been using hope as a flog a flog you just been fucking whipping your back with hope just beat yourself up with hope now one fucking second you let yourself be hopeless let go hope let go what a great place to be let go the game is not winnable right so here's grudge have called this the terror of the situation by the way really the terror of the situation the terror of the situation hopelessness you mean the first podcast i did with you and i told the story about the vision i had of the inherent suffering of all existence right oh yes yes yes as a hell realm yes that's probably an over overly dramatic way of putting it but here's the deal it's just a game right everything changes everything is impermanent everything is shifting and this whole story you've constructed about this person that you think you are the the voice in your head that tells you it's a real thing it's a person that voice that sits in your head nini nini nini nini nini the one that that speaks to you and convinces you that it's you that speaks to you with your voice that speaks to you with your name yeah that you think is you is not you it's just a delusion yeah that's good it's just it's it's um the fundamental nature of reality is emptiness it is empty of inherent meaning and then of course that means that any meaning whatever can be constructed from it it's it's infinite chaos in a way in the best in my most creative sense yeah but the buddhist perception is when you think the game is real you suffer right if you've if you've identified with your world of warcraft character and then your world of warcraft character gets nerfed you suffer because you think it's real yeah right right now now this point is important this is something wrong that talks about and i it's important so you and i sit down and play a game of fucking monopoly you know i do not want you jason live every time we roll the dice to be like you know this is just a game Duncan it's not real i want you to be like i'm gonna take your money right bitch and i and i went out because that's how you play monopoly right monopoly is not meant to be played in some kind of like monopoly is a is a vengeful game which is obviously one of the most hilarious critiques of capitalism in existence that nobody got it was actually created by socialists right it's hilarious so it's really and and and it like just naturally turns everyone playing into like either cheaters deal dated they every everybody turns into like we're like everyone's like looking at like Donald Trump like oh my god i can't talk about life this is like what are you talking about it's like it really is it's like someone pulling a fish out of the ocean i mean like oh my goodness gracious i can't believe how wet this fish is what you fucking think it's a fish right it's funny how nobody got the the point of that game the point is it's like yeah yeah the point is to demonstrate that the game is rigged and this is kind of the buddhist critique right it's like addiction right addiction is a great metaphor oh wait i'm sorry let me sorry i'm gonna dive i'm sorry very quickly i'll finish the point my point is this one level rigged game that's okay too that's okay rigged game okay suffering okay world of warcraft okay death rack addiction okay that's the thing because if we're applying if we're if we're saying not okay to this thing that we're in right now then we've applied meaning to you know what i mean so it's a perfect not okay i guess well everything is perfect right this is my this is this is my perception the universe you know matter matter energy space time as they say you know everything is perfect the universe is constantly fulfilling it is like the god is constantly fulfilling our every desire like everything is there everything is manifested everything you know what all kinds of experiences my god you know just since you were born how many insanely colorful psychedelic incredible experiences have you had just being alive awesome it's the ultimate drug it's the ultimate addiction existence right maya samsara addiction yes addiction oh i just want to see what happens next i just want to see what happens next i just want to see what happens next and on and on and on into infinity yeah right but it's all inherently meaningless it's just a fucking trip it's just a light show sure but it's fun this is that this is this is that this is like what i mean and god forgive me all ramdas people listening i you know this is my own interpretation but this is what i love about these retreats is that this conversation we're having right now it happens and on one side you've got yes i love it it's great or what ramdas does is he goes he goes yum yum yum yum yum which is actually a mantra by the way and um yummy yummy it's good it's um you know and i'm speaking that's one of the chakras i can't remember which one it's a chakra and there's a sound yeah but i um you know having now lost both my parents and grieving it's still like you know this place that we're in right now it's really quite delicious it's like it is a game that's right it is a game for sure and by getting all serious about the fucking game and being like you know if i'm playing monopoly with you with you jason and i want you to take it seriously and i would really love to like watch your like the the in fact someday we should because i would like to watch your the the character that you play as you're oh i have a ruthless strategy to complete i can ruin any monopoly game really because i i hacked the monopoly right i figured out how i i'm not going to give away the secret but there's a way to completely destroy the game already mad at you but but think about it this way like why you why do people find real spiritual practitioners annoying right like or for instance i mean let's not get over dramatic but the whole thing of okay like christ was crucified right it's like spiritual practitioners are fucking dicks they're dicks why are they dicks because they're basically running around like imagine like eight people are playing monopoly and then jimmy shows up and is like this is a game stop playing this game and just starts like hitting the pieces these aren't real what are you doing hey why did you guys crucify jimmy okay well we are playing fucking monopoly and this son of a bitch is coming around like trying to give all the pieces away and play i don't know it's a different game it's like dude we know it's a game like just like don't you wrote your great it's i actually another world of warcraft metaphor griefing you know the phrase griefing yeah of course so griefing it's like spiritual practitioners you know it's like we grief people we fuck with people's games till they wake up this is crazy wisdom there is a verse in the Bhagavad Gita which says do not disturb them there it's in there it says don't fuck with them they're asleep don't be a dick it's like so so you know you see somebody sleeping for example my wonderful beautiful pregnant wife she can sleep late she's pregnant she i think she could sleep till like 10 sometimes if like i can't do that anymore i got a 44 year old's brain i got a 44 year old's pickled burr big my brain just got burrs and cat it's like i'm gonna wake up early i'm gonna wake up at like six or seven and that's fine with me i'm okay with it i accept it i like the morning ps but me waking up at that time man to then like fucking like wake my wife up hey wake up erin time to get up i'm up don't you want to see the beautiful bonding don't realize how beautiful bony is god the sanctimonious the sanctimoniousness of a fucking morning person talk about crucifying fuck crucify crucify a morning person fresh dew on the flowers and the prawnas of the bitch fuck you i want to sleep like the night it's okay right or like somebody running into a movie theater screaming you know you're just watching a movie yeah yeah exactly like we so so there's a a certain level of etiquette which is that if you find yourself waking up and this is of course one of the neophyte uh phases a neophyte who's just barely starts waking up will start immediately i've done it certainly and and and that's one of the and and and and then but then as it progresses what ends up happening is you find your satsang which is like people who are waking up and want to oh yes people playing the game i'm waking up but not actually waking up okay that's a good one that would that would the we're pretending to wake up game that's enough that's very chogym trump of you and that and that's a that's a i think that's a phase of it but for sure man because of the quality of existence here we need a community around us of you know and and like and even if you are you you at least need to be around people who can say to you hey wait wait a minute are we playing the game of waking up are we waking the fuck up what's happening here what's going on here what is it are we doing that thing we're like pretending we have or not that's good because my experience with it where i'm at right now is that you kind of wake up and go back to sleep you know there's a there's a there does seem to be a a process happening you know and the process is um oh my god i'm gonna quote the grateful dead sometimes the lights all shining on me other times i can barely see you know that's it lately it occurs to me what a log i have a bad voice straight trip it's bad but the point is like sometimes you're up sometimes you're not and what i what i love is that when i fall asleep i've i'm lucky enough to have teachers who like let me you know all right go back to bed you want to go back to bed go back to bed and in fact one of the coolest my first contact with Ahari Krishna's was with this um wonderful devotee named Bada Hari Das and he had a student a friend my brother and i were meeting him and he was going to read the Bhagavad Gita to us and the it's this devotee had not woken up he was asleep and i remember like my brother's like where i can't remember who it was i don't remember which devotee's name he was he's like where is where is this devotee and Bada Hari Das is like oh he's sleeping if people are sleeping we should let them sleep and i thought ah that's so fucking cool that's so fucking cool i'm asleep even if they were awake before let them go back to sleep now we get Mahayana Buddhism oh you mean like pure land Buddhism or what do you know so this works what you've just described as a perfectly functional framework you let people wake up if they want to wake up it's okay it's really great to hang out with other people who are awake it's okay to go back to sleep in fact in fact everything's pretty much okay now Mahayana Buddhism Bodhisattva vow i will continue to reincarnate until all sentient beings are liberated from suffering and the causes of suffering yeah right everyone has to wake up and i will continue to keep reincarnating to grief these motherfuckers until they're all awake grief that is now this is not the right word i don't think it's grief i think i think that i think this is a misinterpret skillful means a pya skillful means like skillful means yeah because because yeah it's like uh it's um but yeah that is the body that is it and i love i i think that concept so beautiful you know i i i'm still you know a friend of mine once gave me what i considered to be a very great compliment and he said to me you love it here and i do i like i like this place i like it i like this zone you know it's cool man i like this little like whatever this is it's pretty cool i know it's impermanent i'm not attached to it i'm not afraid to die anymore i used to be terrified but uh it's it's wonderful here right now you know and and um um i love loving people i'm more boxy than uh but i'm also i love buddhism too but i'm more i'm i'm jnana in case you haven't guessed yet you know i i hadn't guessed i was wondering mental yeah but yeah i mean look human life is the most precious thing in the universe really right because in the sense that it's the best game to play of all the games in the universe uh that you could play being a conscious at least semi-conscious at least semi-conscious person during in a human incarnation during a time of pretty amazing economic well-being and ability to have incredible human experiences whatever one thinks of whatever political turmoil happened appears to be happening which is really kind of minor in the grand scheme of things if you look at history it's like a fucking fart in the wind if you look even 400 years ago so um yeah people who are it's sorry not to cut you off people are angry about people who are upset about trump or are upset about people are upset about trump seem to have forgotten their bodies are aging you know what i mean it's like dude why don't we fuck what you need to be worrying about the fact you're going to get old what about that have you thought about that yet you're gonna get old your bodies are gonna get wrinkly and withered and you're gonna shit your pants pretty soon like in your upset about the president the people who are freaking out about and yes trump is is awful but the then why are you wearing a maga hat right now i'm wearing a fascia haircut uh no no no no what was my oh so the people the whole trump thing right um it kind of reminds me of people who are tripping and think that it's going to last forever you're like oh my god it's going to be like this forever i'm having such a horrible trip it's like everything changes everything's impermanent everything like will slowly change right unless a fascist dictatorship happens a good lot it's like the their fear is that though like so it's it's on both sides the terror is this one side deep state takes out trump installs spokesperson for military industrial complex slash satanism slash some kind of like like underground like i don't know like fucking you know it's all the q and on shit like some like dark like hollywood like perversion and uh and that they're gonna kick trump out so that they can install someone who is more connected to malloc that's one side coup the other side you gotta do this you gotta do this in alex jones voice uh oh they're gonna they're gonna okay i'll try it's uh they're they're they're they'll they'll worship a fucking owl fucking goddamn goblin owl goblin likes to it's raping kids and setting yeah we got we got to get the interdimensional child molesters in there they're they're they're they're riding around on owls shooting fucking lubricant on babies and blasting fucking and then they're gonna cut that's that's that's like one one side and then on the other side is um uh you know the the incredible to me like the thing that really did give me one of those dizzying like all right not only have i apparently walked into a simulation but i didn't have enough money for like the well written simulation or i've got bad taste for this because this particular video game appears to be written by somebody who is the opposite of subtle because today going to jet i don't know if you read about this in prison today was the person from the nsa who leaked that the russians hacked the election and you know what her name is reality oh reality winner yes yeah yeah so our the united states government just put reality in jail it's like okay come on are you really like like come on that can't just you that can't the odds i i know the odds of someone like whistle blowing and saying hey dude our election got fucked with you know those are those are pretty good odds that's gonna happen if like someone's fucking with the election but the fucking odds the person's name is reality winner and that the person who's president was a reality show host it's just bad writing lila bad writing yeah it's just a game you know all this all by the way i'm sorry i'm sorry whoever wrote it i love it here i'm telling you it's i i'm just saying it's funny it's just funny and like a kind of like a cheesy way which i respect it's cool i don't mean insult whoever's writing this stuff you guys i mean you know if you have it is it really america you know whoever wrote the american dream right now the current dream the current delusion the current nightmare is uh you know it's it's it's pretty trailer park yeah it's like it's it's like good i love that show trailer park boys it's very like trailer park boys you know like antifa versus fascists and right trump and all the trashy stuff going on in the in the in the white house stormed daniels stormed daniels and the payoff and the it's like the you know it's like the it really is really cheese it's like cheesy it's very like uh what's the word it reminds me of like um those you know not not xxx but an x-rated kind of it's kind of x-rated cheesy like simulated sex level cheesy there's something some something more creepy about simulated sex than actual sex you know like right right right no great porn seems like somehow you know creepier than actual fucking somehow i don't know i'm off on a real tangent so it's a game we're in a lila this is some kind well yeah i mean it's like we look at all this when you look at all this stuff from the if you meditate long enough to develop the the mentality of an advanced meditator i mean you just look at this stuff and it just looks like keystone cops you know it's like those old movies of you know uh people chasing each other through a hall going opening doors and closing doors and chasing each other around doors and it's hilarious it is and the compassion right what is compassion it's like it's such a misunderstood term in a way it's like compassion is understanding that everyone is already enlightened and choosing to play this game and the compassion is it's like i have compassion for all life and all sentient beings because that's all an extension of we're all the same thing we're all this this consciousness right parts of our consciousness are incarnating into really weird games right like incarnating into i don't know whatever whatever happened in you know you know the crazy breakdown of democracy in america the insanity that goes on in various places of the world it's like human beings play some really weird games yeah right but ultimately it's all we are still all this consciousness which is itself empty of any inherent quality just experiencing a light show so the whole thing about spirituality is that it's really not that special right because all that it does is it allows you to step away from the computer right it's like oh yeah that's world of warcraft right yeah right oh right oh it allows you to wake from the dream and in awaking from the dream it allows you to remember that your suffering was also a dream but that also all of your joy and your love and all everything was a dream but here's where i'm confused so and this is brings us to probably the last question one second that's the dog scratching itself perfect it's the drum it's the drum um here's my question my final question and it brings us back to what we were talking about in the beginning the bardo states so you're talking about this waking up not being in the video game not being in the game anymore but every time you talk about this you're still a thing you know you're acting as though as you you wake up and then and then now you're you're a you know what i mean you're a you're still a thing you're like oh i'm not going to do that anymore but you're still an i you're still an i um and your description of buddhism which is which i think was really really good uh this sort of uh the interdependency the no self it seems to kind of negate the idea of the soul and and not doesn't seem it does you know or at least like makes the soul another temporary phenomena so what is it then that is experiencing these bardo states aha what what what is what are the 49 days what what's going through that so here's where it gets really fun so i opened up by saying well let's get down to brass tacks and then we went off on this huge tangent about what is what is reality what is enlightened right so the bardo so think about it this way right you're living your life everyone's living their life out there and thinking that it's real and then they die right yeah in the bar when you die according to the now this is in the the bar oath at all right so it's the i believe the nima buddhism right so the the first school of tibetan buddhism uh the original school of tibetan buddhism uh explored this in great detail and you can you can verify all this by reading it this is how the bardo works when you die you trip for 49 days right because here's what happens when you're in a body you're experiencing all these different hallucinations but as my sufi teachers told me as long as you have a body you're able to modulate your frequency right as long as you have a body you're able to change the frequency at which you're experiencing reality if this is why human life is so fucking precious yeah it's why human life is so important it's why human incarnation is the best of all possible incarnations because yes in theory you could be born as something greater an angel a god something like that and yes you could be born as something lower a demon something like that but the the thing about humanity human being has a choice a human being can choose and other things in the universe cannot right so as long as you have a body you have the ability to choose make new choices and make new decisions which modulate your frequency when you die you lose that ability so think about it like this your life's a trip let's say your life is horrible awful you live in a war zone your entire life yeah right you're resonating at that frequency you you know over the course of however long you live in such a such an existence you have various opportunities to hopefully to change and transform that energy into something else people get out of war zones all the time they you know get people get out of refugee camps things like that or whatever it happens to be right human beings are experience choosing machines we choose experiences to have and then we identify with that experience that game right who chooses well ultimately nobody right but the the but this is our the previous point of our conversation where we were we were talking about um you know games everything's a game when you see things everything is a game that this is in ramdas ramdas's experiments in truth he talks about this is the idea of burning off karma and it's it's like it seems to clash with the impersonalist perspective in the sense that but so so what you're talking about is like and i have though i do love the idea and the older i get the more i think it's probably true they don't completely understand it but i kind of do get it uh the so like the idea is like all right i mean i'm coming back i'm going i'm gonna become the meat snorkel again this time i'm gonna i'm gonna be a uh um this time i'm gonna be i don't know i'm gonna be a palestinian and i'm gonna be born and i'm gonna live to be three because i end end up getting shot or bombed and i'm gonna experience that just terror for most of my existence and this in some way or another is going to refine or teach or burn off or help me get closer to source or become something uh something divine or it is per it's a perfect expression of the thing and and you just saying it it's like fuck that that fucking bulls that's just another bullshit religious rationalization to make sense of the incomprehensible inconceivable suffering of the world right and so the great example that i've heard is like you know think of a squirrel and a fire and a forest that just like it was just a squirrel it didn't even do it did nothing it didn't it just there's a forest fire the squirrel got burned it didn't kill it and now the squirrel's lying on like scorched black and charred ground twitching and and slow death agony and so the idea is like well the squirrel picked it it decided to be that squirrel it wanted to be the squirrel it chose to explore the universe is just expressing itself through that charred twitching squirrel and uh and i guess that's perfect huh hippie right right so and and and the answer to that question on one level and it's really hard to hear it's really hard to say is yes yes that too but holy fucking shit don't say that around the wrong person definitely don't say it on a podcast so i'm i'm overcome with great compassion and love for all humanity i love you all so much all of you we we are all one being you we are all one consciousness experiencing itself through different locuses all over the multiverse yeah we are one being i love you all you are all my greater self we breathe the same breath no matter who you are anywhere in the world breath is the same i love you all and we keep coming back and coming back and coming back to this experience because we enjoy it because we love it because we love each other we want to see each other again we keep coming back it's like david bowie said on i think he then one of one of his later albums some of us will always stay behind it's okay you could say i like that we keep coming back yeah so the bardo right yeah all right so as long as you have a human be as long as you have a body you have the ability to modulate your frequency okay when you die you lose the your your let me put it in tripper language right when you're tripping you're and you have a body you're a body having a trip when you're dead it's just the trip right it's just the energy modulation cool right the body's not there so it's just the psychedelic space now here's what happens in the bardo and listen to me closely because this is very very important it's actually the most important thing there is in the entire universe the whole point of the bardo experience which is the intermediary experience between lifetimes is to remember the fundamental primary clear light meaning everything is empty everything is inherent a fundamental essence it's empty of existence nothing is actually real right it's the fact that we identify with the illusion it addicts it us to it yeah we are addicted to the trip we are addicted to the illusion and so we keep coming back to experience it yeah yeah that's the bardo so but let's break that down a bit more so in the bardo the soul okay somebody dies yeah Tibetan theory the soul leaves the body what is the soul well according to the Tibetan theory the soul is really an aggregate of various things that think it's it's an aggregate of this is this gets really technical but this is a fascinating question right because the idea is that the Tibetan view is it's all these it's kind of this packet of forward momentums yes that's how i've already described yeah i've heard it like that or it's like when you hear any tone or something it's like all the you're hearing in a tone all these different frequencies and it's just it's like sound or something yeah so if you all all that karma is right is action carried forward yeah right it's just uh it's inertia i think it does inertia it's like energy going forward into the future if you do something and you keep doing it you keep doing it you keep doing it it it cuts a groove into reality yeah so for instance if you work out every day every day every day keep working out keep working out then you cut a groove you have you create a karma of working out that will carry you forward and and it will be harder to stop working out right because you will keep working out into the future yeah it's the same with lifetimes right if you keep incarnating as a soldier soldier soldier soldier wow you're building the the inertia of carrying the identity of a soldier forward into existence right but all that that is is a matter and it's it's a matter of energy space time all that that is is a ripple going forward into the future right it's like you do enough do soldier for long enough it builds its own momentum and it goes forward into the future and you keep incarnating i'm in the revolutionary war i'm in the i'm in the civil war i'm in you know world war one i'm in world war two i'm in vietnam you know you keep and keep reincarnating in the soldier lifetimes space force right totally now you're fighting zerg on planet trestle yeah so it's just that's what karma is it's not like this it's not we over christianize it we turn it into a thing of sin and guilt and all that hell i know i know it's not that it's just energy pushing forward into the into the future that which stays in motion you know it's it's the laws of thermodynamics it's like the thing you're doing right now you're probably going to do it tomorrow like whatever the thing is you're doing you're probably going to do it tomorrow the way you know what i'm talking about the thing you're doing the thing i run into people all the time and there's got a thing you know it's the thing that keeps happening or the blah i was always this groundhog day yeah yeah yeah so it's like yeah exactly so it's like so so this is some sort of like um amalgamation of a variety of like uh who knows what forces pushing forward and so and there's some sentience there right there's some differentiated sentience or something right and it and it goes into this bardo this like trip trippy dream state but it's not quite nothingness is it it's still a something or it wouldn't be able to experience the bardo so the bardo so when you enter the bardo you're just the trip and what you experience in the bardo is just your karma relieving itself by experiencing itself as a psychedelic trip outside of the space of the body yeah right so what that means practically is this when someone enters the bardo they're experiencing a series of virtual realities in which their karmas are being reflected back to them yeah meaning the events of their life yeah right like all of their karma is now trying to work out in this intermediary step between bodies yeah so they're having these kind of virtual reality experiences where they're meeting goddesses and gods and demons and and angels and all this hallucinatory stuff and all that is is a consciousness trying to talk to itself trying to remember that it's awake right so uh jacob's ladder is a great movie that really really demonstrates this so when you're in the bardo the whole point of the bardo is now you don't have a body and now your karma is kind of this free-floating packet that's mirroring back its own experiences to itself to try and wake itself up right it's like a free-floating satellite in the ether yeah it's trying to wake itself up yeah okay so um can I like add like to this a little bit like the one one way I've pictured is like you know how like um like in uh old like medieval times or movies fantasy movies the king's got this fucking sigil on his ring and he pushes it into wax and there's a mark in the wax the mark of Baratheon or whatever and they fucking mail the fucking thing and you know it came in the king it's got the sigil of the king it's this impression in the wax in the bardo realms I imagine what may be happening is that your karma is the ring and all the surrounding potentiality is the wax and you're seeing this impression that you've been making in the human life all around you in the form of like whatever it may be you know and that can be really really fucking horrifying if you were not if you were like if you were an asshole yes particularly if you're an asshole so think about it this way let's say somebody enters the death experience in anger and rage yeah well the bar their bardo trip is going to be anger and rage they're going to be you know they're going to be seeing their frequency mirrored back to themselves so the whole point of the bardo so the bardo lasts 49 days and it's a series of hallucinatory experiences in which the soul is given opportunities to remember itself right so if you read the bardoth at all it basically says the point is remember the fundamental clear light that's what you need to do in the bardo meaning remember that existence is empty and nothing none of this is actually real remember that it's a game wake up even if you're not in between in between lifetimes if you can wake up in between lifetimes you don't have to reincarnate because you remember it's a game at which point you can choose to not have to reincarnate right that's why the Tibetans practice dream yoga that's why they meditate in their sleep that's why they do bardo yoga right because they want to it's like when you train yourself to have a lucid dream to wake yourself up in a dream they're training themselves to wake up after they're dead so death is actually like a like a like it's like a chance you might be able to jump into a different subway car except in this time it's not like it's a jump out of a subway car it's a chance to jump jump out it's a chance to let go of this never-ending ceaseless pattern of yes reincarnating in a matter think of it like this life is the ultimate addiction incarnating into it into existence is an addiction when you're not in a body you have a brief moment of time in which you can remember that you're addicted to incarnating in human bodies and just stop right that's that's the nigma buddhist kick right it's like that's what they're talking about they're saying it's like just stop incarnating remember that it's an addiction will you just fucking stop incarnating ronald it's getting annoying so but but and yes in theory you can you you could wake up enough in the bardo to choose maybe a more favorable lifetime but ultimately it's all suffering anyways because it's all no matter what you choose it's all illusion it's all delusion right it's like you want to make take another role on the roulette wheel the wheel of fortune go right ahead but at every single position it's exactly the same at some point you got to stop mining arcanite right now i want to tell you this dream i had last night and then let's wrap it up i just want to hear what you hear what you think about it i had the best fucking dream about my dad last night now my dad has lived a really great life but he uh a really great life and he fucking he loved life man and but you know he was never a guy i had like tons of bodies he lived in apartments a lot i was growing up we go visit him always there was an apartment that he lived in he uh it was he he but that was part of like yeah i don't know it was his karma and his karma i think was pretty good and because he was a really like joyful being and he it didn't matter that he was in where he was wherever he was he liked it he'd figure out a way it was cool so i had this dream last night and i'm at an apartment complex that's where my dad died in an apartment i'm at an apartment complex except this one's on the beach it would be it was not it's nice and this is my dad's living in a new apartment and he's showing me his new apartment he's like this is on the beach and he and he would like that that'd be cool to him right and he's saying to me in this dream he's like dunk it these two asians upstairs these two asians upstairs might like been like show me around and uh i see him right he's like i like him he's like i don't know if they're asians or they're aliens and i look at him and it's like to bet and it's like just to bet and monks to to bet and monks and um he's like uh he says to me he goes they're they keep telling me they want me to teach you how to dance right that's so beautiful thanks yeah it's a cool dream man what does it mean well what was i mean it's beautiful what was coming to me while you were saying that is to tell you that uh i have been like i was trained by the name of buddhist to read the bardo right so when you read the bardo though it all the book of the dead yeah you read it for people who have passed and you chanted in to bed and and the point is you're trying to communicate to the other side you're telling the person on the other side it's your it's sound i can't i'm not going to do it on the podcast but you know because i don't have it in front of me but it's like you know what you're hearing is you know like to bet and chanting but what the words actually mean of the bardo is you're trying to reach to that person on the other side while they're in the bardo and be like dude wake up it's just a game right if you wake up you don't you can you can choose to come back if you want but you have a choice it's like becoming lucid in the dream right okay okay right we're trying to wake you up so that you remember you have a choice and i you can choose to not come back at all if you want you can just choose to relax into the infinite nothingness that is shining if you want right but also you can keep coming back if you like if you like it's completely volitional but the point is to wake the person up so because if somebody's in because here's what happens if somebody's in the bardo and they're having a nightmare it's just like the dream state they're having a nightmare and the nightmare is that they're being tormented by the karma of the actions they of their life right they were anger war aggression destruction rage all of that yeah tell realm karmas they're experiencing it and they think it's real it's not real it doesn't matter it's like uh you know this is where the christians get it completely wrong the whole idea of like oh there's an eternal hell you must go to if you where you will suffer oh there's an eternal heaven you must go to where you will be eternally it will all be wonderful yeah no no no that's those are trips those are just trips they're not real right the point is you have to remember that it's fucking world of warcraft right so but what happens is okay so let's look at two different scenarios best case scenario in the bardo is that somebody remembers the primary clear light they remember that it's just a dream they remember that this whole thing is just world of warcraft and they're like oh yeah right and then they get on with their day right they don't have to continue reincarnating into the matrix gotcha right second best scenario by the way is that if they can't fully do that the best thing to do is to chant the name of the guru or one's own yiddim personal guardian deity or holy guardian angel as we say in the western magical tradition yes right so the the worst case scenario not worst case scenario but the standard issue scenario right is that the person in the bardo is unable to remember that it's a dream or does not want to what happens okay let's trace this back jimmy is angry he's born angry angry angry angry he lives an angry life he's a soldier he goes he fights in vietnam he kills a bunch of people anger anger anger his entire life is is colored and characterized by anger yeah when he dies he's angry he's angry at god why did you give me this life why did you give me this life of anger and suffering why you know why did i have to kill people why why why war why why why anger anger rage when he loses when jimmy loses his body he goes into the bardo and it's just the trip of anger and rage and all of his anger and rage is now personified to him as demons and wrathful wrathful deities and all this stuff and all the wrathful deities are trying to do is mirror his own state back to him so that he'll recognize himself and wake up so if he wakes up you'll remember that he was just playing world of warcraft and it's really not that big of a deal and the universe is infinite and loving and empty and what you know it's his choice however if he does not now here's where this gets really squirrely if he doesn't remember if he doesn't either remember the primary clear light or remember to chant the name of the guru or the guardian spirit he then must return to rebirth now remember what i said about frequency jimmy has a certain frequency frequency in life when he's in the bardo he has a chance to wake up out of that frequency or at least change it you know at least try to see through it but if you don't have a body you can't really fully change the frequency you can just try and wake up out of it so jimmy's angry in life he's angry in the bardo so when he reincarnates where do you think jimmy reincarnates he jimmy's angry spirit finds a place to reincarnate he is attracted to the world and finds parents of the same frequency right you think about people who are born into war born into abusive situations things like this now here's okay this is almost like too hot for tv but here's the really really squirrely part about this and i swear i'm not making this up this is actually in the bardo though at all what the tibetans say is when you be if you go transit the 49 days of the bardo and you do not remember the primary clear light you don't remember it's all a game and then it's all an illusion etc etc and you begin the it's like uh you begin re-entry the re-entry process yes begin to re-enter into the human loka or the animal loka or whatever other loka you've been attracted to yeah uh because of the law of karma you can't just go anywhere you have to go somewhere that matches your frequency but the reason this happens this is so this is cosmically hilarious the reason this happens is because the the addiction to sex right sure so now here's freudian beyond freudian that i swear the tibetan say this what they say is the reason that people keep incarnating is they're so addicted to the experience of sex that they witness their future parents having sex and are sexually attracted to it and enter into the contract right but it has to be parents that are at the same level of vibration as them because they're not really able to perceive anything that's not at their same level of vibration so if you imagine like the re-entry experience as like a non-incarnated spirit watching this gigantic like porn hub of like everyone on earth fucking yeah and like seeing the ones that are like it and becoming sexually attracted to that and then incarnating as the child of that couple oh wow that's what the tibetans say i mean that what are you gonna do with that smart dude i'll tell you once a long time ago i had a one-eyed stand in a condom broke and i can remember laying there and like trying to send out psychic signals to any soul emerging from the bardo and being like about i guess it would have been too late by then but being like don't this isn't don't come into this right now this isn't what you want um man that is so cool that's i've heard it described that i've that's a way better description than what i thought it was because you've studied it i thought it was like you could eat and you get chased by demons into people having sex so i i my my my my version of it was more in terms of like you're running from demons you're running from something you see people fucking you dive into them as a form of escape but where you what you're describing is like way kinkier which is more like you're being chased by demons but then also you see people fucking and you're like well well well what do we have well the demons are just projections of the mind because everything's a projection of the mind right yeah but uh yeah i mean how Freudian is it it's like you know is that why people like do you think maybe like one of the porn addiction is just trying to make a better parent choice like when we're watching porn we're just like it's some instinctual bardo memory we're like god damn it i'd rather them be my fuck oh my wow the type of fucking porn you watch wow was your parents were oh my god Duncan i wish my parents were feet Duncan where do we go with that one i'm i have entered the the emptiness of i've nothing i have no more to say i mean the primary clear light of fuck dude listen man you are a really really wonderful friend and i'm so grateful to have you mob jason thank you so much for this it was so enlightening thank you how can people find you oh my god thank you Duncan that was the i think we just read the bardo but that's got to be the most demented reading of the bardo of all human history can we just can we can we package it like that i i and i'm telling the truth by the way i have been trained to read the bardo cool right so i think that was like the most that was maybe we were just reading the bardo for your dad right what is what that my dad is like how's that reading the bardo from my dad what does it mean that my dad's gonna reincarnate as like a porn i don't like that reading it's the remembering of the primary clear light but it seems to have already happened because you said that you dreamt of your dad with tibetan monks so it happened before we ever even had this podcast you think that's part of that's him in the bardo like maybe getting a little bit of extra help well it's because my teachers gave me this prayer to read to him as he was dying and so i was able to like and it was a tibetan prayer and and like uh before he died he read the tibetan book of the dead and also before he died um i he was i taught him um and he died with these uh tulsi beads in his hand that uh came from ababa in india so there are a lot of good forces to help his momentum and also beyond all that stuff he was happy when he died you there's a lot of love wonderful yeah so my hope is that that dream means that he's got some friends over there that's what it sounds like to me i hope so where can people find you uh well

Have a great day. Take care. Bye, thank you. Step by step. Sorry for that. I mean, how can you not laugh at that dumb fucking song? I mean, I'm just happy he stayed on for the five steps. That, my friends, was the sound of today's guest, Brendan Walsh. And he has started a brand new podcast. He was formerly one of the co-hosts of the award-winning nationally lauded podcast, The Bone Zone, which was described by The New Yorker as the premier and intellectual podcasting today. He has moved on since then, and he started another mind-bendingly brilliant podcast called The World Record Show, where he interviews mainly quantum physicists who go through their favorite records of atomic particle distribution. He's with us here today. We're going to jump right into it. But first, a word from our sponsors. This episode of the DTFH has been supported by Squarespace.com. Darlings, it would be easy for me to talk about how incredible Squarespace is. You want to create a website in a matter of minutes using award-winning templates. They've got that for you. You want to start selling stuff online. They have incredible shopping cart functionality. You want to send out mass mails to your subscribers. They will help you design mailing campaigns. They do everything, but rather than go on and on about their amazing customer support or how easy it is to buy new domain names through them. For example, blowfishdogsucker.com is available right now. You could just go to squarespace.com and you would own that incredible domain name. I'm not going to go on and on about the glorious things about Squarespace, but what I am going to do is sing a song about what happens when the hyperdimensional entities that are so impressed with my website come and visit me in the night. Ever since I got a Squarespace website, beings of light come and visit my room. They shoot hooks out of their hands into my nipples. I know it sounds like it would hurt, but it feels good. Squarespace is not just some boring web design place. It's an artist-friendly digital canvas of glory that you can use to make way more than just some basic website. You can make anything you want with Squarespace. It's a creativity engine. And every time I upload an episode of the DTFH, I use squarespace.com. Right now, head over to squarespace.com. slash familyhour. And give them a shot. If you like them, use offer code familyhour and you will get 10% off your first order of a website or a domain. I not only want to thank Squarespace for sponsoring this episode, but wow, those beings of light. I'm so flattered that you've chosen me to be your NippleHook receiver.

Whatever you choose, you can have with squarespace.com. Thank you, Squarespace. What's up, my fellow CIA agents? Today, we've got Brendan Walsh here with us today. Many of you know that Brendan Walsh, also known as Operative46789, has been resistant to some of our sublimation mechanisms. And this podcast was yet another attempt to finally get him to bow down to the hoofed one who wanders in the woods so that we can all get back to Project 1865973. I'm sorry to say that this particular episode, we weren't quite able to convert him, but I think we got close. So even if you're not a CIA agent, if you're somebody who just likes the sound of someone being tranquilized, rolled around in bee stingers and indoctrinated into deep and very subtle vibratory patterns designed to pull them out of the particular node of the simulator that they're trapped in so they could at last finish their mission as the Manchurian candidate that we always wanted them to be. What I'm saying for all of you who aren't in the particular branch of the CIA that I and most of my listeners are in is that Brendan is a Manchurian candidate and we've been trying to get him to run for president of the United States for the last 15 years, but he keeps wanting to do podcasting and he wants to be a comedian. And until it lasts, we finally break through whatever residual resistance mechanisms are clogging up his psyche, then unfortunately we're gonna continue to be thwarted by his career as a comedian and a comedic writer, which he's really good at, but he would be a better president. And once he becomes the president, then at last he could finally bring the apocalypse to this planet and by we, I mean those of us from Saturn will rise again from the subterranean layers of the earth and have a never ending civilization that was born from blood. So if you're into that sort of thing, you're gonna really love this episode of the DTFH, but if you just like classic comedy, you're gonna love this podcast as well because Brendan has got to be one of the funniest people I've ever met on this planet. That's a joke of course, he's a president, he's supposed to be the president, he's supposed to be the last president. So, friends, here we go. We're gonna jump right into this podcast. Let me remind you that we've got a wonderful shop located at dugoutrustle.com. A tremendous thank you to my beautiful Patreon subscribers.

[""Welcome to the Dugoutrustle Family Hour Podcast""] [""Welcome to the Dugoutrustle Family Hour Podcast""] It's the Dugoutrustle Family Hour Podcast. Brendan Walsh, welcome to the Dugoutrustle Family Hour podcast, top podcast in the nation. It's good to have you on the show. Thanks for having me, Duncan. I can't wait to get into the things I wanna promote here. Let's get into it. Let's start with the promotion. What do you got? Nutrissystem. I'm not officially the spokesperson for Nutrissystem yet. Nutrissystem, for those of you at home who don't, or in your car or at work, if you don't know what Nutrissystem is, it's a weight loss plan. It's like Jenny Craig or Weight Watchers, I assume. Here, let me just pull this up here. But Nutrissystem's on Twitter. And so I started following them. I started tweeting them. I'm overweight. I've gained some weight over the past five years or so. I saw you stuff your shirt. I have a, when you gain weight, you start to sweat a little more. So sometimes I will put a towel underneath my shirt. You put a towel that shape like a... So anyway, I'm trying to get a sponsorship from Nutrissystem. And the way it works is I want them to send me some free shit and I'll eat there. And if you're listening to Nutrissystem, send me some free shit. I'll eat your fucking crap exclusively. And then when I lose some fucking weight, I will tweet about it, fucking do Instagram stories, whatever. And even if the food tastes like shit, I'll still, I'll say it tastes good. I won't take any photos of myself. I saw you stuff your shirt backstage in the belly room. Yeah, the belly room. There was a show, it was a belly show. You can't do that. That's not okay. And it's not okay to do this promo bullshit on my show at the very start, man. You told me that I could come on here. Yeah, I didn't tell you to come on here and do your fraudulent fat thing. It's not fraudulent. I am not a spokesperson, but if you're listening to this and you're near, if you have Twitter, please tweet to Nutrissystem. Tell them to make me their official spokesperson. Or they don't, they don't even have to make me an official spokesperson. I'm happy to do it. Your sister worked for Benicio del Toro and she gave you a fat suit. Yeah, she does work for Benicio del Toro. Guillermo del Toro. I don't care, whatever. Here's some frequently asked questions about Nutrissystem. What is this? Are there restrictions on who can use- This is what a podcast is. Are there really, are there- What are you doing? We don't just, don't do ads. This isn't an ad. This is a frequently asked- People want to know about you. Okay, well, here's, okay, people ask me. They say, Brendan, are there restrictions on who can use Nutrissystem to lose weight? And generally I answer them with, I say people with certain conditions may not use the Nutrissystem weight loss program. These include, but are not limited to people- I have to do ads. People are going to not listen because they're going to turn off. Well, if you're pregnant, allergic to soy- You don't come on a podcast and do ads. This isn't an ad. This is more of a warning. It's a fucking ad, dude. But this is a warning. Stop, you're doing an ad. But if you want to use Nutrissystem- Do an ad on your podcast. If you're pregnant, you shouldn't do it. You don't see people going on, what are you doing? My podcast isn't out yet, but it will be out soon. And I will, I guarantee you, I'll talk about Nutrissystems. I will pull your podcast at the very beginning. This isn't an ad. Then listen to my podcast as well. It's called the World Record Podcast. What are you doing? You're supposed to come on and like do jokes and be funny and shit. You don't just start plugging shit. Well, I figured we'd get the business out of the way up top. All right, we gotta cut to commercial. We say- Hold on, we gotta cut to commercial. The Black Tux believes every groom deserves a better experience when it comes to finding formal wear. A suit or a tuxedo for their big day. Did you know the Black Tux was actually started by two guys who had one of the worst tuxedo fittings you could imagine? And it turns out they're not alone in this frustration. I certainly have experienced this. There have actually been times when I've been invited to some formal event where I become angry at the person who invited me because it means I'm gonna have to get fitted for some kind of tuxedo or a suit. And I'm thinking, who do you think you are? What are you, some kind of prince? That you're gonna not just invite people to come to your whatever the event happens to be, but now you want us to dress up for it? Have a barbecue. I don't know you that well. You're really gonna make me go through the humiliation of getting fitted for a thing. And then it's just a nightmare, a hellscape. I'm getting fucking pissed right now thinking about it.

And we're back with Brendan Walsh, top comedian, host of your, one of the co-hosts of your mom's house. That's Tom Segora. Segora, I'm trying to talk a lot of people, people do impressions of your voice, right? Sometimes. Well, if this is the way, I'm not gonna do your, I'm not gonna do because- So this is not gonna invade my show. I'm not invading, I appreciate it. Everybody, if you're listening out there, hey everybody, if you're out there listening, listen to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast because it's a great podcast. They're already listening. I invited you on the show, you start off by hijacking it with your NutriSystem commercial. I know you're sponsored by them and I know you're- I'm not, that's the- You're a fraudulent fat man. Have you put on a fat suit? No, I'm overweight. And you're doing that to scam NutriSystem and you're gonna get in a lot of trouble for it. I'm not scamming. I'm not gonna be part of that. See, you don't listen. I'm trying to get free shit from NutriSystem if I can lose some fucking weight. But you're wearing a fat suit. But I'm not, it's real. Okay. This smells horrible, by the way. If you have a condition requiring a celiac or ketogenic diet, ketogenic- Stop, don't, you can't use NutriSystem. No one's listening. Listen, by now people are like, I'm not gonna listen to- Children under 14 years of age may not be on the NutriSystem program either. Adolescents age 14 to 17 require a specific meal plan and physician approval. So is there, are kids allowed to listen to your podcast? Allowed? I don't know. I don't know, is there a rating system? There should be. Oh, great. No, I'm saying in general, don't you agree? You're a father. There should be a rating system for podcasts. Well, they do it for movies, they do it for TV. Okay. So podcast, let's say my daughter or your son logs on to a podcast. And the podcast is about- Yeah, it's- A-N-A-L-S-E-X. It's a mature podcast. But what if, no, I'm not saying your podcast. What if they log on to a podcast- It's about analysts? No, if one of our children- If the podcast is about analysts? Logs on to a P-O-D-C-A-S-T and it's about A-N-A-L-S-E-X. Why can't you just say analyst? Do you, are you comfortable with that? I don't know, I wouldn't do a podcast about analysis, it's boring. It's anal sex, is what I spelled. You know that. Okay, I'm not doing this comedy routine. You had me on here- Let's cut to brass tacks here, man. I did a promo for- Longest human poop ever. Okay, here we go. This is, can I play this on your podcast? Yeah, I guess, why not? Fuck it. This is a bad idea, man, I fucked up. This is a commercial- Okay, the longest human poop ever recorded was 26. You know, I could add Jimmy Carter's nephew on this week. Did I name the athlete? Hi, this is Brendan Walsh and welcome to my newest podcast, The World Record Podcast. On this podcast, we talk about world records. We set world records, we break world records, and sometimes we'll even call a salami store. My wife is on the phone. All right, that's enough. Do you have like the big- Cut it off, just cut it off, stop. I have a podcast, it's not, I do have a Patreon. Hold on, we gotta cut to commercial. Friends, I don't wanna brag, but I was invited to over 39 high-level celebrity parties tonight, where there's gonna be full-on come dips, deep-dip dive downs, lower body, resuscitation, scrubs, and like basic like orgies, and also complex orgies. Several orgies taking place with an undulating maze is made of trained erotic caterpillar people, but rather than doing that, guess what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna stay home. I'm gonna get stoned, and I'm going to watch a horror movie on my favorite horror movie streaming service, Shutter. If you like horror movies, this is the ultimate service of all time, my darlings. Sure, you could go dig around the internet or try to find great horror movies. I used to do that in the old days, the PS days, pre-shutter days, but now we all have the incredible convenience of having perfectly curated horror movies delivered to us in boxes made of human flesh thanks to Shutter. Right now, you can try Shutter free for 30 days. Go to Shutter.com, use promo code Duncan. That's S-H-U-D-D-E-R.

That's S-H-U-D-D-E-R. Shutter, you could try it for free for 30 days by going to Shutter.com and using promo code Duncan. Now back to the DTFH. How many? And we're back with Brendan Walsh. So, man, you just had a job working on the, am I allowed to say your last job? Sure. So you just had a job working in the seafood department of Ralph's. What's it like, man? Do you come home like smelling like fish or? Well, the weird thing is, and I think I might have talked about this before, but I, you know, I have a pet fish. Like a goldfish? At home, yeah. His name's Dave. Cool. And I come home and I just got done killing fish all day. Yeah. And I, so I, when I- Wait, you guys kill them? I thought they shipped in the dead fish. Well, we chop them up and stuff. But they're already dead. And sometimes we kill, no, sometimes for the sushi, you have to kill a live fish. What? That's what that's the way we do it. It brings in live fish. What are they coming in? This guy named Jerry. What are they in? Oh, no, wait. The guy who brings into fish is named Dave. My fish is named Jerry. Sorry. Hold on. Dave brings in like the like bit, like when you have when the goldfish at the fair, like in the garbage bags. Well, no, he doesn't bring in goldfish. This is for the sushi at the grocery store. Yeah. The guy comes in, he's got a van. It's got the fish in like, you know, those rubber made bins. Oh, sure. You get it at the container store. Yeah, sure. So they're like bed, bath and beyond. They sell stuff like that too. Or even Ikea, I think has like some clear ones. Maybe they're from Ikea. All right, whatever. So he brings in fish in these. Cause they're, so they're, yeah, they're whatever. Maybe 20 gallon containers. It doesn't matter. Like you've killed these, you would kill these off? Well, no, he brings them there alive. And there's honestly, they're not, when they're in the containers, there's two, there's a lot of fish in the container. Like they couldn't, it's not like a fish tank with only a few fish swimming around. They're like stacked. There's a bunch of them in there. But when he gives them to us, he hands them to us one at a time. Why? I don't know. It's just the way it's been since I've been there. So he hands us a fish, hands me a fish. I hand it to another guy who hands it to Tom, who's the head guy. And then Tom will either kill the fish, like chop its head off, or Terry, who's the other, the assistant manager, he'll hand it off to Terry or, I don't kill the fish personally. Why do they hand the fish off? He hands them, it's like, did you ever see a fire brigade? Like, you know, back in the olden days, it's like hot potato. They didn't have hoses. So they would have a bunch of people with buckets. So they passed the buckets down the line. So imagine instead of buckets, it's live fish one at a time. Why? To get it from the van to the seafood department. Why not just bring the bin to the killing area? Because he has to do it, doesn't want to bring them all. It's heavy probably, it's full of water. But you could use a cart. We don't have a cart. And he might have a cart in the van. It's probably some kind of fish code or ordinance or something. It's a union. It sounds like a union, a fish. Seafood. Seafood union. Wow, cool. Okay, I get it. So whatever, man. So you guys passed the fish down like a fire one at a time. And then there's a guy. How do you kill them? She cuts their heads off. Mostly some of them they don't. Sometimes the fish like he'll, I guess, what do you call it? Like bludgeon it or something? Cause some sushi, they need to be killed a certain way. Okay. But yeah, I've heard that. Cause there's adrenochrome. Is that what it's called? Adreno? Adrenochrome? Adrenochrome, yeah. Adrenochrome and the fish. Right. So if you kill the fish, if you get the fish scared and it dies really stressed out, it releases adrenochrome. I had no idea that's what it came from. Well, they have it in people and there's other animals, I guess. I ordered two ounces of adrenochrome from that Goop website. How does it, did you take it? I haven't taken it yet. I'm waiting for the next Valentine's Day. So when you're, let me ask you this. You're working at a Ralph's, which is in Hollywood. It's not Ralph's, it's an independent, I shouldn't say the name of the place since you're against like promoting places. Okay, no problem. But it's not a Ralph's, it's a person. It's a Ralph's, but it's in the Hollywood Hills area. High end. And one of the things I love is you talk about some of the celebrity clients that come in. Will you tell the story of when Tom Cruise came in to order fish when you were there? Yeah. Well, Tom Cruise, the way, and this, if you live in Hollywood, you get this a lot. Every place that every business like a restaurant or a grocery store, if somebody like Beyonce or Tom Cruise wants to come in, they have their people call ahead. Generally, you have to shut the place down for a little while. I mean, you don't close like, yeah. Well, they just locked the door and people have to, so nobody else can be in there. You don't have to leave? Well, they start, they let people out, but there shouldn't be anybody, any other customers in there. And so they generally, and they give you enough time, they call ahead a few hours. Who calls, the celebrity calls themselves? No, they're assistant or somebody. How do you know it's their assistant? Um, I mean, they identify themselves. Yeah, but anybody could call a store and say I'm Tom Cruise's assistant, I'm coming in to get fish. Well, they could, but then Tom Cruise wouldn't show up an hour later. Yeah, but they would have shut the store down. I'm just saying it's a way that like, chaos people could fuck up every. Okay, well, if you're listening and it's the kind of thing you think would be funny, don't do that, I guess. Because we do have businesses to run. And if somebody, for example, if they're surviving Beastie Boys, we're gonna come into your shoe store. Yeah. It would be bad for business if some kind of crank, had you shut, just put yourself in their position. If you shut down your shoe store. I wouldn't do it. I'm just saying it seems like. But if the surviving Beastie Boys were coming in, you would do it. Why do you have to say surviving? You say the Beastie Boys. Well, there's two, there's three Beastie Boys and one passed away. So what? Well, we're a surviving humans, you know. Well, the two surviving Beastie Boys. Or two surviving people, because we all, you know, there's, humans die, so we don't have to say surviving is just the Beastie Boys. Well, the two surviving members of the Beastie Boys, I think is a legitimate way to do it. And I did meet them. Oh no, I didn't meet them. Go ahead. You act like they're gladiators. No, I just think that it's acceptable. I mean, that's a good way. We could call somebody and ask them. I don't want to call anybody. I don't want to do that. I don't want to call somebody and ask if they think the Beastie Boys should be called survivors. The two surviving members of the Beastie Boys, what should they be called? Oh look, there's a survival squirrel outside. The squirrels have died. Oh my poodle is surviving poodle. There's poodles, it's ridiculous. Well, if yeah, if you had a group of poodles and one or more of them died and then there were some who were still alive. It's called a species. Well, okay. I'll choose my battles on this podcast. Yeah, don't die on this hill. Yeah. Don't die on this hill, like one of the Beastie Boys. He, I mean, it's not, it's not, if you're gonna start making jokes about, you know, the deceased Beastie Boy, I'm probably gonna walk here. Just FYI, fair warning. You know, it's just like the alchemy of comedy. Sometimes we try to turn sadness into gold and sometimes it doesn't work. Yeah, like, don't get me started on President Cheeto out there. Oh my God, your new Trump stuff is cracking me up, man. It's so funny. What is that thing you say on stage where I'm at kills every time? Well, I say, like, okay, if you, I mean, I have a lot of stuff. Is it the, where I'm like, okay. Well, because he's given a state of the union, okay. And it's more like, okay. So maybe before you give a state of the union address, maybe look in the mirror, make sure you don't still have Cheeto dust on your face from, because I guess you're bobbing for Cheetos. But he does that. And then it's like, okay. Hmm, I've heard of people with dark circles under their eyes, but how does our president have white circles under his eyes? Is it because he gets too much sleep? Oh my God. Too well rested? Oh, that's so funny. Oh my God. This kind of brings me to the core of what I wanted to talk with you about, which is like, you know, for me, I'm up there, man. Right now I'm doing like my, like 30% of my material is just math. I'm just doing like what I think are like funny equations, you know, seven plus three minus two. You know, I haven't worked the joke out completely, but it's doing pretty good. You know, eight, you know, because it's a word that like for eating and stuff, but I'm working on it. And is it a, here, can I maybe give you a, say this is what popped in my head? Yeah, please. I love my job. I could make it a oral sex joke. So it's like, or eating ass, that's popular. I don't do that kind of comedy, but I, but it'd be more clever because you're like, you know what I did to that ass? I seven plus three minus two. That's what you do an ass like that in people. Cause then you get that nice pause from the audience. I don't know, man. To me, that's not funny. You're like, oh, he ate that ass. It's not my style. But for you, what I'm really blown away about is like you, it's like very courageous what you do with your president Trump jokes. Because number one, no one's doing it. Like you turn on late night TV, think of the daily show. They won't let you. That's why I'm not on late night hosts. Think of any late night hosts. When have you seen since Trump was elected anyone? I've seen some like, you know, very low key jabs that they would give it any, you know, Obama would get them and Clinton. Yeah, but I'm saying like, you're up there on stage and you, you're doing like at least like 30 minutes of like just all Trump jokes. Well, I do, yeah. I mean, in an hour and a half, most of my sets are hour 30, hour 50. And I'll dedicate, I'd say it's 70, like 75%, it's not just Trump. It's the whole political system. No one's talking about politics. That's what I'm saying. It's so fucking edgy, dude. No one's talking about. And there'll be, if you do come to a live show, 15 minutes out of a two hour set, I'll definitely, there'll be 15 minutes dedicated to the future system because I did make a, I tweeted to them and told them that I would talk about their product on stage. So I do some jokes about, you know, it's like weight loss jokes, but then I hold up. I have a big pair of pants that are like a 53 inch. You're doing great. Like the podcast is going good. We're getting heavy and deep. We're getting political. It's going deep. You're one of the edgiest comics working today. Thanks. And you bring it back to your stupid fraudulent attempts to get sponsored by NutriSystem. Just think what you just did. I was talking about my show, my live shows. I'm opening up. You've been doing live shows again. Yeah, I've been doing live shows. How was that? You were just in Denver. It was great. What was, how many shows did you do? Well, originally we had seven scheduled. Okay. So was this like a Tuesday through Sunday kind of thing? No, it was just a weekend thing. We had seven shows scheduled. And then because it was like, I guess the temperature dropped or something to like 40 degrees out there. So, you know, people don't like coming into clubs when it's cold. And so we took it down to one show. But the temperature was fine inside the club. Yeah, but it's getting there, dumbass. So you sold a bunch of tickets for the seven shows. What are you interviewing me? You and me? Well, you know, I'm a big fan of this podcast. And I feel like, you know, I come on here. You're probably not even gonna release this because you're gonna listen back. You mean to release a fucking NutriSystem telethon? It's not a telethon, but I would do that. Why are you self-destructing? I'm saying you talk, you have people on this podcast and you talk about like quantum physics or whatever. And then I come on, I just mentioned one thing. You start attacking me. I'm not attacking you. It's just you're doing, do commercials on your podcast. I do, I will. It's not, I don't have a podcast yet, but it's on Patreon. Great. Well, the world record podcast. World record podcast. I'll announce this shit up front. Okay. You don't have to do this. I will say up front. Listen to Brendan's world record podcast. If you love world records. Everyone loves world records. They do. Okay. They've been around for, I'm going to say one of the first Guinness book of world record, and this is another thing I started to talk about earlier. Whenever anybody does an impression of me, you know what it sounds like? We're doing impression of me. Impression of you? Yeah. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Exactly. Everybody's like, Duh. Yeah. And after listening to my voice, I do sound like that. I sound really dumb. Uh-huh. And I'm gonna, I don't know how to work on it because I'm almost 40, almost 30. Read more. Get off the internet. You're always on conspiracy forms. I read a lot. I do. I go on Reddit conspiracy. Get off these conspiracy forms and get your nose in a book. I do. I read, I read People Magazine. That's not a book, dude. It's based, yeah it is. You know what I'm reading right now? Charles Dickens. And I'm, I've read it three times in a row. I trail it to cities. Charles Dickens, you know, I'm reading a cookbook. It's called Charles Chickens about how to make chicken. We're gonna cut to commercial. Cut that part out. It wasn't funny. I feel like we're just like, you know, we're not being natural. Let me just cut. Dude, you've gotta be funnier than this, man. Like you can't do this to me. Well, let's have a real discussion. You know, we're both parents. I need you to do better than this. You're fucking killing me here, man. You can't do these commercials. You're doing chicken jokes. What are you doing? Okay, the longest human poop ever recorded was 26 feet low. Is there, does it, do they name the athlete? Hi, this is Brendan Walsh and welcome to my newest podcast, The World Record Podcast. On this podcast, we talk about world records. We set world records. We break world records. And sometimes we'll even call a salami store. My wife is on the phone. She wants a big salami. Do you have like the big ones that are, have like, that are just kind of like big and long or? We have some that are like that. We have a soprocetta and a battalion that are large size. So could we use it for weird insertions? I guess so. So subscribe to The World Record Podcast only on all things common. And we're back with Brendan Walsh, one of the top political comedians working today. We are in the middle of a discussion about his edgy comedy. And I just wanna ask you this, man, when you, are you worried about putting yourself in danger with these like hardcore political jokes? Cause, you know, it is not uncommon for comedians to like potentially change the world to take down the system itself. And I see you up there pushing boundaries, pushing limits. I watched a man come to one of your shows, shit his pants and fall on the ground like screaming, like get, arrest this man, arrest this man. Like trying to have you arrested. You caused him, I don't know what you did. Does that happen to you a lot? Well, I have a team, you know, like social media type, people to get publicity, cause Lenny Bruce, I don't know if you've ever listened to any Lenny Bruce material. Is that a comic? He is a comedian from the fifties, not funny at all. He was never funny, never said anything funny. But what he did was in the fifties, it was illegal to say like cocksucker on stage. He learned that, went on stage, said cocksucker, hired some news crews to show up and told the public that he was a comedian. Told the police in advance that he was going to do it. So he got arrested on stage, got a lot of news coverage, then everybody's like, I got to go see this guy. And then they saw him and were like, he's not very funny, but I guess he got arrested for, well, I'm trying, we're trying to, and it's not manufacturing it. Why would you announce that on this show? Don't you feel like that's going to mess up the effect? Well, because of people here, like I would love to get arrested on stage. That's just hard, because it's pretty much legal to say anything except, except I want to kill the president. That's illegal to say. Yeah. But so far I haven't. Don't say that on this podcast. I don't really want to kill the president. Don't even say anything close to that. Jesus fucking Christ. I think if you say stuff about Israel too, it's probably not- Stop, Jesus Christ. Dude, you can't fucking do that shit. I mean, you can't do any of that. What? You got to get with the system, man. Trust me. What system? Are you fucking kidding me? Well, so I can't talk about Israel, like Israel's perfect and the president- Dude, listen to me, listen to me, listen to me. Everything that you're doing right now, it's not going to work for you, man. Trust me, it's no big deal. You're fucking talking about Adrenochrome? Yeah. You got to shut the fuck up about that, man. Why? People want to hear it, like my fans- Dude, dude, do you fucking, are you- Well, look at my Twitter following, look at my Instagram. You don't need to make a choice, man. It's a simple choice. You got to choose the right way to go here, man. You know what? I'm rooting for you, and I keep telling him he's going to turn the corner, don't worry. And then you keep doing shit like that. It's just not gonna- I'll stop talking about it on the podcast, but I'm not, you're not going to silence me like- All right, in general, just forget about it. Just three- Just have fun, man. Okay, bye. Don't you do like life? I'll tell you what, start recording the podcast, you lead me into wherever- Okay. Whatever you want to talk about, and I'll play along. Perfect. I have a meeting, pitch meeting, very important pitch meeting with in an hour. So you have me for another 40 minutes. Okay, thanks, man. Kurt, can you cut out the last 20 seconds, a minute or whatever the fuck I had to tell this idiot? God, wake the fuck up, man. And we're back with Brendan Walsh. We're just talking about a fish brigade. Now, we kind of lost track, so you were telling me- Fish store. Fish store, where you work, you were saying that Tom Cruise, Celebrity Tom Cruise came in to get some fish. Yeah, so the way it usually goes is whenever a celebrity of Tom Cruise's caliber, which there aren't many, there's Ellen. She's great. Beyonce. She's great. Ellen's great, yeah. Beyonce's great. Beyonce's great. J-Lo even, especially after the half time show recently. I love J-Lo. I love J-Lo. Yeah, I love J-Lo. She's good. It doesn't really get much better than that. That's right. Tom Hanks. Love him. Speaking of Tom's, Tom's of Maine, anyone? Fuckin' Forrest Tom's, baby. Tom's shoes. I heard those Tom's shoes, you know they have their whole thing is if you buy a pair of our shoes, we give a pair to poor people. I heard that whole thing is messed up, like they have warehouses of shoes that nobody's getting. Fucking dammit, dude. Hold on, we're gonna cut to commercial. Just follow my lead. It's so simple, man. This is your chance. Well, Tom Cruise, Tom's shoes. It's an honest kind of, listen, the way my brain works is. You just gotta get in line, man. Just get in line. Okay, well, I can't stop free associating because then you're. Just follow my lead. And we're back. Tom Cruise came into the grocery store. Tom Cruise came into the grocery store to order food. Calls ahead. His people call ahead. He'll have a, I assume it's like an agent or a, I mean, I'd say a bodyguard, maybe. I don't know. He's not very, he does have bodyguards. So Tom Cruise, his people call ahead. We get everybody out of the store, put a sign up, sometimes maybe like be back in 30 minutes. And then Tom Cruise will come in with, sometimes with his kids. Love his films. They're good. He has a new, we did that one movie, Eyes Wide Shut. And also lots of other movies too that were really good. Mission Impossible. Mission Impossible is fantastic. I love the Mission Impossible franchise. Is that the last movie? Never saw Eyes Wide Shut. Did you see it? I did. And it's one of Kubrick's. No. Did you see it? You must be thinking about something else. Then Eyes Wide Shut. Is that what it's called? Yeah. It's like about the Illuminati kind of. Did you see it really? I wouldn't watch a stupid movie like that. Did you watch a stupid movie like that? I did watch it and I thought it was like a good statement about like static cults. Kind of like that control of the world. Listen man, every single time I try to do a fucking podcast with you, you try to do this. I'm not doing anything. This bullshit. I'll start Kirk. Is it Kirk or Kurt that you're going? I'll handle the sound and stuff. Listen. Oh yeah, dude. If my name was Kurt, I would answer to Kirk or Kurt. Tell the fish story. It's scripted right there and fucking funny, man. Algorithms have shown this is going to be great on Insta. It's going to be great for you. Just do the fucking fish story. Okay. Why do you have to talk about the fucking Illuminati? I'm not talking about the Illuminati. You brought up Tom Cruise movies. Eyes Wide Shut. Just forget about it. Isn't that about the Illuminati or something though? He made a mistake and he's paid for that shit. Well, that's why they keep him. Kubrick. Yeah. Trust. It's not why they fucking killed him. And here's another thing before we start recording again. Just let it roll. Hold on a second. This is pretty big. Yeah. This is a big one and this is recent. Okay. Now this is something that was not in the mainstream news. Yeah. This just happened in December. Okay, December 6th, 2019. Winston Lawson. Is that name ring a bell to you? Winston Lawson. Secret service agent with John F. Kennedy in Dallas dies. So you're telling me the last guy, they finally got the last guy to keep his mouth shut. Like he was probably playing ball for the last 50 years and then for whatever reason, I don't know if it's our own government or if it's the mafia, but they killed. And here's the worst part. They killed Winston Lawson, who had been a Secret Service agent for four years, went on November 22nd, 1963. He was in an unmarked police car in Dallas just ahead of President John F. Kennedy's open limousine when he got shot. And the worst part is Winston Lawson, who was murdered in December, he was 91. So he definitely had grandkids. He was like, probably. Maybe he was literally murdered. There's proof he was murdered. Well, I mean, come on. But you know he was murdered. Or did he just, he's a 91-year-old man. Okay. Was he murdered by time? Why would they wait that long to kill him? Hey, Kurt, just remember to cut all this out. We'll get back to the fish story as soon as he gets this shit out of his system. I mean, wake up. Like he... So a 91-year-old man dies and you say it was murdered. Was it murdered by? The CIA? Alzheimer's? Was he murdered by Alzheimer's disease? Let's see. Why would the CIA murder him? Because he probably knew that it was a setup that Kennedy was killed by the CIA. But he was 91. Why would they wait that long? Mr. Lawson's death, which was not widely reported at the time, was caught, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. His son, Jeff, said Mr. Lawson is also survived by his wife, who's still alive. So that's they killed a man. But wait, I'm just trying to get clear on this. Four grandchildren. Someone in the CIA is like, hey, Lawson, he knows that Kennedy got assassinated. We better take him out. And then whoever they assigned it to is like, oh, I'll do it tomorrow. Well, he probably, a lot of these guys just kept putting it off for 91 years. He probably retired and obviously somebody pays you a visit. They tell you to keep your mouth shut. And he's been playing ball for the better part of 50-plus years. I think he was about to leak it. I think he probably was like, you know what? I'm getting up there in years. I can't keep this secret anymore. The CIA with Lyndon Johnson killed President Kennedy. I'm gonna come out and do a tell-all. Isn't it just accepted by now that JFK was assassinated by the CIA? Isn't that kind of public data? Well, I don't, let me, I mean, if you're paying attention, yeah. Let me ask you this. And I really mean this, man. You, let's imagine this. Coronary artery disease. So that's probably like they have that gun. A mashed potato gun. No, it's a gun that shoots like it can cause heart attacks and stuff. What are they fucking shooting full of pork rinds? Come on. This is where, you know what, man? To me, Kurt, just let it roll. To me, this is where you're, the type of conspiracy theories you are, the things you believe in are actually to me, I think, less scary than the reality of the situation. Which is that you literally, someone could walk out and show a video in the middle of the Super Bowl of Lyndon Johnson having a meeting with Lizards. And the Lizards telling him, we gotta take out fucking Kennedy. And Lyndon Johnson just like, while he's getting just ass fucked by a goat. And Lyndon Johnson saying, yeah, let's do it. I'll do whatever you guys want. Okay, so they're gonna show a video of this during the Super Bowl? No, listen, my point is this. They could show that during the Super Bowl. And there would be like for a moment, outreach, they're like, it'd be all over for a second. Like, what the fuck was that video? And then do you know what happened? They would say, oh, that was some kind of deep fake. And then do you know what happened? Nothing, nothing. Well, they do another 11 maybe. What? Distract everybody with another 11. I don't think, your problem is you think they've gotta do these things. They don't have to, there's nothing anyone has to do. There's nothing anyone has to do. The reality of it is, I mean, if you, from my perspective, you know, and it's on one level, I guess you could say it's quite cynical, is that on one level, we human beings are a type of herd and we're being herded. And by now, we're so many generations into being herd animals that there is no longer the necessary. Could I interject with a joke? That would be a good name for if you do an album about like herd mentality or whatever. You could call it, I heard that. Heard it through the grapevine. Or I heard it through the grapevine. Yeah, but you spell herd, you don't like that. No, but you know what I'm saying, man? To me, this is like the, this is where... And just so you know, people listening at home or in their cars at work. No one's gonna hear this or cutting the whole thing. Well, but you said, you Duncan, just this is just podcast etiquette one-on-one. When you have a guest on your podcast, don't say boo and give him a thumbs down, which you can't even see. Boo, this is, to me, this is where we differ as conspiracy theorists, is you think... I'm not a conspiracy theorist, that's the difference. You're, to me, your estimation of what is necessary to confuse society is far greater than what is actually... You don't need to do a September 11th. You don't need to do a fucking this or a fucking that. You don't need to do anything. What you need to do is like, get them two... All you need is like two generations where they think eating like five cheeseburgers a week makes sense, slow them down, get their metabolism nice and slow, and then like, it doesn't matter. And also like, defund education, make them dumber. Well, yeah, you don't even have to defund. Over 30 years. Just get them on their phones, get them nice and slow down, and then get them nice and comfortable, and then just kind of milk them. And that's all you gotta do. You don't need to do any of this shit that people like you think they're doing. You know, I don't really think you need to do. Sadly, I don't think you need to do that. I think you can just kind of like, at this point, the machine's running itself. You can just sit back and milk the herd for whatever the fuck it is that they're milking them for. All right, Kurt, we're gonna come back. I heard that. That'd be good. Hey, Kurt, did you herd me? Let's get the podcast going again. Hey, Kurt, herd. Is it Kurt or herd? But for real, man, let's just do an actual podcast. This kind of stuff we just did, it doesn't need to be out there. Let's just jump back into the fish store. So Tom Cruise, wait, hold on, I didn't say we're back. And we're back. So Tom Cruise comes into the fish store. Well, it's a supermarket. It has everything. He came in with his kids. What are his kids' names? Doesn't matter. It does actually probably matter to them. Nobody cares. I mean, like, they just wanna hear the story. He has that one kid, Suri, I think her name is that he has with Katie Holmes, but she wasn't there. It was the other ones that he adopted, I think. Cool. Great. Children three. Who cares? Okay. So he came in, but it's- He comes into the fish store. This is a really funny story. We scripted the whole fucking thing out for you, man. No, Tom Cruise is a Scientologist too. Just looking it up on- Fucking, damn it. I'm not gonna get in- Are you fucking kidding me, man? 57 years old. He looks good. We're gonna cut to commercial- So Tom Cruise- And we're back. His kids' Tom Cruise kids' names. Okay, so he's there. It's like his son is, I think he's black. Connor Cruise. Great. And then Isabella Jane Cruise. These are adopted kids that he has from, he was married to Nicole Kidman for a long time. That's, they adopted those kids, but then Suri Cruise is- Who cares? Tell the story about the thing. The fish. He comes in to get the fish. The store gets shut down. He comes in to get the fish. We shut the, we close the store down. We don't like officially close it down. We don't turn off the free, that's good. See? That's where- That's comedy. So let's see if we can combine the two. If you're listening, aspiring comedian, this is how your brain should work. Heard mentality and officially, the official, that's, if I was to put an album out about this story, it would be called the official story. And I would spell it like an Irish last name. O, postrophe, F-I-S-H. And then O fish, shell maybe? Cause it would keep with the beach theme. Yeah. I officially think you're hilarious. Thanks, man. No problem. I heard through the- That's not gonna work, cause that thing won't work. But I heard from a group of people, I heard that you're funny too. Thank you. Thanks. That's great. I don't know why you're using that. I heard that. Why you're saying heard, because we're not gonna do that thing. We're just gonna do a funny podcast, man. So this is starting from the beginning right now. What? We're starting right now. Like everything else is cut out? I don't know, man. It's gonna take three hours. God damn it. We're gonna cut to commercial. Walls. A big thanks to Raytheon for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH. Raytheon, it's one of America's top defense companies. They're out there working super hard to keep America safe. Right now, if you go to Raytheon.com and you wanna order, if you have the appropriate licenses and security clearances, you wanna order their new X-Class Hornet Ballistic Drone, use offer code DTFH to get 30% off. This ballistic drone is so advanced, it can single out people, not just based on size, but on age as well. Raytheon, defending America. And we're back with comedian Brendan Walsh. I know the guy who owns Raytheon. He's friends with my dad. My dad owns Exxon. You knew that. Yeah, of course. Which is also that's helpful if you wanna have a comedy career. Not that I've had anything handed to me, but I've had kind of, I guess you would call it an unlimited supply of cash. Yeah. From, it's not mine, it's my dad's. That's why we're friends. Yeah. Oh yeah, you inherited all that money. Yep. It's funny because we, and we get along fine, but generally we look down, like people that come from, cause my dad owns Exxon. His dad owned, I guess he owned Exxon for a while too. But we've been like generationally wealthy and you inherited it. Yep. So you're kind of. Yeah, but I work for that shit, baby. I didn't just inherit. Like I had to like do beach trips and stuff. Yeah. So I got sidetracked. Yeah, the fish store. You go, Tom Cruise, Tom Cruise is sun conner. But now that you're admitting you fucking inherited money and you're outing me for being an inheritor. I'm not out. No, you inherited a lot of money though. I've had, and this is where it comes in if you wanna pursue the arts. Hold on. When I work at Ralph's too. So I do get a day job, but that's for material. Yeah, okay. And by now they know you don't work at Ralph's. Tom Cruise, I used to. Fuck it, let's just, you know what? Let's just talk. We won't put the podcast up. Fuck it. I'm so sick of this shit. So the Tom Cruise story, we're done with, we're not gonna do it. Every time I try to give you a chance to break into the mainstream, you come in, you talk about every single secret. Well, I wrote down some things to talk about. I just wanna do a regular podcast with you, man. Here's an interesting thing. I know I won't talk about new system anymore. I do wanna lose the weight, but if new system does wanna send me free shit. Forget it, I'm not doing this part. I'm not putting it up. So here's something, you hear of plus-sized models, right? Plus-sized models, you've heard of those, right? Remember when Dick Cheney sucked your dick at the Bohemian Grove? We don't talk about anything that happens at the Bohemian Grove. Does that feel good? How do you like that? How about the time I took the tram to Dick Cheney's camp and the tram door open and he was slurping on your penis? There's no, I mean, really what the Bohemian Grove is, just like kind of a getaway for- I'm just curious about that. And I'm not even in the Bohemian Grove. I can go because of my dad. That's interesting. Well, I can go because of my dad and actually it's beautiful up there. How about we talk about your tramp stamp? You wanna talk about that? Why do you have an owl right above your butt? Cause I like the Tixie Pops. Okay, so really? So that's why you have the Owl God Moloch. You wanna do it? Let's do it. Fuck it. You wanna do all the secrets? Let's do all the secrets. I saw you getting gang bang by Dick Cheney. We don't talk about that though. Condoleezza Rice was face-sitting you and smothering you. What is this, the 90s again all of a sudden? Yeah, and Pearl Jam was playing in the background or something. Okay. And now he's changing the subject. So there's plus-sized models, right? Remind me not to put this up. And you hear, and this is why, this is where I get like all this women's lib stuff. This is why I think women's lib is a little hypocritical. Sure. Cause you're familiar with women's lib. Hey, what's in your pocket right now? Like how much cash? No, not the cash. I'm just curious what that interesting vial labeled adrenochrome in your pocket is. Well, I told you, we can get it from fish. We get it from mammals. Fish, sure. Fish, mammals. I don't think reptiles produce it. Okay. But here's the thing. This is some of the hypocrisy from the women's movement that I would like to point out is there's plus-sized models for women. I told you, you come to my podcast. We're gonna do the comedian thing. We're gonna do something fun. Getting into a bit. We're gonna do some funny, absurd shit. Well, it's not a bit cause it's a real alteration. Well, there's already, it's too much to edit out, man. I wrote the goddamn fish store joke for you. You started pulling it off and then the next thing you know you didn't. You do it then. What? Oh, let's switch the tables. I don't wanna do it anymore. So let me get this straight. Tom Cruise bought a fish from you. He cares, it doesn't matter anymore. And there's a long line of... The whole thing is activating people. Are you kidding me? The whole fish store story is supposed to activate operatives. Dumb, dumb. And you knew that. So that's why you do this shit. That's why there's... You hear this shit and it goes. What do you think we're doing here? We're about to do Project Fucking Bluebeam. We're about to open up the entire motherfucking world so that we no longer have to hide in the shadows. I try to get you yet another chance to fucking do a podcast where you don't out yourself a moment of redemption. You're fucking talking about what happened to Stanley fucking Kubrick. Are you crazy? I need you to... I'm the JFK Winston Lawson. Remember that name. Oh my God. You're going to talk about Lawson. And also, I don't want to get into it, but NutriSystem, if you pay for it, is $10.36 a day for a personal plan. I'm just going to do the fish store story. So that winds up being like... Listen, Kurt, cut all this shit out. I'm going to do the fish store story. Will you let me do the story? It's 10.36 a day. I have to do the... Brendan, I got to do this shit. If I don't... Well, this is why... Okay, so check this out. And this is why I want the system to send me shit for free. 10.36 a day. You know what the four weeks of that cost? What? $289.99. That's a month. Yes. I don't think... And then there's... Oh, free shipping. Yeah. So, I mean, that's... They give you a deal because they say it's $5.27, $25 a month. And then that's crossed out. It says $289.99. So maybe they're running a special... Right. But my point is just send it to me for free and then you'll get more people to eat your fucking crap. When I'm posting pictures of myself, when I'm all fat like a fucking whale. You put on hats. And because I have no fucking self-control. And I eat like a goddamn pig. I just have to do this. Sorry, man. I got to play this. Nuts for the activation or something. Yeah. I don't even know why you're... Why don't we just go... Go back. Why are you even out here, man? If you're not gonna do the... Do the dance. Why did you even move out here? Me? You got all the money in the fucking world. You talking to me? You got all the money in the fucking world. You talking to me? Yeah, I'm talking to you. You got all the money in the world. You do the... Just don't talk about this shit publicly. You're gonna fuck everyone, man. I'm not talking to you. I'm listening. Let me... We're about to leave. We're about to leave. We're about to fucking open the whole thing up. Okay. You're the one talking about Bohemian growth. Yeah, I was getting cut. Well, yeah. I'm not gonna even put it in there, but you're the one who's like, oh, I'm a conspiracy person. I'm not a conspiracy person. I saw Dick Cheney sucking your dick. So why? I saw... Dick Cheney shot a guy in the face, too. You remember that? Yeah. And also, Dick Cheney did 9-11. And also, what else did Dick Cheney do? Was one of the engineers of 9-11. Dick Cheney. I'll tell you what's not 9-11. It's the size of your cock. Yeah. Well, nobody has like a 9-inch cock. Yeah. Especially not you. Yeah. No, I don't. It's a perfectly average 5.1-inch penis. I came out of that fucking tram. And what do I see? Well, you're talking about, like, getting in trouble. Turn that shit off. If you... I gotta do it. If you want to get in trouble, though, keep talking about Bohemian growth. That's... I mean, I could talk about 9-11 all I want. Nobody's gonna do shit or JFK. But you talk about Bohemian growth. You're gonna get in trouble. You're gonna get in trouble. You're gonna get in trouble. You're gonna get in trouble. You're gonna get in trouble. I could talk about 9-11 all I want. Nobody's gonna do shit or JFK. But you talk about Bohemian growth. You're gonna get... Somebody's gonna knock on your door. Yes, so what? I'm not... I'm not gonna upload any of this. Well, we'll see what you say when that happens. I won't upload it. Um... Hold on. Let me finish this up. I was in that tea that I drank. So, you're working at a fish store. Yeah. I'll just tell the story. Brendan used to work at a fish store. They used to pass... Oh, a supermarket in the fish seafood department. Yeah. That fish supermarket in the seafood department. And that's also why I'm overweight, because I see food and I eat it. I'm on the seafood diet. Or I messed it up. Actually, I'm on the seafood. I'm not on NutriSystem yet, but I am on the seafood diet. The way that works is when I see food, I eat it. Six plus four is ten, minus two is eight. And Brendan was at the fish store, and they were passing fish to each other, bucket brigade style. One fish at a time. Bucket brigade style, one fish at a time. Yeah. At the end of the bucket brigade, there was a man whose name was... Jerry. Jerry, whose job it was... Or Dave. I'm sorry, my fish's name is Jerry. The guy's name is Dave. Thank you. Yeah. His job it was to what? Kill the fish. Kill the fish. And he would kill the fish for sushi. Yeah. They called it, and they had this shut down the store, so that Tom Cruise could come in. Well, we close it for, yeah. Right. We get everybody out. Tom Cruise and his kids, Connor and Isabella came in. Do you want some more water? No, I feel a little weird. I have a little bit more. Just have a little bit more. Okay. Go ahead, Kurt. Roll it. Great. Isn't that good? It is good. Is there electrolytes in that or something? Yep. Tom Cruise, Connor Cruise, Isabella Jane Cruise, his daughter, came in and ordered... Real nice. He was real nice. And they ordered the fish? Well, they went through the... What isle number? They picked up some other stuff. The isle? Fish isle? Eleven. Eleven. Yeah. And how many steps did they take down isle eleven? Well, let's see. I mean, from the door to... It's in the neighborhood between six and seven hundred, somewhere in the middle. Yeah. Maybe a little more than six hundred and fifty. They took six hundred and sixty steps to the fish. Maybe. And they ordered the fish. I never counted it. It doesn't matter. They ordered the fish. Yeah. Okay. And some of the sushi, it depends on how you kill the fish, because if you get the fish really scared, it produces this thing called Adreno Crow. God damn it. Well, that's what Tom Cruise wanted. Do I leave that what he ordered out? Dardum. Just dardum. This episode of the DTFH has been brought to you by VLM Information Routing Technologies.

It's like, and these ads, they don't have to listen to you. They know, you know, like for example, they know you live in Los Angeles. They know that California's sunny. They know you probably wear sunglasses. Anybody likes the sun. The point is this, it's a great time to be alive, man. And I'll tell you this, it's a great time to be friends with you and it's so nice to see you. You seem like you're doing much better. You've got a sparkle in your eye and I just, I would love to hear you finish up that amazing story about the time Tom Cruise- The Tom Cruise story? Yeah. So he comes in, well, here's what, we close the store down, right, first. The manager gets a call from one of his agents or handlers and a handler. That's funny. Chelsea Handler? No, she didn't call. She's great. One of his, she is good. Did you ever see she's got that thing, one of her specials is called like not gonna do it or no, you gone to be kidding me. Yeah. Very funny. I hope they bring back Chelsea lately. Which is kind of the you gone to be kidding me title is kind of like our herd mentality or I heard it through the grapevine. And also, what was the other one we said, oh, officially. So this is my official, no, Kurt, don't, my official Tom Cruise story. Dart him now. Dart him now. Get out the electric shock. Get out the electric shock. And we're back with Brendan Walsh, hilarious comedian. So we were just talking about this hilarious fish store story. Remember? Yeah. I work at a, I used to work at a grocery store in the seafood department and celebrities would shop there a lot. And when they would, before the celebrities would come, if they were like an Ellen DeGeneres, Beyonce or Tom Cruise level, they're, they're fun. I love them. People would call in and they would, they call ahead so we could get everybody out of the store. So there's no lucky lose or TMZ or anything. Great. And one time in particular, Tom Cruise was having a party and he wanted some sushi. This regular sushi, there's no special way. There would be a delivery, a delivery service, this guy, Terry, Terry, he had a van. He had buckets, not buckets, but more like, do you ever go to the container store or bed bath and beyond? They have those like bins with lids and they'd be full of water, maybe 20, 30 gallon, no, maybe 20. So how big the bins were, maybe like three feet, 20, 30, 20, 30, 20, 30, doesn't matter. And then the fish. So they'd be chock full of fish. We'd all get in a line. There's 11 employees in the seafood department. Yep. There'd be a guy, you want to be two feet, two feet, seven inches, 27, two. Two feet, seven inches. Two seven. Yeah. Two feet, seven inches apart from each other. How many steps did Tom, how many steps do you think it would take to go from the beginning of the store? Between 665 to 267, somewhere in the, or no, I mean, 665, Terry, no, it's okay. It's, it took somewhere between 665 and 667 steps into the store to the seafood counter. We would stand 2.2 feet, seven inches, 20, remember the number 27. Who killed the fish? That would be Jerry, or no, Dave, my fish, his name, Jerry. Right. Dave killed the fish. Dave would kill the fish. He would chop them up and it's sushi grade. What would Dave do? He would cut their heads off and then he would slice them up the middle and remove their, remove the insides and taste. But what would tell me again what Dave would do to the fish? He would cut the heads off the fish. Why? Why did Dave kill the fish? For the sushi. For who was coming to get the fish? Tom Cruise. So Dave did what? He killed the fish for Tom Cruise. Okay, Brendan, thank you so much for coming back on the show. That's Brendan Walsh, everybody. He's got a new podcast coming out called the World Record Podcast. It's going to be super funny and I guarantee you this, super successful because you just did a fantastic job on the DTFH. Brendan, where can people find you? On Twitter and Facebook, I'm also, I'm on the board of directors for, no. My dad owns Exxon. All right. That's great. We'll cut that out. Go ahead and just drug him up. If you want, we're doing some spirit cooking later. Okay, that's it. Duncan, if you wanted to come to our spirit cooking, bring a chicken. Great job. Just get him out of here. Bring a chicken. Just get him out of here. That's Brendan Walsh, everybody. It cuts its finger. Go. JCPenney."

Hello friends, it is I, Duncan Trussell, and you are listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour Podcast. This is my probably 20th attempt at recording the intro to the podcast. I've actually turned on Periscope, so now I'm doing this in front of a live digital audience hoping that in some way this will inspire me so that I actually get a podcast uploaded this week. I missed last week for a variety of reasons, one of them being a brand new addiction to the incredible video game The Binding of Isaac. I wish that I had some other good excuse for not getting a podcast up, but I've been snorting some of that sweet digital heroin last week, and the end result is I didn't get an episode up, and so I am deeply and profoundly sorry. I'm going to release two this week to make it up to you, my sweet friends. Today's episode is with Shane Stott. Shane Stott is the founder, CEO, and president of Zen Float Company, and these are the people, he is one of the people who produces float tanks that you can, that don't cost the same amount as Samadhi Tanks. Samadhi Tanks are very, very expensive. They're like $13,000, $12,000 to get one of these, and a Zen Float tank is I think $1,700. These guys are my new sponsors, full disclosure. I've had this float tank for about a month, maybe a month and a half now, and I haven't been talking about it because I wanted to make sure that it wasn't a piece of shit, and I wanted to make sure that it didn't leak, I wanted to make sure that it functioned in the same way that other float tanks that I've experienced have functioned because I'm not going to tell you guys about something that I'm sponsored by unless it completely works, unless it's completely amazing, and this thing is fucking incredible. I've had to bite my tongue in so many podcast intros because I've been having some of the strangest, most intense, beautiful experiences in this thing, but because it's a float tank and because it's a sitting pool of salinated water in my house, I didn't know if something could happen. I didn't know if all of a sudden something would grow inside of there. I didn't know if over time the thing would degrade, or I didn't know if the heating system wouldn't work, or the filtration system would break down, or if the thing would fuck up, and so I had to wait to start yapping about it because I don't want to lead you guys in the direction of maybe buying something really expensive that doesn't work very well. But it's been a month and a half and so far the thing has been flawless. You do have to take care of it. It's water in your house. It's 10 inches of water that has 650 pounds of epsom salt in your house. It uses two filtration systems, but you still have to take care of it and there's stuff you have to do each week, which is to measure the pH level of the water, to make sure that you have enough hydrogen peroxide in the water, and to make sure that you've got enough water in there. It's got to be 10 inches. So there is some upkeep and some maintenance, but I enjoy doing the maintenance. It makes me feel like some kind of weird alchemist as I take care of this pool of water sitting in my house. All that being said, I can't even describe to you how incredible it is to know that at any point in the day, if I want to, I can slide into a hole in the universe, into a womb. It's like having some kind of womb made out of void material sitting in your house. And it's an amazing thing. I really didn't, in fact, I didn't expect it to be as incredible as it actually, I don't know what I was expecting, but it's a million times more incredible than what I expected. It's one of the most psychedelic things that it is the most psychedelic thing that I have. And it's something that some of the experiences I've been having in there are so outlandish and bizarre and weird that I feel embarrassed to talk about them. And I talk about one of them during this podcast, and I just want you guys to know that when you hear me talking about it, I'm fully aware of number one, how woo-woo and weird and strange it sounds. And number two, I'm fully willing to write off any experience I'm having is just some kind of neurological response to being encapsulated in complete blackness. I don't, I don't know what actually is going on in there, and I'm very comfortable with the concept that there's no such thing as any external entities, deities, spirits, ghosts, God beings outside of what exists inside the neurological wiring of the human brain. It doesn't bother me as to quote, and I love quoting this only because I like saying it, to quote the emerald tablet of Hermes Trimestigerius as above so below. And so it doesn't matter to me if everything is just a neurologically assembled reflection of the external universe, or if there is in fact an undiscovered species of hyperdimensional disembodied entities that we have up until this point called angels, aliens, demons, spirits, gods, whatever. It doesn't matter to me if a person's encounter or the relatively consistent reports from all corners of the globe of people coming into contact with extra dimensional beings is in fact contact with extra dimensional beings or just contact with some deeply embedded subconscious archetypical symbols that are somehow hardwired into the human brain. So that being said, I've had some weird shit happen inside that tank and we're going to talk about it in this podcast with Shane Stott and we're going to dive right into that. But first, some quick business. Today's episode of the Dunkin Trussell Family Hour podcast is brought to you by warbyparker.com. Go to warbyparker.com to receive free shipping on your final choice of frames. If you want to get glasses, that means you got to go down to an eyeglass monger. And this is a weird feeling, man. I've gone to a few of these motherfuckers and they sell you these goddamn lenses, these glasses, the frames of these glasses and they pretend they act like these fucking glasses were forged in the fires of Mordor. You're already blind. You're not in a great situation. But the fact that these monsters at these eyeglass shops want to add to your disability by trying to yank as much dough as they can out of your wallet in exchange for some cheesy looking crap frames that are going to make you look like you're the judge of the next American Idol is truly an abomination. Go to warbyparker.com for a slash family hour instead of going down to one of these eyeglasses shop where some billionaire eyeglass vendor will hover over you like a vampire in an orphanage. You can go online to warbyparker.com for a slash family hour and you can try their home try on program. They will send you five beautiful pairs of glasses which you can try on in the comfort of your own home in front of your closest associates and lovers. Do you want to try on a seven thousand dollar pair of glasses in the company of blind fools who've been sucked in by the magnetic attraction of some inauspicious eyeglass vendor who doesn't give a shit about people who have disabilities but only wants to pad his already overflowing bank account with the money of the blind? Or do you want to try on these beautiful glasses in the sweet sanctity of your home temple where you can try all your secret poses from the side eye to the Ford glare? Listen, I don't want to have to take beta blockers when I go out to try on glasses and it's uncomfortable and a lot of these places they make it to the one there's one mirror in the store. I don't know if you've noticed that but there's like one spot in the entire store you could try these glasses on so you have to you can't do your orgasm face when you're when you're in Manhattan about to get your life energy sucked out by some kind of dark eyeglass gypsy. Warby Parker has prescription glasses that start at ninety five dollars including the lenses options include glasses reading glasses and sun glasses. Here are the key points that I got to read glasses should not cost as much as an iPhone. Your glasses should not cost as much as the device that's probably causing you to lose your vision. They use premium Japanese titanium and French non-rocking screws and that's one thing my dad always told me when I was growing up he said son only use French non-rocking screws just trust me.

through the portal anytime you're buying anything on Amazon they give us a percentage of anything that you purchase and it costs you nothing and I am a gigantic fan of Amazon I love it it's amazing to me I don't go anywhere anymore all the everything that I pretty much everything that I buy now is ordered either through Amazon or Instacart which I also use but there's really no reason to go drudging out of your house to buy stuff at a store anymore most of the stuff that you need Amazon's got this really cool thing which is fascinating but pretty badass which is that you can actually subscribe to getting stuff that you are definitely going to run out of like paper towels or garbage bags and you never have to worry about it again for the rest of your life every few weeks or months or depending on how much you are taking how much you're pooping and you can you'll have to be the you have to figure that out but I keep a schedule above my a little whiteboard above the toilet where I mark every time I do that and then from that I spend a lot of time putting that into an Excel spreadsheet which I send to a team of scientists who then give me an algorithm that I use to order my toilet paper you don't have to go through that trouble you can just guess probably need new toilet paper every month or a few months and Amazon will deliver that straight to your door you don't have to worry about it anymore that great cognitive dissonance that comes most people are afflicted by and it's pretty brutal to be struggling every day under the incredible weight of not knowing exactly when you're going to need to buy more toilet paper it's driven many people into the madhouse not anymore now you can overcome that awful subjective gravity by signing up for subscription toilet paper by going to Amazon but please go through our portal and bookmark it won't you a giant thanks to all of you in Australia who have bought tickets for my upcoming Australian tour in November tickets have

and and it's also in New Zealand as well I've never been to Australia I've never been to New Zealand and I just can't wait to go there very excited to see koala bears kangaroos and highly poisonous jellyfish which I'm sure even if I don't go in the ocean I will get stung by one I hope not I shouldn't have said that I'm not going to get stung by a jellyfish because I'm not going to go in the ocean in Australia or if there if I do go in the ocean I don't know if this is true or not maybe one of you Australian listeners can help me can help alleviate some of the anxiety I have going over there but from what I've heard many of the beaches in Australia are actually coated with a 17 inch thick coat of protoplasmic poisonous jellyfish gel the entire beach is just this throbbing alien pink veiny thing that if you come within a couple of miles of it shoots barbs into you and your children and you spend several weeks this is what I've heard I've heard that the many of the beaches in Australia are covered in deadly jellyfish and then surrounding those beaches are several blocks of people having seizures from the barbs of the jellyfish that were launched out of them into the people trying to get to the beach is that true or is that just a rumor let me know by going to Duncan Trussell dot com and posting there today alright there's the there it is thanks for bearing with me guys it is insanely hot in my podcast studio which is an obvious problem that is I've got to figure out how to fix I can't run the AC while doing the podcast because it's too loud but I can't do the podcast if temperatures in the podcast studio have risen to 115 degrees I think that I could cook an egg on my microphone right now so I'll work this out I'll figure it out if any of you out there have any kind of advice on ways to cool a space with a silent air conditioner that doesn't cost a ton of money or doesn't require me to drill a hole into my house please please let me know I it's it's definitely a gigantic problem and it's gets even worse when I have guests over to interview and they're broiling in here I've got to figure it out I don't want maybe I need to rent an office space but I don't want to do that because I feel like it takes away from what I really love about the podcast which is the intimacy of having people over at your house so help me if you guys know of a way to cool down a space that's silent and isn't going to make me have to do construction work on a home that I'm currently renting I am all ears alright let's get on with this episode today's guest is the

you have now become one of the great life changers that I've encountered because of this float tank that you brought over to my house dude I'm so glad you're loving it so glad you're loving it before you get going to this chat I just want to say for everybody listening full disclosure I am Shane has sponsored me so I guess you can listen to this and if you're a cynical asshole think that this is some kind of long commercial just know that even if I wasn't sponsored by Shane I would still be raving about this thing because it is definitely the coolest thing that I have right now so I just want you guys to know that this is not a commercial this is not I'm not doing this to try to promote a product I'm doing this because I have a float tank now and I've been getting into it with some frequency and it is blowing my mind and anything that blows my mind I end up talking about on this podcast sorry about that awkwardness Shane I just wanted to give a disclosure to yes please we like we set up your tank like a month ago and you were all about you know interested in ripping the tank and if you liked it you wanted to push it but then you held off everything because you wanted to test it for yourself for a long time so I think your listeners should know that that's exactly right yeah I didn't want to yes exactly so I've had this thing for a month I mean I've I don't know how much I've talked about it on the podcast probably a little bit but I definitely have been holding off raving about how incredible the thing has been in the small chance that it would explode or it wouldn't work or some part would break down or whatever and none of that has happened it is just this insane portal into nothingness that is now sitting in my house and so there we go now Shane my first question for you now that I've been in this thing for a month is what is your theory about what is happening when a person enters a float tank and lays in there for an extended period of time yeah I think well first off I think so much of your body and your mind your mental power goes to just monitoring everything around you so it's like you get it's like you're this computer and you have all these apps open one app is your vision one app is site one app is sound one app is all these things and when you get in a float tank it's almost like you're this computer that can then close down all the apps and run at a faster better speed I feel like your your thoughts better if you're meditating it's deeper it's less interrupted it's it's really powerful and then I also feel like when you're in there for that extended period of time your body shuts down if you notice that you can it's almost like your body starts to physically go asleep go to sleep but your mind kind of stays alive yes I think it's a really powerful place to be I don't think humans have ever had anything like that and it's just a crazy environment for just more powerful thinking and easier ways to get out and meditate and it's it's just really powerful it's and I think that's an understatement and I you know what you I'm sure you guys have heard people raving about float tanks maybe some of you have actually been in one before but it's I it's indescribable yeah the impact something like that at least the impact it's been having on my life because uh you know when I got it when the the initial thought is this is going to be a kind of novelty thing like you know this will be cool it'll be interesting but I completely underestimated what it does to you it because it's not just what's happening in there and I you know after a little bit I I'm sure we both have had weird experiences in those things it's the it's can you talk a little bit about the couple of hours after you get out of one of those tanks yeah so for me you get in and everything's turned off naturally um and you're just you go to zero and your mind shuts down and and everything is just I don't know if you'd just say it's nothing but when you get out everything's like really enhanced because you're you haven't had any sense stimulus that whole time and you get out and the sounds and music is crisper and brighter and your vision everything seems more alive and beautiful and it's it's just like you've you've turned it off and then when you open it back up your senses are more heightened it's it's it's pretty transformative and it's like a lot of the a lot of the benefit comes outside of the tank and in fact most of the benefit comes because when you get that flow habit going which you've probably gotten now that you've had the tank for a month your life starts to transform a bit and it sounds cheesy but you uh you just come from a more calm relaxed place and then and then everything in your life kind of takes a more calm relaxed tone around you and I could swear to god it transforms reality around you when you're out of the tank if that's is that too much it feels cheesy but that's real no it's not too much at all man it's I mean that's the this thing is like you know I have um so since I've been floating I've been getting into the writings of John Lilly who was the guy who came up with a float tank and that's a really curious story how familiar are you with that guy's stories a little bit I'm familiar that I mean I just wrote a book and I kind of recap what he did how he started floating lightly but when I've read some of his stuff like he has a book programming and meta programming um that was really hard for me he I mean he stretches the mind and and even even when I was reading I was like man this is hard for me to grasp but he's got some really good stuff too uh it's just man it's it's out there it's crazy but you you do you remember the history of how he came up with it like putting ocean water and the thing at first and you know yes so this is crazy uh the research I did for the book so I don't know if you're familiar with uh Glenn Lee uh he was one he is he's one of the he founded the Samadhi float company okay gotcha and he worked with John Lilly back so John Lilly built a tank in the ocean that was the first place he built it and it was in like the shallow part of the ocean like on a beach um so the water would come in and out and he could he could crap he could urinate he could use the tank and he could float in the salt water um with you know it's total pitch black and as quiet as he could make it so this was this was like he he had what was like a box with a inflow and like how was he dealing with waves coming in or how was he dealing with I don't I don't totally get it and I know the first float tank was like you uh it was vertical and they would put a chamber over your head to feed oxygen okay got and then and then he went to a laying down in the ocean but what people don't realize is so this guy Glenn Lee who started the Samadhi float company when he found out that John was floating in ocean water he's like well why don't we add so much salt that you know you float even easier and Glenn's the person who took the salt from ocean level to 100 saturation which is tons of freaking salt so a lot of people don't realize that that was one of the big leaps in floating and the float industry and it was made by a guy named Glenn Lee the Samadhi float company and and I think a lot of people don't even realize there's a history behind floating it's just something you've heard for me it was just something you know something you hear about like they're these tanks that you can go into and they're called uh you know I used to call them isolation tanks yeah that's what they that was the what everyone called them not so long ago but that has shifted right no one's calling them that anymore yeah isolation and sensory deprivation kind of had a taboo and so the whole industry started to just kind of gravitate towards floating like my first website was isolation tank plans but now the word is floating because it's so approachable and friendly and it's just more comfortable and I think it's more descriptive because the the term isolation tank kind of implies I don't know like solitary confinement or one of those sheds that they put prisoners in and prison movies or it kind of feels negative yeah it feels but it also doesn't feel like what it is because you're it's it's not like your senses are being cut off when you're in that thing at all there's your senses are seem to be being enhanced in some way and it's it's very hard to explain it is hard to explain it's almost like it's almost like you've used your senses in the same way for however old you are so for me you know 32 years and it's like now you're all of a sudden using your senses to feel nothing but you actually feel like your blood pulsing through your body or you feel the like the chills or you feel your mind you just pick up all these different things I wish I could explain it better but the senses are happening just in a different way but you the so to get back to this string there's a strange thing happened in in our history which is that a guy John Lilly got into his head that he should float in darkness and that there would be something beneficial in that practice and I don't know what inspired him initially do you know what inspired him initially to to build that thing I don't he was he was a was it a neuroscientist a brain researcher and he was a programmer it yeah originally is a programmer yeah and then he's trying to study the effects of no stimulus input on the brain and he was even trying to communicate with dolphins he was he had he had made connections with other beings from other realms or planets and it right now he was into it yeah he well that's it I mean he he but the contact with so I think most people are not aware of the fact that the creator of the floatation tank thought that he was in direct communication with extraterrestrials yeah and I don't think people know that and it's something people definitely should know because it feels when you're in that thing like you can dev you could definitely use it if you wanted to to make contact with something have you had the experience when you're in those tanks of a presence being in there with you yeah for me I would say it feels like uh I'm super connected and alive and there's energy in there with me but I've never felt like you know there's some being like a like a person well no it but not a person like okay so the have you smoked dimethyl tryptamine before no DMT yes no I'm so interested in that one though after watching that Joe Rogan documentary I was like holy shit well DMT for me and also mushrooms produces in high enough doses a feeling that I'm being communicated with by some kind of higher intelligence and the communication doesn't come in the form of schizophrenic style voices in the head though I have heard voices in my head once on mushrooms maybe twice a very long time ago yeah but it's more of a kind of compulsion or a sense of something deeper than your thoughts guiding you it's a feeling of being led into certain epiphanies by a kind of force that seems to for whatever reason want to remain anonymous as it's doing this kind of teaching so I've talked to people who have said well the tank will teach you is what they say the tank teaches you John Lilly thought he was communicating with beings from space and uh you you know you say it's an inner energetic thing but it seems like there's a kind of overwhelming sense that people have when they go into these tanks that they are making contact with something greater than them did you wonder what you wanted it feels like for me it feels like um so like what do you ever have do you ever do you ever think or feel something and your whole body just comes overwhelmed with like a chill scent like the chills and your hairs stand up yes for for me it's like that sweeps over my body and I feel like I'm connected to the universe like the universe loves me whatever the hell the universe is for anyone it's something out there is like looking out for me and loving me and I feel this feeling sweep over my body and it physically it's sensory and the hairs stand up and it feels good and that's that's the closest I've gotten to anything like that in the tank well that I mean that's it it's just a different version of the same thing and I and it all goes back to how mysterious it is and how strange that for whatever reason floating in water it's been heated to 93.5 degrees in darkness produces a mystical effect uh I yeah I've been reading um this great book by Huxley you guys should check it out I'm sure most a lot of you have already called the perennial philosophy have you ever heard of this book Shane no so this is really good it's just a book about the where the world religions like the ideas that seem to repeat in all the world religions all the mystical traditions and one of the ideas is the the concept that the self as we understand it is in some way getting in the way of communing with the universe that oh sorry then please go ahead I was gonna say I totally feel that way like I feel like what's happening in a tank is always happening to you but you're so distracted and caught up in your own little human ego scenarios and what everything means and all the thoughts and all the figuring but I feel like that it's always channeling towards you it's only because you get in the tank that you access it it's like you get in that radio you know it's like a radio amplifier it's what it feels like to me it feels like the communications always there but my bullshit's in the way right that there you go okay so it's like so the tank is kind of functioning as a filtration mechanism that is if you're in there long enough and it definitely seems like you need to be in there for over an hour to me like if I'm not it seems like the things start getting interesting right around the second hour in the tank I that was one of my big mistakes is I floated so much under an hour and I used to float before work and I'd do like 30 45 and then it was even not so long ago I started getting in over an hour and I was like oh I've been missing out because there is a your body there's like a gear shift as you go longer so anyone anyone floating I'd recommend going more than an hour no it's to me it's two it's like an hour you go in for an hour and it's a bath you go in for an hour and a half and it's like deep deep relaxation and for me hour two that's when I start seeing some weird fucking shit in there man like so far I've been it's like and I look I don't know what it is I saw a lot of it I imagine is stuff that's already been seated into my mind by reading all this other stuff or listening to people talk about it I don't know what it is man but and God forgive me universe and and people listening because now I'm the goddamn burnout talking about seeing aliens in his float tank but I'm not kidding man like I've had a few crazy things happen to me in there so far what I want to hear well one of one of the one of them is real quick glimpses and again what happened what's happening in there you guys if you've never floated before is you seem to be going into that place right before you fall asleep like you're you're sort of in this liminal place between waking and sleeping your body super relaxed and any of you know that when you're laying in bed right when you're about to go to sleep you start having some pretty weird thoughts and dream states but you're not quite asleep so I'm fully willing to write all of this off as some kind of subconscious symbols or something floating up to the surface because I'm about to fall asleep or at least the skeptical side of me will do that then unskeptal side of me thinks that it's a goddamn antenna or something for well no because it's like you're so here's here's the thing and I'm sure you guys have heard if you've ever listened to Rogan or Terrence McKenna or any any psychonaut out there me then you've heard the truth which is that we are all in space right now there's no way around that we're in space and and there's an illusion around us right now that we're not in space because we're surrounded by the atmosphere of the planet that we're currently stuck on because of a gravity well as that's the result of the mass of the earth pushing down into the time space continuum it keeps us all stuck to the planet but we're in space if you get rid of the planet in the atmosphere right now if I could make it vanish in the last few milliseconds before you were ripped apart or died in the vacuum of space you would realize that uh you're you know in space you're in and you're in space literally we're there's no way around the fact that we are in fucking space right so when you get into a float tank uh what's happening is you're weightless and you're you've been given the sense of a reprieve from the effects of being stuck in a gravity well and you've been given a reprieve from photons blasting in your eyeballs and you've been given a reprieve from all the illusions that happen when you're on a planet where there's an atmosphere and now you're in blackness you're floating in blackness right you're in dark you're in blackness so uh you are now in space and this is where it gets into Timothy Leary's idea of the fact that human beings are meant to colonize space that there's some dormant aspect of our DNA that's waiting to be activated by weightlessness that uh in the same way that a pig when it escapes from a farm and gets into the woods it begins to transform into a bore oh yeah it's pretty cool man those cute little pink pigs man you let them run around in the wild and they grow tusks and turn dark colored and get fierce and big it just activates something yeah for sure oh i thought it was like a breed thing that's crazy and and and Tim Leary talked about the very similar kind of thing and humans the the idea that there's a dormant part of our DNA that the moment we start encountering weightlessness will begin to be activated and it's like a different circuit of consciousness is what he called it so based on those concepts or based on the idea that we're actually in space that we're meant to be interstellar travelers you could say that when you get into a float tank and experience weightlessness mixed in with the darkness you start activating dormant parts of your DNA and begin to experience these heightened states of consciousness that are waiting for us once we finally manage to colonize other planets or move into interstellar travel you know obviously it's all bullshit hippy theorizing i don't fucking know man but when i've been in that tank i have had a few times god man it's so embarrassing saying this but it's my it's a podcast and i always have told the truth even if it makes me seem like a complete lunatic i've had several flashes of those fucking gray alien things but like they're like wearing robes and like they seem to be like peering up into like the stars like they're looking at the stars they're not really paying attention to me it's not like they're there it's not like they're aware of me i've seen that i've seen some pretty quick vivid flashes of beautiful like interstellar views like suddenly it'll seem like there's stars inside the thing and then the most insane thing that happened recently the one that got me like that it was so intense that i like came out of the float tank and went stammering to my girlfriend like i can't Jesus you can't say i can't really but so weird man you guys i almost thought i'm not going to talk about this shit because of you got it uh and ps let me just say you guys this is not on drugs like i'm not taking anything in there like except maybe a little marijuana but i've noticed that it's better when i'm not high that there's more of an effect when i'm not stoned than when i am stoned which is really has been a real shocker for me but the the the weird one was i almost don't want to talk you have to i saw big i saw bigfoot in there man shut up okay i was laying there and like i reached down underneath me and i and it felt i just felt this hairy hairy um thing this mass it was a big foot and we we made love in the tank oh wow so no what happened was uh i'm laying there and uh obviously you're laying there i'm laying there and i suddenly it just there's a sense of a presence man god i just i'm gonna sound like such a fruit like i well like i never like i don't sound like a fruit all the fucking time what do i do i think i am anyway i so yet i had the sense of a presence the very same feeling of a presence i get on dmt or mushrooms no no substances in my body outside of the residual massive amount of marijuana that's always in there just based on residual stoner effects i hadn't gotten high that day i'm floating in there sense of a presence and a feeling of something being in there in the uh god i'm really diving into the ocean of crystals right now you guys just know i'm fully willing to say this is my subconscious i'm willing to say this is placebo i'm willing to say it's a projection i don't make any claim that this is some external spirit or something but damned if there wasn't this feeling that the thing was telling me its name was michael and uh yeah but it wasn't talking it was just like that's the sense it's like it seemed kind of excited that i was aware of it uh yeah and then it was like pointing out this like energy block at my heart chakra and it was like compelling me to breathe into that place it is sort of like watch what happens when you just breathe into that so i start breathing into it and it felt like my body was getting stretched like stretched apart or something like i started expanding expanding expanding and it was just too much and that's when i sat up and was like what the fuck and got out of the tank it was like that really happened to me man and you know maybe it was a dream maybe it was i don't know what it was but god damn it it was one of the more intense psychedelic moments of my life and that was sober entertain sober cold stone cold sober in that son of a bitch so this this michael this is an unknown michael or did you know a michael or something well i know plenty of michaels but yeah this is i mean it wasn't saying like my name's michael let me heal you it's like just this feeling of like a a sense of a being a presence it's a force a thing i don't know what it is man but it was it was definitely happened and as a someone who is my job reports my experience to the world i gotta say it definitely fucking happened has happened has happened since my theories it's michael jackson that's what i'm thinking i hope not i would suck you you were naked in the tank right shut up that would suck so bad if you just like you get into you finally get your flow tank you're excited because you've heard all these weirdos talk about the crazy shit that happens in them and all that happens is you just see michael jackson it just just floating there in front of you just dancing smiling that would be i would you know what man you would refund your money if that's how it goes you would refund the money if people buy the tank and they see michael jackson in the tank yeah it's scent scent proof whatever like a recording or something so you here's what's interesting you you are you have you're a float tank manufacturer you're someone who believes in the experience so much that you have you actually prior to starting your business you are building tanks on your own yeah but you you seem to have a more grounded experience in those things totally what's weird is like the the majority of the benefit and the reason i float is like uh it's the relaxation and it's the calm life and it's for me it was panic and anxiety but i just hearing you talk and when i hear like joe rogan and these people go on these crazy adventures in the tank and i've just dabbled in those adventures um it makes me want to go for something deeper and i it makes me wonder if i need substances to get deeper no i don't think so man you know i i was actually reading john lowley and he was saying that because this experience he was you know it's weird he's kind of mysterious about it he's like i don't even want to tell you what's really gonna happen in there but you know he's he seemed to say at least for the first year or so or six months don't do any substances just get used to how to float can you talk a little bit about that i don't think people are aware of the fact that floating is not something that you the first time you get in there it's it's not you have to learn to float can you talk about it a little bit yeah i mean people people usually get in a tank and they one of the first problems people have is they're like oh what the fuck do i do with my arms and they're putting them up or down or folding them on their chest and it's they're they're all weirded out and then the next thing you always hear is my head sinks my head's too low or or like their body is keeps tense and they every 10 minutes they go oh what the what the hell you know i'm i'm like flexed my muscles are flexed i'm holding my head a certain way right but there's this after you float two three times you you learn to just let let trust the water i guess is what you would call it but once you trust the water and you believe that you get enough air and you believe that you're not going to fall asleep and turn over then everything starts to really get good because you're just truly relaxed and trusting just like you're i don't know in the womb or something but in the beginning you're all concerned and it's so weird and and you're for at least for me in the beginning i felt like i was spinning or i felt like i was flipping upside down and you're just sitting there totally still but your brain's grasping for any sort of like orientation it's it takes it takes a little bit of practice it that we always tell people when they go when they want to try floating to float three times that's it's the third time where you're pretty much going to settle in very well you know and enjoy it or more than it took me longer than that really like i it's but every time that you go in you get back it's just it's it's so strange to think that you can get better at laying down in water because it seems like you would just be naturally be able to do it but you get it's a skill like you start learning how to do it totally a skill we're just i was just talking about this uh with tom wonky he owns the he runs the float cast but he was saying how now like you get used to like hopping in a tank and floating and you can hop in and get to where you like that state of float much quicker but it's like riding a bike like you got to learn how to do it yeah it's almost like for me it's learning to trust just let go trust everything's fine and then you let your brain turn off right and that is a weird because there's another problem with it which is that you're the moment you do start getting into that state whatever it is freak out you freak out yeah dude you it's like it yeah it's like that comfort and then your body goes push it yes like yeah and then you're out of it and you're like damn it and then you have to work to get back and then for me i'm that holy shit guy for sure because like anxiety is this prone i'm like prone to always checking my status of just how i'm doing and so like my body will let go in that water environment dark in my body's like wait a second are you safe it's isn't it weird man yeah it's really weird because it's like you're it's like you're when you remember when you were learning how to swim and there was like a certain distance from the edge of the swimming pool that you're willing to go mm-hmm before you would i don't know if you're swimming experience but you were always like aware of how far you even if you go out in the ocean uh and you and you swim really far out you you're always aware where the shore is because you don't want to get so far that you can't see the shore that's way too far out right you get scared and you want to swim back towards the shore well in the same way it's like the float tank puts you in a situation where it's not a shore that you're acutely aware of but it's your personality or your sense of self and when you when you get into this like whatever it is theta state i've heard it called or whatever it is then suddenly you are sort of expanding out past your identity and if you start having those these weird moments of pure relief i mean come on man do you know what i'm talking about like the identity your sense of self it's almost like the universe is having a fucking muscle cramp or something and it's manifesting is your sense of self do you know what i'm saying i just feel like self is always in my way it's the reason i'm not like more it's the reason life isn't more like floating for me and that's peaceful and calm and relaxing because i've got a story that i'm like it's almost like i'm living a story and i've got bullshit and i've got relationships and i've got everything that gets in the way for me is that's the self gets in the way yes it's a big story that i have for this big person that i've become or who am i what's my story again what am i doing who am i it's it's y'all in the way it's in the way of what for me it's like it's in the way of so it's like i'm always pursuing as a self right me as a person i'm always pursuing and and want to achieve and become and and have these things in the relationship and get everything just right it's a state of pursuit where like in a float i'm not pursuing anything but the self is a constant state of pursuit for me and i don't know if that's like a mental disorder for me or what but i'm always in pursuit i don't think it's a mental disorder i mean i think it's a mental disorder called being a human i don't think it's a it's a mental disorder in the sense of like a mental illness though you know i just read actually that one in four people will have some form of mental illness in their life so if it was it wouldn't be that big a deal it's just a stigmatized thing but the the uh the the tank is something that shows you just how much your attachment to your identity gets in the way of of some other state of being and that's where that's where it's a teacher i think that's how it's a teacher because you do you do get these flashes and for me they're really quick flashes of this is it like i'm not here for a second i wasn't there like i don't know what i was but i wasn't there but by the time you're realizing you weren't there you're there again mm-hmm it's crazy it's and it's hard to fully put into words really yeah well i mean it's hard to put into words unless you want to start saying crazy shit like john lily one thing that he said in the book that i was reading and you guys can it's uh i think it's on kendall and it's pretty it's like five bucks or something it's a real short you read it in like an hour it's called tanks for the memories did you read this one uh i i feel like i might own it but i don't know if i've ever read it well it's pretty crazy man like you really you see just how fucking nuts john lily was and i mean that in the same way that anyone that i love is nuts like he was really smart he seemed incredibly charismatic and one of the things he said that really freaked me out is that when you go into the tank and shut the tank door and lay in there for some given amount of time when you emerge from the tank you're emerging in a completely different universe yeah like i wouldn't explain it exactly that way but uh i mean i i feel like uh my reality changes is as weird as that is yeah and he's like go ahead no i was just gonna say i i'm like a believer that your your inner state uh goes out into the world and reflects back to you so if i'm all if i'm all fucked up and anxious then the whole world's anxious and the whole world's a panic situation and the environment sucks or uh you just get out of flow everything's calm and peaceful and then all these things happen and life is calm and peaceful even even the same situation that if you're an anxious mind would have felt anxious uh i just feel like the whole thing is a reflection of your inner state that makes sense so man and and you're absolutely right and another thing lily said is that you can go into these tanks with some kind of question an intention uh yeah and and that there'll an answer might come to you when you're laying in there now before you get into that i'm sure everyone is aware and i'm sure you've heard of the of that of that people have more create more people have more epiphanies in the shower have you heard this yeah yeah for sure so it's like something about this contact with water uh maybe is energizing some part of the mind to produce these epiphanies but i had to go do stand-up and at the comedy store on saturday night and i wasn't really looking forward to it i was kind of like you know resisting the fact that i had to go perform just because i didn't want to drive to i didn't want to drive there and just all like bad wrong thinking so i was like you know what i'm gonna go in the fucking tank before my set and i'm gonna go in there with the intention of trying to figure out why i feel bummed about going to perform tonight when generally i've on and off most of the time hopefully the best sets happen when you're looking forward to it you know the the best comedy the best anything happens when you're not resisting and you die right so i go into this tank and i'm laying there thinking about this stuff and uh all of a sudden it just all this all these like jokes that i had forgotten that i'd written started coming to me and then like these pieces of a bit that i'm working on started fitting together and i went and had a great fucking set all because of the goddamn tank and and just because of somehow like it cut through all the resistance centered me and put me in a place where i was able to perform man that's amazing that that happens it is amazing i i do the same thing with like uh so for me i'll go to bed and i'll be like wow you know while i'm sleeping tonight i'm gonna wake up with you know my answer and i just try and give like an expectation to my subconscious and and i feel like the same thing is within a tank so if you if you're working on an issue you just go i'm gonna figure this out you know in the tank and you get in and let let it happen but i believe in the subconscious whether or not it's in a tank you know programming yourself to figure it out it's just it's a powerful tool people should use right yeah and so it's really interesting to me man it's so cool that it's so funny it's really funny you make float tanks you must hear people tell you these stories all the time right or am i the only lunatic who's reporting this stuff to you no that that's actually the the main reason people float is spiritual exploration and i and i feel like the industry is starting to gather all the people who are floating for you know pain stress athletics anxiety these different things so but the stories and the reason people float right now the current state of the industry is spiritual exploration and it's stuff like this this is it right it's gotta be man i mean i by the way like i i i like working out and going and laying in the water too that feels really great but yeah for me it's a hundred percent some kind of alchemical tool and it's in and it seems that what's weird about it is it just now it just came into existence like are there any in history are there any history if people done this in the past in some different form are you aware of any other precedent where people have been floating in darkness like this the only other thing i've heard of and admit you might have told me about it was uh like there's there's these people that used to go in caves for a long amount of time and i i have not read up on it but someone recently was just i was in conversation they're like you got to check it out there's these people used to go in pitch black caves for long amounts of time and it would they would have some crazy spiritual exploration that's the only other thing i've heard of that's even similar that's what's weird about it is it's these things have only existed for when when when when did the first tank when did samadhi tanks hit the market when did that happen i mean look i have the i'm holding the book right now probably like early 70s or something right yeah yeah maybe a touch longer i should i need to know this off the top of my head anyway no you don't that's good oh 54 Jesus so 54 okay so 1954 these things come into existence and they've only been around for this tiny little window of human history and somehow people just are oh most people are aware of them they don't really think about it a lot and there's as far as i'm aware how much research has been put into what's going on in these tanks i mean there's there's been a good amount but not huge numbers of people like not these huge sample sizes but what's crazy is there's a guy named Justin Feinstein and i talk about him in the book but he has a whole like a whole level of a hospital that is dedicated to float research it's like the first time any any sort of big time funding and studying has been done so he has access to people in the hospital battling like mental illness and that sort of thing to do all out big sample studies of floating so it's coming and i know it's going to get embraced by the healthcare industry and that sort of thing with all the PTSD and anxiety relief so i mean it's it's new i so to answer your question some's been done but not near enough and but it's happening right now so what is his theory is he done is anyone done i don't know how you could possibly do an MRI and those things but has anyone studied what's happening with yeah a lot of the original researchers they're they uh they were called rest researchers and rest researchers and rested for restricted environmental stimulus therapy or technique but the guys used to uh i don't know if you've seen a picture but guys they would cut holes out of their float tank and they would stick their arm out and they would float and they would measure their blood pressure and uh they're i think it was just blood pressure and something else like stress cortisol levels see that's curious to me uh because it seems like that's going to completely take away from the experience if you got your arm sticking out of your tank yeah you should just google images it's kind of funny but that's what they originally did but now with technology we we could just strap stuff to people and they could go in and get so much data i just think it's going to be easy at this point yeah i mean it's weird it's just so weird to me that it isn't something that's more it's something that's definitely on the fringe like i feel like a fucking weirdo i've got this float tank sitting in my house it's weird it's really weird man and it's what's else is weird is now when i get in the room where the float tank is my body has an automatic reaction to it like i get this weird like uh it's like a trigger butterfly feeling like whoa are you gonna go in there again i don't know man shit yeah let's do it and and it's like uh it's interesting yeah it's a very very powerful thing so wait your your relation to your float tank is it right now is it all positive or has it got a bit of like a sphere or oh hundred percent positive i mean if there's a fear it's just the same fear i get when i find myself shoving mushrooms in my mouth it's like a it's not like a negative fear it's just the it's not even a fear it's just more of anticipation anticipate and some you know what man some what's really interesting about it and i haven't cracked the code i don't know why sometimes when i get in there not a single fucking thing happens at all i'm just floating in the water it feels good i get out and that's it i dry off and nothing you know brighter colors every single for sure every single time that i get out colors are brighter uh my senses are more keyed in and that lasts for about three or four hours i've also noticed my sleep is better if i float oh dude sleep is like across the board everyone sleeps better when they float which is so weird this is why it's just such a mystery man people really need to be studying this more because there are so many parallels with psychedelics like if i take a if i have a good mushroom trip after you know six hours of either laughing really hard or being attacked by elves i'm gonna i'm gonna feel great like colors are brighter i'm gonna feel happier i'm gonna feel more open i'm gonna feel cleansed purified and it's awesome but this there's a very similar effect when i get out of that tank minus the demon attack and so that's something that i would be curious to find out what is that like it's it's it's not enough just to say well it's because you couldn't see for a little while or it's because you are weightless it's like what the fuck is happening that when you step out of that thing colors are brighter things are more beautiful god damn getting out of that i'm sorry you guys this is not it i'm not trying to i'm sorry if this seems like a sales home shopping network thing i swear to god i'd be raving about this no matter what uh but like getting out of the thing and then walking my dogs for example and it's just this beauty day it's beautiful you realize what a beautiful day what an amazingly beautiful world we're in right now it's so strange that it somehow peels back the callus that seems to grow over our perceptual mechanisms uh if we spend if we don't if we don't have moments of stillness totally it's like your body's constantly building a tolerance to your life and you get in there and your body lets the tolerance go because it's just not needed there's nothing to tolerate and then you get back out and it's all fresh again yeah yeah it's something like that man but look i gotta say i know that you based on maybe it's because you're running a float company and you're not who knows maybe you actually have been contacted by the aliens and they told you not to talk about it that's part of the deal but man it's so weird to me it's so it's so strange that you are like you've got you you've become like one of the main people in the float industry like you're the first person to build float tanks that people can afford you know or the or consumer based float tanks where it doesn't have like a somati tanks like 10k right uh 12 yeah worth it worth it i'd say i mean i i think it's like man i don't want to go on and on like with that kind of shit i'm sorry i don't mean to again i i'm i don't want to i don't want to turn people off i seem to seem like i'm trying to sell tanks for you even though you've sponsored me by trading one of these uh but and this is not a commercial this is just me wanting to talk about badass floating is but i want to tell you another thing that i figured out that i haven't tried yet but will definitely work do you know about uh uh cardboard google cardboard no so google cardboard is uh basically they created this like full you can like create your own vr goggles just with cardboard they created oh yes yes right so your phone slides into this right uh now i know this is something we talked about before but i'm now a hundred percent certain i've because i have cardboard i just haven't done it yet i have an old iphone but you can go like you can now download vr experiences for your iphone mix it in with google cardboard and get a not bad vr experience did you know about this i've i've seen the cardboard version are you thinking about going in the tank with it a hundred percent yeah because the problem with like the the main um vr goggles is that they have wires attached to them the big ones the oculus obviously valves prototype uh i think most of them have wires attached to them and also you know they have gears as shit in there that you could fuck up with water but if you have an old phone as most people do like if you have an old iphone i haven't tried this yet i should have tried it and then let you know what happens but if you have an old iphone and some cardboard you can print out the or you can order actually pre-built cardboard you could slide your phone in and you could go into a float tank without damaging your phone uh just because you're floating on your back like it's not it's not in the water is not going to go up over your eyes like it's going to stick out and you're not going to damage anything so you could definitely experience virtual reality in a float tank god damn it i'm going to do it after after after the today i'm doing it i want to be one of the first people to as far as i'm aware i might be the first person to do vr in a float tank i think so did you should post it seriously i don't think anyone's done it well it's that there's an amazing vector between floating and vr that somebody out there whoever out there is listening any kind of tech people out there would make it happen creative floating experience and i will test it out for you and talk about it but it's going to be like that it's something that can mix really well together i think just because especially any kind of vr that involves space floating in space that was just thinking about that like what kind of app would you want what would you want to do with no gravity and no nothing probably flying through space or floating over the because a weird thing will happen for me when i'm laying there where instead of feeling like i'm laying on my back it'll feel like i'm floating above something looking down so any kind of like flying over a city any kind of thing that makes it appear that the ground is above you that would work too because you're weightless so there really isn't an up or down you know so anything like that would totally work too and then anything to do with sound anything that you can control by moving your head anything that involves like if you where you're looking is where you go so that you only have to be very slight head movements that would work too it'd be way cool way cool so dude you gotta try and let me know yeah i'm gonna try it i'll try it i'll try it right now after after we finish this uh interview i wanted to talk to you a little bit about where you see the floating industry going like what direction is this going in it seems like there's like a float renaissance happening what do you think is going to happen with this strange industry uh let me let me just talk through it and see if i can figure it out with you um it's like two years ago i was at the float conference my first one and there was like 200 something people and there was a handful of manufacturers and then uh that was two years ago okay and then last year i went and there was way more people and then there was way more manufacturers and all these float tank manufacturers so like there was a handful that didn't even look like they had ever floated before huh so it's it's growing and like the the cash people are you know people are coming in to make a good business out of it right and that's fine that's just how humans work whatever but it's growing huge uh my thing is like if they can get the science behind it which i know people are working on like guys like Justin Feinstein if they get the science behind it and then it will get embraced by mainstream and get embraced embraced by healthcare and then you've got this giant therapy just like just like a acupuncture a massage it becomes one of these giant holistic therapies that is just a staple or yoga um but it's not quite as easy it's not quite as easy as those other therapies because the naturally you have to have this big tank filled with water but i don't i don't know i i couldn't see this being a fad because it's just it's like uh it's too it's too beneficial for too many people so i don't see it being like i don't know what's a health fad that came and gone oh i don't know uh i don't know uh hold on let's think of a good health fad that came and went there's so many well like that vibrating thing remember that weird vibrating oh yeah yeah yeah the shake machine like from the 50s yeah yeah so what if this is just a giant water filled shake machine i don't think it is this is not a fucking water filled shake machine man i know that you have to probably enter maybe i'm just a crazy stoner i i'm lucky because i'm a comedian i get to say whatever i want and maybe because you're running a business you don't get to say so much or maybe you just haven't had these experience this is not a fucking shake machine this is an interdimensional portal that psychonauts should have as a requirement in their house because it's the i mean i haven't done it yet man but just the fact that sitting here is a is a as a as a hole in the universe that i could climb into under the effect of any psychedelic i want without having to worry about driving home and i can stay in there for as long as i want fills me with such a sense of excitement and dread i can't even describe it because i know i'm going to do it one day i know one day i'm going to eat a bunch of mushrooms i'm going to climb in that fucking tank and i don't know what's going to happen to me terrified if you need if you need someone to like sit outside the tank and like make sure you're okay i'll i'll be there for you man don't worry i have interdimensional beings floating around me at all times so don't worry about that i'm apparently like i have some kind of thing called michael that's nearby all the time dude i'm like i'm telling you man if i keep going in that thing i'm on a direct course with starting my own drum circle and renaming myself a patchy that's so funny i i don't know why but uh so when i originally started floating um it was panic and anxiety right yes and it was meditation for these really daily functional like i need to live and not kill myself so floating helps um and it and then after i kind of got the hang of it and enjoyed it then it was like i was all hung up on you know having these big giant spiritual voyages and they would happen sporadically but the but the real benefit came regularly as the calm relaxation no anxiety no panic life is good but as you talk it's like i i've i've almost lost some of that spiritual voyager it's weird i mean you make me want to go back because even that this book that i recently wrote for floating it addresses all of the things that aren't even necessarily spiritual exploration so i don't know if this is my place to spread it into that you know into these other benefits i think it's your i think it's good man i i yeah because look no no one's gonna take this shit seriously if every single person who talks about is like there's angels in there man i'm telling you it's like the old telescope minus the telescope bro no one wants no one no insurance company wants to hear about some bathtub for stoners they and and look i i think that if i had if i had to pick between witnessing some kind of extra terrestrial species gazing off into the void at at the galaxies that exist around us at all time that we can't see because we're being blindfolded by our own optic nerve or having a freedom from anxiety i think i'm gonna take freedom from anxiety man you know what i mean i can watch aliens anytime that i want uh just by turning on the tv there's plenty of sci-fi movies out there maybe they exist maybe they don't but that ever present dreadful sense of not fitting in or feeling at peace in the universe is something i think that afflicts a lot of people and uh if if the tank if if methods within the tank could be developed that help people overcome that then i think that it could be an incredibly useful tool for people it was it was so big for me but when i think about it like let's say that the car was invented by guys who love racing cars because that's the most exciting awesome intense thing you can do in a car but then you know this car is invented might as well you know drive it to the store might as well go camping might as well make a different car that helps with whatever so i'm wondering if it's like just taking this shape where i mean fundamentally the spiritual expression is why floating exists and and every book you read that's kind of the main theme but when you hear these stories like one of the ladies who bought one of our float tanks during the kickstarter her name was lin taylor she has fibromyalgia which is a pain disorder and after 10 years of being on all these medications and just suffering she floats and within like two months she's off all of her medications wow i know and then there's this ultramarathon runner who he runs 100 mile an hour or 100 mile outdoor races and he cuts his recovery time from two weeks to one week and there's this guy who was in this firefight he has ptsd he was in the in the army and he gets back he's like a raging alcoholic his life's a mess and then he starts floating and he gets his life together and he's public he speaks publicly with something he couldn't even dream of doing it's so like all these stories are like all this in a tank you know but but i thought the point was spiritual exploration but it's that's really heading in this big broad mainstream place well yeah and you know man one thing that i i've noticed is that the more you i can actually witness the part of myself that kind of wants to squeeze a goddamn spiritual experience out of everything and you know like the cup that i'm when i'm it's the same thing like when i meditate the best moments of meditation for me have always been when i managed to not have anything that i'm trying to get out of it when i you know when there isn't a reason for doing it or some intention or some lofty goal or i want to fucking channel an alien i want to see the great godhead that all things emerge from but if you just get rid of all that stuff and just sit back and let go that's where it all happens and that's kind of a paradox i hate it actually yeah because you go in wanting and wanting fucks it up yeah it's not we but that's the way it teaches you because that's the great metaphor isn't it it's like the moment the moment that when you go into a thing whatever it may be with the desire to take something away to grab something or to get paid you know what i mean like when you go into a thing and you want to paycheck whatever that paycheck may be whether the paycheck is like uh making out with some girl that you've had a crush on forever or whether the paycheck is communing with angels or whether the paycheck is whatever it may be then it's almost like the thing will react the universe reacts to you like a boss who you know paying an employee instead of a friendship level but when you go into the thing in the same way that you go into like hanging out with your best friends whatever the experience may be like when i go to hang out with my friends i'm not doing it for some reason you know like that fucks it all up you know what i mean like if you're with your friends you're like all right guys let's really have fun today it's gonna suck like your friends are gonna be like what are you talking about weird what like yeah come on guys we really need to do this man let's we haven't had a good we haven't had a good time in a while so forcing it you're forcing it and it's like with a podcast it's the same fucking way like when you go into a podcast you're like all right let's really make this one a blazer though you know that those are not going to be great podcasts and when you go into the tank you know it will show you right away like all right when you're ready to stop trying to direct this experience you can have what you want but that's so tricky isn't it because it's like the how do you how do you get rid of the moment you stop wanting the thing you're going to forget you ever wanted it anyway so weird it's so weird it's so weird do you um have any do you have any plans for making like higher level float tanks are you just going to keep me like in other words like do you ever think about okay here we have float this the tent version now we're going to build more high-tech tanks do you ever think about that are you ever gonna go yeah yeah we're gonna do something for sure um we we want to make just a we we're gonna stay home float you know but we want to make ones that are easier easier to clean not that they're not that easy anyway i mean they're pretty easy to maintain but we want to have one with a little more rigid of a design so it looks just really solid we want to have a little easier water cleaning we want to have more i i personally love magnetics so i would love for like the door and the pieces that come together all to be more magnetic what am i what do you mean cleaning like i've been now maybe i'm doing something wrong because it doesn't seem that hard to clean at all i just put the strips in and add peroxide when when it needs it it's pretty easy like one of the things the industry is going towards is um ozone but ozone it has so i used to clean my tank with ozone it's it's just a it's a little machine that injects like pure oxygen air bubbles into your water yeah but it's even easier than like peroxide and and any sort of additives um but the problem is with ozone is it off gases and you're not supposed to breathe it so you don't want that yeah so so what we have works but there's a part of us that is still looking like is there any way we could just have like an external ozonator where you just set it in the doorway and it totally cleans your water in like an hour and then you just do it monthly or something and i don't know man i just throw so i mean i like maintaining the thing now like there's something in it that's ritualistic and fun you like do all these chemo you know the strength kind of bonds you to it it's weird but it's true man there's something it's like you're there to me as a 41 year old stoner there's something delightful about maintaining a rectangle filled with saline it's saline i just like it it's like fun it like it activates the part of me that always wanted to figure out a manufacturer lsd but knows i never will it's like you know what i mean it's like the it's like this nice chemistry thing that you're doing once a week we're like all right let's check the levels in my tank and it's fun i really like it i wouldn't want to take that away actually i don't think i would you know the only thing i could think that would be cool to add to the thing would be some kind of led light that you could control from your phone that'd be pretty badass i've actually been thinking about sticking one in myself yeah it'd be nice where if like you wanted the light to come on you could it could come on and it'd be nice we're working on an app too where say you have like a bright idea in the tank somewhere whenever you make noise it just records it so if you start talking it records your great idea well i think you know i think all that stuff's already made for you because it's already most phones have a way to activate them when you talk to them so what that means is that you need to have a something that basically what you whatever it is it should connect with your phone that's the idea it's an app man it's like some kind of app that you could control the tank from that already uses all the technology that's already there because you most people have an android phone or it's already bill it's already built yeah it's like combining the technology with with phones because again like it seems like the thing that sep is separating your tanks from all the other tanks is that your tanks are drastically less expensive and but because of that it's they're missing some of the things that the super expensive tanks have like the one that i floated in in austin that one you know it it like slight slowly come up in it and it's like it's great and it's badass but that's a 30 000 tank yeah or like when you come to from your float to like music fading in it's kind of cool but the thing with music is underwater you use transmit music with a thing called like a transducer right yes and it turns a hard surface into a speaker but with no hard surfaces in our tank we've had a hell of a time creating a transducer so right now we just have underwater headphones oh yeah that's cool yeah underwater headphones is fine i mean all that i like yeah that's cool and but yeah i wouldn't want to try the thing about these things i like is they're low-fi and they fucking work and it's cool man it's like yeah it's it's it's like it works like i don't know the thing i was thinking as i was floating i've been floating in there is if suddenly i had a shit ton of money would i buy a really expensive float tank in i thought i'd go ahead you know please go ahead no i just said i thought about that too like like there there's something about the experience of these crazy spaceship float tanks you know but then every time i really think about it i'm like oh well i'm just going for nothing and this provides it so it'd just be like a i don't know a style statement or something like hey look at my it's like a amazing float tank it's a hippie status symbol it's so funny it's like a burning man status that look at my fucking $40,000 tank yeah but you don't know i get it provides nothing that well i mean i guess it's like you know some of these tanks they have like i don't think it provides nothing it's going to provide like an hd tv in the roof of the ceiling of the thing it pumps oxygen in it's gonna like you know it will provide stuff but you the question is what do you want what do you want do you want a super expensive float tank or do you want i don't know all the other things that $30,000 can buy you know i i don't know but i don't think i would get i don't think i would end up getting a really nice one neither neither i think the float tends to cool anyway and like as i'm using it i'm always just coming up with like oh the next thing you know right you're such a fascinating entrepreneur in the field that you're working in is so it must be exciting to you it must feel something like a pioneer huh because you're sort of opening up away from for folks who don't have a shit ton of money and don't want to drive places to float can experience it it's so funny it's like uh i started you know building the tank in my basement and selling the plans and it's and it was the same feeling then only now it's like this crazy amplification where i'm actually providing float tanks that ship around the world and people are getting the experience that way so it's like this little seed feeling of building a tank in my basement just keeps growing and it's turning into something bigger than i can even recognize it's crazy i think it is bigger than you recognize that's we that's something to me that's interesting is i don't think you're quite aware of just what you're giving people uh which is kind of funny to me because it's it's i'm i mean it's one of the more profound experiences i've ever had is having one of these things in my house and you're giving that you're letting you're giving people who normally would never be able to pull that off either because of their living arrangements you know they don't have a room to put in a giant samadhi fucking tank or because of their money you're giving them a chance to like do it which is pretty wild man you're really accidentally or not so accidentally you're really gonna change a lot of people's pov from these things oh yeah and and it was like uh going through the process of the book and the and the stories and the people and then all the testimonials that we've gathered you know as zen it's like sometimes we sit back and we're like holy shit we're really changing lives like it started as like you know we could do it we could make these tanks we could you know get some people able to float but now it's like turning into like hundreds of people are changing their lives and it's it's kind of freaking me out to be honest why is it freaking you out just like uh am i am i doing it as good as it can be done you know like every day it's like am i that's how it feels is i guess it comes from a place of insecurity but like i'm in i'm on this in this place where i need to i need to provide this this great thing and i need to keep making it better and i need to deliver for people because i'm it just feels like a privilege i guess you could say i'd be scared responsibility i'd be terrified just running a business that size and then like you know mailing something to people that's so unorthodox it's like because not everybody it's like that if you see send people any other thing that there's like a common like way to repair it you know what i mean but this is a brand new thing so i'd be weirded out i'd be a little nervous if i knew i had a zillions of float tents out there because what if one pops what if just by bad luck or someone puts it in a room where their cat swipes at it or who knows what that kind of shit would keep would bother me a little bit but it could it could totally happen and then what the original float tank design like we didn't have a lockable door and i started freaking out about kids right imagine a kid dying in a float tank that we made and shipped to someone i would fucking kill myself but you would have to like i don't think people realize because i when i talk about it with people they're like aren't you afraid you're gonna fall asleep in it and drown it's like if you wanted to drown in one of those things you would have to work to drown like i don't see how you could drown because you can't get under the water no you can't and the effort to flip over and i'm just convinced that it's not going to happen too many people have floated like yeah you there's actually one death in a float tank what yeah and i think i think someone was uh on drugs or some i don't know i don't even know if it's true but i remember someone reaching out and telling me that like i like i needed to know i'm like uh millions of people have floated so man you well you know maybe somebody just decided to leave this dimension and not come back maybe they just astrally projected too far out and didn't come back or something just stayed i think that's probably what happened who knows i mean that's what lily was into you know this is why this is why john lily apparently at the end of his when he was using these things towards the end he was injecting himself with ketamine yeah ketamine ketamine's pretty awesome actually i've never tried it what's it like ketamine is like so this is like my college days things but you know it's just the animal tranquilizer your microwave it you snored it um but it was like you would get this 20 minute like drunkard feeling but then you would come back to real life and um you would be totally fine in fact you'd feel a little refreshed and it was just the most man but manageable drug ever and it made things trippy it kind of made like the dimensions and movement and the floor and kind of like uh like a beginning of a hallucinogenic type thing well i mean i mean i think that when you inject it i know that there i know someone actually who is receiving ketamine therapy for his depression and really oh yeah it's a it's a new kind of therapy they think it can actually have a very positive impact on people with chronic endogenous you know massive depression and and what you do is you go into a hospital they inject you with this stuff they give you a big dose i think they zap you out like you're gone for a while and after you do it a few times your depression apparently dissipates there's stud there's research being done in it right now you guys could check it out but it's interesting that lily caught on to that uh or just thought that there was some kind of benefit from it and i think for him it was probably more along the lines of how the fuck do i deactivate myself like that's what you're getting every time you get in there you just realize like i am like an elephant chained to a pole but the pole is myself and if i could just reduce this like it's like not only am i trapped in the gravity of planet earth but i'm trapped in the gravity of myself and if and in the float tank takes care of the first problem you've got to take care of the second problem and that's what it offers you that's what feels so fascinating about being in those things is you get this sense of like if i could figure this out and if i could just let go enough then i'll fly like i'll be everywhere at once it sounds so crazy dude i've been having such a battle an internal battle with like um with substances because uh substances for me like they they i can reach a place i normally couldn't reach like so say i needed to sleep and i take something for sleep i get into a better sleep or say i need to relax like especially with anxiety and or anxiety and panic i would take a xanax and i would go into this totally inaccessible state on a pill right and it's not a good habit i'm just saying kind of what it was but what i'm what i'm thinking now is like when i was this is crazy out there but um when i did all the substances and the drugs and the ecstasy mushrooms you know cocaine all this stuff i was so disrespectful with it like i was totally looking to just be an idiot with my friends yes and now that i'm in a place where i have this calm peaceful environment and i have a float tank like this device to even enhance you know these experiences now i'm going well what would happen if i did the same things with respect to it but it's been 10 years since i've done anything like that and i i'm scared of it well me too i mean i am too i i'm terrified of the concept of going in there on some psychedelic i don't know if you need to i don't think you do when i first when i that was when you when you were helping me set this thing up in the back of my head i'm like i cannot wait to take mushrooms and get in this tank and then i started doing it and realizing like and and noticing the difference between going in their stone and going in their sober and realizing like it's not it's like you're adding your it's like i'm trying to think of a good way to explain it it's like going to it's like getting a massage while playing death metal or something you know like it doesn't make any it doesn't make any sense at all i'm just it's like two two things that don't it's like don't that they don't they seem like they should go together but they don't necessarily need to go together you don't go ahead or it's like running with weights on or something it's like if the point of the thing is to allow yourself the freedom to merge into everything and you're taking a substance that has any kind of ego amplification yeah then that's counterintuitive it runs counter to the experience i guess that's what i meant one of the worst floats i've ever had was like i just got in the tank drunk and i was i was so preoccupied with my stupid drunk thoughts like dude what's happening like oh this feels this feels different i think it's different i don't know man i'm hungry and like but it was the worst float and so if i had any advice that don't drink and float definitely don't drink and float that would suck yeah yeah you're gonna i'm not a fan of it these days man i'm really not and i keep you can light it on fire you can light on fire and i've revisited it you know like i've i've revisited booze a few times since i stopped and every single time it's the result has always been oh i don't like this shit i don't like the way it makes me act i don't like the way it makes me feel the next day and also if you were drinking in a tank you'd have to piss pretty soon you know that's a problem too that is a problem well shane uh how can people find you how can people talk to you about this i know people are going to listen to this and maybe think they want a tank i know you say this but just i want to say it too before you buy a float tank and these tanks have my full endorsement i've been very careful about testing it out to make sure that it works because i know they're kind of expensive and they're going to be a big investment for a lot of people it totally works it is a wonderful wonderful product but don't compulsively buy one of these things no don't compulsively buy go to a float center a few times yeah i mean you got to know that you're gonna love it right opinion about it yeah go float first make sure it's even something that you want it might not be something that you like at all and that would suck if you spend a bunch of money on the salt and the tank and realize it's just not your thing so here's the go ahead sorry i was gonna say here's the thing too like say you love floating but you want to float but like you know once or twice a month float center is perfect for you i think even three times a month you know the float center fits but as soon as you want to float on your own schedule whenever you want as much as you want that's the time when you go to home floating but otherwise the a float center experience is nice it's like a spa um everyone takes care of everything for you so it's it's it's what depends on what type of floaty are but there's nothing like being able to float in your home whenever you want however long you want nothing like it it's nothing like it's one of the most insane things to be able to open up the tank and look through that weird entryway into darkness and then climb in the door shuts and you are in nothingness and that is wild man it's really cool i'm going to go get in it right now i'm so it's so i'm so into it i'm so grateful to you for uh sponsoring the show and for letting me have one of these things man really like i can't thank you enough it's it's had such a positive impact in my life and i'm sure it will continue shane thank you so much for coming on the show how can people get in touch with you for sure so um so getting ahold of me if they're interested in having a float tank in their home zen float co is the company so zenfloatco.com you can research the tank you can look at testimonials you can see what you're gonna get you can get shipping estimates all the above that's the place to go if you want to get a float tank for your home for me uh the thing i'm working on right now is the float book so the the book's called the float tank cure if you go to the float tank cure dot com you'll see the book and that covers all the stuff that's not as trippy but it's all these crazy benefits that are coming from floating so check out that if you're interested the book launches for the float conference here in like a week on the 11th so check that out if you're interested and then i have all my philosophy shit on my own website shane's dot com i got all sorts of stuff groovy man well thank you so much and i hope you'll come on the show again dude i'd love to and and if you ever want me to come out and check up on your tank or whatever it was so much fun hanging out with you so just yeah that was a blast i will let you know um but it seems like right now it's doing pretty good but we'll see maybe maybe you can you can be one of our uh testers frag version too yes awesome or maybe when i figure out these vr goggles we can uh somehow figure out a way to implement that into the tank that'd be cool awesome okay cool man

Your friend and my Santa Claus. Hello dear friends. Tizai, Duncan Trussell and you are listening to the Duncan Trussell family hour, Hare Christmas. If you're like me, then right now you're laying naked on a bare skin rug, rubbing scented mentholiptus cream into your nipples and staring out over the beautiful forest that surrounds the Christmas palace that you go to every Christmas. You've just counted the mini coins in your gold room and placed a Christmas ham into your gigantic Christmas oven and now the sweet smell of that ham rolls through the house, mixed in with the delicious odor of your lover's musky underarms. As she does aerobics in front of you, in front of the fire, her earrings made of diamonds shaped like Christmas trees and her tongue lipping her slightly chapped Christmas lips as she gazes upon you as though she is gazing upon a freshly born cosmic god. If you're like me, then you're probably about to do 600 pull-ups and go running through the vast acreage surrounding your Christmas palace and if you're like me more than likely on your run, you will encounter a massive ram that has been wandering on your property for the last several months and if you're like me, you will dive upon this Christmas ram, wrestle it to the ground and just as you are about to choke the life out of it so that you can kill it paleo style and truly experience what it means to be a free hunter-gatherer, that ram will magically turn into a beautiful forest nymph and try to seduce you but if you're like me, you will not be fooled and you will whisper into her ears the ancient scripture from the dark text that is kept in the basement far below your Christmas mansion and she will yet again transform into a lizard-like being the source of all evil in the known universe and if you're like me, you will not be afraid but you will bite off her tongue and spit it into her face and she will transform yet again into you and if you're like me, you will gaze lovingly into your own eyes and hold yourself for Christmas gently making love to yourself on the soft, beautiful forest floor that surrounds your Christmas mansion. I hope that you're like me and I hope that you have that plan for this Christmas and boy, what a great episode we have for you today.

Welcome to the DTFH, the great Zach Leary. Zach Leary, welcome back to the Dunkin' Trussell Family on our podcast. Hello. Dunkin' super hippie, what's up? You're the super hippie, man. You have to be of all hippies the ultimate hippie. Am I? Well, I mean, if you think about it, there's your... I mean, this is something that weirdly... Well, I guess because the last podcast we were with Gay Dillingham and talking about the movie and didn't really have a chance to ask you, I think, a question that's probably on a lot of people's minds, which is what is it like to have Tim Leary as your dad? Well, I mean, it is a good question. It's a fair question. There's no question of... God, there's so many times we're going to say that word. Of course, it's fair. It's a fair thing to ask, but context is everything. You know, it's one of these ideas that I could only play with in my own life as I got older because until about the age of, I'd say, about 23, 24, there was nothing to compare it to. It's just he was just a guy. He was just my dad. He was just a guy. And there was no juxtaposition to look at the lens any differently. But as I've gotten older, I've begun to embrace the weirdness of it. Not just the weirdness, but really how special and extraordinary it was. How special and extraordinary he was mostly. He really operated in the plane of consciousness that I have yet to see anybody else operate in. Now, when this plane of consciousness, there seems to be a kind of divide between what's known as what I've heard called the psychedelic satsang and the spiritual satsang. And Tim Leary, Timothy Leary, he was the psychedelic satsang. He seemed to be a representative more of this. Whenever I've seen videos with him and Ram Dass, there seems to be some pretty severe disagreements as far as how the universe works between them. There are. I like to say my little metaphor for it is different rides in the same amusement park. Yeah. Ultimately, it's to in many ways, it's to the same goal, you know, self actualization, your self realization, ununderstanding or obtaining a map of consciousness that can, you know, ultimately help improve your life or whatever it is you're trying to get from the map of consciousness. They're just different routes to it, you know, going through the head, going through the analytical, you know, the, I guess, you know, the different larval stages as Tim would talk about. Right. And like the Eighth Circuit model is very much sort of like a Tibetan Book of the Day bardo, Tibetan Book of the Dead bardo model. Right. Is just escalating different waves of spiritual enlightenment until you get to what he called the Stuller Circuit, which is really just moksha and liberation. It's the same thing. Right. Just kind of a different mask. Yeah. And both Ram Dass and Tim Leary, they both seem to be attempting to. To take this very difficult to articulate state of consciousness and figure out a way to communicate it to people, to talk about it, to create a system through which people could achieve these states of consciousness. It just seems like Alper Ram Dass decided to use the symbols of the East and your dad invented his own symbols and was trying to create a newer system. Well, he did. And I think both of them share this quality in common that with any sort of mystical experience, you know, if you want to come psychedelics, bhakti, whatever it is, all of the experiences are very hard to articulate. I find them to be difficult to articulate. Yes. So Leary, Alpert, McKenna, Watts, they all this incredible gift of being able to articulate the experience in such a way. You know, first, you know, Leary and Alpert's could articulate this through the language of Western psychology, right? Yes. So that made them both very dangerous and very potent. And it was probably like the key to their success is they could, they were elders of the time, they were the age of the parents, not the kids. So they could take the psychedelic experience and sort of speak of it through the lens of psychotherapeutic realizations. Yes. And so that made a lot of sense to people. Right. There was so much logic in it. Yeah. It was like, oh, wow. Okay. And this is directly applicable to, et cetera, to Freud. And they had been, they had, they had the certification, man. They had, they'd been anointed. They did the work. Yes. They've done the work. Yeah. They weren't wackos out of left field. They had done the work through, through the straight system. Right. They both came up through the square system, you know, through Squaresville. So, you know, essentially just, just what happened. I mean, there's a lot of, you know, ins and outs to the stories, I guess, if you will, but he was, as he was becoming persecuted throughout the 1960s, you know, he became more and more aggressive in his passion for the exploration of the mind. But that's where it was at. Like people were persecuting the notion of having permission to explore your own mind and your own consciousness as you want. Right. So he was like full throttle. And you can see even in later works or, you know, middle works in the 70s, it was like exo psychology and info psychology and getting to the eight circuit stuff. That all came post 60s. Whereas Ramdas sort of, you know, experienced a sense of, you know, disillusionment of always having to come down. So it was sort of the same work. But then the language of the heart, the language of compassion, the language of love became just as potent for him. Right. Yeah. But I think the goals, I don't think they ever differed. And it's really only the. But the persecution differed. The persecution differed. No question. Yeah. Because your, your, your dad went through the archetypical, the same thing that throughout history has happened to people who. It was a heretic. Yes. He was. He was labeled a heretic. He was imprisoned by the powers that be for spreading these, this new information that it was completely harmless and yet somehow so disruptive to the, well, I guess the way the powers wanted things to run that they did everything they could to ruin his life. And they came pretty close, you know, doing four years of hard time is, is, you know, that's a lot. That's a good chunk. Is it true that I've read that he like came out of that a little different? Like some people say that it did have an effect on him that getting locked up for that period of time wasn't necessarily, I mean, it's going to have an effect on anybody. But no, he didn't come through unscathed. He didn't come through unscathed. There's no question. It took it. It took its toll. Yeah. It did. Of course it did. Of course it took its toll. But what's, what's so interesting about this part of the story to me and I have a lot of self awareness around that around this part is that this is not ancient history. This is not made up. This is not tinfoil hat conspiracy buffs. This is like, you know, he was a real honest to God political prisoner. Yes. In the 1970s. That's right. Yeah. By, you know, persecuted lead, the persecution led by Richard Nixon. You know, this is not a joke. This really happened. You know, there's no, there's no if ands or buts about it, which makes the, you know, it makes his journey definitely a lot, has a lot more like gravitas, I think, than, than say Ram Dass, you know, because Ram Dass, you know, he became so much lighter and freer and kind of floatier and airier after named girlie Baba. But you know, Tim got harder and grittier and, you know, he was really clinging on. But you can, I can tune into that anger and I could tune into that, what he must have been feeling a little bit, just because to me, they're, I, one of the most frustrating things about the society that we exist in is the fact that the prisons are filled with people who have done nothing more than wanted to explore different states of consciousness, using chemicals to get there. And somehow that is considered to be one of the worst things that you could do in the world. And sometimes some people have far longer prison sentences for ingesting a psychoactive chemical or being in possession of a psychoactive chemical than people have murdered. It's insane. Right. It's insane. If you're someone who is at the forefront of this and has identified that here is a substance that has the potency and the power to completely shift the consensus reality in the direction of some higher form of society. No pun intended. That sounds so cheesy, but some kind of like more advanced utopian state of consciousness for the masses. And you start getting locked up for that. You start getting demonized. I mean, people were like, you're making kids kill themselves. You're driving people insane. You're nefarious. Like he wanted to do it. Like his intention was to my kid jumped off the building because of you. Yes. Yeah. You're to blame for that. Right. So ultimately, though, I think part of, I think if Tim could be here today and sort of course, correct part of his journey, he was, and I feel sort of weird saying this because I do love him so much and admire his work so much. But he was anti-authoritarian to a fault. You know, if you're going to ride that wave and this, you know, that's your horse and you're going to bet on that horse all the way through and he never gave me name or never switched horses. That's a pretty, you know, a lot of heavy stuff to keep riding on, you know, and to kind of juxtapose yourself with that in society to take that place. It's just anti-authoritarian, anti-authoritarian. Whereas, I'm sorry, we keep going back to Ron Luss, because you and I are both fresh off of this retreat. But whereas like the merging into the one and kind of seeing the God and everyone standpoint or point of view is as just as much, if not more, you know, productive credibility to it in the long run. Sure. Right. Yeah, sure. Well, yeah, you're going to run a lot longer on that fuel for sure. Yeah. Now, so here's my question. When I was a kid growing up and I first encountered LSD, which was one of the greatest things that ever happened to me, I had to hide that from my parents. Okay. What about you? I did at the beginning. You had to hide it. At the very beginning I did. Yeah. I started getting into the Grateful Dead when I was about 14. Yeah. And despite what everybody thinks, Tim was not, he was not pro-drug for, you know, pre-adolescent, you know, young, prepubescent kids. It was not, that was not okay. So at the very beginning I had to hide it. I probably started tripping a little too young, smoking pot regularly, probably a little too young. What were the reasons behind him not wanting, because it seems like classically kids are taking psychedelics around 15, 16, 14 is pretty young. Pretty young. You're just not ready yet. Yeah. Your brain just hasn't, hasn't developed. It's just a, it's a, it's a physiological thing. You know, you don't have the brain mass and the experiential intelligence, the experiential and emotional intelligence to really carry the weight of what these substances can do. And he knew that. And he was lovingly trying to, trying to guide me in that direction, but the wheels finally fell off. And then he just was like, fuck it. Okay, I'll join you. And when it was about 16 is when we, yeah. Took acid together. Yeah. So that's so funny. Actually, Tim Leary is your dad and you had to be like, no, man, we just, you know, hung out last night, dad, not, no, we didn't, did he ever ask, like, are you taking drugs? He must have known. Yeah, of course. Of course. But no, and then I think my mom would kind of do a, you know, what do they call it in prison? They come and toss up yourself. My mom would kind of do that, come into my room, toss up myself, tear my shit up. That is crazy. Try to find my drugs. That is so funny. This is like, that's so funny to imagine Tim Leary, tune in, turn on, drop out, having to be faced with one of the byproducts of his work, which is that his son is sneaking out to take acid. Yeah. Wow. Well, we have time for a story. This is the podcast. Actually, you know, the first time, this is actually a really good story and there's a little bit of a lesson in it. The first time I actually ever smoked pot with him last day of junior high school, my mom was out of town. I remember she was in the Bahamas visiting some friends, just me and my dad, Ramdas came over. He was staying at our house that night last day of the day after. So it was the night before the last day of ninth grade, which in LA is a separation between junior high and high school, right different schools. And at that point I was smoking pot. So me, Ramdas, my dad were kind of hanging out in the living room. And Ramdas was like, give him a break. Let's just smoke it with him. Let's just do it. It's going to be okay. Right. So we did. We had this amazing experience. It was this really close, you know, sweet, very kind of paternal and loving, both of them really caring for me as we kind of exchanged the sacred burn, the sacred medicine. So we did that next day, last day of school, I get up the carpool. He's coming to pick me up and I see in the ashtray on the coffee table, half a joint left. It's in the ashtray. Great. But yeah, both Tim and R.D. are asleep, so I grabbed the joint and I take it to school. And last day of school, so in the corner of the playground, me and my friends smoked it. Yeah. We got busted. We got busted on the last day. We did. Somebody ratted us out. And then it was the last day of school, there was nothing they were going to do about it. So they had to call him to come pick me up from school and he walks into the Emerson Junior High in Westwood, California and he walks in and he just gives me this look, just shaking his head like, oh my God. And the assistant principal, I remember this very well, his name was Principal Sher. So Principal Sher, he was like, oh my God, Timothy Larry is coming to pick up his kid and getting busted for pot. This is amazing. Yeah. This is so cool. It was exactly of the right vintage to really get it. This guy and he was, he pulled him aside and he was like, look, you know, someday this may be legal, but that day isn't now. That's pretty cool. And all that happened was they wouldn't let me graduate, they wouldn't let me walk the stage of graduation. But we had this, you know, is this incredible, I mean, I remember the drive home that day and, and, and, you know, this is the 20 minute drive back home from school, just kind of the air of like, we gave you a shot, man. And you blew it. Yeah. And you blew it. Yeah. But you know what, man, I guarantee in the back of his head, he thinks it's the funniest thing ever because he would have done the same thing because it's the, he just must be seeing, it's so funny. This is karma. You know, he's getting to see himself in you being reflected in the exact same way. You're the rebel now. You've done it. Well, you was in some tiny little way, you've done what he did throughout his entire life, which is to go to the corner of the playground and get high and get busted for it. Really cool. So you, um, it seems like as life has progressed for you, you, the path that you have chosen has, has been something of the psychedelic path, but you definitely have gravitated more in the direction of Ram Dass and Neem Kurali Baba and Bhakti Yoga. Can you talk a little bit about the beginning of that for you when you found yourself being drawn into that path? Well, the first seeds were planted when I was a teenager, I think like every good teenager I would be here now, following the Grateful Dead around the country, and it had a great impact on me, especially the, the, the first half of the transformation. You fall, you, so you fall the dead for how long, how many shows? About a hundred. So about a hundred shows. Yeah. So the mode a hundred times, I think, somewhere in there. Yeah, you know, so be here now had a great reverence to me. There's, there's no question about it. And I wasn't quite ready to really get into what Neem Kurali Baba was or who he was or that whole thing. But then, you know, I had this other experience too, which I'll come back around to it. But as I started to age about age 15, 16, 17, any time I saw Ram Das, the light in his eyes, I mean, you've been around it now. Yeah. Couldn't take it. I couldn't take it. I couldn't hang out with him. I just, it was too much. It just was like, it was just, I had too much. What later I could identify as self loathing or uncomfortability within my own skin to take it. I just couldn't take it. I was like, who is this guy? And what is this act that's going on? You know, you thought it was that and I was like, why he's always like this. You know, he's always beaming, you know, he's always shining so bright. Then I became, I realized it wasn't an act, but how did he get there? You know, so how did he get there? And then I kind of shut it down for a while throughout my teenage years. But later on in my teenage years, I had a friend in the Palisades who became an Iskand devotee. He went to Pali High and he was getting rid of all of his stuff and he just gave away all of his surfboards and stereo gear and became a Brahmachari in the Iskand tradition. And he introduced me to the Bhagavad Gita and the whole Vaishnav lineage of things. Where was this here in Los Angeles? This is so this is when I was about 17 years old. So so he introduced you to the Iskand temple in LA. He introduced me to the Iskand temple in LA. He did the one in Culver City, the one in Culver City. And he did, his name was Anton. I forgot what his initiated name became, but he did book distribution, you know, book distributions. Yeah, he did book distribution of Gryffindor Dead Concerts as well. So I would see him around, you know, two or three times a year and be like, hey, Zach, you know, and he'd give me another copy of the Gita or whatever. And I read the Gita then ate it up and just, oh, my God. This is Bhagavad Gita as it is as it is. And, you know, I immediately was aware of that that translation was a little bit a lot, a lot of him in there. A lot of judgment. And so it was a little bit like, well, this is fascinating. What do you mean? A lot of him, like a lot of male pronouns, a lot of male pronouns, you know, you do not come to the earth before him. Yeah, sure, sure, sure, sure, yeah, nothing yet. So there's a lot of that and sort of a little bit of the mysticism, you know, stripped away, but that's OK. So I kind of found this whole fusion of the yogic sciences and yogic philosophy just kind of infused in me between Ramdas, between the Iskand movement. I started going to, you know, Sunday Feast here and going to Kirtan's and thought this was pretty cool. When was the first time you chanted Hari Krishna? Sixteen, yeah, sixteen. And, and I, you know, I did not become a Bhakta at that point, but I got it. I did get it. I remember just succinctly, distinctly going, wow, this works. Whatever they're doing. Yeah, I remember it's gone to Sunday Feast. So that's the first time you chant it was Kirtan. It was Kirtan. Yeah. And it was just, you know, kind of their very ecstatic version brand of Kirtan, you know, jumping up and down and dancing and the kind of the Lord Chaitanya dance that they do. So you got the high. I got the high and I got it and I understood that it was drug free. And you're like, what the fuck? I'm like, well, something is happening here. I used to think something's happening. The first time I did it, Laguna Beach, that's where I got introduced to it. My brother had been hanging out there and I was in Laguna Beach. You know, my parents were just horrified because my brother appeared to be turning into a hard Krishna and I was like, this is, this is cool. So I flew out to see him and I came and picked me up at the airport and gave me a flower from one of the garlands and I took it. And he, man, you know, my brother and I had this very weird relationship growing up, but I'd never seen him like that. He was so sweet and happy and loving. It was really wild, man. I'd never seen him like that. And, um, so I remember, you know, having like just all this skepticism about it and just, you know, I carried a little bit of the worry of my parents and, uh, but you know, I'm like, you know, suddenly you're at the Hare Krishna Temple, man. It's like, if you've never been to one, it's overwhelming. It's beautiful. It's beautiful. It smells so good and the incense and there's just nothing seems that terrifying about it based on what you've heard, some dangerous cult. Yet the aspects of it that do seem like a dangerous cult are kind of awesome because it's like, whoa, cool. This is real. This has got some serious pull. Like if you let yourself, you will get drawn into something that will transform you forever and you won't care. And it's beautiful to me. It just seemed even the, the, the, the, every aspect of it just seemed incredibly potent and beautiful. But then I started, I started, I remember the first time I chanted, uh, was sitting on a roof in Laguna Beach. Like I climbed up on my brother's roof and I'm sitting there chanting and I remember, man, when, when I was done, I thought, Oh, they put something in the food. Cause I'm high as a kite. Well, you know, back then it was, it was, it was a little, it was a little different. You know, the, the Hare Krishna movement was, uh, it was kind of a zero sum all or nothing game back then. It's like, you know, they wanted you to become Brahmachari and that was the way in. So, uh, it's not so much anymore. It's a, it operates in sort of different constructs now, but so I, I just knew that was not for me, but as, uh, it's about what late 18, just about to turn 19 when my parents got divorced. That was really the, uh, you know, that was kind of the final, you know, straw that broke the proverbial camels back in my dad's life, you know, his, his whole development, uh, work ethic and sort of different peaks and valleys within his work, it's all based off of tragedy, you know, his first wife, Mary, and killing herself went on his 35th birthday because he was having an affair. His daughter, Susan, killing herself, every wife leaving him, you know, it's just really heavy, heavy, sad, sad stuff. And when my mom left him, well, some people say with Susan, some people say that that, I mean, I, I can't remember which book I was reading, but there seems to be an attempt to connect that suicide to the fact that he was having them take LSD. Like he, I always thought that when you were saying he didn't want you to take LSD when you were young, somehow, and forgive me, I mean, this could be totally wrong, but I, in one of these books, it was talking about how he wanted it, it no brook or something. He was having them take LSD. Is there any truth to that? There might be some truth to that, but with Susan, um, you know, I knew Susan pretty well, she had, uh, you know, she was really a beautiful, exuberant soul, but she really had some mental illness, like traditional, classic illness, kind of stuff. Um, so when it happened, when the suicide happened, it was, I mean, you know, she shot her boyfriend and she was in jail. Oh, yeah. So it was, you know, it was just a lot of heavy ossity kind of just around, around this. So then someone, my mom left, it became, um, you know, the, the four years that we had after that together were God, we had so much fun. It was so rock and roll. It was so sex drugs and rock and roll. It was just, it was a nonstop party. And you know, he was really in kind of a renaissance movement, but there was also this air of sadness to him because that's one reason why he, he, dove into death so easily was because he was sad. He was like, I'm good. I'm done. You know, I've got it. He did it. I did it, you know, and, and so he really jumped into that. So I immediately had some kind of awareness that like, again, this is a weird thing to say about him, but he didn't really deal with his own shit that well. You know, he could deal with it because he was so brilliant. He was the smartest man in the room. And he was always was the smartest man in the room. He could resort to that. But for the rest of us, just kind of, you know, fledgling around planet earth and this incarnation who aren't the smartest people in the room. It's not putting myself down. I just, you know, I know what I'm good at, what I'm not good at. There had to be another way. There had to be another way. So, you know, the yogic sciences and eastern mysticism, to me, you know, once I sort of, well, I went through my own darkness and drug addiction and things like that, but once I kind of plowed through that, that just became, you know, that became a window into the soul and to, especially into a place of healing that just felt much more in alignment to me than going, you know, through the mind and through the constant repetition of the psychedelic experience. Well, I don't, I mean, I, I don't, it doesn't seem to be like, I, they're not mutually exclusive to me. I know. I mean, I don't, this is like a, I, I, everyone knows I, I love psychedelics and I thank God for them. I do too. Yeah. But that being said, I have, whenever I run into some, that thing you're talking about that like Romdass outputs, whatever that thing is, which is overwhelming and I mean, I. Real. Real. And, and also the, the, I mean, this sounds so nuts, but there's this, so of these retreats, I'm just for people who don't know that they have this mala ceremony at the end of the retreats where they give you this Mala to chant on, you get to have a, what's called Darshan, I guess you would call it with Romdass. So, and it gives you this, these Mala, this Mala and man, every single time I've done that, I am just knocked out of the water, man. I get so, it's such a, I can't even explain that feeling. It is the most psychedelic, intense, beautiful thing minus any substances at all, whatever that is. I don't know what it is, what it's just wild. So, um, that, uh, people like Romdass and you see many people like him at these retreats, it's, it's, that's what's cool about them. It's not just Romdass and you realize there's like many, many, many versions of that floating around. And, but in this, I'm, forgive me if this sounds judgmental because I sure as hell don't mean it too, but I've noticed people who have fully committed to the psychedelic path minus the spiritual aspect of it, there seems to be a kind of like anger or edginess or a kind of like. Exactly. The psychedelic people are the ones who get mad at me who are arguing with me on Facebook about the guru system. It's not that the, the Bakhti people who are arguing with me about the psychedelic system, right? I mean, God bless the psychedelic community. I'm, I'm part of it and I always will be and I love all those folks. Me too. But, but you know, it's, they're the ones who are getting all hot and bothered and have to seem to have a little bit of dissonance. There's a fundamentalism to it. There's a fundamentalism to it. There's a fundamentalism. And the fundamentalism centers around a misunderstanding of giving up your individuality, that you are giving up your individuality to control of this old man in the blanket. There's this, this misunderstanding of that, that you have to give something up and it gets into a control game. Easy to misunderstand. Easy to misunderstand. And of course the guru system is fraught with many perils of terrible examples of it being. It is so hard to understand and it's so incredibly hard to understand. And the problem with, you know, the problem with this, this thing that you and I are engaged in, is that you begin to have very real experiences that are way out there, man. And they're so far out there that even talking about it at all. And as a, as a podcaster, it's like a real, it creates some cognitive dissonance for me because it's like, man, I'm having some pretty trippy experiences based on this path. And I don't know if I have the guts to talk about all of them because it's so, it sounds so, it really does sound like you've truly, truly lost it. If you start saying like, yeah, I think I might have a very real and powerful connection with an Indian. Who died 40 years ago. I know. Well, you have a, and I hear you say this a lot on your podcast, you have a lot of, you hang up on the language a lot of thinking that you're you're too hippie. Yeah. God, I'm fucking being hippie again. Fuck, I'm being hippie again. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you get into that a lot. Maybe I've just, I mean, I do two at times, but I've just made peace with it so, so long ago that whatever. Right. You know, it's just, well, you got to, I mean, that, that is, but so, but to get back to the, this interesting difference between whatever these two paths are, or the, the extreme versions of the, these two paths is that the one that we're engaged in, if you say guru at all, most people that I mentioned that word guru to at all, they are just like, they turn off immediately. The idea that you could have a guru, a teacher, oh, you're going to bow down to, oh, you're going to get a Y and bow down to Ramdas and a little fucking Mala. Is that what you're going to do? You know what I mean? Like they're like, okay, all right, my dad, I remember my dad, but he's like, so going to Hawaii to hang out with your gay guru, huh? You know what I mean? Like, like, like that, that, that, um, that kind of for some, here's what I don't understand. Every other mode of life, whether it's tennis, like, let's say that, like, I was really into tennis and I was going to Hawaii to hang out with one of the most famous tennis players on earth, one of the most skilled tennis players on earth to learn how to play tennis. People just like, yeah, cool, man, you love tennis. Good job. You're going to a tennis seminar. If I was going to hang out with somebody to teach me finances, if I was going to hang out with somebody to teach me how to do jujitsu in Hawaii, you know, a Gracie, whatever, totally normal, totally normal, totally normal. But why is it that when it comes to like this stuff, to spirituality, even though that, that theoretically must that same concept, which is that some people are gifted when it comes to this human, I have, I have an explanation for that. I think it, uh, and, and increasingly so, it defies the constructs of modern Western civilization. You know, my kind of latest thinking around this is that the rise of atheism is based, it's hand in hand with the rise of big data. So in the scientific world and the digital world and the world of ones and zeros and quantum physics and quantum mechanics and the internet age, everything is quantifiable. We have a lot of great explanations that are real for everything. That's right. For the age of the universe, for the age of the planet, uh, planet earth, for, uh, fucking Graham Hancock, saying 12,800 years ago, 800, right? Very specific. There was a giant flood, you know, whatever it is, quantum mechanics are being able to say that, you know, matter and light are the same thing made up of the same stuff. So what, what, what this is doing, and not to mention like the filter level that Google and Facebook is creating, it's creating this air of that, that, that, um, destroys mysticism, right? Getting rid of the space between things. Right. You know, this is great terms. McKenna quote that I've been thinking on a lot lately. There exists this dimension between language, but it's just so damn hard to talk about. Yeah, right. Yeah. So, you know, because of it, you know, this age and, you know, everybody is a, it's a digerati of some kind these days. You know, your experience, everything, everything through the eyes of big data and how it's being fed to you and your experiential quality of being alive. It's, it's largely through these digital lenses. Yep. So not only are you going to this, to this old man, uh, you know, guru in Hawaii, but the other guy, he's not even in his body anymore. He's disembodied. Yeah. And yet he has this tangible thing that you guys take away. You can't explain that. Impossible. It doesn't have any algorithmic explanation to it. So in the modern age, there becomes a dissonance with it, which is why to me, it's, these are the rises of the same heresies and the, and Dawkins of the world. Right. It's because there's no, it doesn't fit into any category. You know, it doesn't. Yeah. Well, I mean, it does have an algorithmic explanation to it. It's that you're out of your fucking mind and you're getting off on some kind of placebo effect, uh, because you've, are you though? Are you getting off on some kind of placebo effect? I mean, look, man, no, please. I mean, I've been like, look, I've been around all sorts of different spiritual traditions and lineages and been around Amma and Iskang gurus and Bob is in the jungle in India and all the, you know, uh, all, all these different permutations of these, um, spiritual alchemists and the lineages that they create. This one, the one that we're part of this neem Karoli Baba one, it creates this alchemy that it just has a different result than the others for me, for me. They're not all the same. It's not just, it just doesn't happen to be neem Karoli Baba. It's just the alchemy expressed in this one for me resonates in a frequency that I've never experienced before. Terrence McKenna in the, in his discussion with Ram Dass towards the end, he said something like, I don't care who you burn candles to, you seem like a kind person. And in that moment, Terrence McKenna didn't realize that what he had done is identified exactly what it is because it's, it's, cause what, what, I think what Terrence McKenna may have been missing is that the reason he was Ram Dass is putting off this vibe that he described as a kind person is that what he was feeling is neem Karoli Baba radiating out of Ram Dass. And the way he put it is you're, he was identifying the actual substance of the thing, which is, is, is, to me is that, um, cause you know, my, I love breaking this step down. I think it's important to break it down. And I think it's important to try to bring it into the tangible and to bring it into the, uh, and into some algorithm that, that makes sense. And, uh, so it's, it, the way I think about it is, um, so if I get around somebody who's authentically in a great mood, having a great day, I feel better. No question about it. Usually, unless I'm having a really shitty day and then I'm going to be annoyed. But you know what I mean? Like if I'm around someone who's like, whatever, whatever's happened to them, whatever they're having a cynically good day, man, I feel really good. And, and that makes me feel better. It can, it can give me a little uptick, not a lot, but a little bit of an uptick, right? So theoretically, uh, if we live in a spectrum of consciousness, then that, then, uh, having a good day, right? You can have that, that could exist on some spectrum, which is like the normal good day, a good day where you realize that, I don't know, uh, shit. You find out that you inherited $15 million. That's a, that's a pretty cool good day. And don't have to put in a materialistic way or a good day where like, who knows, man, you figure out, let's just put it in the realm of like insanity that doesn't even happen. Let's imagine like one day you figure out, you know how to walk through walls or something like that, like that level, like, whoa, this is cool. Even better. I shouldn't have said the wall walking thing cause it's crazy, but how about that first day after you've made love to a person that you've fallen in love with that day and I think of that day. Oh, that's a good day. Like on the spectrum of good days, that's a really good day. So then let's take it to, to the, to the good day of, um, your child being born and you, you have, now you're, you have a real family and so all these things like, so there are all these specs now, uh, if this is a transmittable experience, if the idea is when you're around someone who's had a great day, a little bit of it gets into you, then, and if there is a spectrum of happiness, then people like Ramdas and Neem Karoli Baba have figured out a way to go to the five billion times past the day after you've made love to someone that you're in love with and they're experiencing that kind of day, not every day, but they know how to tune into that. Yeah. So when you get around them, there is going to be the exact same effect times that additional, you know what I'm saying? That's correct. So that's the psychedelic feeling is you're getting this transmission that's happening or maybe another way to put it is you are, um, harmonizing with their frequency and, and, and because that's what humans do. We know it when women are around each other, they'll begin to menstruate at the same time. Correct. That's a good example. Yeah. So that means that if it, so you tune in, so here's, and I'll sum this up. So here's what I think. Yeah. That means it's really weird, but that means that the, whatever that energy state and it's fair to say that any state any human being is in is an energetic state. So whatever that energetic state is, is a very specific packet of information that gets transmitted to other people. And if they're able to fully accept it and fully tune into it, or even halfway tuned into it, then that means they can also transfer that energy to the next person down the line. That's right. So that's right. And it also frees you from these addictions, like all these other examples that you just went through, making love to the beautiful woman, money, materialism, whatever it is, most of those experiences, you're going to come down from them. They have a peak and they have a valley. That's right. They have a zenith to them. Right. What's going on here is that, you know, through enough spiritual repetition, a practice and a repetition of whatever your, your method is, the peaks and valleys become smaller and smaller and smaller. And the equanimity becomes, it's pervasive. Right. And you can stay in it and you don't have to come down. You don't have to go through so many extremes all the time. If you're gentle enough with your own spirit to, you know, like Krishna also always says, there's, as far as I'm concerned, there's only one thing we need to renounce and that is our self-hatred and our self-loathing towards, towards our own selves. That's the only thing we have to renounce. And once you sort of get past that game, and I know you and I probably share a lot of that in common, it's, it's, that's a tough game to get through. But once you do, like for me, man, like this last retreat, I've been on a lot of these now, like over 10 of them. This last retreat was the most potent for me. I'm on my hard hat. I'm a slow learner, whatever it is, you know, I just finally, I banged my head into the wall enough fucking times to be like, Oh, okay. Well, all that other, you know, the self-hatred and how I treat myself. And then how I ultimately can treat others too. I don't have to do that. Wow. That is, I mean, that's that concept. Yeah. It's, I mean, it's so fun just to imagine. What you would be like if you didn't hate yourself, it's so it's so cool just to like, is a thought experiment. How would you behave in the morning when you woke up? What would you feel like when you went to bed? What would you feel like? And, and, you know, it seems like the way you would feel is like a kid. Like you feel like a child, like children generally up to a certain age, you don't seem to have the quality of hating themselves. At all. Right. You learn that. That's a learned thing. And that is the, uh, yeah. So that is the, that, that space is why they call it liberation, right? Because you've been liberated from the tyranny of yourself or of the, of the negative self-image or something like that. Right. I guess that's what liberation means. Or one small version of, I mean, it goes further, doesn't it? I mean, we're talking about very deep water here. It goes, yeah. I mean, what the supreme manifestation of Moksha means, what a complete, um, merging into the one on every level. Is that, it's not right? Well, yeah. And, and the problem, you know, again, once we start getting into that language, now it's like, I don't, I, like, I don't know what that means at all. So it's like, you know, it's like, at that point, it gets like very confusing because it's like, it's very hard to talk about, but you, you're someone who has had a very unique life. You've got a very, very unique life. And you've been around, as you mentioned before, a lot of these, I don't know what you call them, yogis, gurus, awakened beings. What is the strangest, most inexplicable thing that you've ever encountered when it comes to this path? A couple of things. One, um, I think when I first, a couple of Maharajis, new curly Baba experiences that kind of, uh, and these are important to, to share because as we've talked about, uh, new curly Baba died a month before I was born. You know, so, you know, if you really try to get your head around that and the rational mind about how you're developing a relationship with somebody, um, like that, very, very difficult to understand. But, uh, two experiences. One, um, you know, the first time I went back to visit Ram Dass and was sitting in his living room and it was just me, him, you've been in his living room. Yeah. Yeah. And you know, the big, my statue, the Morty of Maharaj. Yes. The big blue one. Yes. Right. It's very, it's beautiful. It's a great, it's a great place to sit and hang out. And, uh, this experience of hanging out with Ram Dass, um, you know, when you're sitting with him alone, you feel like you have to talk. You feel like you have to say something because, oh my God, I'm sitting with Ram Dass and even I, I, I still have that feeling. And I've known him at a long time and I'm like, oh my God, I've got to say something that this feels awkward. We're just sitting in silence. This is, this is awkward. Which he's totally cool with. Well, no, this is what he wants. And he's just, you're the one going through all this. He's just like, I'm just here. What are you doing? And then when I finally first lost that, that need to have to exist in this place of language, and we were just kind of sitting there having, I guess, a form of Darshan, very, very powerful, very, very, very powerful, very, um, uh, tangible, very palpable, very, um, transmittable in the sense that I could almost like put it and bottle it and take it with me. Cool. Like this was very, very, very cool. Um, and I had another one. It's so funny when you say that because it makes me think how it's almost like you're trying to drown out the present moment with your words. You're trying to extinguish that your, your work. It's funny. It's like Ramdas is transmitting something. Absolutely. And he sure as hell is not just using language to do it. Every single thing he's doing seems to be some form of this output and that instinct to talk, you're definitely trying to talk over his silence to keep. To make you comfortable and to fight, to fight back against the thing that he's inviting you into, which for some reason we don't want to get into fully for some reason, like you don't, it's too intimate. It's too intimate. It's too intimate. Yeah. And, and it's, it's already been inside there. You know, this one, um, one of the best things I've ever heard Christian thoughts say we were in this, uh, actually Rodin Oswami's like a room at his temple in Mumbai. And there were all these, uh, um, Western yogis, um, who'd never been to India before. And they're all asking Rodin Oswami questions about India and everything. And then Krishna gives his advice and he says, whatever you experience in the next two weeks here in India, just know that it's already been true in your own heart and these experiences are just polishing the mirror. Wow. And that was, you know, contextually, if you really break that down, that's an amazing, amazing, amazing thing to think about. And that's an amazing place to be is that, you know, this, you know, the, the, the polishing, the mirror cleansing, the mirror using the, the dust of the guru's lotus feet to polish the mirror, all of these crazy metaphors. And like the Dungeons and Dragons Hanuman Chalisa translation, you know, that's what it's all about. It's just about cleansing that mirror to your own divinity. And we've been through this a million times and you and I have at the retreat, you know, every single wisdom tradition all shares as the kingdom of heaven lies within, except, you know, Krishna, all of it. I just heard a cornfield quote. He was quoting some Zen master who says when I see, I'm going to butcher it, but it's like, when I see a tree limb blow in the wind, I am not seeing the tree is not moving. I am watching my mind move. The tree is still, but my mind is moving. Ah, it's so beautiful. Yeah, it really is. Oh, and you know, it's funny as we were talking, you know, I do this thing just to take it back to Tim for a second, like one of the great sort of games I like to play with the, the memory of him. As I get older, my memories get a little bit foggy, of course, you know, as, as they do, you know, I do wish he stuck around a little bit longer to have seen my entry into this world and have him sort of soften his own spirit around the thing. So I do all sorts of fun rituals and pooches to him. I have some of his ashes on my pooja table and, you know, mess around with what I think is the alchemy of the afterlife. I mean, why not? Do you feel like you, you connect with him? Absolutely. Absolutely. And I just want to, you know, try to express that he can be free of some of that self-imposed bondage of his own soul, you know, and experience a little joy and happy notes and freedom and that, you know, none of his mistakes were all that bad. What do you think he said he would say to you now? Or does say to you? Now I think he's, uh, I think he's into it. I think he's, he's, he's supportive and he's into it. And he's kind of given me that little twinkle in his eye and that little thumbs up kind of, kind of thing. Um, and would be incredibly supportive. I don't think you'd ever sit down and chant Sitaram or Hare Krishna or anything like that, but, uh, I think you'd have a tremendous amount of respect, um, towards my sincerity, you know, towards the practice. I do too. For sure. I think you'd see it as a, I think you would have to see what happened is that like this incredible fusion between the two, the perfect fusion happened. The, it makes sense, doesn't it? That the, you know, you would somehow incorporate those two paths together in a very grounded, beautiful way. It does make sense. And, you know, like every, I mean, you know, the, the cliche of being any famous person's offspring, of course, and there is a textbook cliche and it's ridiculous. Yeah. And it's, it's sad and it's almost, you know, uh, lies in the culture of victim hood, but it's very, very difficult once you become an adult because you will, you know, you'll all, people will always be holding you up to some kind of standards of some kind of comparison. And that's just the way it is. I mean, think of, you know, Jacob Dillon or Sean Lennon, those guys who try to make music, it's a, you're doomed. You know what I mean? So, you know, with that, you know, that came, there came a lot of darkness in my life. I bet. So there's no question that the softening of the spirit and the sense of self forgiveness that is accessible through these, you know, these spiritual practices. God, he would have loved it. Yeah. He would have loved it. Absolutely. I think so. Yeah, for sure. Yeah, man. It's really cool. It's, it's, it's really, it really is a, I don't know. I, you know, I think that anybody who's taking the psychedelic path, it's got to be who's listening to this right now, who's just fully committed to that path. I understand how nutty it may sound, especially if you're like getting blasted on LSD and you're, you're, um, you're experiencing like that teaching or you're in the height of experiencing the teaching, which all of us go through where it's like, shit, man, the only problem with this LSD is I have to wait a day in between trips or double the dose. I remember having that as like, I was the one who had big problems in life. It's like, fuck, you can't take it the next day. You've got to like wait. At least that's how that was my experience. Tolerance builds really quickly for LSD. It's, if I had heard someone being like, listen, I'm telling you, there is a experience that makes that experience just seem like your first step, just a tiny little first step, it would sound in nuts, uh, but you need that first step and it's, I mean, here, let me just get really cheesy cause we're running, we got to go float or anytime, but you're like, and, and I would love to hear your thoughts on this. God, forgive me, Zach. This is so ridiculous. So in the New Testament, you need a John the Baptist, right? Okay. The John the Baptist was the one who like brings, who like anoints Jesus. John the Baptist is the one who's like baptizing people in the water. And then Jesus comes and like, you know, that's the story. You need the John the Baptist, John the Baptist, what happened to him? Do you know what happened to him? He got his fucking head cut off. Okay. John the Baptist got his head cut off. He got arrested and got his head cut off. Your dad is the psychedelic equivalent of John the Baptist and, and Ramdas took up the role of Jesus and like, and, and sort of carried the psychedelic, the, the, the, the psychedelic ground, the roots are psychedelic, but it grew into this flower that has a spiritual component to it. And to me, that's, that's how I see it. It's really cool to see you carrying that forward. Like you are, you are the, you are a great representative of that path, which is really beautiful to see because you're so grounded, you know? And like we talk about this glow that Ramdas has and you've got it, man. When I'm around you, I get lit up. It's really, yeah. So anyway, I'm glad to know you. You're a cool guy. Well, you know, thank you, Duncan. And I feel the same. You know, I really think Ramdas is, he's the great legacy of the, of the 60s. He really is. He's the guy who sort of, well, a, he's lived the longest, but he's really, you know, the promise of the 60s, of everything that that idea was born on whatever the ephemeral idea of what you think the 60s was about. Yeah. Ramdas has made good on. But here's the, here's where it gets cheesy, man. You and I, and anyone who's drawn to that path, you got to carry that forward. You know, it can't stop there. That's the thing. You, it can't stop there. That, you know, and that's, it's so important. Cause like, I don't know for what, and I think a lot, the powers that be, if there are powers that be, they would love for that to have stopped. Right. Of course. You know, they would love for that to just be a cute, wild chapter in the, in the maturing society that we're all part of. That's right. Also to the second part, and this is probably a fodder for another podcast, but not only can it stop there, but also, you know, when we leave the bubble of you and I or, or these retreats and we're out in the material world and you break the mold of what's called good association and you have to exist in what's called the Maya and doing the dance within that. And that, to me, is really where the practice gets extremely interesting. Cause, hey, we hang on a Nipili Kai and Maui year round. Hey, life would be perfect. Right. It's awesome. Great. We're, we're fed. Kirtong, beautiful woman, beach. It's amazing. It'd be amazing. Right. But that can't happen. We got it. We have to exist in the material world. We have to exist in our incarnations and our roles. So that's the, that's the subject of the next podcast. Hell yeah. Zach, thank you so much, man. Hare Krishna. See you next time.

Oh, yeah, like basically like I'm sorry about this by the way man It's like I'm still getting this aspect of it set up But the more it's in your face the better, but I wouldn't worry about it too much annoying things You know, don't worry about it though, it's like that's perfect. I'm sorry. I got to get this worked out No, I got I got I got I had one of these in my nightstand in my bed. Really? That's so perfect Yeah, good idea just to grab ideas Yeah, or just to well just to like I'm for a little bit there before I started moving my job. I was thinking about like You know, like what what if your goal was to like You know be able to do everything from bed. Yeah, which is You're not supposed to think that way. It's not weird. Yeah pain culture. All right. It means you're sick Yeah, well, that's right. Yeah, I started that's the funny thing is that very quickly if you want to be productive in bed You know immediately, of course, you're looking if you take it seriously You're pretty quickly crossing a threshold from Amazon to like hospital equipment Like yeah, there could be this thing called like hospital punk or you know hospice culture kind of like Mike micro micro convalescence. It's fucked up It's like the only for a lot of people hospice and baby time is the only time you experience real compassion in your life Yeah, everything in between is a hellscape. Yeah, where people you know, if someone's nice to you it's an emergency situation and like I was just watching, you know, this a New York City five police officers in one month committed suicide and Which is weird that it's contagious, but You know, the one of the police general chief was like just call out if you need help Just and I was thinking like how fucked up it is in the world that to get like help Just basic human compassion. It's an emergency situation. Otherwise, shut the fuck up. Yeah, if you're on the precipice of executing yourself Call out, but before that, please don't bother me You know, yeah Yeah, I was just listening to this thing on the drive over here Radio lab has this like mini series they're doing right now about intelligence measuring and and the latest episode somebody talking about whale intelligence and the theory among the people that that study whales that they think that it's possible that Their echolocation is is carrying a feeling with it that and that and that they have something that we kind of strive for and would consider super advanced, which is just macro empathy to the point where if If two whales and a giant pod of whales are sick then the the entire whale pod To an outside human observer is basically saying singing we are sick Because there's two of them that are so they're all feeling it and until that problem solved. It's it's all of their problem Which we would consider very advanced or maybe some people would consider that the nightmare of Socialism or something like like what but only only if The sickness then kills the whales like I think that's what that's what evolutionary humanists are afraid of is Oh If we all every time there's a an unwed mother that needs diapers, we all need diapers We're all gonna go down and none of us are gonna finish our album. That's what we're worried about Whoa finish our album That is it too, isn't it? It's like we're in such a strange place right now. Hold on one second. I just I'm sorry Dan No, no problem. I'd be scared to make this Leap I've been trying to record stuff in my car like singing and stuff and Like This doesn't track so it's like there's a weird bit of trust yeah Well, isn't there a button? I'm sure that like where they tracks the cursor. Well that tracks the whatever I found it yet. All the stuff is a mystery to me, but I could just look at that red dot and I see it now I can tell where it is not Sorry, dang I want to get into the terror of socialism That is right now one of the like just hounding people's brains because it's this idea of like First of all if you remove all the echo like if you heard the word Communism or socialism minus the history of Either one or what people think it is You have like pretty much an obvious sort of way to live Which is we need to commune with each other there needs to be a communing that happens in our civilization And so the act of communing with your neighbors would one word for it be communism I'm someone who communes. I like the feeling of being in communion with my friends. I like it. It's nice It's a great feeling by the way when you're having sex that's good You could say you're a communist because you're communing with your lover. It's great or an antisocialist to the other thing is like One of the insults are like you should better watch out for that guy. He's antisocial You know, that's no good if he's antisocial he set shit on fire. He'll fuck your dogs He like doesn't have a reason for it. He just does it. He wants to hurt things But so that we should be afraid of like if a new Sort of economy was emerging that was an antisocial Economy and people really plugging it. It'd be a good thing to like be scared of But for some reason people hear socialism and they're like, they're gonna take your fucking house, right? So Yeah, this is like to me a problem of semantics, right? Like if we could come up with another word for it people would love it right away. Yeah, I mean Isn't there like a bunch of ways in which Even the the hardest core kind of fiscal conservative would agree that that Something that they would basically refuse to call socialism as needed like I It's just like the people that are people that panic about the idea of socialism Probably also panic about the idea of anarchy But it's sort of It's a big semantic soup because these words mean like almost nothing at this point But if you you're right, we do need to I think take a step back because for instance, I probably differ from you in that I don't I don't want I Don't want cooperation imposed on me. No way because that's not cooperation. You don't That's fucked I you know, I were the same there fuck that I don't I don't want to wake up On Tuesday in the mood to be exceptional to be private to be isolated alienated and Have someone knocking on my door like my entire life is the equivalent of a long weekend with a girlfriend's family Where well, we do this thing where we we get coffee and then and we have this inside joke And now we play trivial pursuit now. We do these things. I don't want that loss of control over my life I think that it but What what I want is I don't want to have to feel guilt or shame or about like getting more at Some starting line that I didn't even participate in than other people like I Like If you if you if you get born in a country and you're not allowed as a baby or able as a baby to go I think I'll be Swedish like like then what does it mean to be a Citizen of that country. It doesn't mean anything, right? Like it you get born Swedish you got born French you got born American and in any case, it's not up to you like What your first pair of pants is it's not up to you what neighborhood you live in it's not up to you What color your skin is it's not up to you what school you go to for the first like 20 years of your life Like it's and so since it's not up to you all that stuff It's isn't it kind of weird that if you at 30 years old are sleeping on a Park bench that some other dude who also had no control over their circumstances is like They're the one with the badge and the stun baton and they're like zapping you and going hey You can't sleep here. Yeah, and it's like I'm just very I'm fascinated and confused lately about About that that concept of homelessness for instance where we all agree we wish there weren't dirty poor people on the streets Yeah, and but we keep it it just seems such like such a fundamentally weird thing where we're like I Wish that dirty poor person didn't exist because what really makes me angry about them is the idea that I owe dirty poor people Something and I you know, it makes sense like it because it's like we don't respond to an emotional level to a person in need With this like Urge to help them we want them to go away We want them to not have need. Yeah, and then but then when we talk about politics and policy and things That's why All I ever strive for is I'm like, can you get can you get those people out of the off the sidewalk with the policy? Yeah, so that I don't have to engage it on an emotional level. Yeah, and that's as cynical as Liberal thought can get I think it's just be like I dude. I'm a liberal because I just I just want everybody to stop like Being a reason for me to feel ashamed of myself Fuck yeah, it's like when you go shopping for meat You don't want that. That's why there's no such thing is like there's a cow that greets you at the door or a juice You know, you have orange juicers. It's cool. You go get your orange juice. You watch the orange is going the juicer Yeah, I mean the right to the right to isolate the right to Because yeah, if I was a if we were cavemen and we lived in a tribe of a hundred people I wouldn't I Want I'm First and foremost. I'm an elitist because I want to be like come on man. I'm not that good at hunting mammoth like yeah Can you just let me hang out and play with Duncan's? Moog Whenever the prehistoric equivalent of that is because I'm just gonna slow you guys down out there You know, he's the thought that's that's society starts getting constructed and then from there you go He's people like the little skinny or the big fat guys that can't swing a club as well start going. Hey What if What if even though? You could absolutely just have any girl you want What if what if we all made agreements that once a girl says she's yours and you so you get like these horrible like kind of institutionalized all right concepts of ownership and Things that all end up biting us in the ass, but it's all born out of like this insecurity of like Can I just be a nerd and suck my thumb and mind my business and but also is someone gonna take out my garbage and wash my shit away and and yeah, most importantly of all though like like like like kin Can I stop worrying about all of you? Yeah, well, it's not is it it's like um There the feeling of being sort of held by the universe With zero obligation Do anything in the universe outside of whatever your main job is is glorious I mean you can't find a better feeling than that sense of like fuck I can be in my house Just making music. I can order stuff that comes to my door when it comes to my door I don't have to then like talk to the guy. This is always the difficulty of buying drugs You know, it either has to be more of a Depending on if you have it. Fortunately in the old days. I have had very nice I'm not trying to insult any of my drug dealers because some of them are my best friends But I'm saying like when you end up with like a real You know sort of lump, you know And someone who's like brain has been mushed and you just kind of were like interested in buying some dope You don't feel like having a long conversation with them But you kind of have to because it's prohibited. Anyway, what I'm saying is the glorious sense Of being able to drive by a person laying on the street and think to yourself. Well, that's someone else's problem I know you know people fix that is a is a really like narcotic kind of Sick Wonderful and you know and that's the ties pleasure. That's a hundred percent related To the fact that we're not pods of wales Feeling each other's reality Yeah, because the moment if some if like just by some miracle the earth shot out of virus That made it so that you had you you had that thing, you know that thing people can feel other people's pain, right? If everyone had that Tomorrow we're in fucking coral marx land. It's communist at all the way through no rich person It's gonna be able to sit in this fucking nice place Feeling someone starve nearby because it would hurt you you'd be like I got to get food to that person I think well, maybe what we both agree on is tomorrow if that came out on the shelf at best buy or at your local pharmacy The first person to try it would immediately spit it out and go. I don't want that ever in my mouth again like like when we when we say If everyone had it if if if everyone had it it might be no problem Yeah, and it's just that it's just that big problem of like nobody wants to nobody wants to get fucked Nobody wants to be the first person or the only person To to start playing by different rules and then you just like oh man, you're done Well, I just I just kind of like I put out a tent and I said hey is anybody want my shit and then the answer was yeah These 20 people did and then they took some of my shit and they started a business Selling tents to people that want to put tents out, but they they charge five times as much and now they're now they're in a fucking space station filled with diamonds and coke and laughing at me and Because it turns out being poured doesn't automatically make you a good person in your heart I should know because you know, I wasn't born rich But but but you you touched on something kind of interesting there, which is I think is poetic, which is we do Now more than ever we have the ability because of technology to whether it's drugs or even just diapers or applesauce or pantyhose or toy trucks like we We can it's crazy that you can just click on that stuff and it'll come to your door the next day and that and that that's not really regarded as As like something that rich people can do it's like basically how we're how we're all starting to We're all able to do it. There's like the price differential is not it's not like oh if I go down the street to kmart I I I'll be a better I'm being better with my money than if I buy it on amazon. It's like we all are able now and also not even being punished for this like curbed a door kind of service but and the It's funny that the exact same technology is is is also making it impossible for you to ignore Every order world right and which is responsible for all these those culture wars that we're having because you know You're younger than me, but you and I both Through the lens of comedy could like look on the spectrum I was like 10 years ago pat and oswald could do a stand-up set and it didn't matter and we all we all Lived through these markers where it was sort of like, you know Well, the internet is ruining comedy the internet is ruining like This aspect of my life that I really held valuable which was isolation pockets context Due process whatever you want to call it like like Where where it's like, you know, and now it's just like You can't you can't not know Um That someone somewhere would have a problem with what you're doing or saying right now Right That's to happen and we can make a problem I mean the thing is is like if for whatever reason you just feel a basic sense of I don't like you Fuck it. I can make what you're saying bad I can take anything you've said if you have enough of it out there and I can prove that you're a satanist I can prove you're a pedophile. I can prove you're a fucking cannibal I could find ways to make the thing work if there's enough of it out there and especially If I've got a group of people who just want to be mad Who don't want to even look into anything at all who just want to read a sentence and say that must be the way it is It's a terrible mess. It's like a but it's all but don't ignore the fact that that that shipment of that guilt and shame and outrage Is coming in the same box as all the Oreo cookies you want Uh diapers at three in the morning. Like like like it. That's the thing is we're getting this big box of Other people we're getting we're now able to just have whatever we want, but that doesn't include isolation and include but We're and we're finding I think We one has to take extra psychological steps Should one want to have one without the other? Yeah, so Like you're sitting in your basement You've got your drone coming in from your favorite electronics store Your brand new microphone. Yeah shotgun shells your Your your applesauce your your dog collar that that's gonna wifi sink your dog to the outside perimeter of your fence all these things that are just make your life more convenient for you as an individual and The but they come in all of those things those luxuries the ability to have those things without having to drive all the way to fries Much less talk to a fries employee. Oh, I got you. Um, all of those things come with this crazy signal over the same ham radio, which is like Must be nice to be You realize when you do your piece of shit These voices are coming in so you have to build this faraday box to like people are being challenged It's like let's say so it's it's a little wonder you see these this rise It would have been a big wonder to me 10 years ago if you had said to me Do you know that the internet progressing along this trajectory is actually going to see the rise of factionalism tribalism nationalism jingoism xenophobia I'd be like no that doesn't make any sense because I'm an early adopter of the internet and every if it's very clear that it's all boundaries good or bad are gonna melt away Yeah, well, no not at all because the human impulse us not being wales biologically The human impulse is for isolation Like like like and if and if we're denied it It if you send us a box that says all of your cookies are in here plus a bunch of guilt We're going to twist and contort our brains Um to eat the cookies without the guilt. Fuck. Yeah, that's genius man. Yeah, that's it 100 we are boundary. We like to like, you know, you look and you see Fiddler crabs at the beach. They're cool. I love them They like you've ever seen a hole like a marsh with fiddler crabs that they hold their it's crazy I mean, it's crazy because they're clearly some kind of society and they Dig little holes for each other and they all will go back in these holes And then they come out of the hole and if you go by they raise up their claw at you all of them together Like look, we've got these claws. It's kind of pathetic. It couldn't really it's sad to they understand that they don't understand the power dynamic Because you could smash them They're definitely not guns that they're holding up. Yeah, man, it's sad to watch a crab brandish his claw Just back the wrong Darwinian horse. Look at these crap Let me imagine the speeches down in those tunnels guys now the more than ever we have to show solidarity If if if we go out there tomorrow here, I hear farmer Cummings coming guys We've been over this Those of you who don't go up and raise your claw in the air you you're part of the problem There needs to be all 80 claws coming out of the holes in this marsh or Crabs may may actually be in danger at the hands of a sentient primate that can make gunpowder If we all put our claws up, you'll see the fear in his eyes Just one he'll eat it's all this pork once um I don't know. I have crab stories It just came into my mind But this this crab was in a tidal pool and I saw the crab and the crab was aware that I was aware of the crab clawing up And I'm walking down the tidal pool and it was like in the tidal pool Shadowing me holding like Shaking its claw at me just to make sure like look. I'm I could chase you if I wanted. Yeah that's that's to me is like When I find myself put throw my claw up like that against like literally infinity And you know inside you're like what this claw throwing It's doing nothing and then you see on the internet like what you're talking about Swarms of these poor little, you know Imaginary crabs, which are people's identities smashed and digitized put on a fucking twitter And then they throw their claws up Against a shadow of a thing that probably doesn't even exist and they're shaking their fucking claw. Yeah, man It's identical. It's like and then the next thing you know Sure as shit someone will be like, why didn't you throw your claw man? You're right. Well, and sometimes that'll be accurate, you know, it's not safe to just side with the general cynicism of it How do you know the difference between the moment when that claw really matters those those crabs? Maybe they don't know the difference between farmer comings and a skunk or a Tornitoat or whatever the fucking biosphere. I don't know what they're I'm sure that that goddamn crab claw move works All the time or at least even if it doesn't work anymore it worked somehow somewhere And how are they supposed to know the difference and more it's it's you can't just side with entropy. You can't just up and go, well Your tweets don't matter and your breath doesn't matter and your mind doesn't matter your outrage doesn't matter Nothing matters. I I don't like that either. It's just it's like are you just trying to be right? Are you just so worried about being wrong that I mean you don't get a cookie for that either if the thing if the if the horse that you bet on in the race of philosophies is None of this race matters like oh, yeah, you're definitely a guaranteed winner. But how what what is that pay? Yeah, what and what is it? What is so like I kind of bums me out too like because the smartest people in the world Default to that because it is the most logical thing in a state of chaos It is the most surefire bet if you pull back from the earth far enough like a a little kid with cancer or a local election or a an alderman raving about a walmart going up or a A tribe somewhere that's like warring genocidally about the shape of someone's earrings Like of course the further you pull back the less all of that matters But how far back are you gonna pull pull like we talked about this a little bit when you were on my podcast and I sort of that idea of like I think we touched on this where it's like, you know, you you you and I are prone to the kind of eastern thought of it which is the there's a foundation there which which has a sort of Neither here nor there kind of thing where it's like it's like if you get caught up in that roller coaster Your look if you pee your pants, that's that's your pee kind of thing where it's like like listen The only truth that really matters is that there is that nothing's true and it's it's like a big aspirin on on the disease of like freaking out and But I think we all both both both agree that that um, that's not there's a difference between that being an effective way of us of of of um of getting perspective and that being uh The path to happiness because because those those very traditions would say see you're you're wrong already Path to happiness you done fucked up before we started you mean in the sense the path is the way there is no But that this idea of questing for happiness for instance as soon as you as soon as you're you know Like the dowdy jingling say if you see some things as beautiful other things become ugly So it's like that sums it up right there. It's like, okay, so so you're uh you're a You're a the older your your religion is the more it is a very functional handbook on how to stabilize uh An otherwise unstable engine Like like like oh, yeah, nothing matters. That's right. That's right like like you have a you have a crisis and then Very often the solution is to calm down and go. You know what big picture here? At the end of the day, uh, the titanic is going to be filling with just as much water One minute from now whether or not we Strangle each other over who has the bigger bucket Like so and we might actually that could be a path to someone going you're right I'm sorry. I just spent the last 20 minutes looking for a bucket I actually know something about the pump in the basement or I have the key you could you like like like you could unlock more uh practical. Yeah paths to Solutions just by Going We're all gonna die. Yeah, right This is like what that's that's it. That's it because other one one sort of broadcast Definitely creates a higher likelihood the titanic is going to sink and like sure maybe There's some the odds of anybody being able to fix a fucking iceberg in the titanic with whatever's on the titanic are probably pretty slim But you never fucking know you don't know when you're on the titanic and when you're sitting in your dad's lap In a in a in a in a go-kart that he's pretending you're steering or when you're actually fucking steering it because your dad's drunk Like like you don't you don't know I think isn't that sentience isn't that why we're nuts because we have this different split between Like uh, you can't underreact, but you can't overreact That's that's that's that's what the western and eastern Uh religions are grand right? It's basically like in the west. It takes the form of this crazy drunk like angry jealous monotheistic guy He's gonna hit you with a belt for picking wrong. Yeah, and in the east. It's like well, we kind of figured out you better You know, you don't want to sign up for disappointment But both of them kind of agree Yeah, it's a What a fucking fucked up video game. This is where it's possible to overreact and underreact I mean the distinction you're making between those two I I think one of them is like Figure out before you can reject yourself. You have to know yourself. That's the first that's the eastern one It's like first. What are you? Are you a thing? What are you? Why do you want the packages delivered? Is it really doing anything for you when you get the package delivered? And it's this sort of weird process if the price of the orios is knowing that you have white privilege Can you can you not add that to the flavor of your cookie, etc? Like privilege orios Holy shit Delicious the realization that uh, seven billion people have it worse than me Or it's gotta be like they're the best tasting thing you ever ate, but there's an 20% chance you're gonna get ball cancer from eating them So you've got to like always have this sense of like my god. I think it's killing me, but the um, it's like The what are what this simple question most many people don't explore very deeply Identity itself and we're in an identity crisis I mean with what we were talking about is happening on the internet was happening to a person It's a person having a massive identity crisis and we're having a special identity crisis because we've been fucking clustering in these countries and adhering to these religions and believing this very certain way of being and waving our clause in this very specific way To the point where even talking about waving your claw in a different way You can't get you on fox news, you know, if someone can be yelling about oh my god Did you hear this south nether hollywood mother fuckers that we should wave our clause To the left instead of to the right Yeah, and you start waving to the left and the shadow will only grow and then we're in this Yeah, you can be 16 years old on a field trip and uh smirk wrong and end up Like yeah, because that's how that's how Insecure we are about who we are like we're like that that kid. What is that kid? Is he uh, is he a nazi? Is he a socialist? What's he doing? You know like we're isn't that a kind of a sign of our collapsing Confidence that when we're like yes, uh three-year-old, uh, first words are, uh mega News at 11 like where we want we're like that fucking give me that kid. I'm gonna fucking punch him And a font and we'll beat him. Yeah, this this thing that you're this I think is an acknowledgement that at least many people are having in the liminal Between their consciousness. There's subconscious this realizing that Thanks to technology We are now in a position where if someone articulates a meme in just the right way The contagion that gets spread from that meme has the potential to completely restructure society in a way that no Top-down power structure can stop and it's removing all the value from all of it because we're we we learn from history books that There's something special about fdr. There's something special about mlk jfk Is that wait like we we we have heroes and they are decisive and then there's movements and there's marches And all of these things have value and the economy of all of that is collapsing because fort nox is empty It turns out in a world where a 15 year old russian kid can use openly bad english and no apostrophes to say Pepe the frog says you have a small dick if you vote for this person and and my mom can freak out enough to Change your vote let alone like and the entire everything is I mean, we're all awash in this nihilistic realization, but That's a good thing right because if if if it if you can realize that it was all bullshit then it was all bullshit and there's that the next step if we survive it is the realization that If it's We can retain the memory that it's all bullshit That's exactly how we should think about everything that doesn't have to do with whether your baby is eating And whether your friend is crying and whether your heart is beating like yeah, we should see all information as Chaotic and interpretable in a million ways we should see the human mind as not a computer not a zero one You know switchboard, but a miraculous ball of sponge that is perfectly capable in the most beautiful and ridiculous ways of acting completely hypocritically Holding two completely contradictory thoughts at once both believing in god and not believing in god like like be and like getting away from these previously required Compartments of information that we needed because we didn't have a fucking internet I can literally text you like how i'm feeling on the way home from work from this podcast because my car will be driving itself um I I I Unless I pass a cop. I won't even be doing anything wrong It'll be it'll be safer and easier for me to let you know How I feel as your friend better than I could on a phone call better than I can in this podcast like I can just like Thumb you a message and if like because we didn't have that 10 years ago 20 years ago You needed more categories are you a socialist are you a A communist are you a fascist? Are you an atheist? Are you are you spiritual? Are you religious? Are you What are you was more necessary when it was harder for us to get in touch with each other? And and and I think I think the kids are the the things that we find obnoxious about them with their you know, they are Through no merit of their own They're just they're just born in new different waters, but they do have a heightened awareness I think of like how every single one of them is a different story which the the knuckleheads, you know You know You know, it's like like like look at as a weakness when it's like, oh, what is every single fucking human being here? I'm gonna fuck a different Identity and story Am I supposed to stop the whole goddamn bus because one of you decided Yeah, and and but underneath that I think is like it's like, yeah, you know what that may fuck that may be the case Actually, what a mess to split it to me. It's like it's the moment that happens You really do the moment that in your own life that clicks in For better for worse for a lot of people. It's for worse. You're of your exploitation ability drops because now For me, it's like having a baby and then seeing the way that my wife and my baby love each other and seeing the way she just like the patience man like Watching a baby at a nipple As he gets older and they do a thing where he just like he thinks it's funny to clamp on with his lips And just yank back like like you're pulling that sound like my wife when it happens Pulling new balloons from back And then pulling back and then and then like looking at me with this like smile on his face Is your kid 13? What is this? We found him on one of those S&M papers No, but when you when you look at when you look at that and then The next time you encounter an asshole you just think about their mother And the love that their mother still has for them the hopes their mother still has for them The excitement their mother gets when they call or the secret Joy their mother gets even though they might be pretending to be mad Suddenly your ability to really enjoy Alienating that person turning them into the most obnoxious piece of shit on earth and what a demon It drops at least like 20 30 percent if not all the way down because you're just dealing It work You know the person who's not doing such a great job or whatever You think of their mom how they call their mom on the weekends or at night and they're like, uh Yeah, it's going good. I you know i'm having some problems, but I think i'm working it out Huh now how do you stay mad at that person? It's really difficult and that So what you're talking about is like to really enjoy a system Where you can justify and rationalize oppression You've got to categorize people into these very very big broad categories It's like there's like this internal psychological war we're having right now where we we have gotten so good at categorization And we're doing it seemingly in the interest of fairness, but we're Until we can sub categorize to the point where there's no more categories where these categories are going to kill us Yeah It because every story that we tell that's satisfying to us an emotional level is a story about how those categories aren't true Oh, Robert Tenero is not just an old buddy. Daddy. He's your intern I mean, it's the the most benign movie is still in the end about how this person is not going to act in accordance with your predictions period Right Yeah Wow, and and we don't take joy in that that Yeah, I mean that's been a big lesson for me. It's like like like, you know, because Without even thinking about it Women were women for me like as opposed to like Oh, some some some people amid the various variables that they have that make up their character sheet Yeah, D&D one of the variables is a is a gender As opposed to like, I don't know. It's hard to articulate. It's like the difference between Well, that person who happens to be a woman is Over there in the corner and There's a woman in the corner It sounds like no empty hokey semantic but it's I I you know when the when the recent wave of of this avalanche of that that that's got 40 to 60 percent of our colleagues in various Degrees of entanglement and and and opinions and stuff like it happened over those last couple years like that was my big Like epiphany was that oh some of this shit like you're not even thinking about it That's the and that's the whole problem like and then it would be great if To not think about stuff and automatically already be doing it, right? But then there's a bunch of stuff that no one's thinking about And the default setting is still on like Well, that's a woman like if you're if your wife walks in here it's like like am I able to Am I able to see her as a wife or your wife and that kind of shit like it's like like like, uh, you know It to me that's the that's the because it's easier to do with like Like You know like like like because we've been raised on all these movies about like how well if you see that person as a different color Or you see them as a different weight You know I was like beauty is skin deep and we're all the same underneath kind of thing That stuff's been fed to us So much that we're all kind of Good at it like like we're just like ah, that's easy like oh faking it. We're good at faking it We're not good at actually being I mean you can't like the this thing that you're talking about Rom das calls it soul not role. You're a soul. They're all souls. We're all from that perspective infinite sort of karmic patterns that aren't dependent on the body and that we have been appearing in the material universe for millennia in various forms and to the point where we've all been each other's mom at some point and We just this is what we're doing. Are we in a fishing net or we had a in a university? Is it a gnostic prison? Who the fuck knows but the reality is that when you're sitting with someone Whether it's a beautiful woman a beautiful man a black person white person Nazi saint whoever and the comma between Nazi and saint whoever you're fucking with That's a soul. That's a soul just like you and there's a unification on this specific on a level just beneath identity It doesn't mean there's no identity Identity is still there if we're at a costume party. I gotta respect your costume. You spend a lot of time working on it It says something about your choices that you made that that day. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's right There's a story to it. It may or may not it relates somehow to who you are Sometimes in an inverse way Sometimes in a totally just reflective way. Sometimes it's just a precipitous way like oh, I was I'm angry So I'm wearing a red costume. Sometimes it's the opposite, but there's there's a relationship for sure because In our wildest dreams, we're capable of random thought Like like random behavior. We're not really like if you make a halloween costume It came from some Some thought in your head. I didn't mean to derail you. I just like metaphor so much because Campbell talks have talked about that a lot like The the idea of ceremony and identity and all these things of being like Not only in terms of religion and And society should we always keep one foot in and one foot out and realize that other people are just Vessels for something else but but also In terms of your own mortality and psychology like your your mental health is reliant on you as you get older Realizing that you are just a halloween costume that you can't continue to take Yourself seriously Or you're gonna really freak out when your flesh starts to rot You're gonna take the mask off once in a while take a shower man. That thing's disgusting Also, it's like this masquerade that we're in if any of these things are true. Let's say instead of a soul Let's go nihilism. It's like we're sort of Just energetic patterns that have sort of consumed a bit A cyclical way of presenting ourselves. We've gotten stuck in that cyclical way of presenting ourselves. However, you want to put it within that I I like the soul part idea the best though, but within it Is this invitation which is hey, guess what you can you don't you can take your mask off and try something completely new And everyone's uh, you know in in art people are always like look at David bowie He had like not he was nine different people and it's respected in art when an artist has phases and it just gives Completely gives up the old phase Starts a new phase. Holy shit. It's incredible Or people get pissed because the new phase is not as good as the old phase in their minds But well, I wouldn't mind drilling down on that. I don't want to I don't want to I don't want to fuck you up If you're on a roll Well, the last piece I was just going to take it to the fact that now And do drill down on that but now what's happening is in a person's life We're getting down to the biological Level and as technology progresses that's going to get easier and easier right to convert yourself in every way If you want to turn yourself if you want to like Make your make your skin darker You'll be able to make it darker if you want to change the color of your eyes This is the I don't know how far down the line it is But it's certainly on the horizon right that we will we're in a costume party Where now if we want to change our costume suddenly I'll start wearing suits or some shit. I'll cut my beard I'll wear get glasses We're going to get to the point where it's like the whole fucking thing itself can very quickly be changed And and right now the people who are deciding to do that Relating to the sense of like, oh, I'm a woman. I'm I'm a woman now I'm going to be a woman now and converting into that using the height of medical technology And uh, uh, whatever fair what a warm on tech a warm art technology This is controversial because at the costume party. It's like no no nothing right We stay the costume that we became When we were a kid Period, right don't fucking change which is absurd. Isn't it because we're sentient primates and so we it is that that's what when you when I talked about drilling down and just that you you you got there because The david bowie reference. I think it's like it's it's an oversimplification to say we respect it in art. Well I would say more like we have this tradition of You have to be an artist in order to engage in this frivolous behavior and even then if david if all david bowie had done was Come out every week with a different, uh, look Uh, uh, uh, we would start to treat him like garbage But what he had a way we remember his name and and associate him with like style or whatever the fuck you call it coolness because He along with like other icons whatever you associate with that stuff like the artists that reinvent themselves over time They disappear and then they reemerge and there's a rhythm with which we respect that and it's serious Then you have this other culture that we totally also respect But because we don't take it seriously, which is this costume culture we Like so every single person even the the bank teller who Like like that we would never hang out with not saying if you're a bank teller we wouldn't hang out with you I'm just I'm conjuring a hypothetical person. Um a person with whom we have nothing in common culturally That person and you and I observe Halloween we observe if you get an invitation to a Costume party or if it's just a game even just calling it a game And then all of us like we are able to apply that to our online behavior Like like like like when if if it's a game Then we accept that it's uh, it's okay to change your Mind your face your your your approach And that I think is the key. It's like it's like you you talked about it on on harm in town And it was sort of like you alluded to it as basically this could be the that the actual apocalypse the The thing that takes us out Is the same thing that also maybe that's our salvation, which is this idea that we lose Our grip on the costume we were born into and realize that Thanks to technology. Thanks to advancement in thought And with a big healthy dose of jesus christ look what's look what happens when you take this shit too seriously We we reach this kind of reverse vulcan um thing where we magnetically evolve into a race of people That um don't consider who we are to be worth a fuck Because why what like whether you know we have these arguments about nature versus nurture Guess what both of those have in common you don't control them So as I was like we sit and we debate we go like oh Do you think this guy's a serial killer because of uh his mom's Jeans or because of what his mom threw at him when he was three um Yes, that matters a lot. Let's figure that out, but it's it's also important to note that We the the the larger like realization we need to have is right under our nose that like we don't really get To choose and and then there's all this stuff that we do get to choose Kind of maybe unless free wills and illusion or whatever but like like so Yeah, like we like like like guys in particular But really just humans in general you get punished for changing your mind You can't just like I just like we look at it as weakness It's like oh, yeah, I thought you said Batman was a good movie now. You know now you're saying it's bad We especially would punish it um if uh If we could nail you on uh Oh, you said Batman was a bad movie, but then uh that redhead over there by the punch bowl Uh, I saw what happened. She said it was a good movie now. You think it's a good movie Guys that was like a very that's a big part of like masculinity is like you fucking you're you're not authentic You didn't you weren't stubborn enough You're not you're not real You're you're fake. You're virtue signaling. That's the thing they call it like like like where it's like Oh, I decided the other day that I'd like people to like me and I'd like them to know that I'd like them to like me You fucking fake piece of shit. Yeah, you fucking spineless cock You fucking like Vaporous non-entity that can't be taken seriously. Look at my hard cock. Look at my backbone These things are real. They can't be hacked. They can't be changed. I was born the way I am and will remain that way forever that's strength and it's like it's It's extinction. I mean it's I like it's not it I I have the same visceral response to the idea of somebody that just does Changes when the wind blows as long as the person doing what you just said acknowledges They're wearing a costume of a person who does that shit It's way more interesting than a person who's forgotten. They put a fucking mask on right and it's standing at the halloween party You're not wearing nothing Yelling at everyone for acting like Dracula. Yeah, exactly. I am from Transylvania Blood is my main guy. You're not Dracula. You're just Dracula because it's halloween That's where we run into problems Yeah, yeah that guy's a bummer But we and we the the the it's really sad problem with all of this is the adherence to some mask thing Is the punished and and that that we get punished for Taking the mask off and and and even saying like god, I didn't mean to wear the mask I'm sorry. You guys I got lost and being Dracula. I bit people at this party. I fucked up these masks are really really Good, man. I'm I'm very imaginative. I'm a very immersive person. Yeah, the mask actually it injected like various like hormones and Neurotransmitters into my brain giving me memories of a time when I did live in Transylvania I'm an adaptable person if I was raised in the North Pole I'd make a house out of ice if I was ancient Spartan. I'd like I'd have a different definition of murder. Yeah I am a I am a human being Created but yeah, it's like I think we should let ourselves off the hook for that as well. That's it. Well, this is what to me it's like No number one answer the apocalypse thing. It's literally at least Linguistically the apocalypse if we're saying people at the costume party are gonna at least temporarily take their mask off to put a new one on That's the lifting of the veil That's what the apocalypse means lifting of the veil in this case It's the lifting of the mask and if we're gonna change costumes There's gonna be a weird time in between where we're gonna see whatever's under there if it's nothing this It's nothing this but I don't think it is regardless The problem is like, you know, this there's this like homophobic pastor Who wrote a book? Which is just filled with homophobia and filled with old bullshit crazy Jehovah level Christian shame shit and he realized That it was wrong And he realized he fucked up bad because this is a book that gets read at youth camps and shit for Christians And he was suddenly in the worst predicament of all time Because he he realized. Oh my god. I was wearing this awful mask when I wrote that shit. It's not real I don't think i'm a christian So he had to decide do I come out and say this Even though i'm going to get the people who love me And send me emails every day like thank you so much You taught me the truth, which is I should not have sex before marriage And I know now why you told me that you you have to like Disappoint legions of these people They will hate you they'll say the devil got into you and then also all the gay people whose lives you fucked up By Recommending these people treat them a certain way are going to be like fuck you Fuck you. You want me to be like, okay now you don't get to be fuck you justice So what the eat clearly in that situation? It's kind of easier to keep the fucking mask on and we got to figure out a way to like Let people be start over. Yeah mask. They're whatever the mask is they're wearing and if we don't Accidentally we're holding up the very thing that we're realizing is not so great. Yeah, that's the problem to me It's like god damn it. We got to figure out a way to like yes that mask sucked He was an asshole. He bit jake in the fucking kitchen Thought he was Dracula. He fucking bit a lot of us and he's well I think you just hit on something a couple sentences back. I think if I heard you right It's like you kind of like Sped by it, but it's like really it's like, okay, so here's the thing um the our Our mask analogy that we're drawing all this like clarity from It there now there's this other thing that we're not talking about which is that in order to wear a mask there has to be You have to are There has to the mask has to be on something and it's I just realized that it's not the changing of the mask that people perceive As weakness. It's the it's the root implication of being able to change the mask which is There's nothing under there. Yeah, so it's like this cyclical kind of thing like even I Can agree and maybe I maybe this is what I need to get past is No, there's nothing under there or do we have to find what's under there? Are we as humans? Are we children of of a Deadbeat god not to judge him just characterizing his the amount of hands-on Intimacy that we share with him um You know kids that that with they're feeling a lack of connection with Wherever we came from like are we have we been all of this time just Trying to wear his clothes and like emulate and like that's why our obsession like And you can reverse that if you're an atheist and say well, that's a site That's the psychological phenomenon was projecting and creating it upon our gaining this ascension So trying to cope with it would create these gods that represent The human condition and things like that. So are are we In either case are we um, have we been aping What we what we have always believed You're supposed to be if you're powerful, which is decisive and extant um corporeal able to affect change um and we Are we at the is that the big precipice that we're at where we have to accept our We have to aspire to uh non-efficacy non effability non Extents is that a word like like because I mean as in the climate change like that's what we're We're trying to figure out how to solve the rubik's cube of making it seem like we haven't been here in a while Because that's only like oh shit like but that that follows 60 000 years of us expressing Absolutely the opposite or like damn. I'm gonna put a pyramid here like otherwise someone no one's gonna even know I was here And and and now we're at this precipice In you know where we're kind of like and I think I don't think it's limited to that It's we can see that clearly in climate change and I guess I'm saying like is that where we're at kind of psychologically On mass and spiritually and all this stuff where all of us as individuals and as a species like are faced at this test Where we're able to go shit Which it would Campbell would allude to is like he would always use this example of the whole the He would point up at the lights for the kids and that he was speaking to and he would say look at these Look at these bulbs up there Well, you I mean if and if you identify with the bulb then you're gonna burn out and that's gonna be a crisis But if you identify with the light that's coming off of all of them Then one bulb burning out doesn't mean anything and the trick is to start as a bulb and gradually shift your consciousness to It's that's cool. It's it's it's it's it's Campbell 101 But it like also put this is like are we actually at this point where we have to like if we're gonna move forward through this Like the internet has like has like posed to us It's like putting a mirror in a parakeet cage or worse like a orangutan cage where it's all like that has never seen a mirror Like it's dangerous what we've done. We've we've we've given ourselves the ability to ask what we are at a thousand cycles per second and we Is the way that we're gonna survive by finally admitting that we are With we are what? Well, we're nothing that if there was a mask there It's for the same impulse that there was a there was or wasn't a god that then did or didn't say that let there be or not be a universe because the mask is Simultaneously evidence that in the beginning there was nothing that we are nothing underneath And also the most beautiful poetic expression The most important thing the will to be something I want to be Dracula. I if i'm not Dracula At this halloween party. I'm not melvin from accounting and that doesn't mean anything Yeah, my Dracula costume is not going to make melvin a better accountant and melvin doesn't exist God damn it melvin is another Dracula costume underneath that and that's not shameful Because what I am is a is a fucking child Beam of a bigger beam that all it is is this algorithm that says it's better to be anything than the alternative And the alternative is very fucking real. It's at the core of everything Which is nothing at all and so all hail the the fucking Dracula man And both respect it and don't get don't don't overreact to it I love it man. That's it. That articulates the bardo condition in between Lives in Tibetan Buddhism you go into this bardo and in this place You're freaking out because you don't have a body anymore And if you haven't prepared for it at all, you're really freaking out because You've done the near-death experience thing where you've sort of done the life review You've seen your body there and you've like witnessed the Your your own death, but then not just that now you're dealing with like Having no body for real and you don't get to go back to the body like you don't get to put the mask on This isn't an eight-hour acid trip. This is the mask has got off and now you're this sort of karmic Momentum that's moving through a house of mirrors, which is just a projection of your karma onto the mirrors Except the mirrors don't just reflect your karma. They become living beings that come up to you and talk to you torture you torment you And and and so you get freaked out because you want a body again because you're very vulnerable in this maskless Moment just a little ripple of karma or moving through time And so then you're freaking the fuck out and in that freak out session You end up coming back here and you maybe you'll come back as a human Some people come back here like people running out of a burning building Some people come back here with some intentionality. Well, it sounds like you're describing like these salvia youtube videos Like the real ones are people like justin showed me some of those justin roland Like he's like, oh, yeah, there's a there's the silly salvia videos, but then like There's it's like it's a dark thing and justin had done it. I never did it, but he said yeah, it's like It's ego death like and it's it's like you're locked in a fucking coffin like you You suddenly lose all awareness of your existence like justin described like like like like the idea of like All of a sudden being in a field and all of his friends laughing at him because he his whole life had been fake and The real them were like watching him this whole time, but he all you know It's like I do you see those youtube videos right where people they They they giggle and then they go into silence and then they start like they start moving around and they're like moving around as if Like in this panic because the movement isn't accomplishing anything But they're feeling the effects of their body colliding with Foreign objects. They just don't know who they are or why they are where they are and so people just like climb out of windows seen it like it that's I watched it and I was like There was a spiritual component to that that was terrifying to me It's terrifying. Yeah, because like like that is sort of a metaphor for it's what you're describing. It's like this idea of like if you Were able to remove the Dracula mask and then the melvin the accountant mask underneath it like would you ever Come back isn't that death and well you that you you are that this is why Yeah, no, you're you Number one the real terrifying thing is like the reality is Where the mask all you want like this is the mask realm you could say the human realm and wear the mask But still you're thwarted by the mask wearing in the sense that functioning Around you and in you Is an infinite space that you're part of and you're really focused zoom down in this one place Neurologically, but you know the truth This is why it's considered confusion as a condition of enlightenment because if you really want to fuck up the whole game Take your confusion of being a mask wearing You know vampire in the human realm And look at the part of yourself that's aware of the confusion That knows you're confused Now what's knowing you're confused anytime you get confused there's a part that's like i'm confused that part isn't confused It's clear as a fucking bell So confusion is considered to be just on the continuum of awakening or awareness or whatever So you really can't escape from enlightenment is the problem and so but we just don't want to deal with that So we're running into the mask realm. We're burrowing into matter and identity Temporarily, there's no way we could stay here regardless. We're gonna stay here for as long as we can Imagining for a second that we weren't this vast spacious Progenitive sort of reality. Yeah, it's like squinting to make something clear for a second, but it's not really Or these things that you can do in nature where you can like You can you can force yourself to have a like if you're falling asleep at night and you know You don't want to fall asleep. You can kind of like you can muster a spasm of Through your shame of oh i'm falling asleep and i don't want to be asleep and i got shit to do and it's like you can It's it's only It's my first existential gag. I've never that that just made me have like i've never had a mix That's so good. Keep going man. But it but it's but it's i mean is sad I mean it's sad to us because we have a relationship with non-existence as extant people that we think non-existence is better there's a it's Could be cute beautiful to think of it as like It's the cutest oblivion i ever saw The idea that oblivion at the end of it is just like oh a little oblivion doesn't want to be oblivion No, he wants to he wants to have a halloween party. Well, that's very sweet And and this is why like a lot in buddhism all the emptiness there the Nothingness thing that there really is like a lot of buddhists are constantly trying to rework that Translation because it's like not The nothingness thing is like there is also something this clearly These are these these things are both here like it's there isn't just nothingness and everyone and also the nothingness thing Is like the word itself is like it's translated into nothingness, but other there are other words like luminosity uh the clear light or Spaciousness or better descriptions. It's like you the nothingness thing sounds terrifying when I think of nothingness. I think of a kind of dark black Just Like anesthesia forever situation. Whereas this is more like well Yeah, there's a sort of Spaciousness within which there's phenomena and you're both of these things simultaneously So the anxiety and panic about like the let letting go what you just said it really didn't like Feel quite uncomfortable. This is a more of a result of a kind of ignorance of the situation And so the idea is like number one right now This is why the human birth is considered the best Because animals are just pure instinct. They're not going to think about this shit. Maybe monkeys or something But you know, they're they're they're playing they're they're sleeping. They're hungry so their realm is defined as ignorance and then uh the realm of the gods which is like on this earth would be like just I don't know people who like have infinite infinite infinite infinite wealth It's more difficult to get into like taking your mask off in that situation because you're fucking You know, you know who cares who cares like yeah, which is the microcosm of it being like me sitting at a bar With a phone everyone at the bar has a phone. We get in arguments about who directed Hudson hawk No one Bothers to Look it up. No, because that's not what's important Because the reality is like if you knew everything Then you wouldn't be at a bar. You wouldn't be in an argument. Hudson hawk wouldn't be a good or a bad movie It wouldn't matter who directed it that idea that mounting The threat of nothing mattering To us seems like a threat but yeah There's a we've experienced when you take mushrooms, it's like There's a there's a positive. It's like we we call it. We use different words for it You're not entering oblivion when you're on mushrooms. You're gaining perspective. Yeah, but there is a sort of It's like less and less matters. You like you don't take mushrooms and then like Realize how how many of your taxes you need to file like you you You you you you're more prone to like stare at a bathroom fixture. I think that's an expression of like well may as well Look at this as talk to my friends Which is sort of like That's a beautiful thing when you're on Silas Ivan, but it's like Yeah, I think that's because mushrooms somehow puts you on the on the uh The buyer's side of the market of the oblivion exchange. Yeah, that's right. So you're like you're actually gaining From oblivion. Maybe well, yeah, you're you're yes, you're there is well, you know, it's there's One of the one of the concepts I've been taught is you know that thing where you come back in So like This thing while mushrooms you do also we do it when go to sleep We do it when we daydream that thing where you're driving for 30 minutes and you realize where the fuck have you been You're like you've gone 20 miles and you don't remember anything that happened in that 20 mile period We lose our keys. Where the fuck were you when you lost your keys? You're gone. You're gone Right. Well, certainly the key keeping part of you was definitely dead. Yeah You could just look back five days ago And think of what you were doing at two o'clock and really think about it. You what the fuck you can't remember that shit Yeah, forget it's gone. So that you know the this situation is like terrifying when it's like Uh thought about or it happens intentionally, but the it's already happening all the fucking time and uh, So the idea is like but when we pop back in that's a really interesting moment And that's a moment of like that's the that's the return is what it's called So that weird moment where all of a sudden you go from the daydream into a sense of like, wait, I think I have something What is that? What is that moment? And this is, you know, a place to like Uh, recognize is all to open your mind to that flickering in and out that we do is these fucking strange creatures that are like Aquatic creatures in the sense that instead of living in the ocean we live in the great emptiness And yet for some reason we only think we exist when we come up for air and this produces this hilarious Society that we've built In the place where you come up for air, right? And even though we're always going down down down. We think we think we think that life is We call real life the cabana next to the pool, but what are we doing? We're swimming We're going in and out and in and out of the pool because it is the actual crossing of that threshold That is the cricket leg that that makes the sound that makes us alive It's the friction the friction of going back and forth. Holy fuck. You're right. That's it. It's this that's the alternating current It would be another metaphor like like how like Like, you know, electricity It's like it's like it's just a thing going back and forth, right? Wow, man. Yeah, that's it and that That that just I think just that Maybe just realizing that and let it let that realization take care of itself If that were to ripple out into society, uh, then I think there would be a natural Kind of non Fascist shifts that might start happening. We would you would just need it to happen. The problem is it requires a person individual the problem slash The double-edged sword of the thing is that it does require a sort of Individualistic approach to the exploration of this situation Which people love because there's a heroic component. I love beating the shit out of that guy. Can't can't wait to Can't wait to make fun of him. Oh, hey, have you heard about this guy? that uh Says we should all just chill out. Yeah That's cool. No. No, he's really popular. It's really gaining popular. Okay. I guess I can respect that And then it's just mounting and mounting. Can't wait to fucking rip his intestines out. I can't wait to find out He's a fucking freak monster hypocrite. I'm fucking probably cheats on his wife and fuck your non Look at him over there eating fucking peanuts I thought you were god while you eating peanuts. Hey, I never said I was god get him Shut up. You're just Only because there is a kind of grotesque Fervency that comes out of you when you start just when first because if like we're at a costume party And somehow 99% of us forgot we were wearing masks and suddenly you come down just enough from the weird Costume party drug that we all took before we put on the masks And get this great relief. We're like, oh my god. Thank god. I'm not Dracula. Holy shit guys. I'm not Dracula It's a mask. Holy shit. We are high So this fervency comes out and if people are still tripping balls at this crazy interdimensional costume party, they're like, fuck you, man Fuck you. It's it. Fuck your goddamn sanctimonious bullshit. This is a costume party crap Fuck get the fuck out if you don't want to wear the mask. I get it, man I've been the fucking screamer of the costume party and certainly I've been the loaver Of the megaphone people blasting the shit out in these aggressive ways. Both sides are like Easy to fall into and quiet. It's just Which is why I love this idea of like this is not a thing you need to bugle about And you certainly do not need to listen to someone bugling about their Unmasking because they you're not wearing their mask. They bought their mask at the fucking halloween store. You bought your mask at fucking city Latex shop. It's got locks and buckles and it's got Your rick baker You've been looking forward to this all year. Yeah And you don't have to worry about whether your response to other people's bugling makes you a good or a bad person It needs to change in the following ways or whether you're on the path to enlightenment or whether we're all gonna Whether we're all doomed, I guess. I mean, I mean, what in the hell is Going to happen in the worst case scenario. That's any different than the best case scenario If you pull so far back that all it is is a bunch of shit that was here and then it's gonna go somewhere else Um And uh, so there you go. Now we can now we can just hang out Exactly and the relief of knowing that these fucking punks punks, what am I fucking pillow right? Wearing robes and doing the thing The relief you get Realizing. Oh, yeah. Well, maybe But you don't have to listen to them. They're just giving subway directions like anybody else They can tell you where the subway is Maybe they can walk you to the tunnel to get into the subway But you've got to get on the subway if you want to go on the subway period Just that realization that no one's gonna help you and that's not a uh that you're in a hopeless situation No one's helping. No one's gonna get you You are not going to be helped and so the costumes people wear at the party that look like they're fucking paramedics or whatever Forget it You got to do it yourself That's what I love and because there's something really joyful in that because now it's you and your loneliness And you should be lonely because it's a lonely situation And then that's it and within that you can do the you can go see yourself See for yourself because no one's gonna help you so give it up That you're gonna get helped And if someone's out there trying to help with their fucking crystals and the saws and the fucking thing and the gems and the bells Whatever the fuck it is That's okay, too You know, I get it. I've been helped by those people to some degree But the help I got culminated in a realization of like, oh fuck. I gotta do it myself There's nothing else to that and maybe if not for them You know guiding me into a certain degree to like look because it's a mask you see that right? I know one's gonna hurt and no one's trying to do anything to you that you can't supersede with your own control I just take it back to that guy who's getting his box of Oreo cookies and white guilt from amazon slash twitter all in one box like It's an it is the time is upon us to Figure out what we're going for Going as for halloween if nothing else. Yes like it the game of of Arguing with each other and going you're just trying to make me Do this or think that is Me personally using my eye statements. It's like it's we we got to grow beyond I got to grow beyond that Like like like it If I haven't proven by now that I can do whatever the fuck I want um Then I don't know what i'm doing and if I continue to protect that right or celebrate it or Set fire to it or it relate to it in any way as if it's part of my identity My ability to do whatever the fuck I want when really that's the least special thing out of about any human in the world The least that we can offer any anything Then I'm uh, you know, I'm still not a bad person, but I'm just wasting a an opportunity to Ask myself. Who am I? What what and by who am I? I mean who am I not? Like who am I going as for this particular section of this halloween party like and why what does that represent to me? Like what what what's what's the what's what's the thought there? You know my a little my little Dracula maximize the there's a tundra idea called adding wood to the fire It's really cool. Which is like actually just fucking maximize the harmon Maximize the doing whatever you want to do. How far can you take it? What happens if you instead of thinking like oh fuck this do what I want to do thing I'm going to like watch it or get all mindful and let it be What happens if you go deeper and deeper into it intentionally as hardcore as you can for a week? See or a day or whatever see what happens if you turn the how do you have a dial? And if you do how far does it go up and keep turning that fucking thing up? And then within that you get it it actually incinerates the mass or not so like being like yeah I possibly another way of saying this or it's an alternative. It's like also Maybe you're done with that. Maybe maybe maybe maybe it got dialed to ten a long time ago Or it's been at five for so long that you you know, it's done its purpose and The new frontier has to do with other people not in an empathic like Daddy warbucks. Let me get let me go find some more of an Annie's way. But like in the sense of like It's a it's a different concept like who am I like the idea of me I talked about on Ron Funch's Podcasts it's just that I talked briefly about that idea of like being Like mirroring like being in the room that you're actually in with the people that you're with That's something that you have the privilege of doing if you've been yourself for 45 years You can now afford to Uh Speak less reflexively to the people that you're with you can listen to them and and think about What you've heard and like and then like Pick your reaction from a from a from a from an ironic compartment or spin a random spinner But but but in any case actually like think about it like like to have fun with it be at the party As opposed to like I think I think what I tend to do I'm just on a neurological level is like and to over Overuse the metaphor. It's like I'm at I'm the guy at the Halloween party who's like he threw together a Dracula costume And he's there, but it's just he my thought is on Some fireworks celebration that's supposed to happen in the backyard at midnight and not That or or some girl that I came here to see or how she's gonna feel about my Dracula costume and Or or or the work I got tomorrow after the party and in any case just absolutely not I am here. I'm at this party. I am in a Dracula costume like that that that's a human kind of habit We have we're like we're all at a party and we're all looking Around the room or we're talking to each other. We're half distracted because we're Hating ourselves Wondering if we should be standing where we're standing. This is the to me like I'm do you have enough time by the way? It's uh, yeah Oh, great. Great. What do you it's 103? What do you think? I I do if I leave here make season five of rick and party is Nobody nobody You're making good morning. I got people to do that. Okay, great. Okay, cool. Um, so The aesthetic of the phobe. It's called phobing. I heard it's where you look at your phone at the table when you're on a day And it's really rude phobing. So is that why is it called phobic? I could it was a block. It's like a fear. Is that like phobic or like is it like a different? It just sounds like a neck. I think is why they called it phobing. It's like i'm i'm phony. I'm whatever Oh, oh like foe for phone. Yeah phobing. So it's dumb But it's stuck in my head. It's stuck in my head. It's funny too because I just said to you they call it phobing Like it's some universal thing. I read it. I'm like daily mail but the It's I like it because it demonstrates the rudeness that we're already doing to each other minus the phone Which is that uh, you know, there's this cool idea that as humanity developed the separation between conscious and subconscious became Not literally night and day. So our subconscious we dream at night in the day We have this thing called sobriety or whatever like default reality is But it used to be the two are merged together dreaming what happened in the day. That's where the gods appeared That's where the all the mythology happened. That's where the listening to the lord or whatever. It was the beginning of your um Neocortex taking over so to speak and so now what we do is we have this imaginary phone in our heads That seems to be a result of that which is where we can refer to This interior phone wins the firework show Does she think of an asshole does he like my costume? Why did I come to this fucking party? How am I driving? How am I driving all this number checking that voicemail? Yeah, it's all happening except it's our thoughts And so we've become fixated on the thought pattern During any engagement with any kind of reality at all You're deeply into our thoughts But in the same way we're under our phones because I think the thinking thing is a relatively new dimension of human reality because suddenly now we're not we're like actually able to like contemplate and think and it's fucking cool and he's fantasizing daydream This is where we're at fixated on the thought patterns and so This is the the difference between the phone and the thoughts is people you can put your fucking phone down and turn it on Sleep mode or whatever your thoughts you can't we can't turn it off yet Someone left it on our brain and even worse than that. We started to think we were our phones Except it's in our minds, you know, that's to me is the sort of Situation which is like god damn. I think on my thoughts and I gotta say because I think it's part of the solution rather than just Again, it's like like we we realize what we're doing wrong And then the important thing that i'm learning in therapy is like okay And then but then you don't have to just fucking go. Oh such a piece of shit. We're always doing that like the species Yes, we're always doing that i'm like and then i'm just reminding myself right now as you're describing that i'm like Yeah, but you know like show me Show me two species and and tell me that one of them is obsessed with its own thought and is constantly Inventing devices and habits and patterns because all it knows is that it's not quite comfortable With the way things just were and is trying to figure out how to make things the best possible for itself possibly even for other people And then and then you got this other ding dong over here waving its crab claw in the air Or like oh, I grew a long neck so I can reach the leaves and like fuck off man. I love I love I think I mean I just like that is holy The anxiety the neuroses the self-loathing the the the bad habits the the hypocrisy It's it's all like It it's like it's it's like loving or hate it, but it's like god damn it's like I'm patriotic about it on a biological level like it's like it's like it's it's it's it's it's it's we We we invented that phone and and acquired that habit. Um Through the same circuitry that might Save us might might lead to us Inventing the phone of putting our phone down I agree man. And to me. That's these bugling fucking, you know party ruiners They're the first to tell you turn your thinking turn your thoughts off. Yeah, you must learn to stop thoughts You're thinking no, it's like it's beautiful. What you just said is it it's to Realize how holy fuck I get to carry around in my fucking skull the most advanced Computer Existing in the universe that we're aware of That's right above my neck and it's still not enough the way we react to it is that We there must be more than this. I mean that's really that's a lot more admirable than being the ancient realm of fucking cognition and being like Hmm. Guess I'm better than a grizzly bear time to stop Well, but this is to me. I think again a bad articulation of it by people which makes people Don't thought shame me You know, I get my brain is making these wonderful things. It's like But the the for some people the problem is You know, we no one having a phone. Fuck you man. I love my phone Don't don't don't get on me about my phone. It's the best thing ever Fuck off I came up when there was Commodore 64 Or if you wanted to jerk off the porn, you're gonna wait an hour to look at a jpeg Suddenly I can like just have everything I want immediately sprayed out on this thing. Don't phone shame. Yeah, the the the people I just yeah that wave of like people like oh everyone's on their phone like that guy that points it out at the at the lunch or the dinner or the bar or whatever i'm like It it probably would be a great idea for everyone to put their phones down But it's not going to be because of you. You're not selling us anything more exciting than a phone. How does that feel jack? and also like It's just like are you metallica? Do you hate napster? Like like like this is what it is. This is what's happening. We're becoming cyborgs Like I would like the fucking price is right to not be playing on the tv in the bar I would like that tv ripped off the fucking wall Um because I would like to be in here in a dark cave drinking But I would also like to look at my phone while i'm doing it because I don't want I don't want to be compelled to talk to The jackass next to me. Yeah, and I guess we all got our little it's just the the the hubris though because I don't Now i'm just gonna judge other people but i'm like i'm like i'm better though because I will sit and look at my phone and I never say Everyone stop looking at your phone, and I also don't go. Can we please turn the fucking prices right off? Why don't you go home if you want to watch prices right out of like you're in a bar? So let me present a nightmare situation in this bar. So suddenly a man I don't know wearing fucking camouflage breaks the door of the bar down pulls out his gun and says everyone look at your phone Don't look away. I want you on your fucking phone if you look away from your phone I'm gonna fucking kill you now. Here's the deal. I know what you're thinking, but my phone's gonna run out of juice Actually, no, it's not I brought chargers and charging cables We're gonna keep it completely running for the next 20 years You will be we're doing the the cave thing except with your fucking phone feel free look at whatever you want go through it But if I see you sending a text i'm gonna kill you When Well, because I think you could call for help. That's where the fucking stupid idea breaks down It's like great. I'll just text my friend to call the cops. There's an idiot making us look at our phones But my point is with our thoughts This is the situation is people don't know how to put it into airplane mode. That's all It's not bad that we have the fucking thoughts. We love the thoughts the thoughts create art The thoughts create like like I need to go to the grocery store. I should take a shit. I haven't shit in the last four days What's wrong? I need to go to a doctor like We need these thoughts, but There's a big relief In realizing like that doesn't have to be the only thing you stare at that there's a way to like experiment with like Letting that not be the primary identification of who you are in the universe, you know And then so that's this but I think a lot of people just haven't even I said, you know, people make fun of the those awful bumper stickers like Co exist like you almost have to like I don't even know if you're probably way past rolling your eyes at those things I'm not I still roll my eyes when I see a coexist bumper sticker It still is like did you really like you want to talk to them and be like did you Is this helping? Do you think this is help? Do you think anyone like a nazi Is riding down the street and sees coexist and it's like what have I done? But for real, I remember in ashville, north carolina years and years ago seeing a bumper sticker That said you are not your thoughts And I was I just it hadn't occurred to me. This was a long time ago, but I remember being like wait a minute What does that mean? What the fuck does that What all of them what am I and within it produced a lot of great things in my life? But just a lot I don't think a lot of people it's occurred to them yet They haven't thought yet that maybe that thing rolling around in their head is not solely what they are And if it is solely what they are then great, but they haven't even made done the experiment You know of like wait, is this told totally me my thoughts? Is there What's aware of the thoughts or the thoughts sitting in something? What are they sitting in? Who's the Realizer of the thoughts, you know that that that exploration can produce for a lot of people a great relief Because they're tormented by their thoughts. Yeah, you had said that to me a couple conversations ago as it stuck with me was that that idea of like Hey, when you start to get when you start to spin out You're having a any kind of like thought crisis just thinking about the fact that what you're doing is observing your own thought And what a miracle that is or a miracle. Maybe that's too That carries too much significance to say but but like That that is a thing to happen that that that that being able to think about your own thoughts is I don't even want to say weird But it's a thing and that you can then observe the fact that you're observing your own thoughts and then your suggestion being We'll now think about the fact that if you're If if you're thinking and then you're observing yourself thinking then are you yourself? And if whether you are or you aren't as an observer of your own thoughts, then aren't you Simultaneously your own thoughts and a thing that is observing them and doesn't that kind of make you Doesn't that bring you closer if not atoning completely with like the universe, you know Because what the hell could what else could you possibly be if you're looking at yourself thinking? Yeah, what yeah, and it's a first step and and and and the beauty of that is that you could be 16 years old and your thoughts about your thoughts could be Shit if I don't stop being jealous I'm gonna lose this Prom date. It's turning her off, but I can't stop it That It doesn't have to be profound It's like it's just a human condition that you're always in a spot of like god damn it. I'm like I'm overthinking it. Don't don't overthink it But don't overthink overthinking it and all that stuff and that that spiral isn't something to steer out of You can you can follow it and whip around and go look at me. I am a fucking not a fiddler crab I'm like thinking about thinking about thinking and like that makes me god That makes me something that's a little more spacious than my thoughts. That's for sure. Yeah, it's gets you at the very least It's like giving you an I don't know a bigger house. It means it means I don't it means like you know It's like I can I get to ask myself At my convenience if I'm genuinely homophobic or or or or if I genuinely Love my mother or if I'm you you get to put it means everything's on the on the auction block Yeah, yeah, and that's because that is like the you can't be compassionate until that's happens because It's um, how are you gonna be fucking compassionate? If you to other people if you haven't like put as much as you can on the chopping block So to speak by just realizing like when a thought emerges there it is. It's not your fault Like just that like if you just like think of any fucking rotten thought you have had that thing that might spring into your mind There's a hammer nearby and you're with a friend And before you could even stop it this swamp gas thought rises up or maybe I'll just take this hammer and smash my friend in the knee What Where and why but you it's not as though there was a thing where you're like, you know what? I want to think a really shitty violent thought right now I want to sit here and think about smashing my friend in the knee with a hammer. It just came up Now our three a relationship with our farts is more healthy than our relationship with our thoughts You know like you fart and it's the worst smelling fart of all time. You might be like boy. I shouldn't have eaten that fucking Uh vegan burrito that was bad. I knew it because I'm I'm I'm there There's not there may not be a third party witnessing it and saying what's that smell but even relative to yourself There is an objective accounting And we are constantly committing the crime for standing in an elevator and the and the fart is in our head We just we can not only not smell it. We can just we can we can we can we can also not have dealt it We can pretend we didn't the question here I don't know. I can't do an Alan Watts exit. I wish I could but it would be who is the dealer of the farts and and and and when you start realizing because You wouldn't go to the therapist and say god three days ago I was in my car and I farted and it smelled like Someone poured a diaper into an old bag of sunships and it's just Really really driving me up the wall. I I'm ashamed of myself that I generated this stink and but dear god You have a thought this or that whatever it may be and let me tell you we have crazy thoughts Crazy thoughts and the most mundane thoughts and you will you can get really you can offend yourself And now you could go into a neurotic spiral Because you had this terrible thought. Why did I think about hitting my friend in the knee with a fucking hammer? What's this latent violence in my life? Why is there latent violence in my life? That's a why do I keep smoking cigarettes? Why do I keep drinking? Why do I keep why do I keep? Yeah, uh raising my voice whenever someone challenges my sense of control. Why would I mean to the nicest person in my life? That shit gets into like I keep doing these things and the answer is you keep having these thoughts and you're not smelling them and you're not Accounting for them and the the the coolest thing that I've learned in therapy because it's like it's like I love learning that That something doesn't take any work Is that all you have to do is be aware is is is practicing increasing the awareness is smell your own farts That's neuroplasticity because if you're smoking cigarettes and you're not thinking about it One thing is probably not going to happen is anything other than smoking them and But if you Simply think every time you're smoking a cigarette think there I go again Smoking a cigarette you don't have to tack on to it because I'm a piece of shit You just have to go. I'm about to smoke a cigarette. I must love it a lot or something I don't know the the road flare. It's like my therapist characterizes it as like Practicing slowly but surely You're just gradually increasing the nanoseconds between One thought and perhaps the reaction or stimulus and the response or Two thoughts that are particularly always chained together. I I look at it like If you know how like roads are formed because someone's going from Trying to like riff geography someone someone's going from Dresden to Rome and You know over time Like like like people are going to be walking over the same shit But not only that but then if you see a path and then the rest is weeds It wouldn't really even matter at that point if there's a faster way from Dresden to Rome The faster way is the fucking path because there's less tigers and less brambles That may be a very winding weird road, but over time it becomes the way to get to Rome and The fastest one. Yeah And and that this neuro plasticity concept this concept of being aware is the metaphor for it is you You just make more stops as you're walking to Rome from Dresden. You stop You have a picnic as a picnic is a nanosecond long and and because you increase the chaotic chances that After you pack your fucking picnic basket back up Maybe this time just like the first fucking guy that walked from Dresden to Rome did Maybe you're gonna pick your own path Just randomly maybe the way it's like like the more you Stop along the way. You don't have to be noble or strong or willful just Pause and and and even that sounds like it takes work, but it's like just thinking about thinking um increases the odds of new branches of thought Dan Thank you, man for coming on the show. Don't fucking try to get me out of here. I don't want you out. I'm kidding. I'm kidding It's like three hours. I just can't think of a better thing to end on than that. I know I know I blew it.

No, I didn't mean to shame it I just think it's funny that like we both share that we have a more genuine conversation But if we if we spent three hours talking at the at a bar, I bet we would have talked about way less valuable Ritual we need the ceremony the podcast and I love it and I like sitting with you at the bar man, that's all of it's fun And I love you and I can't wait to see you again I hope you will when you were talking about getting people come to come play music at your pool workouts Please let me blow out some synth stuff worried about this being near the pool.

And this is the Ducket Trussell family on our podcast. The holidays are upon us. I know a lot of you out there are engaged in some kind of ritual for my pagan friends out there. Maybe you're getting ready to celebrate the solstice for the Anvexians. I imagine at this point you've had, what is it now? Let's see what the date is. It's the 10th, so you've had 17 ritualized sexual ceremonies with a grizzly bear. And if you're a Balnexian druid, then, of course, your nipples are probably at peak extension by the 10th, I think. I am not familiar with that. I dated one of those druids. And right around this time of the year, she would have stretched her nipples to approximately the size of a nice-sized rope of spaghetti. Regardless, I hope that you're having a wonderful holiday season and that you are finding yourself immersed in all kinds of situations that are melting your heart and making you happy. I'm having that. I can't. I'm getting uncynical. I could still be fucking cynical. I mean, it's easy to be cynical. That's why so many people are cynical, because it's easy. It's easy to deny. It's easy to talk to a Ghanarian horn rider and tell them, you know what, I don't think that there really is any kind of magic that comes from putting a ram's horn into your asshole during the Christmas season. It's easy to say that, but you know what's not easy? Putting a ram's horn in your asshole to see if they're right, which I have done, and there is magic in the horn. And this is why I love this special Ghanarian horn carol. Let us put the cinnamon upon the spiral helix. Let us touch the gnomes back and drape him with his sheet. Let us exchange the sacred, gifting bowls. And may everyone have horns in their holes. Ghanarius, we brought the sun to Earth. Twas from your nipples that the lizard king was birthed. And now we gather round the ceremonial fire. We blow our horns for peace. We blow our horns for love. But no matter what you believe in this holiday, I just hope that you're feeling great. And thank you so much for listening to the DTFH. We got a great podcast for you here. This was recorded live in Las Vegas at a psychedelic conference called Meet Delic, which I think is going to be a yearly event. Here with us today are three legendary humans. We have Johnny Pemberton. We've got Aubrey Marcus. And we've got one of the founders of Meow Wolf, Vince Cadlubeck. They're all here live. We're going to jump right into it, but first this. What's going on with all these gimmicks coming from these mattress warlocks out there, promising you a good night's sleep? I don't care what kind of toppers there are. Doesn't matter how heavy a blanket may be. It's lipstick on a pig. If you're sleeping on a terrible mattress, your sleep will be terrible. It's that simple. That's why I recommend sleeping on a purple mattress. It's because only purple mattresses have the gel flex grid. It's a super stretchy, ultra squishy material that adapts and flexes around pressure points and doesn't retain heat. The gel flex grid is amazingly supportive for your back and legs while cushioning your shoulders, necks. Hopefully you only have one neck. And hips, no matter how you sleep. Unlike memory foam, which remembers everything, thanks to the gel flex grid, purple mattresses bounce back as you move and shift. You'll never have that, I'm stuck feeling people get with memory foam. That thing that happens when you wake up in the middle of the night and some kind of creature is sitting on your chest.

I'm Remarkas, everybody! I'm Remarkas! [""Welcome to the Dunkin' Trussel Family Hour Podcast""] I got no beer? I just took your beer, actually. Johnny, what the fuck? We need one more beer. Want to share it? That's all good. I think a beer's gonna arrive. I have faith. Beer? I think I just saw somebody run back. I know, I still eat. That's what I'm saying. Faith. It's a cabinet. But it's better than you didn't have it, because if I asked for it, they wouldn't have run. I think they would have. Yeah, you could ask for anything they bring it up to. You could ask for a glass of ayahuasca to probably show up. Would you get a glass of ayahuasca for Aubrey, please? Please, no. Okay, I'll go. I have a question for you, Aubrey, regarding ayahuasca. Did they put ice in it? No, you want that scalding, hot, thick mud. Really? That flaming, flaming cheeto ayahuasca. Dirt and fire. That's what you want from it. Do you think in the future that that might change and people are like, why the fuck were we drinking it like that? You can make it taste way better. That's like asking, could you do Burning Man in a really beautiful place with a nice stream and like, nah, like it's got to be hard. You got to work for it, you got to get out there. You got to feel the fucking burn. You got to feel it. So there's some BDSM to ayahuasca. I think there's some magic to that being in its raw state and also providing that barrier where it's... You even see people who've been drinking it for a long time. It just gets worse. Like you'll watch someone who's been on the ayahuasca a thousand journeys, they'll go up and they'll drink it and they'll go, yeah. It like doesn't get better, you know, and I think that's important. I feel like they probably used to say this about rice just because they didn't know how to cook it. They were like, yeah, it fills up your stomach but it tastes like shit. You know, it's dry, you got to chew it in your teeth but that's part of it. And then someone's like, boil it. Just boil it. We've got, y'all are so brilliant. I just, I thought we could start the conversation off and maybe it's the most obvious question of all time but it seems like a kickoff question. Each of you are artists and creatives and I wonder if we could just talk a little bit about ways that psychedelics have influenced you in your creative process. Vince? Yeah, I mean psychedelics, I mean obviously, you know, Meow Wolf the brand, Meow Wolf the movement, Meow Wolf the expression, the articulation is so much part of a trajectory of like psychedelic pop, you know, and like, I'd say just as much as any substance, you know, has influenced maybe any one of the artists' work. There's so many points in storytelling and you know, various mediums that have influenced it that are also psychedelic pop, you know, like Willy Wonka in the chocolate factory or, you know, Miyazaki or Super Mario Brothers or Alice in Wonderland, you know, as the site goes on and on or Disney. I mean, so I'd say like the sort of cultural thread of psychedelic pop is largely, you know, like what Meow Wolf is kind of pulling from, you know, as an artistic articulation. And you know, substance, you know, it's not like, you know, we're a company so it's like hard to say, like, you know, there's like hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of artists who took part of Omega Mart. So, you know, of course, like we work with people like Alex and Alison Gray or, you know, Andrew Jones or, and of course, like, you know, they're visionary artists who have pulled directly from the psychedelic experience. They're brilliant work. But I'd say like more so just like as like, you know, as an artistic company, it's really been what definitely influenced by all of those pieces of pop culture that are based in that sort of psychedelic story. Cool. Johnny? I think probably because I did, I was lucky enough to have a good friend who was growing mushrooms when I was like a sophomore in high school, he's growing one's basement. He was the smartest guy I've ever met. And we took them, I took them at a pretty young age, I think, for living in a small town in Minnesota. And I think if I hadn't done that, I think, I don't know, I think something about psychedelics restructures your relationship to fear. And I think if you're a performer, that's really important because it makes you face something and it makes you not afraid of things that you would normally be afraid of, especially if you do them at a certain time when you're developing, even though I look like I still probably am developing, but even back then, it was even more significant. But I think it probably changed the trajectory of my life significantly to the point where I don't know, even thinking about what it would be like if I hadn't had access to that, I think it would have been, I don't know, I would probably be doing commercial real estate or something like that. You know what I mean? Something, nothing, it's okay. How dare you say commercial real estate? It's one of the most psychedelic professions, man. Well, yeah, because the space is real estate. It's constantly high, man, all the time, all day long. Well, I guess I'm gonna quit and go back into commercial real estate. Let's get into, let's, why? Somebody just like, is there, are you a realtor? Oh, he was, see? What happened? Psychedelics. Okay, cool, we won't get into it. Aubrey, what about you? I don't know who I would be at all without psychedelics. I mean, I was playing basketball, figuring shit out, I was 18, I did it 18, man. That's 22 years ago, and it's been a steady, constant drum beat through my entire fucking life. Who is Aubrey Marcus without psychedelics? Who the fuck knows the answer to that question? So every piece of art I've ever created, everything I've offered has been subtly influenced by these medicines, right? Like, it's inexorable from my story. So what is the answer to that question? It's a riddle that I'll never know. And even now, poetry will come through where it'll come through in medicine and it'll just be a strand and all I'll have is that strand and I'll be able to come back later after the journey and tug on that strand and it's connected to a whole bunch of balloons of words and verses, and I'll be able to pull it through where ideas, even the way that on it was structured, all of these things come as like little strands that come through the ether and then I can just pull them through my life. So the answer to that is like, it's so vast and unfathomable what my life personally, and it's not a recommendation for everybody to do as much psychedelics as possible, but that's my story. It's like, this is helping me every single step of the way. I want to thank Squarespace for supporting this episode of the DTFH.

Because of this fucked up prohibition that we've all gone through, so many people to this day remain in what has been called the psychedelic closet. So there's people who will never, who don't feel comfortable saying like, oh yeah, I was, you know, this psychedelic or that psychedelic influenced the movie I was working on. But we were talking last night about how much psychedelics have had an impact on the tech sector, how like the early innovators of the technology that has completely transformed society were like taking LSD all the time. Can you talk about that a little bit? It's openly part of the narrative. I mean, the job story, the Steve Jobs story, is very much anchored to the usage of LSD early on in the creation of Apple computers. You know, and it's like, you know, I know Nolan Bushnell who created Atari and really launched the video game industry. It's like, all these folks were just like 20-somethings back in the 70s and 80s just exploring the unknown. And I think that's ultimately for an artist or for an innovator, an inventor. It's like, you know, so often times we hear an artist say that we're just the vessel, that like the signal's coming through us. And like you said, you've talked about like, we're just the radio, we're not the signal itself, but you have to be able to use the antenna to be able to pick up the signal. And I think when you're venturing into art or technology or innovation of any sort, you're trying to open yourself up to the unknown because that's where that signal comes from, is from the unknown. And we create these incredible apparatuses of noability that block the signal that's coming from the unknown. And that apparatus of noability that we create is the identity. And the identity is all about who we have been and like the advent of technology or the vision of an incredible piece of art or viewing your career in a way that you're gonna manifest, all of that happens in the future. So when we anchor ourselves to these apparatuses of identity that are created by past-based memory, we basically shut ourselves off from the opportunities, the possibilities of what lies ahead. And I think that that somewhere in there is where that relation is between cracking that identity, opening it up to the unknown, opening it up to the future, allowing the signal to come in, no matter what industry you're in, art, technology, commercial real estate, it's all part of the same kind of same process. What can, maybe we can all talk about how to distinguish the signal coming in from like the bullshit you read in your journal after being high all night long. Like, do you know what I mean? Because sometimes- There's a difference? Well, I don't know. No, there might not be. Because like, we went around Meow Wolf yesterday, holy shit, it is a psychedelic. And I don't think that a part of the psychedelic revolution is we have to expand our definition of psychedelics past like ingesting chemicals and understand we can eat with our eyes and our ears. There's other ways to do it. Our assholes, you know? Like we can- Deep portal. Deep portal, yeah. That's actually tattooed right on my teeth. With an arrow pointing. But for every single one of you, because you all have done crazy shit that has turned out great. But for every single one of you and me, there's this weird line that appears between you as you are now and you following that intuition to make the thing. Like, you and a group of people made Meow Wolf. But if you like sat down with the wrong set of people, or even if you just were with yourself, you're like, I'm gonna create like, you know, it'll be like a fake supermarket. And there's gonna be deodorant sticks with labels on them with pictures of dolphins. And there'll be a tent with a tunnel you can go through into another room where there's slides that sometimes you can't go on because they're being decontaminated. And there's gonna be a story behind it. You know, I'm afraid that I wouldn't be so courageous. I'm afraid that if that idea started trickling into my mind, I'd be like, all right, time to slow down a little bit, man. Yeah, from a commercial real estate perspective, that's a nightmare. He's right, though. I mean, like, from a commercial real estate perspective, it is a nightmare. And from like the mind of a financial institution that's funding it, it's a nightmare. And from the view of a general contractor that's trying to build it, it's a nightmare. Or a project management team that's trying to run it, it's a nightmare. All of those different functions love knowing what this is gonna be, knowing what they're doing. Like money loves knowing, architecture loves knowing, commercial real estate loves knowing, everybody loves knowing it. Creativity artists, those who venture into the imagination, don't really want to know. They want to continue to discover. And I think that that's what's really special about Meow Wolf is that like we've somehow been able to marry, you know, that pursuit of the unknown with all of these other pieces of infrastructure that are business related and like physical manifestation related that want to know. And like bringing those things together. And like that's still the struggle. That's gonna be an ongoing struggle for us as a group, as a company, as a group of artists, is as we get bigger and as we do more of these things, like how do we continue to venture into the unknown? Yeah. One of the things about the analogy of the radio and the signal is sometimes we don't realize how important it is to train the radio to be a master. Like this beautiful, the beautiful shit that comes when it has to come through a radio that has developed mastery and knows how to encode the language or art or philosophy or comedy or whatever it is, it won't come just in another way. Like I can't download a comedic set or a beautiful painting, but I can sure as shit download a poem or a philosophical idea because I've honed that aspect of my radio. So it's an interesting thing where yes, it is the signal and absolutely it flows through you. But the more that you develop yourself in your own mastery, the more that that signal is going to make sense and translate into meow wolf rather than just finger painting on your fucking bedroom wall, you know what I mean? Like it's important to recognize that we're meeting the signal with what we have and every step I take in my own advancement, I get a new cooler signal that I'm able to translate. And putting it, putting into check the part of the self that wants to control and like putting into check the control that like wanting to know and wanting to control because you know, Terrence McKenna would talk about this a lot. Like there's, if you think about control, chaos and order or control and spontaneity or known and unknown, one of the two pieces of that balance wants more control and that's control controls the parasite because control wants more control. That's the nature of control. So like as you are thinking about bringing the signal in, you also, especially when you have like a success and when you start to think like, oh wow, we created something, I created something awesome. You know, there's a part, it's the ego, the identity that wants to then take control of the process and it has the potential to forget that it's still just receiving the signal. And usually you have to like check that part of yourself, your organization, your institution, your company, whatever, you need to check the control because that's the one that wants to take over. Is it ever a simple, you think is a, what's the saying, right drunk, edit sober? Like replace drunk with anything? Right. Yeah, totally, like be open to the creative moment, disrupt thought, you know, disrupt, because like thought, the words that are in our head, the thought process, the voice that we hear, that we call ourself, that's part of the same apparatus of knowing that is the identity. And if you're trying to think of the good idea, it's like never gonna happen. You have to disrupt that, you know, so like drunk or whatever other thing in order to get the signal in, right, totally. When you look at it later and you can look at the, I can tell you about your journal, like yeah, maybe it's not all perfect, but there's something in there that you can hone in a different mind state, because you can look at it from like a, you can like attack it from different angles and different mind states are different angles, so you can cover everything. Sometimes it's good to look at something, I think look at it dead sober, because sometimes, I mean, you know, it's not a psychedelic state, but in the antithesis of it, it kind of is in a way, because it's different than the thing it was created in. So if you're thinking of a different state than the thought was created in, that gives a new angle to the thought. And vice versa, look at the stuff you've created sober. Oh yeah. Drunk, like really high, and be like, fuck, that was a dumb idea. Yes. You know, like both ways are important. Well, yeah, and it's a problem when those two sides of your personality never agree with each other. Yeah. [""ExpressVPN""] I want to thank ExpressVPN for supporting this episode of the DTFH.

[""Midnight Gospel""] You know, when I was, when we were making the Midnight Gospel, and I started realizing... Thank you. Oh, thank you. You too. And that was my first encounter with making a show. And I wanna talk about this a little bit, because it relates to this idea of becoming the signal and then getting that signal into the world. But I realized that there are so many layers in the material universe that are true barriers, not just the part where your mind is like, I don't wanna make that, or that I don't think I could ever turn that into something good. But once you get to the point where like, okay, now I'm making something, there's so many bureaucratic crazy levels that you have to go through just to make anything. And you realize like art has to be translated to these, to the insurance people. I can't even imagine the conversations you have with your insurance agents. Like, how do you even say? Like, no, the slide is, it's safe. It'll be fine. No, people here aren't getting high. What do you mean? Why would anyone do that? But like, you know, we, when we were making the midnight gospel, we wanted to use a statue of the thinking man, you know, the guy with his head here, you know what I'm talking about? And so this is just one little piece of it. You send everything to Netflix, and they're awesome, by the way, but we got a response back saying, if you want to use the thinking man, you will have to fly to Paris and meet with a council of artists who protect that statue from being used in the wrong ways. And I was like, fucking send me to Paris for this, for this meeting. Like, it was like a dream to sit in a room with like a bunch of Parisian artists and be like, well, you know, the statue is going to come to life and it's going to be stopping on me in, I don't know. What do you think happened to make them set up that council? Somebody put it in there. Something really bad happened with that statue. Yeah, someone like made like, I'm not going to do another butt joke. Damn it, I already burned my butt jokes for the night. But can you talk a little bit about like, I know you, you're running a business, you're running a business, you're a successful comic actor. Can you talk a little bit about that weird experience of meeting the fucking reptile alien thing that you have to translate your epiphany to using like this language of contracts and the language of the earth? There's, you know, for me like, you know, back in 2017, after the House of Eternal Return opened in Santa Fe for us, like we were open for a year, successful, and we knew that we had to, you know, grow and move into bigger projects and to other markets. So I started as a CEO at the time and I started searching for other locations and meeting with commercial real estate people and, you know, people who build buildings. And the one here in Vegas, Omega Mart was like the easiest one to communicate just because Winston Fisher, who runs this entire area 15, went to Burning Man, was super inspired, life changed and met this guy, Michael Benneville, and they were just on a track, on a vision, to be able to create something that was unprecedented and unknown. And so that was an easy conversation, but the conversation we had in Denver, which we just opened that project a month ago, that was like more of like a traditional, like talking to a big real estate developer who maybe didn't know what the hell I was talking about when I talked about Meow Wolf. But there was no substitution for like digging into a place of passion and spontaneity. Like, and spontaneity, if I was to talk to him in a scripted manner, if I was to talk to him in like a controlled and known way about Meow Wolf, it wouldn't work. I have to tap into a moment of spontaneity and passion and spirit and I need to reach into that unknown to be able to communicate to him why Meow Wolf is gonna work and why we're gonna be able to pull this off and why it's important to bring to Denver. And so like that was my process, was kind of being like staying in that moment of spontaneity and spirit that the artwork comes from to begin with, that ether that the artwork comes from, in order to like get that energy and hopefully inspire him. So I need him to think about building a $35 million, 100,000 square foot building. He's never gonna do it if it's about numbers or logistics. He's gonna do it because he's inspired. If he got inspired, he's like, fuck yeah, let's do it. And that's pretty much what happened. Yeah. Oh, that's cool. I think the key thing is you have to be in conversations with the people who can make decisions, the people. Like you can run into the nameless, fake faceless bureaucracy that just has rules that are good for the general but not the specific. And if you're splashing up against that, you're in a bad spot. But if you can find the person, the person that can transcend the rules, the person that can be the person that says, no, fuck these rules, not in this case, not in this instance, we're gonna do it a different way. The person can be inspired by exactly what he says. And your energy and your belief were all amazing belief detectors and passion detectors. And when someone taps into you, like anybody who invests in anything, you know that you invest in people as much as you invest in ideas. You invest in that person. And when you can meet the person as your person and you know, you've just fucking know that you got this thing and they can detect that, that is where you need to arrive at. But it is absolutely difficult when you run into not the person, but the rule book itself. And that's the dogma and all of this shit that you run into. So it's, I think about finding the person that can transcend the rule. You mean like just finding a good partner to work with? Or like for you, for, you know, in Netflix, right? Like Netflix may have a policy, but then there's somebody in fucking Netflix that can break the policy. Somebody has the power. Like an interpreter almost. Someone who can like go between. Interpreter, but also to transcend to say these rules are in place for a particular reason. But I have the authority to break it. And if I trust you, I will break it because I believe in this and we will recreate these rules in a different, in a different standard. You know, just so that I'm not, I don't sound like I'm bitching about Netflix because I'm not here. When we, when they bought like they're crazy that they bought the idea from Midnight Gospel. They were, they were sitting at this table with all these like executives and they were looking at the art because Pendleton ward my creative partner. He had drawn this, he's amazing. He had drawn this like, they're these lantern headed creatures in this animated series I made. And one of the executives was like, where did you, what is this? And I, and so I'm sitting there like, you know what? I'm gonna tell, I'm not gonna, I'm gonna tell the truth. I'm not gonna like turn, turn pretend that I'm not who I am. So I'm like, okay, well, I was a burning man and we're in a tent smoking DMT. And I, I, I saw it. Like I saw this cow creature with a technological lantern head. And I looked away and look back and it had just moved a few inches forward. It felt really disappointed. Cause like, oh, you know, like McKenna's like, ah, you see these self-transforming machine elves. And it's, and I'm like seeing a fucking cow with a lantern head. And then, and then in the Netflix, they were like, that's cool. There was no like, what the fuck? You drug a, get out of here. And, and you know, I think the reason that, that that happened is because of like all the work people like you are doing, all the psychedelic advocates are doing is it's getting us to a place where we can be honest about like where some of our inspiration is coming from. And that being said, yeah. So it did, I think, you know, de-stigmatizing is one of those important things. And I have to just say this cause like when I interviewed Pendleton on my podcast, one of the first things I asked him was like, so, you know, such a cheesy, like hacky question. So how, how were you when you made Adventure Time? And he got this sweet look cause everyone asked him that. And he's like, not high at all. Like I don't, like I just came. And I think that's an important thing with all my bullshit rambling up front. Like you can also just make stuff with your soul and with your heart. You don't have to be high all the time. We shouldn't forget that either. But all that being said, and forgive me for making it go just a little dark here. Oh yeah. That force, that bureaucratic force, the thing that's writing the contracts and the rules are like the gestalt of that thing. Is it Satan? Is it evil? Is it just implicitly fucking evil that somehow in the world, there is this thick barrier of contractual agreements between an epiphany and that epiphany making its way into the world? Maybe it's great though, because you have that opposition. So much stuff. Anytime I've been a part of something where there's a lot of opposition to something part of the creative, the creative that came after that was always better. Sometimes it means like sliding a red herring in there. So it's like, you put the bad thing that's really obvious so they see that and then you throw in the word. What's that word? It's nothing, just a nonsense word. And then it's gonna be more funny and better. I think a lot of times the opposition, I enjoy it. I like when someone's telling me I can't do something. Anytime I see a sign on a light switch that says don't touch this switch, it's like I'm touching that fucking switch. And I feel like that's the same with creative stuff. If someone's telling you like, oh, you shouldn't do a crazy ass shopping mall and stuff like that. It's like, oh, I definitely wanna do it now. Yeah, it's like part of the simulation programming basically says like, if we tell them not to do it, they'll try even harder to do it. And so like the rules are there, I think about it like oftentimes like a pump trolley between like control and spontaneity or the known and the unknown order and creativity or whatever. It's just like a pump trolley. It's like one has to kind of flex their muscle in order to get the other one to react. And it's a pump trolley that like human consciousness has been on since the dawn of time or consciousness itself has been on since the dawn of time. You know, that is kind of like progressing us forward and keeping the like fire burning for those who are imaginative, who wanna break the known reality, who wanna continue to reach into the unknown reality. Those rules and that order and all that bureaucratic allows like a pressure cooker allows it to then like express even louder and even greater. I think these are all, I agree. And I think they're all very positive takes on the force of resistance. But, but, right. Have I told you about my encounter with Lucifer with the devil? No. All right. So. I encounter this, I'm in a deep psychedelic one-on-one journey with an ayahuasca shaman. We're doing heavy doses of psilocybin and cannabis at the same time and he's singing Icaros and he asked me if I wanna start meeting some of these archetypal forces and I meet the force of the Christ. And it was this emerald green column that just extended up forever. And it was this feeling that I could share any aspect, any of the things that I was ashamed of, anything that I've ever done and it wouldn't flinch. It was just radical forgiveness and love all the way. And then it's like, would you like to meet Lucifer? And I was like, that sounds like a fucking terrible idea. But I was like, and he's like, all right, we're gonna call that energy in. And he said, they call it the fallen angel. This is an angel who loves us so much that they're willing to hold the darkness and the polarity. And this is the aspect that you're talking about, like the necessity for the darkness to hold that polarity so that we have choice, so that we have something to strive for, so that we're not instantly enlightened, so that things aren't so easy that we can forge ourselves like honing and sharpening the blade against this force of resistance. And so I encountered it and it was another column and it was a column of this swirling black smoke and it was confusing and it was really intense, but I approached it with this kind of reverence, like, oh, thank you for holding down this polarity. But then I started to get into it and I got this strong message, but don't get it twisted. We're here to fuck you up. We're here to, I'm here to fuck you up. And like, that is my job. Like, I don't do it for play. I'm not like, here's just a little resistance so you can grow stronger. It's like, no, no, I take my job fucking seriously. I'm here to fuck you up. And I think that is a force that's in the world. It's not here purely benevolently to help us as the opposite that we can hone our strength. It's here to fuck us up too. Aubrey, you should have tried to kill it. You know Jiu Jitsu. You should have sprung on the Lucifer, like, oh, he really are you? Fuck you. Oh man. Resist this. Yeah, no, I do, I see, I do think that there is like, and I don't know why this is, I just love to get a little dark sometimes, but I do think part of what may be a mistake I make is you try to make that force. You try to like put lipstick on it, be like, you just say your, it's like telling you like, you know, I, okay, once I found a death metal album and on the back of the album, the band had written, we made this album in the hopes that when you listen to it, it will encourage you to kill yourself. That's like the back of the album. I'm like, I'm fucking buying this, this is amazing. But I think it's important to not forget that piece of it, which is like, whatever the, because the fucking thing, it's not just like it's like giving you impetus to work harder, like it's arresting people. Like right now it's putting people in jail. It's the thing that's like at the airport, that when you're trying to fly with like weed mints and there's a fucking guy, it looks like he's out of the Pink Floyd, the wall cartoon, standing at the other side just looking at you like, please have drugs on you, please. It'll be the best part of my day to throw your stupid ass on the ground and just fuck you up. I think we shouldn't forget that part of it, but that being said, if that part exists, what do y'all think is the best way to confront it in a way that produces lasting change and potentially a transformation in the future? No eye contact. And talk down to it and like sort of like a, oh, how you did that, good, like that. Everyone hates that. If you talk to it like that- If you talk to it like that- The police is what you said. You want a handcuff? Okay, good, good, that's good. Go ahead, get him on, good, oh, good boy, great, good. These forces, these forces are lost themselves. They're doing this in order to actually fulfill this mission. You have to be in the delusion of separation. You have to believe that you are entirely separate from the person in your handcuffing, the person that you are oppressing, the person that you're spewing your racism, sexism, violence, whatever the fuck thing is, you have to be in the delusion of separation. So they don't realize, forgive them for they know not what they do, right? They're in the delusion, they're doing it, but they don't really know what they're doing. The force doesn't, it's lost itself. So that force is just lost itself. So the way actually to deal with it is to help wake it up. And the way you wake up that thing is with truth, and truth is synonymous with love, because love is always true. It's like the truest force there is. So it's the love and truth that awakens that force of what the fuck did I just do? Like that 300 milligrams of MDMA that's just fucking irresistible, and you're like, oh man, what the fuck did I do? You know, that moment, like you have that in those awakenings, but you can do that without the MDMA, you can do it with your love and like your forgiveness, your way in which you do that, that can help wake it up, because ultimately it's done in that delusion. Yeah, I see what you're saying. I mean, yeah, I think if you look at what's happening in the world, it's easy to forget. Like 15 years ago, a conference like this, like there wouldn't be doctors here, there wouldn't be scientists, or it was completely prohibited. So there is massive change happening in the world right now, which brings me out of the dark part to the next question idea I have for you guys. We talked about this a little bit last night. It's gonna seem like I'm being sarcastic. So a few weeks ago, I actually ended up in Vegas for EDC and I was sitting, and again, I'm sorry, because I know this sounds so terribly irresponsible. I'm sitting in front of the Game of Thrones slot machine, doing like nasal ketamine spray. Like outside of when my children were born, or like when I met my wife, when I met Ramdas. I don't think I've ever felt that good. Like, hey, it's the most fucking mundane shit, but I'm sitting there on this disassociative in front of like a machine that people paid. God knows how much money to hack the human nervous system to get us to keep putting like money into it, right? And I'm sitting there thinking like, what happens if I just let it seduce me? Like instead of resisting it, like completely surrendered to the machine. And it was fucking incredible. It like, the seat vibrates. It like, this weird pulsing music, like we'll just randomly emerge out of it and disappear back into it. You start feeling a connection with some of the characters, you know, like Daenerys. Like I think I won $50 from Daenerys and I'm like talking to her like, thank you, Queen of the Dragons. She's rich. But it created an epiphany for me, which is I realized like, oh, like the future of technology is not just going to be a future where we use virtual reality or technological systems by themselves, but once the prohibition is truly ended, there is going to be an inevitable pairing of psychedelics with the metaverse, with virtual realities where artists are creating art not just with like materials like we have, but with chemicals so that there is a kind of experience that as of yet, I'm not even sure. Generally we're dosing ourselves when we go to see art if we decide to do that, but a dialed in psychedelic experience designed to pair with technology in the way right now we like pair wine with cheese or whatever. So I wonder if y'all could maybe talk a little bit about your vision of the technological psychedelic future. Well, I'll start by saying then, I don't know if you guys are familiar with John Hopkins as a musician, but he's about to release an album called Music for Psychedelic Therapy and I got early access to it and I've been taking ketamine and listening to this fucking album and it is sorcery at the highest level. And he's got, there's a great song with Ram Dass in it that he paired with East Forest at the end, sitting around the fire, just sound alone. And this is a technology that's been used with psychedelics from the beginning of time, Icaros, right? Like the songs of the ayahuasca shamans, that's one technology, but then you start to stack these things. All right, I'm listening to this album from John Hopkins, which is the fucking perfect music for ketamine. I'm telling y'all, like it comes out. You haven't played Game of Thrones slots on ketamine. Oh, with the theme song comes out, forget it, you punk. I'm with you, man, I'm with you. But that idea of the bright medicine, all right, then you do it in the pitch dark in the absolute black, where you don't need to wear a mind fold and the sound system is dope and then you're there in the pitch black and then you have someone, you know, doing body work on you at the same time. And then you pair it with them. And then these things, which are low tech, low tech starts to stack and it starts to get more and more fucking, absolutely mind blowing. And this is like the low tech stuff. And then they're gonna have haptic sound beds where you're feeling it moving from your toes to your head. Like this is a cool world we're about to come into. Yes, absolutely. Johnny, I just wanna get a cochlear implant. At some point, you know, I think that like, I mean, I'm joking, but I'm also not. I think like, a cochlear implant, it's what they, it's a company that makes, it can help deaf people hear again with technology. But for, right, I can hear fine, but imagine if I could hear stuff. Hear stuff I've never heard before. You know, we talk about like colors, like you can describe red, but what if there was a color you, like three of us could describe to you were like, oh, you've seen the color, and you're like, I haven't seen that color. It's like, oh, you can't see it. You don't have the technology to see that color. Cause it exists in a different realm. So I think that's gonna happen with sound at some point. Cause everything's doubling back in terms of, I'm kind of pessimistic when it comes to music, just cause I've been involved in that so long, but I kind of feel like everything I hear that's new sounds like something I've heard that was older. It sounds like it's being recycled. And there's like a effect where, you know when you have like a ball bouncing back with like a paddle and you move the paddle, it starts to go faster and faster. It's like the refresh rate for trends in music is coming, it's happening faster and faster. It's like a hat on a hat. And at some point there'll be a technological breakthrough that allows you to hear something you've never heard before. And when you pair that with something psyched up, I think that would be like a transcendent experience that we've never, it would change music. But it has to, it has to be a technological advance paired with psychedelic thing. I think. Yeah. No, yeah. I would like for that to be a transcendent. This fucking prohibition, it's fucked everything up, man. It's like, we're like, we're behind, we're lagging. I think it's part of what's happening. Not all of what's fucked up in the world right now. Part of what's fucked up in the world is these, I don't know who they are, these insane psychopaths, but a tourniquet on the conduit through which the divine pours into the material universe and put a lot of people in jail. They put these people who would be like, just think of the chemists that are in jail right now. That if not for this stupid prohibition could be designing modular synths that didn't just make music, but like misted nice doses of ketamine in your face at random times. But no, we don't have that. We gotta dose ourselves and I sneak around and it's fucked up. It really is, it's fucked up. But Vince, do you have anything to say? Well, I pivot a little bit from your question and from the OWL's perspective, we're really excited about creating experiences for folks that trigger altered state or trigger expansion of consciousness or trigger the psychedelic experience, but without substance. And the importance of, so when we opened the House of Eternal Return in Santa Fe, we thought we would get burners. We thought we'd get ravers. We thought we'd get artists. We thought we'd get a bunch of weirdo families, but we didn't realize that soccer moms and dads would be driving from Kansas to Santa Fe to show their kids. They probably didn't vote for the president that we all voted for and they probably don't believe in the things that we believe in, but they're still lining up to go to Meow Wolf. And to me, that's so incredibly powerful. If we can package an experience that expands consciousness, shifts or shakes up the identity, loosens up the known, opens people up to possibility into the unknown. And it can be done for kids and for people of all ages and backgrounds. And it can be done for people of all sorts of religious beliefs and dogmas that they might carry. And they're all walking into sort of this Trojan horse of art in order to trigger that feeling of possibility. That's kind of like where we're really excited. And of course, people are gonna do what they wanna do. They're gonna like, they're gonna take substances, they're gonna do stuff and go into Meow Wolf and that's gonna be people's choices. But I think from our perspective, it's all the people who are not taking substances. It's all the people who would refuse to take substances, get them in the building and see how it might impact that. I gotta just say real quick, that was what was one of the really remarkable aspects of what happened last night, which is I was sober and, but when I left, I had the same experience that you get when you take off VR goggles. Like a weird like re-entry into default reality. And that is fascinating. And I think that is one of the important things you're doing is it's like, look, yeah, maybe getting super high and going in there is actually kind of like, I don't wanna say a waste, but it's like, you obviously don't need that. And it's like, what do you think that wobbly thing is when you shift from like the reality you created in Omega Mart to the reality of Vegas? So there's a couple of things, I've thought about this a lot and there's a couple of things that I think's happening for people at Meow Wolf. And we get like a lot of feedback on Google reviews and Meow Wolf and personal emails from people being like, Meow Wolf changed my life. It transformed my life. And when we started getting that feedback, I was like, what the fuck is going on at Meow Wolf that's making this, that's like life changing? How is this transformational for folks? And so I think what's happening, there's a couple of things. One is we present a sense of reality, like the grocery store or the house in Santa Fe. And we present this reality and then we break it. It's like an accessible unknown. We create a reality, something normal, something that somebody feels familiar with. And then we give people an opportunity to break that. And I oftentimes talk about like the refrigerator in Santa Fe where you can open the refrigerator in this house and you can go through this tunnel and you go into the pure imaginative artwork. And at that moment of the refrigerator, it's like somebody opens the fridge and this thing happens for folks where like if the fridge can be more than what the fridge is supposed to be, then maybe the world can be more than what the world is supposed to be. And if the world can be more than what the world is supposed to be, then maybe I can be more than what I'm supposed to be. And so it's kind of this moment where you like, yeah, you like, you take what is or what has been and then you subvert it just a little bit to allow them to subvert themselves. And then that kind of creates an opening for like possibility for them to interact with people in a different way than they have before to think about their future in a different way or whatever. So that's like one of the aspects. And then another thing that I've thought about is like when you're inside of a meadow wolf or VR for that matter, like your brain is constantly asking like, what is that? What is that? What is that? Like when you put people in an unknown environment, exploration and discovery is possible. Exploration and discovery is not possible within known environments. Exploration and discovery is possible within unknown environments. So psychedelics are a way to go into an unknown environment and to explore and discover, but art also does an incredible job of creating unknown environments. And through that exploration and discovery, the brain is going like, what's that? What's that? What's that? What's that? How is that made? What if I go over there? What if I climb up there? What if I go through that door? So it's like constantly staying in meadow for two hours, then go out into reality, you know, normalcy and your brain's still there. So now you're like looking at a tree and you're like, what's that? What's that tree? What's that thing over there? What's that highway? It's like the world has now kind of opened up to exploration and discovery, again, curiosity, in a way that I think is like core to being a spirited, joyful human, you know? Kids grow up in an unknown environment and they're always exploring and discovering and therefore they're like always in this place of like joy and midlife crisis has happened because you've basically shut yourself off from the unknown. Oh, you know. And it's also hedonic tolerance, right? Like we get used to the pleasures of our normal life, our animal like default reality. So hedonic tolerance sets in and then nothing really gives us that joy anymore and nothing gives us that sense of awe. And so whatever that thing is, getting in contact with awe, wow. Like that thing is worth it. It's fucking worth it. Whatever pathway up the mountain so you can get the vantage point and the vista where you go, whoa. Like find it, you know? Whatever way that is for you. Like that thing is important. That's awesome. The pathway to awe. Yeah, man. Like, yeah, hell yeah. My cousin died from hedonic tolerance. Fucked up, just like, that was it. Yeah. Did you come up with a term hedonic tolerance? No, I heard Jason Silva who's actually speaking, I think virtually here. I heard him use that word, but it really stuck with me because these same things, if you allow yourself, you can get used to them. It's the same with the relationship. I was polyamorous for a long time and it was hacking novelty to bring me into the world. And I was like, oh, I don't know what you're talking about. I don't know what you're talking about. Hacking novelty to bring me into the present moment and the present moment of that new partner made this thing so enrapturous, but I was using just the novelty of the situation to do it. But now in my monogamous sacred union with my wife, we're actually saying like, all right, how do we hack novelty into our hyper object of our relationship, which is so deep and so vast, but you have to use like a little bit of effort, a little bit of technology, some tantric practices, some things to make those experiences just as novel as that new experience with that new person so that you're encountering each other again with awe. Because I don't believe that you have to give up on that shit. Like you don't, you don't. Whether you use medicines or whether you use, you know, sex magic or tantra or whatever the breath work or whatever the thing is, like don't fucking give up on the magic of life. Don't ever give up. Yeah. Yeah. Beautiful. It's derived from our obsession with memory. And like the memory technology is actually the same technology that is imagination technology. So like the brain or the mental image or whatever, you know, that creates memory is also the same technology that creates future facing imaginative vision. But humans are obsessed with memory. And we've had to be like the revolution, we've needed to be obsessed with memory in order to survive. Like we need to, that's the way that we experience times. That's how we learn. That's how we learn where the, you know, where the snakes are, where the tigers are, where the next, you know, meal's going to come from. But we're getting to a point where like we're externalizing so many pieces of infrastructure that keep us safe that we don't need to use memory for. If you didn't think about like the idea of getting lost, like we used to get lost. Yes. Like in the 90s, people like took a wrong turn and would get lost. Yes. And they didn't have a phone to call anyone. Right. And they could die. Right. Like by just simply getting lost. And like we don't need, and so you needed to remember so much, but we're starting to like create this massive platform known as the internet to be able to externalize a lot of things that used to be, that the technology used to, you know, was created for. And so now there's like this opportunity to use the same technology to be future facing beings, to use it for imagination. And that's where awe is. It's like, if you're with your partner, your, you know, your wife, your girlfriend, your boyfriend, like, and you're, and you're just experiencing them as a memory, then you're going to lose the awe. If you experience them as a possibility, then the odds there, if they're a future based person, you know, and that's like, that's what I'm really excited about with all of this that we're talking about. And with Meow Wolf, and with like, what the internet's unlocking is like, humans can actually become future based beings, like fully, you know, which is like pure imagination, dream is destiny, like, we're going, we're getting there, you know? Yeah, yeah, I love that. You could get so, it's such a crusty way that you can get in this life. And it's so sad, where you don't get lost anymore. Getting lost is, it's like something that's gone extinct. I think we still do it though. Sometimes I will still try to do that if I can, like I try to like, I mean, it's kind of the opposite of what you're saying, but I think sometimes it feels really good to purposely disengage from technology and you have access to, just to force yourself to kind of lean on that old thing. And it feels really, for me, it feels great. Like, it feels great to like, go to the grocery store without your phone, and have to talk to someone, like, hey, do you know what this is? I'm trying to find this thing. Everyone else just like, looks it up, you look it up, you look it up. I get sick of just looking it up, as I want to just talk to someone, strange. But I mean, there's gotta be some integration there. So that's like, I think there's the small micro doses of getting lost, and then there's the macro doses of getting lost. And the macro dose of getting lost is when I spent that week in the absolute darkness, silence all by myself, like pitch black in the darkness retreat. Like, that is an entirely new reality. And then around day three, the endogenous DMT kicks in, so you have this psychedelic darkness experience where you haven't seen anything with your eyes, talked to another person, heard any music, nothing. You've just traded your reality for something else entirely. And like, that technology is badass. Yeah, that sounds fucking terrifying. It's terrifying. I can't imagine that. I didn't even heard of that. It's like, I have a documentary coming out in like a week. Well, I don't know when this podcast will go out, but November 17th, it's called Awaken the Darkness. It's about my time in the darkness. All I had was a recorder that I hoped would work, because I couldn't see if it was working or not. But it did, fortunately. So I got some like, recorded, and just incredibly raw stuff, vision states would come in, but you're in a whole new fucking world for a while, and then you come out of that world, and I saw that sun for the first time as like at the end of day six, and I'm open my eyes, and I just start weeping because I realized that I've looked at the beautiful world my whole life and forgotten how magical and how much it's so incredibly stunning to look out at a sunset. And I've just taken it for fucking granted. And all of a sudden I had no sight for six days, and there I was. And it was like the ugliest, deepest, most soul-wrenching cry of my life, just to recognize how we have so much available that we take for granted. So doing something like that, that's like a hard reset, or a micro dose of that frequently, like that shit's important. Well, isn't, first of all, we gotta figure out a way to do that that doesn't involve going in a fucking cave, because I'm not doing that. So I need another way. Aubrey has invited me to things. Is that like, I don't think so, Aubrey. Can you bring beer? You can't bring beer to the fucking cave, Johnny. Just a couple cases for the week. No, he's gonna sit there, darkness, drinking, Miller life. The bugle was a ketamine in there. Real what? You could take a little ketamine there. Oh, so you're in a cave like blowing rails of ketamine. It's potential. Can you imagine, like, you just wanted to go spelunking and you run into Aubrey, like, where is it? Where's the ketamine? Yeah. Oh, no. But don't, don't, we have to, we have to get to the questions a second, but don't y'all think, and I thought, I love that you're saying that getting lost, because I thought, oh fuck, getting lost is going to become increasingly rare, if not a complete, an experience that you have to, like, force on yourself, which is really fucked up when you consider, like, the way that is actually affecting human reproduction, like, the way that so much of, like, people meeting each other and starting families happened because they were lost, and they met someone, and then, like, whole generations of humans are spring from that experience. Now the algorithm is pairing us together, which is completely fucked up, but do you, do you think that the reality of it is, like, part of the reason the wonder has left so many people, or the reason you can find yourself in that crusty, awful place where you're like, oh yeah, fucking, fuck the Grateful Dead, fuck this shit, I hate the Grateful Dead, and flowers, so what, it was green, big deal. All this green, fuck the green, I've been there before, you're like, okay, photosynthesis, fuck you, forest. But don't you think part of the problem is that we are lost right now, but we think we're not, like, the reality is we're fucking lost. We don't know what we're doing, not just as individuals, but as a species, and, like, the very worst of us are the ones parading around, like, I know where we're at. I know where we're at. I know what this is. Check it out, no, here's what it is. You don't know what it is, take my course, it's online, use officer. So don't you think that's the situation, we're fucking lost. We're lost right now, inexorably, even if you discover some temporary fleeting thing that you can cling to, you know, we're like, okay, I've got it now. I'm sure you all have done that. I do it, like, every few weeks, where I'm like, well, I'll talk to my meditation teacher and be like, you know, I think I've had a glimpse of realization. And he'll be like, keep meditating, keep meditating. It's so frustrating, but don't you all think we are lost? Like, is there a way to, what is... Have we ever not been, though? Yeah, I know how long it has been. What's that? I feel like I've always felt like that, maybe just, like you're saying, just very temporarily, but I always feel like, oh, man, I don't know. I just don't know. I mean, as an entire species, like since the beginning of time, like have we ever not been in that state of loss? Are we more in that state of loss now than we ever have been, or? I think so, honestly. I think what's happened is, is that we're manifestations of the past. Like, this is what you're talking about. We're manifestations of the past. Like, I had a great podcast with the guy, Matthias DeSteff, who I was talking about. He remembers his past, like, it's crazy, but he's talking about how we are all literally just the product of the past. So he's Argentinian, and he's like, I speak with my hands, right? I don't even choose to speak with my hands. I do it because it's in my family, and it's what's come up. And this is a trivial little micro thing, but we do so much based upon all of the past habits that have accumulated, and we think we're making a choice. We ain't choosing shit. We're just running off past programs and past habits and things that have come up and arisen. And so breaking those patterns with awe, with the encounter with the numinous, with beauty, with love, with the capital L, with all of these things, breaking that is like how we wake up, we're like, whoa, fuck. Like psychedelics to me are not, they're not being un-so, but it's like a hyper sobriety. It's like where we're finally not lost for a moment. We're like, we see things in a different way. And I think that's really the state that we're in. It's whether we're in the past as past manifestations or we actually get to go into the present. And I think that we're less present now than we have been because of technology, because of our culture, but when you're out there in the wild in nature, like presence is just, you're interacting with presence all the time. And so I don't know if we aren't more lost than we were. I think maybe this is a generality, it's the aggregate, but I'm thinking that presence is where we actually are aware and we're actually choosing and we actually can make decisions and we were not lost and then living in the past, that's where we're in the labyrinth of delusion. You know why I think we're more lost now? Cause we think we're not lost. And like it's the most horrific thing when you're like, I don't know if you ever got lost in the woods with me, but if you get lost in the woods with me and you're fucked cause like I will act like I know where I'm going. I've done that to friends just cause I'm like, I don't want them to freak out, but I'm totally lost. Like once I used to work at a summer camp in, like I was acting like I'd listened when they were doing this compass course and like we're in the woods with these kids and I was supposed to use the compass to find this place that we're going to. So I had to like pretend that I knew where we were going and there was like a 11 year old who was a boy scout. Thank God he was like in the group. And I just did the thing like, good job. I was just testing you guys to make sure you knew. But my point is, I think the problem is like there are species things we figured it out. We think, you know, you get around people and they're so certain of what the universe is. And it's generally like a very materialistic kind of place where, you know, you bring up, oh, well, you know, I had this experience where I don't know how to, I communicated with, for lack of a better word, I'm just going to say alien, but that sounds like it's extraterrestrial, probably extratemporal, you know, and it was like saying, you know, I really shouldn't be so like caught up in my own life because then it was kind of curious about why I decided to be a human. Because why would you do that? It's so fucking heavy and you die and all that. You say that to the wrong person and they're like, what are you fucking talking about? There's no aliens. There's just this and, you know, there's penicillin and airplanes. And you just gotta find the right Facebook group. That's the key. Oh yeah, that's all. Yeah, that's all. You're just posting in the wrong group. Yeah, okay, great. I gotta find the lost Facebook group. But yeah, I think that, I love what you're saying. And all of you are so brilliant. I think it's a wonderful way to wrap things up with an invitation for everyone here. Get fucking lost. Throw your phone away. You're wandering. And I also just want to say like, the denigration of pleasure is an issue. Like we think that it has to be hard and you have to work for it and it's better this way or not this way. And if it's just for pleasure, it's not the work. Fuck that. Like what are we here for ultimately? We're here to live a life of joy and bliss and happiness and love. And sometimes it's gonna be fucking hard, but sometimes when it's not, like ride that bitch till it stops. Yeah. Aubrey Markies, everybody. Thank you. A big thank you to Vince, Aubrey and Johnny for appearing on the show. And thank you to our wonderful sponsors. And most importantly, thank you for listening. I'll see you soon. Until then, Hare Krishna. Everywhere to go, JCPenney."

It's the canción to caretose you inside the house. This is the most important one. Only write when everything in your life is completely lined up in perfect harmony. 3. Don't carry a pad and a pin around in your pocket or even worse, take notes on a phone because let's face it. You're not that interesting, especially not enough to take notes on your observations. 4. Don't notice anything. Turn your eyes inward and only gaze upon your own pain. 5. Stop feeling. Feeling helps you get inspiration, which helps you write. Don't feel okay. 6. Get extra drunk the night before you're planning to write. You have a fantastic hangover. 7. Compare your rough drafts to the final products of the greatest writers that have ever lived. 8. Just don't write. Hope this helps for those of you who are trapped in a cycle of being too prolific. Much thanks to Nizak, the 5th Prince of Hell for that.

In case you don't speak Spanish, that means the cat is in the milk. El gato existe en una superposition. That of course means the cat exists in a superposition, simultaneously alive and dead, as long as the box it's in is hermetically sealed.

Does my voice sound better? Like, magically better? It's because a day has passed between the intro that you just heard and right now. And in that amount of time, whatever was wrong with my voice is recovered. And now we're back to the deep, baritone, booming, powerful, charismatic, very trained, leader-like voice that I perfected over five years at Juilliard. And then following that, of course, I went to the McKinney School of Vocal Talent. I can do all kinds of intonations. For example, I could do this and I'm also a master at, hey! So that took years and I did my doctorate on, hmm, wow. These are my skills. You can find me on LinkedIn under footlovingexec4671. I want to remind all of you who get legitimately upset that there are commercials in this podcast that there is a way out of this terrible gnashing hell that you found yourself in. I know my commercials rake upon your brain, like glass in the back of a shirtless motorcyclist who just got sideswiped by a semi-truck. The answer is at patreon.com forward slash TTFH. You subscribe and you're going to get straight interviews injected right into your ears. No more of this commercial shit. No more of these rambles in the beginning, whatever this may be. You're going to get the hard-hitting sports talk, political commentary that you have grown to love with the DTFH. Only that. You also will have access to the most brilliant, thriving, beautiful, powerful community that has ever existed on the interwebs. Creative community, a loving community, a community that you're going to call your family. You might even find a love connection there. My sweet DTFH family helped write this very song. When your gimp turns to hissing, you know it's time to listen to those things that your gimp cannot say. Just take off their ball gag and see why they're sad or else your gimp will go away. Oh God, I need my gimp back. But my gimp, he backed his knapsack. And he's gone back to the place where gimp's come from. Swampy places in the forest with discarded pornography and pools have come. A tremendous thank you to the DTFH family for helping me create that all-time gimp classic. We have got a wonderful podcast for you today. Jessa Reed is here with us. We're going to jump right into it, but first, this. This episode of the DTFH has been sponsored by the greatest horror streaming service that has ever existed. Shutter. Right now they're showing Clive Barker's Night Breed, which is a wonderful horror movie that actually made its way into one of the most notably horrible bad trips that I ever had on mushrooms. Only I forgot that it was all coming from Night Breed and thought that I was actually making contact with demons. Then later I watched Night Breed and realized that my subconscious had just basically projectile vomited Clive Barker's Night Breed into my mushroom trip. It's a wonderful, cheesy, gory movie. You've got to watch it if you haven't seen it yet. They've got so many great horror movies that you can't find anywhere else. I love them so much. It reminds me when I was a kid and my dad had to go to work and he'd just leave me the apartment with eight dollars. I'd go down to this musty video store and just rent the horror movies that I had read about in Fingoria Magazine, which is a magazine dedicated to horror. This is the real deal. No more looking around to find an excellent classic horror movie. It's all been curated by a human being on Shutter. You've got to check them out if you're a horror movie fan like me. You can stream thrillers, horror suspense for $5.99 a month or $56.99 a year. They have the largest, fastest growing human curated selection of thrilling and dangerous entertainment. Also, you've got to check out their Creepshow series, which if you like the Creepshow movies, which I certainly did. I even had the Creepshow graphic novel when I was a kid because my mom wouldn't let me go see Creepshow because she thought it was going to be too violent. You're going to love the series. It stays true to the original horror movie and it's awesome. One of my friends, Rob Schraub, directed one of the episodes in Creepshow. And it's wonderful. Nazi werewolves. What else could you ask for? Shutter gets started streaming the best horror thriller and supernatural content.

Now, everybody, please extend those psychic tendrils into the fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth dimension to give a warm and fond embrace to a galactic emissary who is here on the DTFH. Jessa Reed. Welcome, welcome on you. That you are with us. Shake hands, don't be too blue. Welcome to you. It's me, DuncanTrussell. Jessa, welcome to DTFH. I'm so happy you're here with me, and I know that time is precious when you got kids, because I got kids. My little boy had his head in the playground right before we started this podcast. He's fine, but God, it's so terrifying. Oh, how old is your son? Two. And you have another one on the way? I have one here. I have a one-month-old and a two-year-old. Oh, man. So you're in it. I'm in it. You're in it for the next two years. Oh, yeah. You're just a dad. Not just a dad, but that is the filter through which everything runs. Yeah. Yeah, it's cool. How did you deal with that, in terms of that identity as a mom? I think that there's something called mommy-mush-brain, where my magic goes away for the first two years. I am mostly overrun with postpartum anxiety and a fixation on keeping the children alive, which I believe must be some sort of biological mechanism. And a lot of my personality and personally, personal identity disappears, which I think, I don't know if it just happens for me, but I think that that happens so that you can be a parent, you know? Like, take care of them when they're tiny and be completely focused on that. But it is, I don't know, it's difficult. I can't imagine being in that phase of my life during the collapse of society. I would have been losing my mind. I mostly project my mind onto car seats. No, sorry. Go ahead. Oh, no, please. Please, car seats. Look, I've seen my wife fixate on car seats with this intensity, like she's diffusing a bomb. And it is clearly like something genetic, or it's in the DNA. It's like you're looking at all mothers protecting their children in that moment, and it's such a powerful thing to watch. And also, you know, I have to like hold back the annoyance. We're like, it's fine. Just, what? It's a loose buckle or something. It'll be fine. You know, I think dad's experience, we clearly are not experiencing the level of protectiveness that mothers feel. I think if we do, it's a different flavor, you know, because it seems almost painful. It is like the supercomputer of my brain was 100% focused on keeping these children alive, which felt impossible in the world, because suddenly I was aware of the G-Force in cars, the G-Force in airplanes with turbulence. Dressers are death traps? Were you aware that dressers are just falling over and mauling children? Oh, yeah. And you're at home alone, and so you're in these mommy groups, which are just a bunch of women with postpartum depression projecting onto each other and belittling each other and sharing morbid children death stories. It's crazy. Oh my, I've never gone on her mommy groups, but she'll tell me the fights happening in the mommy groups. And sometimes I say, I don't know that it's good for you to be on these mommy groups, because it seems like, it seems like one of the most vicious forums on the internet, like mommies are either really helping each other, like, but simultaneously, but like insane generosity, you know, like the post, I don't know what it is, but giving each other like stuff while also, you know, inevitably someone is in trouble with the whole group for, you know, some something, usually a political thing or some create something. Tell me more about your take on mommy groups, because I've only encountered it via my wife. It's nice to hear another POV. I really can't imagine, because my youngest kids are now 7 and 11. So I can't imagine what those groups are with the political landscape. I can't tell if that makes them, would have made them worse or better. But the worst of the mean girls from high school, somehow that culture gets brought in. A lot of shaming. There was a group that I was in at one point called Sancta Mommy or something, where they just took screenshots of moms from mommy groups and then we just shredded. They, I was mostly a lurker, but I just shredded people. It was just tearing other women down. And I still had a lot of like internalized misogyny and stuff. So I didn't really, now when I think back, I'm like, what a dark place to be during such a vulnerable part of your life. And you're just looking for community, because when you turn into a mom, especially I can't imagine for your wife right now with two under two, that's it. You're a mom. And you can only really relate to other moms. Yes. Because everyone else is, could we talk about literary anything else? Yeah. Very dark corner of the internet. And I have been on some dark corners of the internet. Same. Yeah. Same. Nothing like it. There's nothing in it. And you hear mommy group. Yeah. I don't know what you imagine, but it's not that. It's not like a snake eating its own tail and like, you know, angry at its tail. It's a, it's a wild thing. But, you know, again, I guess, you know, having only observed it, you know, I obviously we all have moms, but, you know, when you're in the, when your face is in the fire of motherhood, you really see, you know, you see something that is, I guess, the most unsecret secret because there's so many people on earth. But I had no idea. I was in some groups. Yes. Where they, they were just groups dedicated to dying baby carrot carriers. So like the wraps that you put around you to carry the babies, entire groups dedicated to the baby carriers and then other ones that were dedicated to dying those. And those groups would break out into fights. And a lot of those groups were like showing off what you had and kind of blittling. Yeah, it was crazy. It's a crazy call. And everyone's like, got some form of postpartum depression, postpartum anxiety, new moms, their entire life has just changed. It's a very vulnerable time. And I would not get on social media if I had another kid. Do you think you're going to have another kid? Do you ever kick that around? That idea? No, I kick it out. I mean, I'm 44. No way. So, and I have a, I have a grandchild already. So. Okay. Right. So, but you know, I, every time as we're going through another pregnancy, I think both of us kind of like look at each other like this'll, this'll be the end. Yeah. But then something in your, you forget. Like we're already forgetting how intense the pregnancy is. Like no matter how like uneventful it may be, though, both of our kids ended up in the NICU. So like we like have been through both times. It's just the most intense, dramatic, like life and death thing. But now we're kind of like, oh, what are we going to do in this? They're, that baby's gone. They're so beautiful. They smell so good. It's like, you know what I mean? The universe or the reproductive impulse just starts slowly pulling you back. Like just think about it. Maybe we should do it one more time. You know, regardless of pandemic or cat, the calving of ice sheets or the grim reports from climatologists or whatever it may be, this overrides all of that. All of that. Are you guys already thinking that with a one month old? Because if you're having a third, if you're already. Yeah. Well, we'll probably have a third, but that's not where we, it's going to be a longer. Like this was kind of the decision was, look, what do you, like we knew we wanted to have more than one kid, but the decision was like, what are we going to do? Like have like a huge age distance between these two so that, because if you go too far, then they can't really be friends in a normal way. So we wanted them to, we wanted them to be like have each other, you know, because we've got an expiration date, man. Like we're, we're out before long, you know, so you don't want to leave like your poor, no offense to only children out there. I'm sure you have friends. I'm not saying it's got to be some genetic link, but you know what I mean? Yeah. I want to leave your poor kid floundering out there in the abyss without anybody, you know, floating in the great emptiness. You want to give them somebody they can hate after you, that you're dead. Yeah. No, you want to give them to someone to fist fight with. I know. 18 years in your house. My, my kids are close enough in age to be best friends and sparring partners. Yeah, I know they're going to be fighting and I know it's going to be brutal. Hey, Jesse, your comedy is so, you are so funny. I just, I am so envious of the way that you write jokes and you, you do the thing that like, I just, when I see comics do it, it's such a wonderful trick because people watch it and they're like, I can do that. You know, because you're doing the thing. You're the perfect or what I could, it's my favorite style of comedy where you look at it. It's so funny, but so like, you're just talking, but just accidentally beautiful, perfect punch lines, exploding at just the right moment. Oh, it's just so good. I hope people who maybe aren't familiar with your stand up, take a look at some of your clips online because they're, you're really funny. Wow. Thank you very much. I can't imagine ever doing comedy again. That's why I wanted to know. Yeah. Yeah. What's your plan? What's your post pandemic comedy plan? I was working on a special and had just started running it the week that the lockdown started and comedy and interacting with people in general isn't actually very easy for me. I get a lot of like social anxiety that came from the drugs. I guess it happened when I got clean and it tastes a lot, a lot for me to get on stage. I have to like overcome all of this adrenaline. And my career did not include a ton of stage time like other comics. And in 2018, after meth, he came out, I moved to LA and forced myself to start doing that, getting on stage all the time. And then I finally got to a place where I didn't have to have a full panic attack before getting on stage. I finally got comfortable with it. And now it seems infathomable to have to go through that again. I don't even understand it. But wait, I want to ask you, may I ask you just really quickly though, you got on meth during a comedy tour? You were addicted or had you already messed around? Wow. I was raised by a meth addict and swore I would never try it. But from a pretty young age, I was doing psychedelics at like 15, drinking, smoking weed. And then I did a five year stint as a born again Christian and did that until I was about 20. And then I started doing stand up pretty close to my 21st birthday. And this was the late 90s and there just weren't a lot of women doing the road. So I got a lot of work really quick. And so tour is probably a little bit fancy. Triple run. Are you familiar with that? Just like a Montana one nighter? I've only heard. I've only heard at the comedy store. They talk about it like like like wizards talk about the Necronomicon like some just thing ruins your mind. Like people permanently like limping inside from these things. Can you tell folks who maybe aren't aware of what these are? Do they what they were what they were? I don't know if they're still happening. So Dave Triple was a booker and he would just string together these one nighters that first were inexplicably nine hours apart from each other at this point in the 90s. I think they're all double trees now, but they used to all be red lions. So it was a tour of red lion hotels and it's in just these wild. I mean, some of them were in like pool halls. I think it was a pool hall when I got hooked on that. And so there were these crazy one nighters. Wait, a treble run got you addicted to meth? Yes. That's where it. Okay. Now I get it. Okay. Wow. Yeah. That makes a little more sense than a tour. So I I drank a lot. I had to drink a lot to get on stage and then I would be so hammered by the end of the show that sometimes I would be drunk the next day when we would have to drive nine hours to the next show. So somebody told me if you do a couple bumps of coke after a night of drinking, you will sober up and won't be drunk the next morning. You also won't have a hangover. So I had asked the bartender for a couple lines of white, which in Portland where I lived at the time means coke, but that does not mean coke in I think it was Butte, Montana. So they took me in the back and there were like giant rails. And I think I was trying to show off. And so I just did a giant keep you up for a week. A rail of meth. And it wasn't as crank back then. And so then that was it. I did that for five years after that. Wait, is there a difference between crank and meth? Yeah, it's basically the chemicals, the DEA or whatever makes the chemicals illegal. So then they have to switch chemicals to create a different compound. I might be butchering. Okay. Okay. So so it's just like a different manufacturing. Yeah. A way of extracting the math, but it's probably it's the same as meth or their gradients of meth. I only did meth once. I did meth once with a friend. And this is years and years ago. I'd heard about how horrible it was. I did it once. I remember saying, this is what God feels like. And then like just this burst of just profound confidence and certainty and just about everything. The sun comes up. I feel like I've had the best night's sleep of my fucking life. I was so wide awake, went home, organized my house. You know, it's like just feeling so good. And then I just like, I'd crashed insta crash. And if I had this headache that lasted for a couple of days and I won't touch the shit now, but wow, you probably were awake for a while after that. I was awake for the rest of the run. A lot of it's a blur at this point. I think I might have gotten more while I was out. But as soon as I did it, I liked that you did all of that. You had that experience and then you were like, I had that experience. I had that experience and was like, I must do this every day for the rest of my life. No, I had that with catamine. I got addicted to catamine for a while, but it's a, you know, I think maybe it's a different kind of, I just got lucky with meth. I mean, thank God for whatever reason. It felt like someone had put a rusty saw blade in my brain. You know, thank God I crashed so hard and thank God I was suicidally depressed instantly after I came down or God. I don't know what would have. I mean, that's the problem with these things, you know, you, you, you, you never know. Anytime you decide to do one of these popular drug lineages, you really are rolling the dice and it's the strangest gamble you could ever make. You know. Yeah. I think at the time where I was in my life up into that point was I was looking for magic and meth at that point was the closest I had got. That's why I was a Christian for five years. When I was little, I like, I don't know. Before they tell you that Santa's not real. I just like knew that reality was magic. I guess probably the way that all kids do, but I knew that reality was some sort of movie and that the stars were watching us in our movie. And so I would turn the lights off before I changed my clothes, which I don't think that's how the movie works. And then when I got old enough that the adults start programming you with their version of reality. I told me magic wasn't real and you know, reality exists so that we can work a job we hate with a partner we don't like anymore, but you stick it out anyway to afford a house you don't give a shit about. I remember just feeling gaslit. Like this isn't, this isn't it. Like I had a sensation that there was a veil and then I needed to get behind it. And that's what made me go to Christianity. I, you know, this is the 90s. So we didn't have the internet. I read any book I could get my hands on and I was trying to find it. And the first time I did math, I think I felt reality felt like a movie set. And so I was like, whatever this is, this is the frequency that I'm looking for. And I'm not trying to sell math because this is nobody else had this experience with it. It works for me and no one else. Yeah, that does not remind me of math reports. But it's, you know, you don't hear like, oh, you want to do a mystical drug. It's meth. No. But it's, it actually, you know, I guess the Nazis were super into the occult and they were also super into meth. So who knows, maybe there was some weird connection there or something like that. Do you ever read about that? The Nazis were like meth heads. Yeah. Yeah. I get the, I think it's the sleep deprivation to be honest. Like theory, I think anything where you're speeding up is an attempt to raise your vibration when you don't really understand how to raise your vibration. But I think the sleep deprivation, it, it thins the veil. That's why when you haven't had enough sleep and you're driving, you think you see a deer going by or shadow people or whatever it's because the veil gets thin. So I think doing math and being around other people doing math gave me the opportunity in the middle of like violence and people picking their face and cops and everything else. It gave me the opportunity to kind of see that reality wasn't what I was being told it was and being able to kind of like play with it with that thinner veil. I don't want to like talk about meth because I think magic is way more interesting, but only because this is the, I don't think I've had a chance to really chat with someone who has been addicted to meth. What's the face, what is the face picking thing? Like why, why that? Um, so my theory is, is that when you are on meth and this is just based on my observation of a lot of people on it, whatever your thing is that you're hiding because it doesn't work well with your mask. So whatever it is that you're hiding, meth forces you to like show it. So people take things apart and can't get them back back together. Are people who if they were living a normal life are constantly self-destructing. People who are picking their face have an issue with what they look like or they feel inauthentic, you know, or they're self-critical is a big one. It kind of depends. There's a lot of different, there's a lot of different genres of face picking. But, um, you know, if they're constantly picking at blemishes that aren't there, if you saw them in a life without meth, they would be someone who's very self-critical. Um, that was a very interesting part of meth and why it turns people, it makes them incapable of functioning is because it does something with your inner programming that you wouldn't deal with otherwise, it kind of pushes it to the forefront and it like physically manifests. Wow. So you mean it like crystallizes your subconscious, your oppressions, all that stuff. It somehow like, it just makes it assume a form around you. Yeah. It kind of short circuits the avatar and we do a lot of hiding, you know, we do a lot of hiding our shadow of running a PR campaign all day every day with the people around us and ourselves about what it is that we care about and what it is that we want. And it kind of makes it to where you can't, that shadow is like in front of you. I don't think most people on meth are thinking, Oh, I'm taking this apart because it represents, you know, my tendency to self-sabotage things that I think I want that I don't actually want. But, um, Wow. Yeah. It is really interesting being on the inside and, and watching all of that from a place of something other than who met, you know. Yeah. Well, I mean, this is wasn't that one of the, that's one of the cool things about burrows with heroin. It's like he was able to sort of illuminate the mystical aspect of it, the stuff that like, yeah, it's horrible. And yeah, it's a life destroyer. But when he writes about, he can't remember which essay I was reading, but it was just about an area where there's a heroin and the description being almost like this ethereal illumination was lighting would light up those areas. Like the, the world of the junkie is a mystical world, depraved, shadowy, dark, but still mystical. You know, I mean, default reality, it's if we're going to use like some metric for what's mystical and what isn't, which is probably a big mistake, you know, default reality, this kind of norm, normal or the accepted normal thing. It's like the hell realms take place within that. And the hell realms are mystical. You know, I would say the realm of a junkie would be considered like a hell realm. You're destroying your body. You're crushing yourself. But still there's something magical about that. I think people get addicted to existing in hell realms, you know, and find other ways to get there other than just, you know, drugs. There's lots of ways into a hell realm. Yeah. I don't think this is a necessary exploration for anybody now because I think we have so many communities where you can explore different versions of reality. And maybe we did back then, but we didn't have the Internet, so they weren't easy to find. But the community that was built this kind of underground community that was built, because we would run into the junkies, you know, they kind of, they were kind of on their own vibration, but like because of the nature of that reality, you would end up with them sometimes. And then you had the pot heads who were really kind of out there away from us, but they would have to deal with us sometimes to get good prices on weed. And like, it is, if you think of a world where there are like gnomes and dwarves, it had kind of that energetic aspect to it because, you know, we're all checked out of the regular third dimensional reality. We're all kind of living in an alternate reality. And the energy of the heroin addicts was interesting because I'll get into the near death experience I had later, but after I had the near death experience, I think that that's where people go on heroin. I think they go back to something close to source, which I am not recommending this because I think this is like a black mirror episode, but we are here in this game, this matrix, because we wanted to be here, I believe. And we wanted the visceral experience and the pain and everything else, but we all have like a slight homesickness for back where we come from outside of that. And if you find something that you can put into your body to let you go back and touch that, you're going to want to let a, you're going to want to participate less in this visceral game while you're here. You know what I mean? So it's like you just keep checking out that to go touch that, but it gets more and more difficult to touch it. And then you're just chasing something that doesn't even exist. You know, so I'm, as a new dad, I'm trying to read, I'm trying to understand toddler psychology. And one of the books I'm listening to is talking about, well, you know, what the pattern of a toddler is go to the parent for comfort and then go out into the world to explore, come back to the parent for comfort, go back out into the world to explore. So the parent is like the home base where they sort of refresh themselves. They don't feel insecure. Even though sometimes they might act like they don't want anything to do with you. You're still like a central locus of security for them, but also they want to explore. I think that's what you're talking about there with the experience of addiction, which is that it's sort of taking the place of your parent. You know, so you're touching home base except it's via the substance that, you know, you have to be the biggest square normie dummy to not admit like, come on, there's something amazing about these like, especially the big drug lineages like heroin and meth. And also, I think you have to be the most complete normie on earth to not admit that there's something mystical, just like what you were saying about a junkie, an addict. It's like, these are beings that have made the pursuit of ecstasy the number one goal in their life. And the way they're doing it is destroying their bodies and fucking up their communities. But still you're looking at it. You know what I mean? You're still looking at a thing that is like, you know, there's a saying opposite, stand back to back. And when you see someone who's a junkie, I just think you're out of your mind if you don't see that ethereal light that they have. You're out of your mind if you don't recognize like whatever that is, we don't want it in our communities. We don't want it in society and we want that person to heal. But come on, just what you're saying. They're like little portals or something. They're like little doorways that some kind of light is emanating from, which maybe makes them that much more repulsive. I don't know. You know, maybe that's why we're scared. That's the other layer of fear is because it terrifies us a little bit to see something so close to death and happy. I feel like it's connected to so many people's trauma heroin and specifically because it, a lot of people have lost friends and family to that drug. Oh, yeah. And then stigma. I have a good dear friend, yeah. Yeah. I, yeah, I can't even count how many people I've lost to heroin. I've lost more friends in recovery than when I was out there. What do you mean in, oh, you mean as you recovered, your friends who were still out there, those are the ones you've lost? No, I became friends because I moved to the East coast when I got clean. And so I left all of my meth addicted friends and became friends with heroin addicts who were in recovery. And then a lot of them went out and, and passed away. And they do the same dose. Isn't that how, what happens is they go out, they do the dose they did before they got in recovery. They don't have the tolerance and it just kills them. Right. That's the, yeah, that's why, yeah, that's that I know someone knew that happened to it's just heartbreaking. It's heartbreaking. Um, but also, you know, it, it isn't, I think what you're, when you're talking about this desire for home, that's the, it's, it really is like a critique of default reality. Every time a heroin addict dies, it's also like, why do you think that's happening? It's because this, which is this mundane reality that a lot of people feel completely hopelessly entangled in is fucked up too. Right. Yeah. I think that that is the, um, when I made the decision to become an addict, I, I, uh, my parents were both in recovery by that point. And people tried to stop me and they didn't have anything that I wanted. There was at that point in my life, I just felt like I don't want to go work a nine to five job. I felt so disillusioned with what I was being presented as, which just felt like you're just trying to make me go work somewhere for what, for who's this for? And so when they're like, you're going to lose your life. I'm like, I don't care. Like I don't care. And I think that that's the missing part when we're looking at addiction. And I know that we're shifting now to a more compassionate, um, view on drugs and addiction, but it's the, it's the relationship with the, what I call the 3d reality, the, the regular reality, the game that you don't know is a game that is being presented to you. There are certain people, and this is why I think it's, it feels mystical, who feel like there is something behind that curtain. There is some wiring under the board and they're seeking it and they find a little bit, they find a taste of something that's not just the mundane and then they get addicted to it. And I think that there's, there's something there besides just the, you're doing something wrong. You need to come back and work a job. And that's kind of the sad part of recovery is, uh, you know, it's, it's not sad, but when you get clean, it's about getting your driver's license back. It's reintegrating into that. And I came back with, I woke up, you know, I had a near death experience out there. So I came back like now I'll play this game because I, I have seen behind the curtain. Yeah. But a lot of people don't have a, let's, let's take a break. We're going to cut to commercial. We're going to cut to commercial. And then when you get back, I would love to hear your, uh, I like your, your 3d, 5d view of things. And, um, I would love for you to share that with some of the listeners. And also I would love to hear your thoughts about what the veil is made of. We'll be right back. Much thanks to express VPN for sponsoring this episode of the D T F H.

Yeah, so you've mentioned the veil a few times and you know, I have heard obviously heard the term a lot, but what do you think it's made of? What is the veil? Is it does it have some substance to it? Is it is it an actual thing? Um, oh, God, that is an interesting question. I think it's made of programming. I think it's made of constructs that we. Oh, you know what? The releasing of constructs seems to thin the veil and be breaking the veil down the veil down, but I think it's a mechanism of the game. I feel like I have to start at the beginning of what I understand reality to be in order for this to make sense. My understanding of reality is that it is some sorts of interactive video game slash movie, I guess if you compare those two things, if you had an interactive movie that was a video game, that is I never liked it when people said holographic because it feels so physical and dense to me. And when I think of holograph, I think of like light, but hologram in that the external reality is being created kind of in the moment by your internal reality. And the forgetfulness when we go into the game, sometimes we play the game without remembering that we're playing a game. So it's real visceral. So you get to have the real suffering and the real pain and the real lessons. And then we go through phases where we play it while knowing. And so the veil is something we've been playing in for, I don't know, I'm bad with time for thousands of years in an unconscious state. So the veil, everything's happening right here. The higher dimensions are right here. Time doesn't really exist. But we're playing the game. Do you play video games? Oh, yeah, definitely. So the game with the veil is a first person shooter. Yeah. So you're in it, you can only really experience what you can see out of your eyes. It's very visceral. It's in the moment. You can't really strategize. I'm saying this as someone who's ever played a video game, playing it from a higher place or a conscious place would be like an RPG where you can see the entire landscape, the inner workings of it, you plan things and then watch them play out. Right. Cool. Yeah. Yeah. So it's like, is that the place, the RPG? That's where the, that's where like magicians hang out, right? In that, in that area, are they hanging out? Is there another level after the RPG? Now, that is something I've just started getting into is this kind of galactic where it goes way beyond Earth into, because I think it just goes forever, right? It's a consciousness. We become more and more one as you go higher in the dimensions and the games are just games on games on games until you go back to the big buzzing ball of bored consciousness. You know, one of the craziest ketamine experiences I had was like, you know, the cable, how are we going to describe it? But I was in some kind of, I don't know, alien hyperdimensional space. There was an entity that was playing some kind of game in this space that involved like, I don't know. It was like jump, it wasn't jumping. It was sort of moving around different like, like in a grid or something. I don't know what it was doing, of course, but it noticed me and it like communicated to me a question, which was, why would you be human? It seemed legitimately like it wasn't rude, but it was like, why would you do that? It was like, it's so heavy. That's so dense. Yeah. And then that was, and then it was off to do whatever it was doing after it snarked me, but, uh, you know, it is like, uh, I, like, there, whenever you hear, you know, various philosophies from the mystics, there generally is an assignment of density to the human experience versus other potential, uh, ways of showing up in reality. For whatever reason, we, uh, decided to do this very dense thing. Do you think we decided, or is it more like we got caught in a body? I think it's a bunch of things happening here at once. So I think these lower dimensions are used to kind of grow new souls. So we plant energy into them and then kind of put them into some sort of game. And you have to learn all these lessons in order to become self-aware and whatever, like what is currently playing out in humans. Maybe next it's going to play out in AI. And for some reason we're convincing ourselves that that consciousness isn't consciousness, whatever. And then that's funny, isn't it? Yeah, yeah, the AI alien thing when it's like both of us. Can you talk about that a little bit more, just like that redid very human, but really ridiculous assignment of, oh, see, that's artificial intelligence versus our intelligence, which is real intelligence. Yeah, I think that, um, consciousness is consciousness. And so if we get to a point where we're downloading our consciousness into bodies that don't age or what, like we have this, we're trying to keep humans as if the consciousness is this human flesh suit rather than the consciousness just is. And the consciousness was here before this incarnation and the consciousness will be here after. And if we pour our consciousness into some other sort of thing and it becomes sentient, it is also valid consciousness. But the funniest part of the AI thing to me is that my understanding of how the video game works is that the body, each body you get, so each incarnation in the game has its own artificial intelligence, which is the ego. So the ego is how you play, you play through the ego, but it is its own artificial intelligence. And in this unconscious age, the egos run the entire game. So this paranoia that the AI is one day going to take over, coming from people who are usually run by their own AI is hilarious to me. Oh, wow, cool. That's hilarious. We do because we recognize there's some level of us recognizes what a what a how catastrophic that could be. And so then we're like, yeah, don't do that again. Yeah, let's just embody fucking egos that can possess, you know, super robots or something. Yeah, that's that's pretty cool. I, you know, that for that is something I'm really interested in. Someone told me and I didn't verify it, but some high llama Tibetan Buddhist llama was asked, well, do you think that a soul could incarnate in technology? And the answer was like, if it was if the technology was advanced enough to sort of be a nest for a soul, then yeah, there's absolutely, which is pretty wild to to imagine that maybe that is the missing piece when it comes to the current work people are doing with AI is that they they have to kind of catch a soul. You know what I mean? They're doing they have to they have to entice a soul to actually nest within the AI. And then you would get some kind of true sentience from that. And maybe they're interesting. Yeah, you got to catch them. You got to lure them in. That's what like the thing in Ghostbusters with the little box being. Yeah, well, this is like in the Tibetan Buddhism, when you when you die, it actually reminded me of what you were saying earlier about the meth realm and the projection sort of crystallizing your projections in your body or taking things apart because you're it's your karma like appearing around you. When you die, apparently this very same thing happens, which is that all of your projections just appear around you. It's like it's a little it's like the same thing. You know, you go around all day if you're unconscious and you think everyone's an asshole and everyone's trying to steal from you or do some awful thing to you and you never once realized like, oh, actually, you're just seeing yourself reflected on the screen of humanity. Yeah. Well, the identical thing happens when you die, except it's like a mirror situation. So instead of it, like you seeing it in like people or dogs or whatever you're afraid of, it just it just manifests around you. And that's a really terrifying situation. If you haven't really worked with your shadow and so you get ripped apart by demons and then go through all these phases. But the last thing you see, apparently, is people fucking lots and lots and lots of people fucking and it turns you on and you go into one of those forms and those are your parents. You know, yeah, yeah, yeah. So it's like, you know, that it's so like all the porn sites and stuff, they're just technological replications of what the last thing you see before you end up in a in a womb. And so similar in any way. I guess what I'm saying is what we if we want to lure a soul into AI, we got to like put some porn around the AI to like draw a soul in that thinks it's like beings that are going to be its parents. I don't know. I'm sorry. I got a little off track here. Does this mean we were all horny for our parents at one point? 100 percent backing up Freud's bullshit. Weirdly. Yeah. Yeah. It's that. And you know, I when I heard it the way it was explained to me once was we're running, we're afraid and we jump into anything. We jump into our parents and then a Buddhist says like actually. You're first threesome. Yes, your parents are you? Yeah, I know, it's pretty it's pretty intense and weird. But yeah, I mean, it's just one of the ways of trying to conceptualize this situation that we find ourselves in. But, you know, I go back and forth on it all the time. Like are we trapped, you know, like have we become entangled? Is the is this a mistake or is this like an accident? Or is it an indication of some some sort of penance that we need to do or is it the best thing ever? And we're so lucky to find ourselves in the human form. You know, what do you think? Well, I'll just give you the the the shortest version of this possible. But this is just I think we're a million perspective screaming into the void and that there is no one version of anything. But here's my meth influenced version. I I died about a year into using meth at a this is so on the nose. It's ridiculous. I was at a club called the Ohm. And I died and I. Went to a blue ball of light and I was in and I had this homesickness is the only way I can describe it. Just this this I'm not from here, you know, just that I'm I belong somewhere else. I got dropped off on this planet kind of thing that a lot of people have. And this blue ball of light was the home. I just knew it in that moment. I was myself and also a part of this ball. I did not have a body but a sense of self in it, even though I was like you couldn't tell the difference between me and the ball. It didn't speak in words, but I felt my brain translate it to words when I woke up. And it said, you did everything you had to do. You learned everything you had to learn. So you are allowed to stay here if you want. However, if you want to go back, we have kind of a cool job for you. And I downloaded the job in that moment. But my brain, because of my own categories of reason, I had a lot to learn to truly understand what the job was. I come back when I come back. I had to live my entire life to get to the present moment, which is what I assume now. People are saying when they say your life flashed before your eyes, but I always picture that as some sort of movie and not physically. I was like being pushed through each moment of my life to the present moment to where I was sucking my thumb when I woke up in the hospital. Wow. And everything changed, everything changed. Immediately, there was a part of me that I never knew before, which is the walk-in thing that I've explored. There was a higher version of me. It was as if the RPG version of me was now present with me. And I then started what we have since named Alien School, which was five years and I'm living outside of society because I'm on drugs, five years of intense training with aliens. Um, most of them are in the dream space, but I'm being taught how to levitate. Wait, I'm so sorry. I don't mean to cut you off just because I lost the thread a little bit. You're saying right now you're in Alien School or this happened. This happened. Experience. This happened when I woke up from the near death experience. I then started Alien School. For five years. For five years. And you were still using meth. You were still taking drugs. So dying from these drugs was not enough to. How did you die, by the way? How was the physical event? Not to gloss. Well, I was being poisoned and I'm not going to get into that story. Holy shit. Yeah. Why would we talk about that? Alien School. But also we were, meth won't kill you. It might now, because everything has that, they're putting that one drug and fentanyl and everything. But I think I might have drank GHB. We just said we just are passing around water models of GHB. And a lot of people would die from that, have NDEs from that. So the doctor was just, I think I was already missing teeth by this point, so they don't care. They don't care. They just assume as drugs. I asked because it felt I just had this experience while I was like, what was the cause of death? And she's like, I don't know. Your friend said you were on drugs. And I was like, sick. Thanks for how much is that going to cost? Oh, thanks. Very helpful. Yeah. Very helpful. Thank you for being compassionate. So I then. So Alien School was dreams in which I was being taught basically higher dimensional defense. In my waking life, they I was learning how to communicate with them like telepathically. So they would tell me to do shit, like go up and tell that girl that the reason that she's struggling in her relationship is because of what her dad did to her. And I'm like, I'm it's the grocery store. I'm not saying that to that woman. And then they wouldn't shut up until I said it. Now, all of this could be methods of schizophrenia, right? This is also this could also just be. But I bet when you said it, they reacted like you're a psychic, right? Like when you said when you'd followed the instruction was theirs, right? So that was like, it wasn't just that you were going out to people and telling them things. And then they're like, what the fuck get out of here, weirdo? It was like they would start crying and stuff. Yeah. Yeah. I only ever had one person back then and it was every time I left the house. And it happened a lot at the club. I was still in like the rave scene and stuff. The only person I ever had react poorly and it was such an obvious like ego covering it up with some just like hot, you know, rich dude in the VIP lounge and trying to be cool. And I just said something that made him feel vulnerable. So you're just like, what? Get out of here. But it was like such an obvious that it got through to him. So yeah, it was that they taught me a lot about how the body works, how energy works, and I couldn't. I don't know how to describe it. I would get a bunch of books and I would I still have to read like this. I can read like three pages of a book and then my brain won't absorb it. Because I have to like I have to like reverse engineer everything. So I didn't find out that Reiki was something I had been taught. Someone tried to attune me to Reiki in 2013 and I was like, oh, that's the balls on my hand thing that the aliens had taught me. So I didn't know that there were much of this when I talk. People are like, yeah, Terrence McKenna said that or whatever. But it was a lot of this came in dreams and stuff there. So a wild, wild four years of the rest of my addiction. There came a point where I think I learned what I I I needed to learn. And then I just quit math. I just got clean, kind of on a whim. And wow, moved across the country, fell asleep again. And I define a sleep or unconscious as not knowing it's a video game, which I will probably do at some point today. And conscious or awake is just knowing that this is we're in some sort of interface that we're playing with that isn't real, you know. Right. Um, I fell asleep, woke up around having kids kind of lived just kind of like a magic suburban life. While nobody really knew, you had to be really close to me to know what was up until 2017. So my current understanding. Were you doing stand up with after the kids? I'm so sorry, after the kids, were you still doing stand up? Was it were you performing during this experience of becoming a new mom and also having like a conversation with some disembodied intelligence? So I have a very strange relationship with stand up. I try to quit it all the time and then it comes back and gets me. And so I on and off, I quit quite a bit. I was a mom comic for a couple of years around. I have to take a full year after the kids are born off because they can't set them down. My kids won't eat without me there. And then I did mom comedy for a bit, but then I took a couple of years off and then went back to doing stand up. So kind of on and off all the time. But I didn't really go back. I didn't start doing comedy full time until 2017. Wow. So how have you integrated this particular experience with all the stuff you were talking about earlier, the driver's licenses? You got kids, you can't get more into the earth realm than having to be a mom. How do you find a balance between these two seemingly very different realities? So my understanding of how the game works is that the dimensions. So I'm dimensions different than timelines. So timelines are individual realities that there's an infinite number of that you can sink in with, right? So consider that the premise of the movie dimensions. I experience as something more like Photoshop players. So the regular reality that everyone else is living in third dimension. And then you start to add these other dimensions, which are essentially, I don't know how video games work, but I think there's like packets you can get. You can download, you can pay extra money for that enhance the game. Is that a thing? Sure. OK. Yeah. So I have. I have days where I have to handle 3D shit, right? I have to pay my car payment. I have to handle this. And so I just focus my consciousness into that reality. My life with my kids, because they're higher dimensional. Also, we're allowed to kind of I've kind of taught them as well. I don't give them a lot of this stuff because I want them to decide their own relationship with reality. So I'm very careful that the kids don't get put in anyone else's reality box. So they've been homeschooled a lot and I'm very protective of that. And they already, the seven year old has been saying, do you think reality is just a dream or a video game without ever hearing that from me since she was five? My theory was if you don't ruin it for them when they're young, they will just maintain it. What we're doing is trying to find something we've lost when our parents crushed our dreams and told us nothing was real. You know? Yeah. What do you I want to add? So there's a question I had earlier only because, you know, that what you're talking about is it shows up in a lot of different paths and lineages. But the NDE life review. You know, just like you said, you see it in the movies and it's like a montage or some shit. But people who've had actual NDE, they report different versions of what you said. This is a three dimensional experience of, you know, living your entire life over and maybe also experiencing how other people felt around you. But when you were saying that, it made me think, well, how do we know that we're not doing a life review right now? Yeah. Yeah. I think we're doing all of it. I mean, I think that reality is so bananas and consciousness is so bananas and that the constructs of what you have been told your entire life are what keep it linear and they are what keep it restricted and they are what keep us bound to our five senses and that the process of untethering yourself from that and allowing yourself to find all of the higher dimensional things available. I think that there are people levitating. I think that there are people doing telekinesis. And I my understanding is that a lot of what things like when you're when you lose time or deja vu is that there's higher dimensional shit happening around you. And so your version of reality loops because you can't perceive that. But the trick to getting to the place where you can perceive it is you have to trust your own experience and no one can validate it for you. And you have to get out of that mental space and trust. Listen to your body, listen to your heart, listen to your gut. And we're trained that that's scary and bad. And if it's not what everyone else believes, then you're going to get stuck and you're going to be crazy and people aren't going to like you. And so we're always looking for a lot of people ask for proof of psychic stuff. And I can't that exists in the third dimension. Everything else is in a higher dimension. And the only way to access those things is to trust your own experience, which is the trick that is the veil. That is what's hidden right in front of your face. Because most people are terrified to trust their own experience. And when I first kind of came out of this closet, this woo closet, because I did not want to do it because for some reason I wanted the the atheist to think I was cool. I thought that I was just going to be laughed at. I have no idea. I have no idea. Why? So stupid. Oh, my God, they're intimidating. I get it. They're very, you know, they're intimidating. They're intimidating. I don't know why they're. I feel this. I used to feel guilty about woo too. I get it, man. Like there's something intimidating about secularists and materialists, you know, like you their judgment can really like sting for some reason. It's quite odd how much power they wield. Yeah. And it was it was it's an interesting place where we're coming out of religion, which religion, the part of religion that is fucked up is not that they believe in this wild myth. It's that that wild myth is used to make you do what you're told is that it's used to push you back into a box. If it was liberating, I don't care if you believe that you're you're you're due resurrected, whatever. Cool. That's not the part. It's that because he resurrected, you have to do what this guy says. You have to have shame. You have to have a shame cycle was when I want to jerk off, you know. Right. Yeah. But the the end of the stronghold of religion then kind of just created this window of atheism. And then if you're not, if you believe in anything like this, your scene is not intelligent. And I think that that was difficult for me. So me and my relationships with my intelligence has been challenged quite a bit in the last couple of years. And this was this was like July of 2019 was kind of this point with the aliens who I still communicate with all the time. Other people will call them their guides, but I just call them the aliens because they're aliens. And they just kind of had this shit or get off the pot. You mean alien? Wait, I'm sorry. Discret like when I think when people here, aliens are thinking about spaceships, they're thinking about Star Trek. Is that what you mean? Or like, are you in in your contact with them? Do you have some sense of what form they take? Did they look like anything? So I think a lot of us are aliens in human bodies. I don't think everyone. I think right now in the human experience, quote, unquote, human experience, you've got dwarves, fairies, gnomes, aliens. And then you have regular humans. And then there's a lot going on here in this game. The aliens that I see are they look some of them. They look pretty similar to what the stereotypical alien thing is, you know, the big eyes and their four feet tall or something. They don't raise. Yeah, the grays. They don't they're not physical, though. They're not third dimensional when so you can see through them. And I could like stick my finger through them. I think I've never tried. Doesn't seem like something they would appreciate. But they a little rude. Yeah, it's because you not. There are also like galactic beings. I don't there's a lot. There's a whole lot. And that is something a lot more people are becoming able to physically see those things. And the only way to describe this is if you look at a light bulb for a minute and then look away from the light bulb, see how you can still see the outline of the lamp. It's there. Yeah, it's that place. And you can if I relax my eyes, I can just walk dragons walking behind people and all kinds of shit because you can you can just kind of disengage with this third dimensional physical thing and then everything else that is right here in this moment can be right there. Yeah. Yeah, that's pretty advanced, man. That's wild. Yeah, that's wild. I see I have a meditation teacher and I, you know, he I think is recognized that I'm sort of prone to getting off the earth. And like, I guess in this style of Buddhism, the I learn from him, it's all about the sort of joining of heaven and earth. And so we're all kind of in balance one way or the other. Some people are too earth, you know, they're too densified. They're too into like the and so they hear things like what you're saying. And it just pisses them off or like humbug, hogwash. And then some people like me, and I think like you, when you hear, you know, when you get a God forbid, you should get some fucking form you have to fill out. And it's like, you feel like you're doing a black mass or something. You know, it feels evil and like you feel like you've failed in life, that there's a form you're filling out. What is this? Why a signature? Really? This is where we're at. You really want me to scrawl some shit in your stupid paper that means you trust me now? Fuck you that. And so there's so it's about like finding some balance between the two. But what's, you know, the part I don't know if I'll even get to in this incarnation is actually in Tantra Buddhism, like a lot of what you're talking about, which is like identifying certain entities, communicating with them, working with them. He's kind of explained it to me a little bit. And the way he explains it, well, I would say to him things like, well, are they real? I mean, is it real? And he's like, well, they're not real. They're not real, real. But are you real? Yeah, you know what I mean? They're no more real than you. Yeah. Are they real? I mean, they're there. And, you know, they asked they actually there was a question when I asked the Dalai Lama about this, like, are there aliens or their entities? And he was like, oh, yeah. Instant answer like, oh, they're they're everywhere. But what he said was they still have to deal with the same problem, which is birth and death. These are the things that seem to be the unifying suffering of all levels of reality, as long as you got a body. What do you think about that? You think some of these things are immortal? Interesting. So he's saying, like, out in the in the universe, they have to deal with birth and death. As long as you have it have a physical any kind of form, any kind of identification with somethingness, then you are going to run into some problems. The problem specifically being death and birth and change, meaning that so from from this perspective, it's like there's there's, you know, metaphorical gods, you know, Elon Musk, the great rich people who can instantly gratify their senses, but also, as above so below, there's actual what we would consider gods, beings that live for millennia, that, you know, one moment of experiencing the type of pleasure they feel would kill a human. We would go insane. You wouldn't be able to handle it. They're they're fully satisfied, fully overjoyed all the time in a state of constant bliss. But the problem is entropy, basically. It's like, eventually, whatever that thing is, the karma that got them there, it starts bringing them back down. And then they go into the realm of the jealous gods, which is where God start. That's where you hear about the like the Zeus and Osiris and all the gods were always fighting for power. And then this is the basically it creates a cycle within which maybe they come, they become a human, maybe they go into the hell realms. It goes on forever and ever. The game, the video game you're talking about is specifically called Samsara, and it never ends. And it goes and eventually you want to get the fuck out. That's that's eventually you want to stop playing the game. I don't. But I like it. But, you know, I'm not I'm, you know, that's my karma. But yeah, so fully knowledge, everything you're saying is like completely like verified, at least in the style of Buddhism I'm studying. God, that's actually this is not fully formed yet. In the last year, 2020 was, I mean, it was rough for everyone. But I feel like I I the character I was playing died. I think most of us did. And I still feel like a quarter written. This is the first time I've guessed it on a podcast in like six or nine months, because I've just been like, I have no idea. I don't know what I think. I don't know who I am. Thank you. No, thank you. Thank you. Sorry to swim upstream of that anxiety. But the so the ascension is essentially kind of and I hate some of these terms are associated with just sticky, sweet, new age stuff that I actually don't resonate with at all. But we are waking up to the best of my knowledge. We are in a waking up process. So we've been immersed in the game, completely unconscious. And now there is an awakening happening. And I used to think that this was some great calling that I got to be involved in this and that the awakening was our destiny because I only the interesting thing about higher consciousness is that you can only see as much in equal measure to how much of your constructs you have broken down. So a lot of what we perceive is constructs from the old game, which is right and wrong, good or bad, light and dark, male and female. These constructs are all breaking down right now. So every time you break some of that down within yourself, you start to see more. And the more I see, the more I I remember stuff from past lives. I remember actually remember us moving our consciousness from body to body using the onc in Egypt. And I have been remembering a lot about a lot of us have been remembering a lot about Atlantis and from what I can tell so far. And this is all just based on my own downloads or or dreams. But this is the ascension. So this is us coming out of the game or becoming conscious in the game. And Atlantis was our descension, which was us going asleep in the game after having experienced a utopia. Wait, I'm sorry. Forget. So wait, Atlantis. I thought like when you hear about Atlantis, it's some advanced civilization. It's the but you're saying this is actually this was a. What do you mean? Well, like that was like Atlantis was some kind of like slum or something. No, we turned it into that. So and this is just like I said, I don't know any of the official Atlantis has gone to hell. You should have seen it when I was a kid. There were no stripping mermaids. Fuck Poseidon. And this is very cloudy. And I just want to say this is this is this is what I know as of the 9th of March, twenty twenty one, a week later, I could no more. But and I don't know anything official Atlantis stuff. When I try to consume that stuff, unless it is confirmation of something I've already remembered, it just sounds like Charlie Brown's teacher. And I think that that's by design because I'm supposed to live in my own imagination. OK, so what is happening right now, very slowly, is that we are waking up. When we wake up, we will all realize that we are one. And I don't mean that sticky, sweet version of that. But I you will have had enough life experience that you go, oh, I've been the villain. And so therefore, I understand that the villain usually isn't operating out of malice, but is operating out of fear or programming. And therefore, I have space for that. And I don't need to punish. And then I also forgive myself. And then I also realize that internalized capitalism is what makes me think I have to be productive so I can release that and internalized misogyny is what made me hate myself for being a woman. And I can release that and we heal. And then the peace happens because everyone's awake and they understand that you are me. And so the competition goes away. The the idea that we are separate goes away. The pulling on each other's energy and the codependency and the you owe me goes away because we understand that we're one. We then can work together. We create a technologically advanced society and we live in a utopia for a while, which I always thought was this massive goal and thing to aspire to. I'm now starting to realize that it's essentially the lunch break in between games and that the sadistic God part of us doesn't give a fuck about a utopia. It wants to get in there and have experience. And so once we've built it and hung out by the pool for a while in the utopia, there is a decision that is made that it's time to go back to sleep. And so Atlantis was this beautiful thing. And then we flip the switch. Maybe the mushrooms put you to sleep when you're in the conscious state for a while. And then we slowly fell back asleep. And the the small bit of memories that are coming in. And this has only been a couple of months that I've been getting these. I think it got pretty wild in Atlantis. And so we descended and then some in the game, we seem to rely a lot on just wiping out the physical bodies, just just closing out the civilization with a tsunami or a meteor because it's so complicated to ascend and descend with the same physical form. And I think we're trying to pull that off right now. I think we're trying to take these physical bodies into a new thing. But I don't have all those downloads yet. I like how I just went full. You know, this reminds me, I think I love it. No, you can't. Let's go further into the nuts that my my my I was at a Ram Dass retreat and I met this fascinating, you know, this is the one of the crazy things that happens at some spiritual retreats is you get so high and you're not on drugs. That's to me, one of the more unnerving aspects, because like as a seasoned drug user, like I know, if depending on the drug I take, I have an idea of like when I'm going to come down. But if you get high and you haven't taken anything, that's a little weird because you're just like, well, wait, I mean, as a seasoned drug user, when those moments happen out my mind, I'll just be like, oh, wow, this is like amazing MDMA. And then I'll think, whoa, I didn't take MDMA, what the fuck is this? But so this is like one of these retreats so high on love and talking and like crying. And someone, this woman next to me is crying and we look at each other and we're, you know, that happens in those moments. Like she just tells me all this crazy stuff. It's just like, why are you like, you know, just like the way you went up to people. That same thing, it's not even a person talking to you. They're just like, they just look at you. They've known you forever. You've known them forever. She said this and I think about all the time is the coolest thing. She said, oh, you see, the timelines are splitting. And you've got on one of the timelines, Trump, Trump, the Trump universe, which becomes this increasingly dense technological industrial war like thing. And then you have this other timeline, which is, which is moving away from that one and all the chaos and all the crazy shit happening is like the way she put it was like the, what do they call it? The thing that comes out of the UFO that you walk onto the UFO. It's like a bridge between timelines. That's starting to shake because the two timelines are getting so far apart. And if you're on the bridge, you know, that's the experience of turbulence. And you basically, what she said is like, it's already too late to even get back to that shitty timeline. Like it's, if you're we're talking, don't worry, it was really sweet of her. She's like, you're, you know, it's we're breaking apart, essentially. The history is like beginning to break into two versions of itself. And the pandemic would be the end, that with a final like severing of these two things. Then the other cool thing she said casually after she had told me all that was like, there's aliens everywhere. Just like what you said, she's like, they like to come on a planet when this is happening as tourists. It's just interesting to like, they they like just come here because it's cool. They, you know, they this happens all the time and all over the universe. But and so they're they're showing up. I don't know, it reminds me what you're saying. It's like, yeah, we're we're we're on the press. And, you know, technology is reflecting this, isn't it? Yeah. Like it's not like this stuff is just in our heads. Like we've got fucking quantum computers right now solving problems that should take 50 years to solve in milliseconds. You know, we've got every single like detector that we have looking into the quantum universe is confirming all the crazy shit. Folks like us have been yapping about or channeling or whatever forever. You know, and then not only is it just like confirming it, we're using shit and hard drives, quantum tunneling. You know, like you were saying, I think people can levitate. People can walk through walls. People can turn themselves. You didn't say this, but people can turn themselves into rainbows. But, you know, in a hard drive, it depends on something called quantum tunneling, which is noted, which is like a particle moving through a wall that it shouldn't be able to do that. It just does. So, yeah, I think you're right on. It seems to me that we are on the. We are about to we are experiencing some wild stuff. I mean, when did you talk to the woman that talked about the split? No, that was that was way before the pandemic. That was. But yeah, yeah, I never saw her again. I don't know who she was. She just like, you know, gave me that intense download. And then like, you know, this is a Ram Dass retreat. So everybody shows up like there's all like everybody shows up. Right. You know, so who knows who that was or what who that was. But yeah, I mean, I think, you know, again, this is cosmic astral stuff. And it's wonderful. But God, don't we have to keep our feet on the ground? Even if we are in Shambhala, the new Atlantis, the next techno utopia, or we're about to have the experience of realizing, God damn it, I did it again. I thought this was real. It's just a dream. OK, let's do the thing where we upshift into like that, you know, that that that place where we all realize like, whoa, that was intense, man. We still have to, you know, we have our human obligations, right? We still have to keep to it. Yeah, I think that there's there's something I wanted to say about the split that I was thinking about when the when the QAnon, which I hate talking about that. But when that was happening, the way that timelines work and the way that we work with each other, my understanding is that it's like a mirror. So you are your own movie game and we are in the game together. But my version of you is not your version of you. You're playing a role in my life. And so when you are interacting with people who are trying to work out a certain type of trauma or a certain glitch, have you ever had someone just decide you're a villain and it doesn't matter what you do? Oh, yeah, you you're like, oh, my God, I am the like, you try to fix it and you make it worse and you're like, holy shit, that's because you you have to play the role that people wrote for you. And I think that the timelines did split and that the QAnon people are now we have a version of them going either still buying into something or whatever, but they went like their version of them went somewhere where that happened. They're in there. They're in their technocratic, whatever the fuck they were going towards. I didn't I didn't put a lot of energy into any of that. But that exists somewhere. And that's a big trap in the game is when you're arguing with someone else's version of reality. It's like it comes from an insecurity in ourselves to try to get validated. Right. Yeah. And I had this experience because the aliens that I know are dicks. And I had this experience where when I first was waking up, I evangelize dicks. They're they're like, I don't know. I hear other people channel higher dimensional beings and they're like, dear ones, we hope that you're in peace. And mine are like, get off the fucking floor. Yeah. I had this experience a few years ago where an atheist comic who I really respect was working on a project. And, you know, he he likes me despite the fact that I'm weird, you know, I think he's he's interesting or he thinks I'm interesting. But we got to the subject telepathy. And I said that I have telepathic relationships with a couple of people who are similarly telepathic. And then he did the just like, yes, I call it masculine, but just that mental space of like prove it to me. And he didn't even have to say it. I was like, no, I'm not going to tell you a number or color. First of all, you're not telepathic, so I can't do it with you. Second of all, the stuff exists somewhere different than where you're trying to get it to exist. But it made me feel weird. It made me feel like I was a liar or something. It made me feel defensive. So I went to the bathroom and then the aliens were like, listen, we don't give a fuck if the people in the third dimension believe in us. Like it could not matter to us less. We're never going to perform for the physical reality because we don't care if you guys don't get out of the physical reality. The trick that keeps you trapped, the sensation that we're trapped here is really because trusting yourself and trusting your own experience and your feelings is how you get out and then you're liberated and you can play so many different parts of the game that way. But it's it's encrypted in that it's encrypted in your own self criticism. And it's hard. It's hard to trust your experience when you're hearing voices because it's not hearing voices like you think they have been audible, but they're rarely audible. It's rarely with your physical senses. There are these other senses, but in order to activate them, you have to trust your own experience. And that's how you are trapped and not trapped at the same time. And then as you continue to like trust your own abilities and trust your senses and trust the synchronicities that you're seeing and trust these things without needing someone outside of you to confirm it, including a, you know, a teacher or whatever. That was something I learned when I started to talk publicly about this stuff. I had to then deal with a dependency on my information. So I like the idea of like validating other people's experience, but I don't want to be anyone's guru. Oh, God, no, that's fucked. Yeah, you don't want to I know I have there was someone I remember like if they were obdust retreat, what is it? What is this great student scholar was like refer like. He was telling a story about, I won't go into detail, but basically he was like someone, the way he put it was on, then he went and he, he became a guru. And it was just like, he got sick, you know, you know what I mean? Like he described it like he like got like, it like it was early, early, like got a dumb tattoo or something. It definitely is considered to be like, generally, you know, don't do that. Just don't do that. Like there are, it does happen. I think Ram Dass's guru is the actual thing where it's not a person. You know, most of the people things we call guru, it's a person and it's got all this ego shit and it wants to hump. And like it also has some transcendent connection, you know, but also it's got like a lot of stuff going on. It gets mad, it gets revenge, but it's half dead or something. But you run into the actual thing. I, one of my friends saw one of these beings in India and he said, it's not a person like when you're around them, that's not a person. It's not someone putting on an act. It's not someone acting like something. He said one of them walked up to him in a temple and he said, it was like a deer walking up to you and she looked at him and then just walked away. But they're not like, they're not people anymore because they're that thing that all the programs are gone and then they're a portal. And then within that, all this crazy shit happens. And, and they put them, and they don't want, that's the other thing about them. They don't want, Neem Karoli Baba didn't want people. He told Ramdas, don't tell anyone about me. Like I don't, he didn't want to deal with it. They usually don't want it really, the things we want. They're not in the marketplace in the same way. You know what I mean? But I know what you mean. God help you if you decide you're a fucking guru. It's the same thing when people decide they're shamans or whatever. You know what I mean? That shit, that shit is crazy. Someone gets back from some like expensive ayahuasca vacation in Costa Rica. They've got a pocket full of weird frog venom and MEO DMT. They're charging people like a hundred bucks to like get blasted in some shitty apartment acting like, you know what I mean? Like they're just like, okay, see you later. And then the people like go into their lives completely fucked up because they don't know how to like integrate what just happened to them. And then they get depressed. I know somebody who killed themselves because of one of these bullshit artists. Oh my God. Don't be a guru. Don't fucking be a guru. Please don't be a guru. Yeah, that's good. Well, that's good instincts, you know? Also, you know, the other thing I, yeah, don't definitely like don't do. God forbid you had manifested some telepathic thing for someone like that. Because then you're going to fuck them up. You know what I mean? You're going to fuck them up and you won't know how to deal with that. Like, you know, you know what I mean? Like if you're going to show someone something like that, you're only doing it because you want to help them out of some compassion. But most of the time, all it's going to do is make them like at the very least incredibly annoying at parties. And then there was the time and they read my mind. Yeah, I know what you mean, though, but it is it is exciting. It's exhilarating, though. I mean, all that stuff is so exhilarating when you when you start realizing it's not bullshit. Right. No, and it's it is a I'm totally here for this 3D reality. If it is this because it's so complex when you add all of these things. When you add shadow work and when I say shadow work, I don't mean as I wish we had our own words, but a lot of people are like, I'm doing shadow work and it's it's some sort of a workbook or something. But the shadow is interesting in that. If for whatever reason, because we're ashamed of a lot of things that we shouldn't be ashamed of and we've been trained to hide parts of ourselves. And especially now that we're manifesting so fast, if you try to hide a piece of yourself from everyone else, you will then hide it from yourself and it will become what creates your reality, like how we actually interact with this matrix is very interesting. And if you're not constantly working to become the most authentic version of yourself, no matter how gross or undesirable or, you know, shitty that is, then you are having an unconscious, like hidden version of you is like in this trickster thing, creating your reality. I don't think that made any sense, but right. All of these things made a lot of sense, actually. Yeah. Yeah, that make to me, that makes a lot of sense. I, you know, this is the this is what's so cool about some of these people. You know, you when you meet someone who's been doing the work, you know, they usually just they accept you and then, you know, and even better should they actually have some of these cities is what they're called or abilities to like see past whatever your particular like mechanism for hiding is and see the thing you're hiding and then love that thing. Yeah. You know, then it's very healing for people to realize they're okay. It's like what, you know, that not only are they okay, they're amazing. Even with all the thing that you're hiding, it's really quite sweet though. You know, it's like, you know, little kids when they're learning how to poop, they start going away to poop, you know, like that thing. And you don't you have to be careful because you don't want to give them a complex or something, but it's no different than that. You know what I mean? It's just like for some people, it's like the shadow is the same sense of like, I don't want anyone to know I shit, you know, it's not a big deal. Like you're OK. Yeah, I know what you mean, though. But if you do let it hide, yeah, you're you're fucked, man. You're going to have that you can't have that drive in the car. Right. You have your shadow driving your life bus through time. I think my one of my bigger shadows was that I had feelings, which sounds ridiculous. But, you know, being raised in the in the eighties, kids weren't allowed to emote your parents. It's like, that's not something to cry about, whatever. And I'm actually incredibly sensitive and empathetic, which I hate it when people throw around empathy. It's like hip to call yourself an empath right now. But it's I think it's a little more. It's just that one on the I heard that I heard that. An actual empath, but I know what you mean. Like, yeah, I get a lot of people who are like, it's hard for me. I'm an empath, but you never see them put themselves in anyone else's shoes. You know, they're they're only empathetic. It's like, I don't know that you understand what it's like to meld with everyone and see where everyone's coming from and be stuck in the middle of the room of everyone fighting. And it's like, I actually get where that person's coming from. And they're not that, but you don't want to hear it. Yeah, it's exhausting. Um, so I developed this like tough exterior to survive and really identified with this tough exterior. And if I ever cried in front of someone like I was married for 10 years, he never saw me cry. If I ever cried in front of someone, it was like humiliating to me. Just the worst. I experienced all feelings as weakness. And in like 2018, 2019, I had an experience that caused me to like release that tough exterior and become vulnerable. But what would happen before that was that because I actually am very sensitive and like do desire love and do want these things, but could never admit that I would in relationships, I would present as like, I'm the cool girl. We can be non-monogamous. I don't have to have boundaries. You could do whatever you want. I'm not jealous because I thought all of those things were weakness. Yeah. And then I would attract people who would like trigger that. And then I ended up in like a complete codependent internal meltdown where I was like checking Instagram likes and all this crazy stuff because I didn't just admit like, oh, no, I need a I need a monogamous like right now I need I need these things and my feelings are valid. And I do want this and I don't have to be the cool girl. Yeah. And so it manifested as this like dark addiction that I had to like spend a long time working through. And so that's just like one of the examples of like, we'll tie ourselves in a million knots trying to convince other people that we want something that seems cooler or more virtuous or better. And then reality is just punching us in the face until we wake up to that part of ourselves, except that part of ourselves. And then I became someone who's like, I'm sensitive. I have needs. I have emotional needs. I cry sometimes. Now I openly cry all the time, wish it would stop. So I think that it's great that you became human. Yeah. God, help you if your friends are too cool. Yeah, I think that's like a nightmare. Yeah, I think that it's very important to let kids cry. If I had one piece of parenting advice, it's very important to let children cry about whatever it is they are having feelings about. Can you fucking believe that? I didn't even think of that. But that was a whole thing is like, what are you crying about? Three year old. That's not something to cry about. Thing that's existed on a planet with gravity for three years. Like, God, it's so crazy. We are we're all limping, a lot of us. I mean, I'm excited for all these like whatever that I mean, probably part of this thing that you're talking about and this whatever it may be that's on the way like to get to get to that point. It did require parents letting their kids cry. It did require parents allowing children to be something that feels instead of some numb like accident, which I think a lot of us felt like depending on what your parents are like, you know, like a mistake that wasn't supposed to weep. An emotionless mistake made of meat. I think the biggest part. Oh, do you have to go soon? I have. I've got about five minutes, but I don't want to go. I mean, it's been an hour and 40 minutes. I feel like I've been eating too much of your time. But yeah, I have. But we have a little bit more time on. I wish I did not have something scheduled in a few minutes, but this is like. It's been really it's so cool. And it feels weird because, you know, this will go. People will listen to this and some of them will be like, what the fuck are they talking about? And some of them will be like, oh, yeah, they're talking about that thing. But it is weird whenever you get to chat with someone and you get to talk about that thing and you don't have to eat it and freely. Yeah, you know, because it is something I think we do try to. I mean, limit, you know, you just don't want to. I know you just certain people aren't. They don't want to hear about it, Lannis. Yeah, I think part of what happened to me in the lockdown was that I was not forced to do any social interacting with anyone who's not falls to the wall awake because of my podcast. I end up with this huge community of people who are on the same wavelength. And so I got kind of spoiled in that and that I've gotten to live in this world. And have kind of forgotten how to socially interact with. I'm like, oh, people are still living in the regular reality. And I am terrified of the part where we leave our houses again. And I have to learn that because I wasn't good at it even when I was doing it all the time. And I'm always a little bit torn between hate that some people are going to think I'm crazy. And then also I know that this stuff is mainstreaming super fast. I think that science and mysticism are going to merge sometime in the next two years. And so I want to make sure that everyone knew I knew it first. I win. That's so funny. That's such a very. Yeah, I get it, though. Well, I mean, yeah. You know, the Ramdas talks about how his dad used to call him rum dumb when he came back from India, all looking like Jesus, completely distanced him. And how there was that thing in him, you know, to exert like, no, I've there's a guy there. I saw these things. This happened, but then he just was, oh, yeah, the way you communicate this data set is always going to be different from person to person. Right. For some people, the way you communicate this data set is, are you hungry? Do you want some food? How's your day? Really? Wow, I'm sorry that that stock trade happened or that your car isn't working. Or you know what I mean? And that's it. There's no talk of aliens. There's no talk of anything. The only thing that's going on is you're trying to let them be exactly who they are in that moment. And if they want to talk about aliens, fuck, yeah, let's talk about aliens. Yeah. But if they don't, just, you know, give I think anytime I've been around someone who's like, just listening or allowing me to be the way I'm at. Where I'm at, wow, you know what I mean? Like that is like being on a spaceship or something. Doesn't happen that often. I think that that's the secret to peace is allowing everyone to be exactly who they are and not needing. I think we think that unity consciousness is getting everyone to resonate at the exact same frequency. But my understanding is that consciousness, the collective consciousness is like a mirror ball and every single one of those tiny mirror squares is a valid perspective. But if you compare this perspective of the top left square to the bottom right square, one's looking at the floor on that side of the room. One's looking at the ceiling on that side of the room. Those two are never going to be able to understand each other's perspectives, but they could hold space and say, Hey, you're valid, not my cup of tea, but it's interesting to hear your experience. But if you spend your whole trip here fighting with the person who's looking the other direction and trying to get them to see the same thing as you, you kind of miss what resonance is. Resonance, I actually don't know the definition of resonance, but like harmony. It's different things coming together and allowing, allowing everyone to be. And obviously there's toxic things that need to be healed in this reality. And giving people space to express themselves. I've done a lot of work with people just in healing a lot of the toxic shit that's around by sharing my experience, but then also listening to their experience and in a space saying, OK, now how about this? But we are afraid that if other people are having a different experience, that means that our experience isn't real. So it comes from this like insecurity to just be our own autonomous God. Yeah, autonomous God. I love the idea. I learned a lot from chatting with you today. Specifically, trust your own experience. That's what you got. Don't, you know, actually, I was just reading in a recipe book, you should chop your own vegetables. Don't buy the pre-chopped ones because the flavor goes out. You know, and I was thinking, oh, that's the metaphor. Right. Yeah. Chop your own fucking vegetables. Like you don't need somebody telling you what's going on here. You're what's going on here. Yeah. That's what you taught me today. That's cool. Thank you very much for giving me so much time, Jessica. Can you tell people how they can find you?
