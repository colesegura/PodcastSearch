It's me, Duncan, and this is the Dunker Trussell Family, our podcast. It's interviews like the one you're about to listen to that make me feel like the luckiest person on Earth. Sometimes I find myself getting emails from llamas, not the creature, obviously, but the Buddhist teacher, llama. That's what it means. Roughly, I think it translates into guide. Buddhism never stops blowing my mind. I just can't get enough of it. The more I study it, the more I love it. And the weirder it seems. I love its lists and categories. Buddhism has got a list for everything. You've got the Four Noble Truths, the Eightfold Path, the Three Characteristics of Existence, the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, the Five Aggregates, the Five Hindrances, the Ten Perfections. And today, we talk about the Four Immeasurables, or the Four Boundless States. My first contact with Buddhism happened here in North Carolina when I was in college. I did an internship at a Zen temple. And I took a class that was being taught by Tejo Munich, who is a brilliant Zen teacher. At the time, I really wanted lists. I would go to this Zen temple wanting some kind of, I don't know, exposition on Buddhism, some kind of easy method to realization. And Tejo would ask me to clean the floors. And she taught me a method of cleaning floors that I still use to this day, where you take a cloth and you dip it in water and you push it with your hands across the floor of the temple. And she told me that in Japan, this is one of the ways that monks will clean the temples, running across the floor with these cloths. It really works. You essentially turn yourself into a human swiffer. But at some point, I was getting frustrated. And I asked if she could recommend a book. And her response was to ask me, what was the Buddha doing when he gained enlightenment? And I thought about it and said, oh, right, meditating. Damn it. All those lists spring from this practice of meditation, something that is so infuriatingly simple that for the longest time, I couldn't do it. I couldn't sit still for longer than a few minutes. And I can remember once saying to my meditation teacher, David Nickturn, who maybe you saw in the Midnight Gospel, whenever I meditate, it feels like I'm on fire. And he said, you know that's happening in you, right? That's not the meditation causing it. It's not like you're sitting down to meditate and your nerves are suddenly getting inflamed. This is the odd thing about the practice of meditation is that it seems like it should be easy. You're just sitting still after all, not doing anything for 20 minutes. I can spend hours sitting on the couch, watching TV, playing video games, looking at my phone. But the moment you remove all of those distractions from your field of awareness, suddenly you're faced with something that initially isn't that pleasant. And this is suffering. And all those lists spring from the recognition of that suffering and the possibility of ending that suffering, not just for yourself, but potentially everyone in the universe. And not just people. In Tibetan Buddhism, there's a place for all kinds of interesting beings, gods, devas, demigods, demons, hungry ghosts, you name it, they got it. I think this is part of what draws me to this particular type of Buddhism versus some of the more austere forms. I like the colorful stuff. I like hearing, as you're about to hear in this conversation, that they don't quite look at time in the same way we do, in a linear way. There's some possibility of communicating with beings in the past and the future and in basically parallel dimensions. That being said, as cool as all that stuff is, at my age when you got kids and you're married during a pandemic, the real miracle is when you find yourself being less reactive to things that used to drive you up the fucking wall. Because let's face it, if a UFO landed in your backyard and invited you on board to go travel around the universe, at some point, maybe 1,000 years into your celestial voyage, you're going to get bored. You're going to get annoyed. Something's going to happen. Maybe the chef on the UFO is going to cook a bad batch of space cakes or whatever the fuck you eat on a UFO. Something's going to happen. The toilets aren't going to work. Who knows? Maybe you're going to get space sick or something. Or maybe you're going to get in a fight with the captain of the UFO or just get a general sense that you're the least liked human on the UFO. The point is, all the mystical stuff is really cool and interesting and fun to think about. But the reality is an asshole gets on a UFO in Los Angeles. An asshole gets off a UFO in Alpha Centauri. No matter where you go, you still got to bring your mind. All right, I'm done rambling. We're going to jump right into this podcast with Lama Somo. But first this.

Welcome to the DTFH. I'm so happy to be here. I'm happy to be here, Duncan. So I, after the first conversation we had, I went home and I was giving my kids a bath. And I said to the three year old, I talked to a llama today. And he laughed and goes, you llamas can't talk. And I realized, like, I don't know if I'm going to be able to talk to you. And I realized, like, I don't know if I'm going to be able to, at this age, explain to him the type of llama that I chatted with. But then I realized, I don't know if I know much about how a person becomes a llama or even technically what a llama is. So I thought it'd be a great place for us to start our conversations. Maybe you could tell us a little bit about what a llama is and how you became one. Yeah, so I think it's related to a camel. No kidding. So it's slightly different depending on which llama has done the training of the llama. But usually there's a traditional three year retreat with four basic levels that the student studies very deeply and practices very deeply. In the many, many hours of retreat, you know, because retreat means total immersion. So when you're not eating or sleeping, basically, you're in session. And because, yeah, and because I had kids, I had to do it in like three month installments and two month installments. One advantage to divorce and we had an amicable divorce, thank goodness. Is the kids dad could take the kids while I would go off and do retreat and then he liked to travel. So I would take the kids when he wanted to travel. So it worked out well for me, even though I was, you know, at the time a single mom. Wow. Where did you, where were you, where was this retreat? Well, a lot of times I went to Nepal and was at the small monastery he had there. It was actually a nunnery. He's one of the very few llamas who has lots of nuns under his tutelage. What's his name? It's Tuku Sanak Rinpoche. Okay. And I will not ask you to pronounce that. Oh, I'm writing it down. Tuku Sanak Rinpoche. How did you, how did you meet this person? Um, yeah. So the real way I met him was, um, I had meditated for most of my adult life and realized that I needed instruction. You know, if you want to get good at piano, you find a piano teacher, you know, and then you take lessons in practice. Right. And I thought that's what I need to do. By the way, I have piano in my background and so do you actually. Well, I need a teacher. I just like to tinker around on the thing. Yeah. Yeah. Well, so anyway, um, I decided to get very clear about, um, you know, such a teacher. So I actually wrote down, here are the things I want in the teacher and here are the things I don't want. And, um, so, you know, among the things I wanted were, um, needs to be highly realized, uh, needs to be a gifted teacher needs to, um, you know, really understand their tradition and so on and so forth, you know, just various qualities. Um, and on the don't want side, I said, um, you know, things like, you know, shouldn't want me for my body, et cetera, et cetera. Right. That's something you have to worry about. Right. That is a legitimate problem that happens out there. Yeah, it does. And so everything I didn't want on my list wasn't on the list of this llama. Everything I did want, I got, but I forgot to put one thing on the want list. What's that? Must speak English. Right. That's important. He didn't speak English and he still doesn't speak English. So I had to learn Tibetan to be able to communicate directly with him. I have to say this is such an organized and specific thing that you did. I think, you know, many of us, when we hear people talking about their teachers, specifically their meditation teachers, it has this exotic sound to it. Like the idea of, for a lot of us, even reading some of these books is exotic, much less imagining that we would try to make a real world connection with one of these beings and go so far in such a focused way as to figure out what we want and what we don't want in these beings. It seems like you had already had some kind of very powerful epiphany or that you had some, you must have been having some incredible pull towards this lineage to get to the point where you're sitting down and going through a list and really trying to find a teacher. It's interesting you say that. That's a really interesting question, Duncan. And I'll get to the epiphany. But first, I want to say a little bit more about this moment of sitting down and, you know, writing this list and that kind of thing because I did that in preparation for my morning meditations when I would sound the note in the world, you know, with my mind very clear from having done the list. Very clear about what it was I was sounding a note for so that I would, first of all, you know, know what to look for. And second of all, recognize it when it shows up. And third of all, of course, hopefully attract those specific qualities. And I believe it helped. But then I was clueless when I met him. You know, when I first met him, I didn't realize, you know, this was it. By the way, what was not on the list was must be Tibetan Buddhist. I really care what flavor of spirituality. Did you think Buddhist, though, or was it any teacher? Yeah, I mean, it didn't matter. I had studied a little bit of Taoism, but never had a chance to work with a teacher. I had already started studying and practicing Theravada. So, you know, the insight meditation folks, Joseph Goldstein and especially Sharon Salzburg. Yeah. So, you know, I was doing Buddhist practice at the time, but I wasn't attached to that, you know, in particular. When you say sound a note, what do you mean specifically by sounding a note? Yeah, well, that's hard to explain. And so I was using a metaphor. And when you think of the metaphor, it's like, you know, if you literally like sing a note, then these waves go out in all directions, right? And they bounce back as any bat will tell you because that's how they find their way at night. So I was using that as my picture in my mind for what I was doing. I hope that. Oh, it does. I mean, what's fair to me, what's very impressive about this story is that is the confidence you had in doing these sorts of things. I think I have an intuitive, you know, in my sloppy meditation practice from time to time, you get this sense of connectivity with everyone who's meditating at that moment all around the planet, not in some ridiculous like mind blowing way, but just a simple intellectual sort of realization that there's probably a lot of people meditating right now at this moment. And some of them are probably enlightened. If there's a lot of people on the planet, if they're enlightened, theoretically, I could reach out to them and ask for help. But generally, after that, I'll think, I don't know if you should get stoned and meditate, Duncan. You know, I'll shoot it down. My skeptical mind will shoot that kind of stuff down as a sort of wishful thinking or something. And so it's really beautiful to hear that you had not only experienced or intuited that, but that you are actually experimenting with it in a way that brought results. I mean, when you first met this person, you didn't know this would be your teacher? Or were you saying that you weren't sure? Or did you ever sense, oh yeah, this is the llama I was calling? No, I didn't have a clue that he was it. I was partaking of the spiritual smorgasbord that we have here in America. And I was living in Boulder, Colorado at the time, so really a great smorgasbord. And then I went to, I found my way to Tibetan Buddhism a little while before that. And so was trying out those practices and finding I was liking them and they were just clicking with me, which is a sign that you're, you know, this is a good path for a person, you know. And so I decided to try doing retreat. And the American llama who I learned these practices from, I had a little tiny center in the middle of no place outside of Santa Fe, New Mexico. And I was there doing my retreat and just when it was about to end to Cusangak Rinpoche drops in and he's about to do this whole retreat. And empowerment or transmissions on the very practice I was going to be focused on next in the group of practices I was studying. So the fact that I didn't get a clue from just that is, you know, interesting, you know, so you thought I had a clue, but actually not very much. Well, it's almost too much. I mean, that kind of synchronicity is so on the nose. It's outrageous, right? That it that weirdly, it would be easy to miss a thing like that. I mean, it's because I think maybe our dreams train us to ignore synchronicities or ignore because in a dream, things like that happen a lot, you know, and in the dream state, connections like that happen. So when they happen in real life, it's almost like you go into your dream mind and don't it's invisible or ignorable or something. That's curious. It's really interesting. So that's a very interesting theory. And I almost wonder if it could be, I'm just, you know, brainstorming here. I wonder if it could be the reverse. And, you know, we think of this as real life, you know, which actually is just another longer dream. Yeah. In a way. Right. And so we get really focused on the surface things. And we don't have any sense of what's underneath, which is why I think, you know, you're a little taken with the fact that I, you know, had confidence. I wasn't even experimenting. I just had confidence that there was this underneath level. Right. You know, to continue with the waves idea instead of sound waves in the air. Now we can talk about being in this big ocean and I'm a wave and you're a wave and everything and everyone are these manifestations of this ocean that's constantly, you know, in this creative dance and making all of these unique waves. But there is the whole ocean and that's what we're all made of. So it's not even a question of am I connected to this? It's like, what do you think you're made of? You know, so that's how I already conceived of things. And, you know, you asked a question earlier, you know, did I have some kind of epiphany that I had this confidence? Yes. And the answer is yes. Way back when I was in college, I was visiting my boyfriend and we were both the highs at the time. And he was busy doing homework and I done mine already. And so I was just kind of sitting there with nothing much to do. And so I opened up this behind prayer book. And as I was reading the prayer, my mind, you know, finally shut up the usual litany that it goes, you know, the constant radio that's on. Yes. It just was quiet and I, you know, just immersed in what the prayer was pointing to. And all of a sudden I just like, it was like I switched channels. You know, it's like it gave me the channel change or something. I was I switched channels and I could feel that whole ocean experience and I could like see these different colored threads weaving reality. And so I realized, oh, you know, this is how it works. This is, you know, a fuller, truer vision of how reality is than my everyday mind. And, you know, I sat there watching it and I could feel this is real, you know, just know sometimes. And I thought, well, should I wait for science to catch up and figure this out? And I'm like, well, you know, I can't expect somebody else to believe it. But I'm going to believe what I'm experiencing and seeing for myself. So then after, you know, that epiphany sort of quieted down. Oh, and I could see that things weren't really solid, you know, actually experienced that on some level. And so then, you know, after I sort of returned to my more normal vision of things, you know, the normal channel. Yes. And I still carried a little bit of that with me. And I was thinking, okay, so if this is how reality really is, then what could be more important than learning how to live from that place? All right. A tremendous thank you to Athletic Greens for supporting this episode of the DTFH. Friends, this is the number one best way to get healthy. You don't want to be a vitamin person, do you?

So if this is how reality really is, then what could be more important than learning how to live from that place? Right. Right. You know, pursuing that seems like the most important thing. Yes. Bottom line. And so that, I think, was what launched me on a spiritual journey and had me, you know, trying to meditate, although it took a while to get instructed. A very long time, actually. So, you know, then fast forward to when I was like, I don't know, 38 years old or whatever I was, 37, and I was sounding that note or making those waves in the ocean, if you will. Forgive me if this is too personal to ask. But because of, I'm guessing that your marriage, obviously, it wasn't something was not working there. And so probably you weren't very happy. You know, it seems like, was that note that you sounded? How much of it was a cry for help? Actually, I was happy at the time, relatively speaking. We all carry stuff from our childhood and, you know, I certainly had my stuff, including, you know, some pretty serious, ongoing childhood trauma. Right. You know, that kind of thing. And so maybe that, I would think that had something to do with my wanting to, you know, see this deeper level of reality. Right. And more of a driving force. I think we all, you know, have our pain from childhood as a driving force that directs us in one way or another. And the more we can be conscious of it, I think the better chance we have of actually hitting the target and feeling that satisfaction, you know, where the wires connect. Yeah, sure. Well, yeah, I mean, that, to me, I think in all of the wisdom traditions and in some forms of psychology, even anything that alleges, especially for folks who have childhood trauma, anything that alleges there is some possibility that that is not how you have to feel permanently. That in fact, that isn't normal or that isn't how everyone feels or that whatever, whatever it is, that it could actually end. I think a lot of us, when we initially hear things like that, or think, oh, that's delusional. No, that's, this is impossible. This weight I'm carrying has always been with me. Why wouldn't it always be with me? And so there is something also incredibly, I think, exciting when the wires do touch, and you get a little glimpse, even if it's a tiny little glimpse that, oh, actually, that's not the case. You don't have to be completely devastated for the entire rest of your life. Yeah, well, so that brings me to something I've always thought of about the way we describe our emotions in English. We say, I am angry. I am depressed. Right? So it becomes like this idea that, you know, it's not only a permanent state, which is ridiculous because emotions are so fleeting, actually. Yes. You know, we could be devastated about something that just happened and laughing the next, you know, five minutes. Right. Or something and then go back to the devastation and then something else. Yes. And so on. But, you know, the fact that we say I am depressed, that's taking it on as our identity. And so I think then what you're saying, you know, where we believe this is how it always has to be is because we identify with how we are in a moment, whether it's emotions we're feeling or, you know, the collection of memories that makes our personality. And, you know, what we take to ourselves and say, I am this way and that way. And, you know, I'm not this other thing and this other thing, you know, and that changes over time. You know, you've lived long enough to know. Yes. Your identity isn't quite the same as it was five years ago or 10 years ago. No, not at all. Are you kidding? Oh my God. Thank God. No, I went through goth phases. I used to smoke clothes. I thought crows were cool. I still do. But you know what I mean? Like I went through a lot of embarrassing phases where those big raver pants thought about getting weird tattoos. I look back at all the tattoos I've contemplated. I'm so glad I didn't get any of them. So yes, the, the, the, but in yet, knowing all that somehow, I find myself completely fixating on as I am now. I'm a dad. I'm married. I'm a podcaster. The identity is, it's, it's an incredibly convincing thing. It's, it's, it's, and also seemingly, it's quite painful. Does it always have to be painful? I mean, is that, is the, I guess another way. I'm sorry. Let me rephrase the question. Is the price of the ticket, I'm sorry to use marketplace language, but is the price of this ticket that you have to give up who you are? You have to give up your identity. You have to kind of like get to the point that most people when their kids get to Santa Claus, except it's not Santa Claus that isn't real. It's you that aren't real. Is that the price of the ticket? If you want this suffering to end that you sort of have to, in a weird way, I don't know how to put it grow up. So this is a really interesting question about ego. And in Tibetan terms, the way they talk about it, if I translate the term exactly for what you're giving up, it's ego clinging. They don't say ego. They say ego clinging. So I'm going to partly wear my psychologist hat here and say that our personalities have all of these different internal organs, like ego and shadow and, you know, our feminine side or masculine side, all kinds of things. And in order for the personality and the ego to be in service of the full greater self, which includes the whole ocean, self with a capital S, if you will. Yes. Okay. In order for that to happen, we have to stop identifying with the ego and saying that's me. Because, for example, you couldn't have reincarnated as a podcaster if you were identified as somebody who isn't a podcaster. If that was really solid in your mind, and I personally think it's the belief that's so solid, right? So that's what we really need to change is the belief. Right. You know, in the clinging, if we can let go of the clinging to ego, right? Ego clinging. Yes. Loosen our grip and allow the ego to just be an organ that's in service of this greater self. That allows us to step into being a podcaster, or in my case, a writer or a llama. You know, I resisted being called Lama Tomo. I didn't mind the Tomo part, but the llama part, I was like, I'm embarrassed about that. You know, I don't feel like I'm like I've really mastered this stuff enough to be called that. And so I had these debates. Yeah, with Rinpoche about it and he insisted on it. He said, no, no, no, you need to be called Lama Tomo. It's important for them. And I realized, okay, when I go to a doctor, you know, it's good for me to think of them as doctors so and so who's going to treat my whatever, you know, give me a checkup, you know, assign prescriptions to me or something. You know, I want to have confidence that they're qualified. They've been to med school. They've done their residency and all these things. Yes. Likewise, when somebody knows that I have this title, they have this sense that I went through rigorous training, which I did, you know, with lots of study and a ton of practice. And so really distilling my mind and going through, you know, deep transformative kinds of experiences before this name got attached to me. Right. Yes. Yeah, I totally would be freaked out if I went to a doctor and the doctor was like, you can call me Jason. You know, that would bother me if he was like, if the doctor said, yeah, I don't really feel like a doctor today. I'm not sure I've really earned the title doctor. I would definitely not feel comfortable in that moment. So I think there's a usefulness to some of these titles, particularly in the spiritual world, because it seems it seems it's ridiculously easy for anyone to just assign to themselves purely out of some ego state, purely out of some power drive, purely out of just wanting to make money, this a title. I mean, I'm sure you run into that all the time. People who claim to be this or that, you know, I get on Instagram, I get messages all the time from people telling me they just got enlightened. You know, it happens all the time inviting me to follow them to Indian stuff. You know, it's like, yeah, I know. And sometimes I'm like, oh my God, did I just pass up the coolest thing ever because I'm skeptical. But I get it. I think that these, these titles are really important. And maybe it's worth before we have some some llama related questions for you. But before we go further into that, I think maybe it's worth people out there who aren't familiar with this style of this form, this lineage of Buddhism to hear some specifics about that what that training looks like. Yeah, cool. So you have these great questions. So you should be a podcaster. I might try one day. So, let's see, before even kind of getting to the point of three retreat, one needs to have done some shamatha and vipassana. So just, you know, slowing down the mind getting it to be able to settle on something for a little bit. And vipassana, then is being able to see a little bit more of the actual nature of things. So that's kind of the first level of being able to do that. And so there's this interplay between those two. And then there's also the four immeasurables. And what the heck does that mean? So it means four different avenues of feeling your connection with all beings in that, you know, your fellow waves in the ocean. Yes. So the shamatha vipassana help you to be to slow down and get beneath your usual surface vision of things and, you know, see how we're not separate through those four avenues of connection, which are compassion, loving kindness, sympathetic joy and equally feeling those for all beings, which is why they're immeasurable. Right. So those are all ways of feeling how we're connected. Once you already have a bit of that foundation and nobody's expecting, you know, absolute mastery, but as long as you have that foundation, then you're ready to do something called the preliminary practices. And they're preliminary. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. You're, you're saying that before you can start the preliminary practices. Now, loving, you have to have some like experience of loving kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity, and that what just to be clear, I'm like, you know, I'm lucky enough that I as a podcast, I get to chat with people like you, my teacher, David and other people. And sometimes I think, I don't know for sure, but I think you y'all, you all forgive me. Y'all think you just casually saying loving kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy and equanimity. It's like talking to a high diver, an Olympic high diver being like, you know, triple backflips. We do a couple of like, you know, you have to be able to jump from hundreds of yards up in the air. And to people like me, this stuff is like some of it, I don't even, sometimes I don't even believe in, but, but my glimpses of these things are so fleeting, so flickering. How much of this are you supposed to be experiencing? And how do you even know that you're actually experiencing it and not just tricking yourself into thinking you're experiencing it? Again, good question. So, going with your analogy, I would say, you only have to be at the level of diving off of a typical diving board into a swimming pool. Okay. In order to start the preliminary practices, and they call those preliminary, not because they're considered kindergarten level, but because before at the beginning of any practice, you do these first because they're a set of five practices that can be done quite quickly in succession that are a microcosm of the entire Vajrayana path. Oh, okay. Always come before, hence preliminary. Got it. Any practices. So that's what I mean by that. Getting back to the four immeasurables, and it's on my mind lately because I'm about to teach a retreat on the four immeasurables. Yeah. They are these four avenues of feeling our connection with all in a genuine way. And it's based on the fact that we already are connected. Actually, it's just we're so distracted with this surface level of the waves that we, it looks like we're separate. Yet, if we were truly separate, why is it that, you know, when I see you, if you talk about something that's sad, you know, and really like kind of heart-rending, I could have tears in my eyes. Why is that if we're not connected? Right. Why would you care when you read about something in the news or, you know, you see a, you know, sick, stray puppy, you know, by the road? Why is your heart moved if you're actually, you know, truly separate? You know, I think that these days, thanks to the pandemic, if it's taught us anything, it has to be how connected we are, how, whether you like it or not, you are just so connected. But I think maybe some people, if they, I would say, sadly, it's probably more of a common experience for people to have the opposite style of connection, not loving kindness, but hatred, not compassion but selfishness, not sympathetic joy, but jealousy, not equanimity, but a kind of instability or a reactivity or something like that. You know, I think so, but I don't know if when people are feeling these things, they're necessarily saying, wow, this is a, I'm connected to something, but you are. I mean, to me, understanding this stuff, sadly, is easier if I think about the opposite reality, you know, if I think about the opposites. I think how many people understand loving kindness? You know, some people do in a fleeting way, but I think most people understand hatred. How many people understand compassion? I don't know. But I think a lot of people naturally understand selfishness. Anyone who's been around a toddler does. I mean, they just, they don't want to share most of the time or, you know, anyone like sympathetic joy. Wow, that is a sounds like incredibly ethereal and esoteric, you know, but jealousy. Oh, yes, I can understand that. But to me, in this conversation, what's enlightening is the realization that that too is a connection. That too is a mode of recognizing your connection to others. It's just a painful mode. Well, it's also a mode that's coming from longtime habit. You know, we're used to, very used to thinking in terms of being separate. And so all of the jealousy and so on are going to issue from this mistake of, you know, thinking, you know, I'm me, ego clinging. Yes. And so everybody and everything are separate from me. Yes. And once you make that mistake, all the things you just described will issue from that. And so there are strong habits of coming from that mistake and perception. So, you know, without that, we could, you know, easily feel lots and lots of compassion and so on and so forth. But I think we have to build those habits. How can I say this? Learn to loosen our sense of being separate so that it makes way for these natural feelings that come from the natural true state of things to arise. Okay, okay. So to follow the logic here, if this sense of separateness is some kind of fundamental mistake, a very easy mistake to make, but a fundamental mistake that has as a symptom of making this mistake, the instantaneous arising of these unsavory qualities, then. And so, you know, pathways that turn into highways in your brain and in your mind and so on. You know, you mean like, you know, you get baked in like neurologically. Baked in is the wrong, I would say it's like firmware. Cool, cool, cool. Okay, okay, that's it. Well, that's good to know. We don't need to like get a new chip or something like that. It's firmware. Okay, that's beautiful. Okay, but I have to ask this and it's something that I've brushed against in some of the Buddhist texts that I've read. And it's one of those things you brush up against and maybe skip over because it's so incredibly bizarre. But how literally are we to take the idea that we are not separate, that you are me and I am you? How literally is, did the Buddha mean this? And how to understand this when you, there you are on my screen and here I am over here and we clearly are separate. How, so, two parts of the question, how literally is this? I mean, it seems almost schizophrenic or, I don't want to say psychotic, but wildly devastatingly counterintuitive if we've been born into a society based on separateness. And two, I forgot the second part. The first one, I can't forget, how literally am I supposed to take this? I'm me, you're you, you're over there, I'm here, my wife is home, my kids are home, there's people driving by. How literally am I to take this? So from the point of view of one, you know, a wave on the surface, right, if we're from that point of view, and it's, you know, this little tiny point of view, we can't see the whole ocean. And it's easy to then look at the other waves from that level. Yes. And they all look separate. Yes. I mean, literally. Nevertheless, if we think that's the only point of view, that's where we make the mistake. So there's also the whole ocean, and then we would understand that I'm made of ocean, so is that wave I'm seeing at my level, you know, over there with air in between, right. And so I, you know, it looks just like we're separate. So it's only when we can, you know, go to another viewpoint, literally, that we can see, oh, these are waves and the ocean is making these waves and there's this whole ocean. So that's what happened in my epiphany, that's what happens in really any epiphany in one way or another, right, that's kind of what they're getting at. Yes. And that's the whole thing. And that's hard to do with our physical eyes and, you know, we're identified with this body and, you know, really in it and so there are these deep, strong habits from birth and I would say from before birth, many, many births. They're very ingrained habits, but it's still just firmware. And so we can slowly but surely ease up our grip on that point of view and open up to a much bigger point of view and that's what all of the practices are slowly but surely helping us to do. We call it practice because you need to do it every day. Right. And, you know, moment by moment 24-7, wearing these grooves in the selfish direction and the ego clinging direction. So it's going to take, even with very skillful practices, it's going to take some hours. Right. And regular time, it's like, you know, to learn a foreign language and, you know, get those grooves going in your brain. You have to do a lot of hours and you have to do some total immersion or you're not going to get fluent. Total immersion, what does that look like? It's going to Mexico and speaking only Spanish for a while. Oh, wow. But you mean total immersion in the sense of like going to study centers, going to retreat. Oh, I see. That's what retreat is for. And so those 10,000 hours of mastery that they talk about, I have a friend who's a neuroscientist and he said, you can do 10,000 hours of daily meditation and it won't get you to the mastery level. He's measured it in brains, you know. You don't get those changes that are really remarkable unless you've done a bunch of retreat because of the total immersion factor. That's when you really shift those habits and shift out of the old grooves in the brain and really wear those new grooves into highways. Okay. I see. And that makes sense. I have to. This is the last time we chatted, this question came up and it's related to what we're talking about now. Because I do think anyone who's got any kind of desire to not hurt other people or wanting their own peace or whatever it may be, they hear these things. Anyone, most people I think when they hear loving kindness or compassion or sympathetic joy or equanimity, they think to themselves, of course, yeah, I'd love to be like that. But I don't feel like that. I'm pissed off. I don't like the way the world is right now. I'm not satisfied with whatever the thing may be. Something's completely, totally off here. Essentially, I'm in a bad mood. So is it better to just fake these things or and maybe take up a practice in the hopes that at some point a stable shift from wave to ocean will happen? Or is that inauthentic? Does that make you a kind of spiritual phony going around pretending to be full of loving kindness or compassion or sympathetic joy and equanimity? When you really just feel rotten and generally disconnected? I don't think anybody's asking for people to go around being fake. I can speak from my own experience that I was a lot less happy ongoing before I did all these practices, you know, before I spent all this time with these practices than I do now. And my response to challenges from the outside, whether it's something a relative says, you know, that drives me. Yeah. I mean, how do I handle that now compared to how it was before? And my teacher took us on our grimpege talked about this because I said, you know, my mind is still distractible and I've been doing these preliminary practices. You know, I'm almost finished with them and, you know, I've done some other practices and, you know, my mind is still wanders a lot. And he said, well, I don't feel like I've mastered them. And he said, well, in everyday life, do you notice that you're more motivated by compassion and less clinging to your ego? And I, you know, stopped and, you know, kind of looked back, you know, how was I five years ago? How am I now? You know, like you just did a little minute ago. And I thought, oh my gosh, yeah, I'm definitely, you know, I can think of specific challenges that I'm coming to very differently because of these practices over time. Right. So I had to stop and, you know, reflect on that. And now, and it's been 20 years later, a huge difference, huge difference in my ongoing life experience of myself, of others, of life, because of having done all these practices. And the more you progress in them, which I still didn't finish about, the stronger the medicine, because one level does prepare you for the next sort of like, you know, learning addition, subtraction, division, and then you go to algebra and then you go to spherical trigonometry. Gotcha. It builds. Yeah. And so I, you know, have done these amazing practices and had amazing experiences and that epiphany I used to have, I wanted to find the channel changer so I could at will change channels. Absolutely. Yeah. And I got to say, if you do these practices, you know, and really bring yourself fullheartedly to them and take them in, you can do that. Oh, and I want to get back to something else you said about, you know, whenever you're meditating that there's probably somebody else who's really enlightened meditating at that moment. Yes. So Tibetans take advantage of that very principle. And they also don't believe that time is linear. So, I mean, there are enlightened beings, both incarnate and discarnate, who, whose minds we can tune into if we decide, you know, whatever we zero in on, just like I did in sounding the note in the first place, right, whatever you clearly zero in on, you're making connection with. Wait, just let me clarify. You're saying that it's not just that there is some possibility of connecting to the people enlightened, the enlightened beings who happen to be meditating at that very same moment as you. But in fact, according to the Tibetans, you can connect with people who have yet to be born, people in the past, and I don't know, people in like parallel universes or in other realms. Here's how. I mean, this is the way that makes the most sense to me. You know, if you realize that, you know, the depths of the ocean, what we're talking about there, that makes the waves, that's the source, if you will, source like with a capital S. Yes. And it's aware. And at that level, it's just one thing before it, you know, divides into the many. It's just one source that's the taproot of all of us and everything. Yes. So that awareness is enlightened. And any master, past, present, or future, anybody who is able to fully open their sense of self to include all and everything, including that one big awareness. That's enlightenment. That's my definition. That's, you know, the definition, you know, in Judaism, in Buddhism, you know, I imagine in all the great spiritual traditions. So here we are then tuning into, you know, as we sit down to meditate, we can really, how can I say this, amp up our meditation or whatever, by tuning into that. One awareness, which is hard to do. And so we try to, you know, think of somebody who we know has achieved that level of awareness. So they've come home, if you will, and that's where they're coming from. So we tune into them. We, it's hard for us to imagine an archetype as human beings. That's just tough. So that's why we use archetypal images like the Great Mother, you know, and so Catholics imagine, you know, the Madonna, Tibetans imagine Green Tara, Chinese imagine Quan Yin. Really, those are images for this one archetype that's the Great Mother. So if, you know, if you're Christian and you're, you know, trying to pray really well or meditate, you tune into Jesus because that's your image of enlightened mind. Right. Christ consciousness. Of that awareness. Christ consciousness, exactly. And that's this, you know, they're pointing at the same thing, I believe. Wow. So when you begin to meditate to focus in on that consciously and say, okay, you know, I'm, you know, calling on you, I'm tuning into you. And, you know, I know that you're representing for me enlightened mind. That's really what I'm tuning into is enlightened mind. So Guru Yoga is the practice of projecting your own enlightened mind out there on somebody you associate with enlightened mind. Tuning into their enlightened mind. Right. And then you take that projection back in, in every Tibetan Buddhist meditation, you're doing that projecting and then, you know, bring it back in because we can't recognize it in ourselves. Why? Right. So we, well, because of those habits, you know, we don't see ourselves that way. So we don't see that aspect. But if we project it out, you know, like, so now we're singling it out and we're glomming it on to somebody we do associate with enlightened mind. Ah, you know, then we recognize it. And then we take it back in and we sit there in that state of unity at the end of the meditation practice, whatever practice it is. Wow. That's amazing. Yeah, that I, it's so interesting, the doubting mind, how powerful that can be. It's how, you know, I think people who are beginning a practice, I always say people when I my experience in this regard has been I'll catch these just what you're talking about. And usually, well, in the beginning, when I when that started happening, I would be so startled by it that I would disconnect immediately because it would just be like this can't be this isn't real. What was that? And then the rest of the meditation might be an attempt to recreate that moment by will or something like that, which doesn't has never worked for me. I don't know if you've ever flown in a dream before, but my experience with flying in dreams is weirdly the more you try to fly, the more you go down. And the less you try to fly, the more you go up. And it's something like that in meditating. And the more that I attempt to do these spectacular things that you're talking about, the less it happens. But the moment I'm not trying anymore, it's almost an instantaneous connection. So it's very paradoxical in that it does seem to go against as the everything you're taught as a wave is a wave you're taught exertion. Is it you're taught this kind of, you know, brute force methodology or whereas this thing, it seems like it's almost, is it the is it the opposite? Is it the literal opposite of, I guess, I'm sorry, I'm just sort of connecting the dots. Can we just start doing the opposite of what the wave wants to do. And then in that is that its own practice in that can we achieve connection with Buddha mind Christ consciousness green tar or any of the other symbols that represent this sort of consciousness we're talking about. Well, now I have to talk about the two truths of Buddhism. So one truth is relative truth, which is the truth from the point of view of the wave. Right. And so all the principles that normally apply, like, we can't fly, for example, absolutely, all these other things, they apply. But then there's absolute truth. And so that's more the point of view of the depths of the ocean and, you know, one great awareness. So as incarnate beings who are not fully enlightened, we can't let go of either of those truths, the relative truth, you know, where I'm over here relative to you. For example, my point of view looks like this and your point of view looks like that. Yes, that's relative truth, as opposed to absolute truth, where it's, you know, just one thing. So if we let go of absolute truth, then we're stuck in relative truth and you've described beautifully how, you know, that kind of feels like shit on go. But if we because it's not true. And so we're going to act from this untruth and act like jerks. Right. But from absolute truth, there's no such thing as, you know, karma doesn't mean anything anymore, etc, etc. And, you know, there's no such thing as gravity and so on and so forth. But we can't fake that we're still, you know, pretty locked into this point of view. So we have to live by both truths and not go jumping out of windows, you know, because of gravity. And, you know, so on and so forth. So we have to somehow hold relative truth and absolute truth, which seem like opposites. But they aren't exactly we need to sort of step back and have this what physics called calls a superposition from which we can hold all of it. Okay. Okay, right. I know what you mean by superposition. And I have entertained the idea that that's what Buddha figured out is just a methodology for human consciousness to go into a superposition or something like that. Absolutely. Whoa, that's really interesting. But before we get into the that the superposition stuff, which I love, by the way, I'm not trying to be a bummer or a buzzkill here. But it's not often you get a chance to chat with a llama, who is also someone trained in Western psychology. And so to get back to the relative reality, the wave, the neurosis, the shadow, the all of that stuff. Now that you've experienced like intense training in Vajrayana have become a llama, and you've also experienced intense training in Western psychology. Do you think that we can just disregard the therapeutic approach that this this other approach is somehow more valid or I ask this only because you know, Ram Dass, his teaching to me, he told me to get therapy, and I didn't listen to him for the longest time. Because it was such a disappointing thing to hear from a great spiritual teacher like that, you know, you want to monitor or something, not don't tell me to go please, it's not therapy. But now that I've been in therapy finally listening to him and working with my own stuff. I have really experienced a quantifiable positive change in my own life and the way I interact with other people that wasn't necessarily happening from my meditation and from my spiritual practice. Now, that being said, my spiritual practice has never been anything more than wobbly or anything like that. But I find myself wondering sometimes if sometimes we put the cart before the horse, so to speak, and go down these spiritual paths without dealing with like the, I don't know, the upper crest of the wave. You know, the, the, the constricted mind stuff that seems to be amazingly articulated and identified in Western psychology, whereas in, in, you know, some of the mystery or Easter, or I'm sorry, wisdom traditions, it feels like they do identify the same things, but in a more in such a simple way or something, whereas, you know, look at the DSMR or whatever for, I don't know how many there are now, look at all the, there's so many forms of neurosis. And so, you know, is it pot, which is, I'm not asking you to tell me one's better than the other or anything like that, but it's part of our own personal training. For some people, does it make sense that even before starting a practice, we should just go to a therapist? Yeah, so that's a really important question that, of course, because I've had training in both, I've really, and I've experienced both, you know, I've been a beneficiary of both, I've really thought about. And I had dinner with Ram Dass once, and when, while I was busy cooking, he was saying, you know, in all of my experiences in psychology and, you know, deep spiritual practice and study, I have not actually completely erased one single neurosis. Wow. The relationship with these neuroses is completely different. And so my experience is completely different. Right. He said, it used to be that these neuroses were like these big monsters that would be, you know, somewhere looming behind and then they would just pounce on me and I would be taken over by them. Yes. And I would act and feel from those. And he said, what's happened now after all I've been through, and he included psychology as well as the spiritual practices. He said, now, you know, this familiar neurosis will sort of walk by and, you know, I'll go, oh, hey, how are you doing? It's like this little shmoo, he said, you know, hey, what are you doing? What's going on? You know, oh, bye, you know, that's it. They just make an appearance on the screen. So his relationship with them is completely different. And therefore his experience and how he behaves are completely different. Here's a metaphor that I've come up with, you know, so. Right. There's Ram Dass and then there's me. So mine is that. Right now you seem like the same person. I'm sorry. I'm not trying to put that on you or anything like that. But I mean that. And the pot, I mean, you remind me of him right now. Oh, well, gosh, I'm really honored because I, you know, think so much of him. Anyway, so my experience of it is that it's like we're stuck in a dark attic and we're and it's all piled up with furniture everywhere and stuff. We're constantly crashing into the furniture as we walk around. And so, you know, cracking our knee on this, you know, table or chair and, you know, then we're cracking our elbow on a lamp or whatever. And we can't see in the dark. So Western psychology gives you a headlamp. And so now you have this focus beam and you, you know, can focus it here and there on pieces of your unconscious and pieces of your mind. And you can say, Oh, there's a lamp. I'm going to, you know, kind of work my way around it. And actually, I can not only work my way around it. I can begin to arrange the furniture so it's not just all piled up and right here in there everywhere randomly. And now I can arrange all this furniture nicely. But once we've arranged the furniture enough, and you know, we aren't crashing into it so much. My experience of spiritual, you know, training is it shows you the doorway out. So you weren't stuck in the attic at all. You can actually, yeah, step out. Thank you, Shutter for supporting this episode of the DTFH. Not only is Shutter my go to horror streaming service. I happen to be very good friends with Rob Schraub, who has directed two incredible episodes on their incredible series creep show. I'm a horror movie nerd. I love creep show. When I was a kid, I wasn't allowed to go see it. But my mom bought me the comic book, which actually was a million times creepier than the movie. Regardless, I have a sentimental connection with it. And so when I saw the creep show series coming out, I felt a great deal of nervousness hoping they hadn't destroyed this classic title and they didn't. They stayed true to form. It's a wonderful series. If you're looking for something super creepy that isn't blaspheming the thing it's based on creep show series on Shutter with executive producer Greg Nicotero of The Walking Dead. If you're a fan of old classics or looking for the next classic, they've got it. They've got The Wicker Man, Blood on Satan's Claw and the all new movie, The Last Thing Mary Saw. And Shutter has just released an exclusive documentary called Woodlands, Dark and Days Bewitched. It's the ultimate history of the folk horror genre, which I didn't even know existed until I started watching movies on Shutter. Curated by an actual horror movie fan. I don't know who's putting the stuff together, but I'm sure you've been frustrated when you can't find an actual horror movie. This is the stuff that they write about in Fangoria, another magazine that I used to love when I was a kid. Old school, classic, super spooky, super weird horror movies. They've got the whole collection of bizarre horror movies, including something that you truly must watch. If you haven't seen it, the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which I've seen at least 12 times. If you're a fan of supernatural thriller and all things horror, you're going to love Shutter as much as I do. And right now you can stream your first 30 days of Shutter free. Go to Shutter.com, use code Duncan. That's S-H-U-D-D-E-R dot com code Duncan to stream your first 30 days of Shutter for free. Shutter.com code Duncan. One day I will make a movie for Shutter. I know I will. All right. Wow. Wow. Yes. Yeah, that okay. I love that. Yeah. I love that. Yeah. And I think it's what you just described does kind of present a step. It's not like, you know, I think the question was a little dumb because it's like, obviously you can go to therapy and meditate. It's not, one doesn't preclude the other necessarily. It's just... Yeah, but you're really asking what are their relationship to each other? How can we use these different tools the most skillfully and to the most benefit? So, you know, I think it's an important question. I took it, you know, that that's what you really were getting at. Thank you. To go back a few steps, you know, in your casual, the way you casually told us that we can, through the meditative state, enter into a kind of superposition where we can either merge or make contact with enlightened beings existing in all periods of space and time. I wouldn't be surprised if a few people listening who might not be so familiar with Buddhism were like, what? How come they don't lead with that in Buddhism? Like, in Buddhism, it can seem so austere or simple. There isn't this initial like, just so you know, you're living in this very, very vast, potentially immeasurable, very alive place where you're in just one realm. So to me, it makes me think, is that a secret that you just said, like a kind of secret? It's not a secret, obviously, because you said it. But I mean, are there secrets in Buddhism? In the sense that there is a progression, there are levels that you're like, you're saying, you know, you start with arithmetic, then you're going to get into algebra, then at some point, God forbid, you have to study statistics or something. Calculus, you know, but so it's not like calculus is a secret, but there's no way you're going to be able to do calculus if you don't know how to add. In Buddhism, specifically Vajrayana Buddhism, would you say that there are secrets or levels of this system that aren't really put out in front, because they would be incredibly confusing, potentially, I don't know how to put it, damaging or potentially, yeah, damaging to folks who are initially hurt them. Actually, there are. The very word in Tibetan for Tantra is secret mantra. I mean, if you translate it literally song knock, which you notice was Rinpoche's part of Rinpoche's name to who sang Rinpoche. So yes. Can you tell us the secrets? Of course not. So here's why a couple of reasons. One is that would be a, you know, a spoiler, right? And, you know, you don't want to divulge the spoiler, because if the student has prepared their mind with these different levels, and then they get to the point of the next initiation into the next level. But they already heard the words before and they made something up around it because they didn't have all the experience they needed. That is going to be misleading. And also, you know, sort of spoils the moment when it would be imparted. So there's two reasons not to do it. First of all, it'll be misleading and you'll then think you understand and that's in the way of your just receiving the actual transmission. So it's also, you know, then going to be, you're going to be off track. You're going to have something in the way to undo before you can do, you know. Right. So, yeah, those are reasons why you don't want to spoil that and talk about that stuff before somebody's, you know, readied themselves to where, you know, you say that and they just go clunk. Ah, I get it. Gotcha. But you know, it's like chiropractic adjustments or something like you're not ready to have that kind of adjustment until you're loosened up here and then that thing. Right. So it's, um, well, that seems to Well, here's more of that analogy that right there is that you're instead your back will resist and it'll the muscles actually tighten up in response to the cracking. Right. Um, and, you know, that's kind of what's happening is your mind will grasp onto the, the concepts in the words rather than the, you know, the deep realization that's being conveyed as the master, you know, says the words. Cool. Yeah, that's not the important thing. But okay, so can you help people understand why they're like when you're looking at Tibetan Buddhism and folks who are hearing this now who maybe aren't familiar with it, but are more familiar with Zen, you know, or, or, um, you know, Tich Nad Han just passed and which is a very sad thing. And a lot of people have been transformed by his writings and teachings. Uh, but are they, are there secrets in Zen? Are there secrets in Tara Vada? Are there secrets in the other lineages of Buddhism? And again, I think people understand when I'm saying secret, I don't mean like secret secret. I think you just described it perfectly. But does this sort of systematic holding back of something? Yes. And then the systematic revelation of that to the student. Does this exist in all forms of Buddhism or is it specific to Vajrayana? Well, I didn't get far enough in Tara Vada to say from my own experience and I didn't study it so much. Um, I did, uh, get, I guess far enough in Zen and I have dear friends who are Zen practitioners that I get the sense that there's some of that that's held back until it's time for that student. You know, they're, they are prepared and ready and, you know, we'll receive it in a particular way. Um, but I can't say for sure. So my deep experience is with Tibetan Buddhism and I know that, you know, for sure that that's the case. Maybe the equivalent in Zen is the koan or something like that. Or the, Maybe, you know, I, yeah, I do have some sense of koan practice and, you know, that is a sense that I have. But again, I just don't know enough about Zen because I didn't get to those levels there with Zen. This is just, and I forgive me. I, I'm sorry if that's just a weird question or anything like that. But to me, that is why I love this form of Buddhism is because it is so spectacularly strange and so it's so spectacularly cosmic. And, um, and most importantly, my own working with it. I have in some way, shape, or form experienced in a mild way, some remission of the. Those traits that I have that go completely against. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So getting a little less cosmic, strangely enough, I want to go back to the immeasurables, the four immeasurables, which sound cosmic and, you know, they're based in a cosmic view, but can be quite. You know, they are foundational because they're accessible to all of us. Yes. Again, you know, we've all felt compassion. We've all felt loving kindness. And what I mean by sympathetic joy, we've also all felt so, you know, when your wife just had something wonderful happen and she tells you about it and she's all excited. You get all excited. Yes. You can help the smile. Right. That's sympathetic joy. Yeah. Okay. I got it. Sure. Okay. So we have our underlying connection and we can take that, you know, wherever we are with that, you know, that basic capacity that we already have and expand that capacity and we can make it immeasurable eventually. So, and we do the practice in an immeasurable way to try and sort of lead our minds out of their usual limited view. And we can use any of these four immeasurables. These are four avenues of feeling that connectedness. And it feels wonderful. And so the good news is, you know, you're already happy just practicing it. Also, I find helps me when I'm in pain, for example, to do the compassion one while, you know, using my own pain as the theme, I start with compassion for myself that you'd start with yourself with all of them. Because, first of all, I think we Westerners especially need that. Right. Very good at compassion for ourselves or loving kindness for ourselves and so on, even sympathetic joy. And so that's not equanimity. So I just named all four. So we start with ourselves and practice that for a while and get established in that because that's going to be the foundation from which we can step it out. When you say practice it, what do you, what do you mean? Like how specifically do I practice any of these? Yeah, so with compassion, for example, I mean, it's the practice of Don Lynn sending and receiving. And I mean, I could teach it right now, but please do you have time? Well, we can try just to describe it very simply. And, you know, again, I'll be teaching this in not this coming weekend, but the next weekend. Is this an online course or in person? Yeah, via Zoom. Oh, cool. Oh, great. Yeah. Yeah. So anybody can take it. It's a weekend retreat. That's so wonderful. Where can people, where can people do that just since we're talking about it? Yeah. So it's at nomchok.org. So N is in Nancy. A, M is in Mary. C, H, A, K, nomchok.org. Okay. Great. I'll be at DuncanTrussell.com if you can't remember that, nonchok.org. Maybe a little easier. Okay. Okay. Okay. I mean, I'm sorry if my, if I'm asking for something that takes longer than the amount of time we have here to describe Tong Lynn, maybe before that, can I just say, what's the difference between having compassion for yourself and feeling sorry for yourself? And is there one? Well, we'll get to that because there's this whole understanding of the near enemies and enemies of each of those four. So let me just start by, I mean, yeah, describing a little bit how we work with compassion. So let's say I'm just going to, you know, pick, I don't know, feeling misunderstood. Let's say, you know, today I had an interaction with somebody where obviously they were projecting on me and not really seeing me. And it was really painful. So I'm, I'm sitting there, you know, trying to do my meditation and rather than ignoring that painful experience, I can actually use it and I can start with compassion for myself, for the painful experience, you know, I'm feeling pain. So the, what compassion is, is feeling with compassion, somebody who's suffering and you naturally want to take away that suffering and replace it with happiness. Sure. So that's what we do in this practice. And we use visualization because, you know, we always have mental conversations with people, right? We do that all the time. Absolutely. So we take that human habit and tendency and replace it, you know, or how can I say this, do this practice that's going to be a little more productive and beneficial and you're going to feel a lot better. Right. So you're going to start with yourself and then step it out. And when, you know, in all the stepping out parts of, you know, sort of the concentric circles that go out, it's easier to describe those. So let's say you imagine now somebody else who's been misunderstood and we can all think of just about anybody. Sure. This experience being misunderstood. We don't want them to suffer. We start with, you know, people we care about who we naturally are going to feel compassion is easy for us. Yes. We've primed the pump and we're going to step it out slowly to people we easily feel that for and love and so on. And then we'll step it out to people we don't really think much about. We're kind of indifferent toward. Okay. And now we're kind of on this tide of, you know, feeling compassion. So it's easier to feel compassion. Well, they don't want to suffer either. Right. And we don't want them to suffer being misunderstood and we can start to think of whole categories of people who have obviously been misunderstood because of the color of their skin, for example, or their gender or all kinds of reasons. And so, you know, we step it out to them. What does compassion feel like? You know what it feels like. But is it, is it, these are four immeasurables, not four undescribables how sometimes when I'm wondering, you know, I'm so neurotic. And so sometimes when I'm experiencing anything remotely good, seemingly good or like compassion, whatever, I'll get stuck in my head thinking, is that even compassion? How do you know that's compassion? So I'm just curious if there is a definition of the feeling or a visual way to, you know, what you could say, you know, in in Tonglen, what I do understand is the description of poison, thick, sludgy, smoky, dark, hot. Yeah. Okay. But compassion, if you had to describe it, what does it feel like? So I think maybe already the problem is you might be in your head too much because it's an experience and a feeling direct. And the thinking about almost separates you from the natural feeling. So if you just stop and think about the students of Thich Nhat Hanh right now, the close in students who have, you know, so deeply connected with him and relied on him for inspiration and so on. And imagine how they feel right now. How do you feel? I know, I know, that's how we felt. No words, no words. Just stop and feel that. Of course. Yeah. So you're feeling along with them. And the natural response is, wow, I wish I could take that pain away from them and replace it with happiness. And so we get to do that in the practice of Tonglen by breathing in that, you know, thick, dark, you know, all the things you've described of their suffering. We breathe that in to the doorway of our hearts and our hearts are connected to that whole great ocean of being. That's where we feel the compassion, right? Yes. So that's where we know our ocean-ness. And so we're connected to the ocean through our hearts. So through that open doorway of our hearts, we breathe in the compassion. It goes into the whole ocean. We don't keep it. We don't have it stick to us. It just goes through us to the ocean and from the ocean is vast. You know, how can I say? You know, never ending joy. There's no, you know, it's bottomless, right? Wow. And so we breathe that out in the form of these spacious, billowing, bright clouds. And we see those soaking into those students, for example. Wow. And, you know, then, you know, they're soaking that in and their pained faces in our minds turn to smiles and they're kind of glowing. So that's the practice of Dong Lin. And we step that out and out and out until it's all in everyone we're breathing for. Why is it so sad? Why is it so sad? What is this? You know, is it always, is compassion always, does it always have this quality of sadness to it? Does it always have this very sweet yet sad sort of aspect to it? Well, it has that aspect. But in Dong Lin, we don't leave it there because after, you know, breathing in and through us, the sadness, we then are a conduit of joy, vast, complete, you know, utter joy. And we breathe that into them so that there's this satisfying conclusion, if you will. You know, we make up these dramas in our minds all the time. And now we're making, we're living out a very specific drama that's actually much more wholesome and bringing us, you know, toward an enlightened mind and enlightened state of mind rather than our usual, you know, mind movies that are taking us away from it. So that's the brilliance of Vajrayana practices is they're based on our human tendencies and habits and just shifting them a little bit. So now with that turn of the kaleidoscope, we're now bringing ourselves closer to the true way of seeing things and experiencing rather than farther away. Yeah. So I think there's so many interesting things about that experience of compassion. One of them being, it doesn't, though I, I does, for me, at least it shows up exactly in my heart. And for, but when it does show up and when I have this, I think the stability to experience it for longer periods of time, it doesn't seem like it's me. That's the odd thing about it. It doesn't seem like it's in me or in anything. Or it's got this very, I'm not saying it's not real, but it has this quality of like, where are you wonder? Where are you? Where is this? You're unfamiliar with that aspect of yourself, I would say. And your definition of self has been, you know, tip of the wave. Yeah. Rather than your whole self. And so this is introducing and eventually, you know, having you get used to this other aspect and getting stronger and stronger and almost living then more and more, well, yeah, living more and more from that aspect. So the word in Tibetan, Gom, is the word, you know, that they use for practice. Yes. And it literally means getting used to. Wow. He meanings of it. Yeah. Wow. That's so wild. I thought it meant self-knowing. I didn't know it was getting used to. It's like, this is the practice of getting used to your heart, getting used to this ocean, getting used to that. Because it's not like it's easy to get used to that if you've been living up in the crest of the wave all the time. It's not like it's some, it's weirdly undesirable from the crest of the wave's perspective. So unfamiliar. You know, it's like, what is this? Just like you said, you know, it's, we haven't been there before, but more and more than we live from that. And then it's like, oh, yeah, here we are again. And it feels more and more like home. So I want to come back to something you quickly talked about when I first mentioned the four measureables, you were like, well, how do we know we're not fooling ourselves? And you can fool yourself because, for example, with compassion, you can go into the near enemy, they call it, which is pity. And that is not the same thing. So remember, I said the point of the practices is to feel your connection, deep heartfelt connection with everybody. Yeah, he does not do that. In fact, it does more separation. Wow. So yeah, good to check yourself and make sure, oh, I hope I'm not pitying somebody. And we can feel it on the receiving end. We can feel when somebody is genuinely compassionate and when we're in pain or when they're doing pity. And then it's like, you know, the worst. Yeah. So, you know, just to name. So for example, with loving kindness, the near enemy would be sentimentality. Oh, yes. Yes. Wow. That's so cool. Yeah. And another one I noticed with a boyfriend once was clinginess. You know, he said, I love you so much. And it was actually just, he was using me as his teddy bear. Yeah. It didn't feel like actual love. Yeah. And so jealousy came out of that and clinginess, you know, all that stuff. So that was a near enemy and he couldn't distinguish the difference that I sure could on the receiving end. Yeah, you know it. You know, absolutely. So for sympathetic joy, it can be hypocrisy where somebody feels like they should, you know, sharing your joy, but actually the far enemy is jealousy and you actually even mentioned it. Yes. You know, if somebody has something wonderful happen and we feel jealous, that's because we're coming from ego to clinging. Right. And if we're coming from the more full heartfelt self with a big S, then we naturally feel happy with them. But if we aren't feeling much of that, then we might just sort of fake it and say, oh, yeah, that's wonderful. You know, Wait, that's what you're saying? That's hypocrisy? What is that? Yeah, if we're, we're faking it. It's fine. Yeah, yeah, sure. Yeah. Yeah, hypocrisy. So those are, you know, some of, and then obviously with equanimity, the far enemy, the opposite is preference. You know, Oh, right. Yeah. But here's the near enemy that people get fooled by quite a bit. We can feel like, oh, yes, I'm equally feeling, you know, love for all beings when actually it's indifference. We actually, Yeah, right. Oh my God. Anything. We're equally. Numb. Yeah. Indifference. Numb. You're just numbed down. Completely numb. Dangerous. That's what, it's got to be one of the most dangerous of all the near enemies is indifference. That's the spawn of every rotten thing that happens on the planet is like the other stuff. But indifference is dangerous. That's, It really is. Well, and I knew a guy who was a, you know, very advanced Zen practitioner and he had fallen into that. And as a result, he did some stuff that was really not cool. And it was because he mistook indifference for equanimity. Wow. Wow. That's so, I love that. I love that it's detailing these modes of tricking yourself into thinking you're any of these things are happening. But what do you? Okay. So let's say I identify that I am indifferent. Let's say that I, or I identify, oh, no, I am jealous or identify that like, no, I'm legitimately feeling sorry for this person. It's not like I'm, you know, asking to feel sorry, pity for someone or asking to feel indifferent or trying to be that way. But let's say you identify that this is happening. What is, is there some antidote? Should you realize that you have been living in a, in a completely indifferent way for a long time? Well, the first thing is recognizing the problem, right? That's huge because they're near enemies and it's, you can be fooled. You know, you can honestly think I'm practicing compassion when actually it's pity. So having that realization is the first big step. Then, you know, I find these practices, because you start, you know, from a genuine place, you know, where it's easier to feel that and you prime the pump, then you have more hope of stepping out those genuine feelings of compassion. And you just, you know, keep watching yourself and seeing, oh, you know what? I need to apply these myself to these practices better and aim better and, you know, really open my heart and be coming from my heart. And, you know, if you're practicing with theme for the day, that's something you yourself are feeling pain about, and you start from there, you know, and a genuine feel of feeling of compassion for yourself. That's why I think it's going to more surely step out, you know, from yourself to those who might meet my people to my, you know, neighbors, you know, to categories of people, et cetera, et cetera, and it can move out in a genuine way. Ultimately, if we're all the ocean, is there really even any difference in these categories or are these categories an afterthought? Well, they're a practice, you know, so they're used as four different entry points, getting at the same thing. We're trying to get at this feeling, the whole ocean and the fellow waveness connection to all of our waves on the ocean. So that's why it's a Buddhist practice. It really across all of Buddhism is so that Brahma Vihara is what they call immeasurable in Theravada. You know, it's across all of Buddhism because it's just a great, you know, collection of four sort of entry points at this avenues for practice. And by the way, you know, if you find yourself slipping into pity or hypocrisy or sentimentality or whatever, you know, if you beat yourself up, that's not practicing compassion or any of the goals, because your ascension being too. You just start over. I mean, just like you do when your mind is distracted in meditation, when you're doing shamatha, and you go, I caught myself. Hey, you know, that's something to celebrate. I was aware enough to catch myself. Now I just bring myself back. And you just keep bringing yourself back. And that's what the practice is for. These four immeasurables. Where do they come from? The Buddha is the original source. Well, but he was reporting in or sort of articulating this, this, I don't know, these forms or these entry points. Where do the entry points come from? Yeah, so I would say it's that, you know, great awareness, you know, that is the whole self with the capital S, you know, it is the whole ocean. You know, that kind of thing. So the in Tibet and it's Gongba, which is enlightened intent and enlightened mind, you know, and from that can issue all of these different, you know, just, you know, thousands and thousands of practices that have happened over the millennia and insights and, you know, sutras and tantras and, you know, all of those things. They're issuing from that. And when you say issuing and maybe I'm sorry, I love chatting with you. Do you have a second longer? I know I've kept you now. Okay. Yeah. When you say issuing, it feels like you mean this isn't, it's not like this is something dead or like, in other words, like, if you're reading this, the scriptures, you know, you're reading something on paper, but you almost, you don't need to read those. In the sense that you could just as easily tune in to a sort of eternal reverberation that when it makes contact with the human mind, it looks like these scriptures. Yeah, that's a great description. Yeah, yeah. And it's going to look different in different ages coming through different conduits. Wow. You know, different masters. Yeah. Or profits or whatever we're going to call them over the ages. Thank you so much for giving me so much of your time and for teaching me today about the four measurables. I really appreciate it. It's been quite enlightening and thank you. Can you please remind us about not just the upcoming retreat that you have, but other ways that people can connect with you? Well, yeah. Actually, I'm just thinking, so we're about to print up a book on the four measurables that I wrote. And it's called Deepening. How did I finally decide on the title? Deepening fashion. Gosh, I'm blanking on it right now. I can't remember the names of books either. It's something very liberating knowing that you can't remember the name of a book you're writing because I just remember the authors. I never remember the names. Well, so what I did was I just, I always say book one, two, three, because it's a series. So it's book three in the series and the series is Ancient Wisdom for Modern Times. So this is book three and it is on the four measurables and it's also including a section on forgiveness because how can we really have immeasurable equanimity and compassion and so on for everybody except so-and-so who did me wrong, right? So we, you know, we want to take a look at that and so I do because we've all got that stuff. And by the way, it gets in the way of good shamata as well. Anyway, so that's one thing people can do is to buy the or right now it's pre-purchase the book, which will come out this fall. Okay. And then there's also, if you don't want to wait, there's this retreat and I will read excerpts of that book in the retreat, but also teach the practices and we'll do a bit of each of the four measurables over the course of the weekend. And there are e-courses. We have online courses that are free. So again, nonchalk.org, you can, you know, just noodle around on the site and find your way to the practice section and the, you know, learning and so on. And, you know, just start up if you haven't started a meditation practice before. You can do that. We also have online classes that are, you know, very, very affordable and are based on the book and the e-courses. And it's fun to learn together. So, and you, you tend to show up for a class, right? So it's just a good discipline. So do you think online retreats count as immersive retreats? It's not as good as, you know, full on in-person retreats, I think, because there's also the spirit of togetherness and so on. And it does feel more like you're fully immersed. And, you know, we can tend to kind of sneak off and make tea and stuff like that, you know. Yeah. Or, you know, sneak in emails and I don't know this kind of thing. I did, you know, real strict retreat where I wasn't looking at my emails. Right. You know, I wasn't just calling right and left and all this kind of thing. I just stopped all that, made a full container, you know, because then it was very rich what happened inside the container. So the more you do that for yourself, the better. But yeah, a zoom retreat still is immersive because you do, you know, these sessions all through the day. Right. So it's pretty. Look, we'll take what we can get right now. I mean, it's like, it's not like it's the best time to go traveling around the planet to monasteries or temples. So this is great. And I hope lots of you will take this course.

All the links you need to find Mirabai will be located at DuncanTrussell.com. And now please welcome to the DTFH Mirabai Star. It's been DuncanTrussell, thank you. Thank you so much for I mean, I have a good background in culture and, and I wanted to talk to you, like um, you're not in a state of Philadelphia, it's just like a lot of my families have been listening to your podcasts and I know that the caliber of people you have on the show is really amazing and also the topic, you know, is often connected to mind altering substances and maybe that's not so much my, you know, what I have to offer. So I, I appreciate you making space for whatever happens in our conversation. Well, thank you so much for coming on the show and it is a joy to read this book while Mercy, for me for a few different reasons. One, I lost my mother and so I have really enjoyed connecting to her through her book because this is the kind of book she would have loved and I feel her in your writing and two, because watching my wife with the baby has been one of the most profoundly illuminating experiences I've ever had and I love conspiracies. But for me suddenly to just bear witness to what I, for lack of a better word, I think you could call a conspiracy, which is that somehow this aspect of life, breastfeeding, birth, it takes a secondary position or has taken a secondary position in just about everything. It's, it's when I, you, in the very beginning of the book you talk about the lifting of the veil in certain moments where it's like you're, now you're in a whole, you're in a new reality, you're in a new sort of, to me what feels like an intentionally censored space, which we know, watching my wife as she is laboring and feeling the energy in the room and feeling the circle of ancestors that you write about in this book and feeling that sense of like, wait, this is it, but I, this is not what I thought it was and realizing this is the mother, I'm experiencing the connection to the mother and somehow as a guy, I just never, it's embarrassing to say I just didn't spend a lot of time thinking about moms. If anything, you become a teenager, like give me away from my mom. And so I wondered if we could start off and thank you for letting me do this rather long introduction to my question. I wonder if we could start off by me reading a little passage from your book from, it's on page 117 and it's the chapter called Sheltering, it's quite short but I thought it could be a good starting off point. Perfect, let's do it. The great mother holds you even as you hold your son or daughter. When you feel incapable of making the next decision or even taking the next breath, you will turn to that mother, you'll lay your head in her lap, unburden your heart and listen for her guidance and then warm to beside her hearth, you will go back into the forest and pick up your baby and continue your journey. Tell me about the great mother. Oh Duncan. I feel like I want to ask you questions. What's funny of this impulse is arising to have a real conversation and the interesting conversation partner in this pair is you. And yeah, so first of all, bless this birth of your baby boy and the new relationship and landscape that you've entered with your wife and bless your broken heart in losing your mother. So I just have to say all that first. Thank you. So the great mama, sometimes it's hard for people to even get their heads and hearts around the concept of a divine mother because their relationships with their own moms might not have been so great and so it's not really where we go. Well, I have a great mom so it's easy enough for me to go there but I have definitely encountered other people, men and women and people of all genders who struggle with the mom thing. And so I have begun to expand my whole concept and experience of the sacred feminine to be sister, lover, dear friend. Like it doesn't just have to be mother. But yes, there is some way in which even if you had a mom that wasn't really there for you, this great mama of the universe is. And I think that we can all find an access point to her. And there is something about this great mother energy that has been you right. You said it earlier just sidelined. I don't know how you said it but that is true that the feminine has been intentionally covered over by all the world's religions and all the other human communities, not just spiritual traditions but politics, the arts, all the intellectual pursuits, sciences, everywhere. And so it requires this kind of excavation and it did for me with this book Wild Mercy because I am looking at women's wisdom, feminine wisdom across the spiritual traditions and you think that would be relatively easy to find. I thought it would have been after a lifetime engaged in multiple spiritual paths and it isn't because there is something so powerful about this ma energy, this feminine transmission, this wisdom that it has been really threatening to the dudes in charge. But she is like right there, completely accessible when we turn to her. And the thing about this mother energy is that she is ultra compassionate of course unconditionally loving, yes, forgiving merciful, filled over flowing with loving kindness. Yes, all of those attributes belong to this great mother. And she is also a little scary like Kali. She is fiercely protective. She doesn't put up with any bullshit. She is a ferocious truth teller when truth needs to be told. She speaks out against injustice anywhere and everywhere she sees it. And she is not that fond of rules and regulations. And so when you are in a situation that has been controlled by the masculine mind where everything has its place and there is a right answer and there are boundaries and prescribed rituals this feminine vastness is really subversive. Yeah, it is. I think right now there is a sort of anger, a Kali energy that people are feeling and I understand it and I wonder how it is. Not that individually I am responsible for the repression of feminine mystical traditions or the feminine mystical voices. I think a lot of us are realizing we don't get to decide when you fuck up when someone stops being angry. You don't get to do that. But I just think this is like thousands of years of this level of intentional suppression of the feminine voice in relation to everything but it is covering the mystical side of it. How long do you think the anger lasts or will it ever go away? Is there a time when people realize how tragic that is? Secondly, is there ever going to be a time when women stop being angry about that? I don't think we have gotten to the point of that part yet. It is kind of terrifying to consider. And Kali is a really good example of this fierce feminine energy that you are talking about. But Kali is also an example of probably the most culturally appropriated Hindu deity by progressive white spiritual people like me. And one of the things that I am constantly trying to stay aware of Duncan is my own impulse to help myself to the spiritual treasures of all the world's religious traditions because I can. And to continuously disarm my heart and deconstruct my concepts so that I can meet these great wisdom teachings from a vulnerable, naked, open space and not with my own preconceived ideas of how those great transmissions can serve me. And so Kali is one of them. But here is the thing I am getting about Kali in relation to this anger issue. Is that Kali is ferocious, yes. She wields a sword dripping with blood. She is wearing a necklace of severed skulls and her hair is matted. Her skin is blue black and glistening. She has blood dripping from her teeth. A skirt of severed arms around her waist. And she is not pretty. She is really scary. But what we forget about Kali is that she is the ultimate unconditionally loving ma. Transmutation of the poisons. And she takes it all in and she transmutes it into what? Hold on. One second. Are you there? Hang on. For some reason you stopped coming through my headphones. Speaking of one second. Sorry, I'm not sure what happened. Sorry. Let me just make sure this is the first time I use Zoom. It's a little thing that I think was my headphones. Let me just pause this. I apologize. You are bullseyeed. Something I've been massively confused about forever. So we're going to jump right back into Kali in two seconds. I just want to absolutely make sure that something didn't glitch here. This is the first order of groceries. You don't have to suffer at the grocery store anymore. You can get groceries delivered to your house in less than an hour. Remember that's Africa Duncan. And you'll get $10 off your first order. So this is the thing with Kali. And I have some of friends who are Kali devotees. And I still I can't understand where the love is in all that and the skirt of arms. Though I do think it's beautiful and amazing. Something about the wrathful feminine energy demonstrated in that way. It's terrifying. And I have a friend who told me the more you think about it and the more you devote yourself to the more beautiful she becomes. You know it's funny Duncan while we were talking about this and just in a little pause here I just opened my book Wild Mercy at Random and guess what I turned to? What's that? The section on Kali. So can I just read you a paragraph and see if it maybe speaks to this? That would be great. To the love. Actually a couple of paragraphs because Rhonda's is in it. So Kali would do anything for the liberation of her beloved children. And so she smites the enemies of sorrow and delusion. She eats our too muchness and spits out our not enoughness. And then she gets it to Kali. You really want to wake up? Ask her to awaken you. Irritable and moody, selfish and sluggish Kali will relieve you of your burden. Call on her. Come on, remove this obstacle and open the way. But according to my lifelong friend and mentor Ramdas another feminine mystic in the body of a man you better mean it. Ramdas is talking about Kali's transformational teachings from his Guru, Neem Purali Baba in India. With Maharaj's blessings Ramdas, okay I'm just talking about now what Ramdas brought to America. But to go on with Kali, whatever you give to Kali Ramdas taught me she will receive. And if you weren't quite ready she will come and take it anyway. Her sword will slice you to ribbons. Her fire will burn you to ashes. She loves you, but the opposite is also true. Just as the feminine cannot be limited by attributes of gentleness neither is Kali exclusively fierce. There is an exquisite tenderness in this goddess of liberating change. Fire doesn't only burn it softens and melts that which is hardened and stuck. I think about Kali's transformational fire that is like when Maharaj said that a saint's heart melts like butter more than that it melts when anybody else's heart comes near the fire. And I think that's Kali it's this exquisite tenderness also it's just what can I do to take away your pain and suffering so that you can be fully present and with your heart wide open. And that Duncan is what leads me to respond to your question about the anger of women and how long does this fire need to burn? And I think that maybe one of the things that we've been missing because I too have been angry all of a sudden really pissed off at men for all the ways that harm has been perpetuated in this world. And lately I've begun to realize that I need to be able to feel that anger in my open heart. If I can stay connected to my heart and keep my heart open in hell as Ramdas used to say then healing can happen. If I only stay in my opinionated mind about all the harm that has been done then there's never going to be healing for me or anyone around me. So I keep coming back to that heart space which doesn't mean that I'm not angry in the face of injustice at all. It's not a spiritual bypass but it is a continual homecoming that makes room. The heart is vast is what I've noticed and so there's boundless space to contain it all the anger and also the hope and the tenderness and that exquisite vulnerability that's also characteristic of the feminine. Wow, yeah well you know the vastness of the heart reminds me of your chapter on believe St. Teresa and within that you are talking about her discovery of this interior spaciousness or an interior castle and what I love that you did in this book and I don't know why right now I have a problem with non-dualists it's like the nerdiest thing to be irritated by but and for the non-duals out there forgive me well you understand because you are me so you can't really get to it. But you know I love the way that you broke down the sort of I don't know what the word for it is when you find yourself around someone who feels how did you put it you basically I'm gonna try to I'm gonna this isn't what you wrote but essentially this like hierarchy of there's non-dualism and then if you're a duelist you're deluded I think that's what you said in the book it was beautiful whatever you said it was wonderful which is this stuffy snobbiness in relation to people who have decided to be devoted to some person or a god this or a god or a path boxy you've you're on your own enjoy it kid eventually you'll wake up right and then you said that in your opinion the divine feminine is all about embodiment and it made me think are you saying that there's some kind of implied misogyny and non-dualism I think wow I've never nailed it like that but yes I think there is you want me to respond to that yes please okay wow that's very very insightful way of putting it Duncan right so the non-dual philosophy because it is a philosophy Advaita Vedanta an ancient philosophical system from Hinduism one of the streams and it basically states that we are one with Brahman it says in the Upanishads that thou art that there is no separation between god and self and any sense of separation is an illusion and our task is to wake up to our essential unity with God which is wonderful I can totally buy that the problem is it has become really kind of crusty and entrenched non-dualism has become very dualistic in the sense that it asserts that anyone who actually cultivates a devotional relationship with the beloved god as other is missing the point because there's nowhere to go and nothing to do because we are already there and we are essentially the same that which we seek the truth about the devotional path seems to be however that because devotion bhakti yoga is about love love opens the heart but it also melts the boundaries of the heart so if I'm having an intensely loving moment with the divine through chanting kirtan or sitting in silence or walking in nature or making love with my beloved human and all the many ways looking into the eyes of my baby then what happens very naturally in those love spaces is the boundaries start to thin and dissolve and we actually experience our oneness with all that is philosophical notion or set of beliefs to adhere to it's a living reality that embodiment and the seeming separation of different bodies becomes the holy ground where spirit pours into matter and we discover the divine in each other and then we forget from these beautiful gorgeous fleeting moments that we are separate hmm yeah wow I wonder if there's something that the problem is that there's this imbalance happening there well first of all number one the non dual thing it's kind of easier in a weird way to be everything because in the any human relationship there's this turbulence that can happen that emerges and so it would be easier to be everything all at once this thing that you're I keep thinking what would a world what would this world look like if everyone read your book and suddenly this shift actually did happen where we did move into a world that was more feminine that didn't think bad things about the mother sitting in a hotel room window at the Bates or motel room window you know what I mean and where the relationship with the mother had been somehow healed so that when you hear the idea of the mother being the way into the heart of compassion or you didn't even cringe you never met my mom you have no idea but so what does your world look like how does this not your world our world but this world where the divine feminine suddenly became part of popular culture and became something that men didn't immediately recoil from because a lot of my friends I think if I even said the word divine feminine around them they might puke in front of me you know like divine feminine go back to your yoga studio what are you talking about you know this is like the world that we're in that you know the divide is quite big well and I feel a little pukey too sometimes when people just spout this spiritual mumbo jumbo including the language around the divine feminine because it's just another concept that becomes a commodity to over consume we can even just like jettison the whole word divine and just speak about the feminine which is why it's very nature sacred and then we can get around those divides but to actually come back to your question about misogyny the thing about the masculine way of doing spirituality for millennia across the world's religious traditions has been about transcending the body right that the masculine spiritual path is about seeing the body and the earth as illusions to be transcended whether it's Maya or in you know Christianity that there's that the rigors of prayer practices are all about beating the body into purification and purifying and perfecting and the feminine doesn't get that so if we come back to that whole non duality thing that's very much about seeing embodiment as illusion because embodiment is separation right here we are in these separate bodies on this planet with all of its dramas and it must all be all be illusion other spiritual practices catapult us out of this realm of form into some sublime stratosphere presumably where we are all one and so what that does of course is it leaves the feminine experience in the dust a woman's reality is so much about embodiment but not just women people of all genders are grappling with this absence of of the affirmation of the sacredness of our human experience and we're all heirs to this kind of bullying spiritual bullying about purification and perfection which is why we think there's always something wrong with us that we're too much or we're not enough and so women's experience is even more I think embodied than a typical dude's experience he might be more comfortable with this whole idea of non duality and transcendence of the body but what it does is it opens up women to all kinds of abuse really psychological and emotional if not physical and it has probably been responsible for the climate catastrophe and what's happened to the earth herself and I say herself very intentionally because if we can cultivate this intimate personal relationship with the earth as a cherished relative and fall in love with her again then there's no way we could use and abuse her you have to man this is crazy to achieve a kind of consciousness within which you're cool with strip mining you definitely can't look at the earth as being anything more than some kind of accidental blob of exploitable matter floating in the middle of space then if you want to dehumanize a person then you want to do the same thing you know amalgam of like traits or whatever but they're mostly there for my whatever my pleasure to be controlled subverted subdued, herded it's so wild legislated the thing is my wife and I were having a I guess you call an argument and I don't know if you've ever heard of this but she was pointing out you can leave and be gone for more than a few hours because you don't have to you're not breastfeeding the baby and within that for men maybe genetically I don't know how many people listening or fathers or mothers but there is all this room to sort of disconnect from the reality of having someone who truly depends on you like truly truly truly depends on you which is this little baby they have to have milk and they grew inside of you and they're part of you and they love you more than anything so yeah that experience I think I mean would you say that there's no way for a guy to experience that in the sense that I will never breastfeed I will never have to transform some part of my diet and the milk to give to a baby that's I can't do it and I won't feel that level of being away from the baby and knowing if I don't get back the baby doesn't get milk so this creates in my mind is there a like Dejevary Dune is this like the that place where only women can go like a walled garden that is completely inaccessible so that all is men we can do is kind of like thing hmm well I guess I sort of understand what this means about the feminine and all this and the connection to the earth and the celebration is the beautiful duality the sacred duality and the ability to nurture and care but man I I'll never really know it no I don't think that Duncan I really don't I mean for all the people who are listening who are not mothers and never will be either because you're a woman who hasn't had a biological child because you chose not to or because you were unable or because you're a man or because you're a non-binary gendered person that doesn't have any intention of doing that I don't want you to feel left in the cold from this conversation I mean I think that biological females have a felt sense of sacred commitment that is available to us maybe a little more directly than other people do but I for one Duncan am an adoptive mother so my children I adopted my two daughters and then I married someone who had three daughters and so I co-raised five girls and none of them grew in my body or suckled from my body that I deeply connected to them and my daughter who died Jenny was as close to me as any human being has ever been even as more than my own mother who I'm incredibly close to whose body I did grow in so I think it's important to say that I also want everyone to be aware that when I'm speaking about a feminine spirituality I'm speaking about the thirst for that that's in all of us men are just as much yearning for feminine wisdom and the feminine voice and a feminine way of accessing the holy here in the world as women are and I think are really ready for it like right now I'm doing a podcast interview and most of the podcasts I've done so this book's been out for four months it's in its fourth printing by the way in four months and I've done many interviews and the majority of them have been with men and with white men who are the pinnacle of privilege in this world supposedly and what I'm noticing is that these men who have been interviewing me are incredibly vulnerable and are getting out of the way and centering the voices of women in a really intentional way not to dispense their alms on us poor women because it's our turn but really deeply listening and trying to see what they can do to rearrange the power structure so that the feminine can be centered for a time just as people of color who have been marginalized by our accidental unconscious racism as white people often really well meaning progressive white people like me don't realize the way we perpetuate racism by virtue of just our access to privilege and so I'm seeing white people wake up to their privilege and I'm seeing men wake up to that imbalance of power that has done such harm not only to women but to men as well let me just address something very quickly I'm sorry if I didn't mean to create some kind of reproductive like I don't know race where you're only winning if you've got some little baby sucking milk out of you for me it's more like a sense of like loss like a sense of like holy shit this is a place I don't know how to get to and I don't mean press feeding though I would love to do what that feels like I mean literally like a sense of I mean imagine walking into a library and you've never even heard of a book and it's like what is it I can't get to it it's really tough for me to get to connect with a feminine and to have an authentic conversation with I think that that energy in the world and I think it sucks I wish I could but when I look at myself and I think about my relationships I'm mostly friends with guys I I don't know like I feel like I've just sort of ended up or am or privileged my way in or I don't know all the best way to describe it but it's just a feeling of like I'm reading this book and just feeling really cut off and afraid to even talk about it with you because it's not exactly the coolest thing to say and but just that this sense of like man like whatever this this is it's a it's a few floors up from where I'm at right now I hear what you're saying and I don't totally believe you because I don't think you would have been willing to have this conversation with me if it wasn't somehow something that you deeply connect with look I think that what we're talking about Duncan is as simple as just accepting that the body is holy because it's the place where spirit meets matter and you get that it's about not disparaging feelings and emotions you know like a lot of religions have done that even my beloved Ramdas who is my lifelong mentor friend I was with Ramdas when I was 15 and I got the message about the witness you know cultivating the witness who is kind of watching the whole show or what Ramdas calls melodrama of life but is not caught by it and it's taken me years so I was 15 when I hooked up with Ramdas and followed him around started following him around and I just turned 58 so it's taken me decades to tease out some of the messages the unconscious not misogynistic exactly but body denying messages in my most beloved spiritual lineage I've got many spiritual lineages I'm Jewish and I feel connected to my Jewish roots I'm deeply connected to a number of Sufi traditions I've been a translator of the Spanish mystics who are Christian mystics and you know I have a Buddhist meditation practice so I'm all over the place spiritually promiscuous as the way I've always described myself and I'm having to really discern as I do this work now with feminine wisdom what the messages are that oppress and make our human experience wrong so there's like beautiful value in cultivating a witness consciousness so that we don't get caught in believing everything we think I'm all for that mindfulness practice is a powerful tool for waking up and stepping up but if we use it subtly to disparage our human experience then all we're doing is perpetuating these patriarchal structures that say the real world God lies beyond everything that we experience in the human condition rather than it's all available right here so we can keep our hearts open whoa this is so in such a mind blowing conversation it's like we've like this is probably the wrong way to put it it's really forgive me you know anyone listen I'm just trying to be very honest about all this and not try to seem like it would be easy to say the right thing it feels like pornography and the consumption of pornography and the addiction to it that many people have it reminds me of what you're saying in the sense that when you're watching this you have to get out of your head that this is a person that these are people you have to like imagine that you dehumanize and that the thing starts and then it ends and that's it and it feels like people are doing that with the planet which is like it's not a thing it's not a thing or definitely with women and certainly it's so much easier for me to meditate on the non-existence of a fundamental identity and to imagine that there is this kind of phantasmal attachment to a sort of vaporous and permanent series of habituations called myself then to think no I'm actually a self I'm a me and there's a world and I'm interacting with it and it's primary to whatever this other lofty bullshit is and it's just easier because it hurts to feel it hurts to be vulnerable it hurts to deal with all the pain you may have caused in your life it hurts to deal with like not being a good son and so it's easier to just be like I'm just a little wisp of God's and it's just like a sensation of some junk and flavored vape smoke and whatever head shop God's hanging out in and so like this to me I don't know this is the wall I run into is anytime I do get to the point where I start really feeling the feels I shut down I don't want it I would love to want it I would love to be that person but it's like no way after my mom passed in the car and oh no she hadn't passed she had she was we were just driving in the car she was very close to her and we both wanted to cry and I start crying a little and then my brother starts crying he's like we're not going to do that we're not doing that right now and I'm like I'm not doing that right now and I think I've been not doing that for my whole life to stop not doing that and maybe that's why these ideas are so like hard for some of us who've been taught that's the way to be a God yeah oh I know it must be so hard I totally hear that and I don't know I don't know what to say you know except that there are boundless opportunities to feel the feels and so you know you are doing it right now as a new father that heart exploding territory that you're showing up for and so the thing I think that often scares us about this embodied spirituality is that if we've been conditioned to think that being a spiritual person and I really don't think you suffer from this illusion Duncan but a lot of people do men and women people out of all genders if we have this idea that to be spiritual means a certain set of attributes that like character traits that we're supposed to have for instance equanimity and boundless generosity and compassion and it's always about the other person and never about ourselves if we have all of these ideas about what it means to be spiritual or enlightened then we're gonna think that we're a constant fuck up everything about us will be too much or not enough and there's something about feminine wisdom that I feel invites us to accept our messiness, our brokenness, our unskillfulness all the ways that we don't measure up to that patriarchal idea of a saint and just light them on fire and be with what is I just came back from a small intimate wild mercy retreat, I've been doing these wild mercy retreats all over the place and they're usually women it is true who come together circles of women and we spend a couple of days together and go deep into this stuff and speaking about the paradoxes that are inherent in the feminine way of being the feminine is really comfortable with ambiguity whether it's a woman or a man or a person of any gender the feminine space is one that doesn't have a problem with not knowingness radical unknowing is okay with her she lives in mystery that is the feminine ocean environment and so paradoxes are perfectly fine like Kali being ferocious and absolutely unconditionally loving, of course they're all true and so like the title of my book, Wild Mercy mercy evokes this kind of meekness but it's not, mercy is wild and powerful the subtitle of the book is living the fierce and tender wisdom of the women mystics so the fierce and tender is the terrain of the feminine and this weekend together we're talking about how we can hold these seeming paradoxes of knowing and not knowing for instance it's like the two wings of the bird and the love and the wisdom and loving kindness you need both to fly what tumbled out of my mouth is that the feminine is about a mighty vulnerability and I think that really sums up what I'm talking about here it's not weak it's mighty and yet it is broken open and it breaks when our heart when our heart to break is when that openness well when it's potentially available wow that just is beautiful but man it sure sucks you could anything but that like any it's not dramatic here but it's like you know lately with my practice and working with David Nicktern and reading some Trump of Rinpoche and getting to this idea of the warrior being broken hearted and being not a numb emotionless John Wayne thing but feelings so fully being so present and never ending sort of beautiful lonely heartbreak happening and within that you radiate out from that place but that is of course that's the ticket price it's just so annoying because it's inviting you for people like me I don't know why I ended up like this but it's like asking you to jump into rocks it's saying listen you're just going to have to do it you've got it that's because of the conditioning you've received as a dude that you have to do it alone like ride solo and slay your dragons and the thing about the feminine wisdom and heart is it says yes we get to show up for the full catastrophe here and we don't have to do it alone no one is going to let you fall on rocks because you're going to be held by this net of of interbeing that's called love because we are we all belong to it we belong to each other and so you're not exiled and banished to this dude land of you know the singular prophet who as I say in my book rides off on its horse and sings ballads that he wrote about himself you don't have to do that we can only do this this together we can only navigate the land of the broken heart together you know I have this I can't get this out of my head my son has just started doing this thing where after breastfeeding he like clamps on Aaron's nipple and he stopped but he was doing this for a bit and then just pulling back like her nipples are just a rubber band and then looking at me with this like smile not a sinister smile he just like loves everything about nipples it's the milk it's mom it's milk it's warm it's love and then looking at my wife and just seeing the patience I'm not saying she wasn't hurt yeah seeing this level of patience that is for me so heartbreaking because I can't go that may there's no mom for me to call yeah like thank you oh I had no idea and I just didn't I never I was too dim and then you're walking down the street and every single person you see regardless of gender had a mom and then you realize like oh my god the whole thing is being supported by this energy that is so patient that it would without hesitation die yeah for the child and so that to me is as this realization keeps popping into my head when I can't really smash it down is gotta be one of the most heartbreaking epiphanies I've ever had in my life yeah that's beautiful well I think that this experience of being supported that I'm suggesting belongs to the land of the feminine is is what enables us to be present to the pain of the world and let it in because it's not just ours to carry and I think that the injustices that are unfolding across the human community and in the earth in relation to the way the earth has been treated could not possibly happen if we connect with our own all of us men women people of all genders our own feminine soul and allow our ourselves to feel the pain to take it in to gather it like the mother gathers the child into her broad laugh and let ourselves feel it together and then if you feel the pain of the world you have to step up and act like how could you see someone you love suffering even if it's strangers in Ohio or El Paso or Rwanda but if they're all us and the nature of this whole fucking mess is love then we love them and we have to act on their behalf and we're not doing it to be nice or to be good progressive people we're doing it because it's the impulse the spontaneous impulse of the heart it's just I got you this math is from my I went I'm a doctor from the University of Bro science and this math checks out from where from my school but I don't know how to not be cynical about it because I think but I think that so many people and because we're talking about masculine versus feminine I think a lot of guys have a lot of guilt and a lot of sense of just like I just it's too late from if I spend the smallest amount of time going into that I don't know what you would call it the sub basement the next that realm like inside the secret door inside the massive iron lung thing that you created around your heart if I go into that thing I'm done I'm done I will no longer be effective as a person but worse than that I'll just have to face it you know I think of like in name think of any powerful authoritarian male figure in history or existing now and imagine that moment of having like Joseph Stalin or Hitler or Mao you there's many out there right now I mean sit and come to terms with the reality that every single person that they murdered does had a mom right you just could you can't it's it's the reason I feel cynical is I just don't know how this beautiful idea that you have becomes actionable in a from from for us for us guys for the guys out there maybe you're a sensitive guy who's like heart is completely open or something but like I just how is it actionable how do we do it I'm sorry to do the most I guess masculine thing which is like okay what do we do do because the masculine paradigm is kind of mechanistic and let's let's fix this busted gizmo right now yeah so I think that there's this fear of death like if I go there you know I as a dude with a certain amount of privilege maybe I'm white maybe I'm educated then if I go into that sphere of feeling the pain of the world in every cell of my body like a woman does with the pain of her child then I'm going to die I can't I can't survive that that's kind of what I was hearing behind your question like I can't do that I'll die and so that is true you will die that's what I want to say to anyone who's willing to show up for this kind of dis disarming of the heart it if you disarm the heart that means you're not armed that means the sword can pierce you and my response to that is yes that is correct that is what disarming is about and that death is a try an utter transformation like right now that I feel that the peril to the planet is so great that mass extinction is a distinct possibility and all I know is that my task is to keep showing up being present keeping my heart open keeping my sense of humor intact eating well and sleeping well and exercising so that my vessel is as sturdy as it could be for whatever it is that's going to be required of me and that maybe there is a kind of global dark night of the soul that's descending in which everything that we thought was the way things are is not going to be that way anymore that it's going to come undone and we can only bear witness with love and try to tend each other as these massive planetary changes unfold and to keep showing up with our hearts open and to keep loving and tending each other because this is real and injustice is a thing it's not an illusion it's required of us to tend each other not just as broken gizmos that are busted and need to be figured out mechanistically but as part of this web of interbeing that we all belong to Wow I am so lucky that I get to have these conversations thank you

That was the cover of Rainbow Connection from the band Thank God for Vote Coders and you are listening to the Dugga Trussell family our podcast. Welcome! Holy God in Heaven. I have got a wonderful recent podcast for you today I feel so lucky, this is my job. I do not know how I end up having conversations like this sometimes I even get foggy regarding how I met people but suddenly I find myself having conversations that I will think about for the rest of my life and this is one of those conversations. Today our guest is Dr. Ben Epstein he is a rabbi, he is my rabbi and he is a brilliant Jewish scholar and an author we are going to jump right into some heavy duty kabbalistic mind blowing glory but

cannot confirm or deny that you will be spared from the wild small animal attacks that have been happening all across this country now without further ado I would like to introduce you to my friend and rabbi Dr. Ben Epstein Dr. Benji do you think that there is a lane and if there is a lane what is your lane I'm finding it because I did not think that this was in my lane and you know what the universe has a way of saying guess what it is now it is now you didn't think podcasting was in your lane I didn't think Duncan Trussell was in my lane I didn't think that you know meeting heroes which is always going to potentially be disappointing is going to be something that is going to be life changing and exhilarating because I look good when I am animated yeah I think you look great it is a little foggy on the camera but I love our conversations I love the messages that you send me from time to time regarding just very sweet things about existence I just realized my god here we have someone no way you are wearing a midnight gospel shirt oh thank you well I feel kind of bad because the person who designed it I thought it was like special design just for me and then she put it on her store and I am like no no no I paid for that design and you are not getting any of that money so I hope you are not pissed about that but you have no idea what you did on jewish twitter when you put this on your show ahh you blew so many people's minds really? that is the cabalistic diagram that is the tree of life I know are you a metaphor and on a water slide it is like how many times do you want to make my brain explode was that the goal it is like the goal is soul by the way the goal is soul but other than that I think the goal there wasn't so much a goal as much when you start getting into the cabalistic tree of life you are for me at least you begin to get the sense of oh I am encountering something more than a symbol here is this thing sentient what is this thing is it talking to me why is it talking to me you start asking questions what are you what do you want from me can we hang out more often I feel very blessed to have you in my life I am really trying to keep it together you tell me when I am not you are keeping it together you provided a voice that is just talking about my lane you might be my lane is that weird to say I will tell you why nothing is weird to say that is not right I think the number one just knowing myself well enough to understand I am someone who is just interested in stuff and also knowing that there are legitimate people like you who have dedicated their lives to mysticism to healing it makes me I just feel like the thing I have to put on cigarettes it is great but I don't know long term which is why but I do love thinking about these things and specifically when I look at the various lineages that have impacted my life you know for sure Judaism specifically the tree of the Kabbalah the tree of life and of course a lot of my most of my teachers started off as Jews and then some of them you are still considered a Jew even if you are a Buddhist I wasn't sure you are always in the club cool that is good to know that is good to know I wasn't sure if Ram Dass good to know he is as much in the club as the string wearing black hat to fill in you are in the club my grandfather was Jewish but it is matriarchal so I don't get to I am going to call on some favors I am going to see if I can pull some strings but it might be tough we might have to snip I am snipped there is a work around I don't know how graphic we are going to get for the audio I am snipped there is a little bit more but you are definitely you are a friend to the tribe you are saying I have to get snipped more there is not much left there is not much left we got there quickly we got there quickly how quickly can we get to your private parts is this a record no but the what a mystical tribe what a mystical tribe and so much in western culture has sprung out of the thousands of years of contemplation the thousands of years of processing the thousands of years not just in terms of mysticism but psychology itself all of these things seem to be bubbling up out of that tribe tell me why I think there is the perennial wisdom the perennial wisdom do you consider yourself a guru no I do not do you know what I don't consider myself any of those things that you said to me about a student of mysticism a healer I am an average joe but your average joe in my tradition in my faith is constantly doing these mystical ideas and practices whether or not you are aware of them or not I am wearing strings right now can we show this for the listeners he is showing me these strings which by the way I am not certain what they are called they are called cc they are worn on a four corner and they are supposed to be a meditative device which is again for most people they just put them on in the morning make a blessing and go about their day but if we stop and pause and use it as another touchstone to remember something like you would be like whoa there is a lot of autism going on around him when a special needs camp right now so I apologize I want to be blown it is beautiful it is a beautiful scene it is service for our fellow men because we are all trying to connect on a soul level here but in terms of like I am just a regular guy who is just doing the things but it is part of the day to day it is built in and the more you study about it the more you learn about it the more you become hopefully connected they could which is this idea of attachment of again it is the opposite Buddhism is like being not attached we are trying to fully attach to what is we are really connecting to what is there are so many similarities and I am just learning about these things I am just starting to see the similarities and I am so attracted to Buddhist thought but how it informs my life in my lane I am not looking to go to Ashrams I am not looking to go to Dharmasala but I can take from your teachings and I can take from Sharon Salzburg and Joseph Cornfield and Joseph Goldstein and Tara Brock and be like how does this inform my life and my traditions and my faith and I see there is a lot of overlap and we just we are going we are trying to get to these places I want to thank Fields for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH Fields

friend about depression and how with depression it's like you get this suddenly things that aren't good for you become attractive things that are like it's like a grab your bed suddenly has this like magnetic quality an extra heavy duty gravitational field you're drawn into activities that create a sort of exponential increasing gravitational well why depression is deadly the more you listen to it the more you get pulled into it it's an illness increasingly difficult to get out of it it's because eventually it just tells you to not talk about you is inviting you to not even utter the words that you're depressed so it's like they're of opposite is Vecude finding like getting drawn into the gravitational well or field or some being attracted to God is that Vecude I think Vecude means big it's again it's that awareness that we that we all possess that natural awareness that we all possess when we're talking about seeing God like we have to get out of the old man in the sky right yes which again is it's a hard that's a hard myth to break out of sure you know stern father whatever your whatever your relationship with your dad was you really looks like the same relationship you have with God yeah right it's like oh it's that guy it's like oh he doesn't really want to talk to me or he doesn't want he's pissed not my dad or he's pissed oh my that might be my dad hope he doesn't listen to that I don't know what he's pissed what's he pissed about and again there's a lot of intergenerational trauma that the Jewish people have suffered and so you start to project your own but in terms of really connecting to what is and what is happening right now that's divinity that's the way God wants to be perceived in the moment and so the negative feelings per se and this is also very similar to I think Buddhist psychology is okay this is the weather this is the weather right now and and we talk about in an anthropomorphic way that there's also God experiences you know the sadness and the suffering the struggle there's actually here's we're doing some some some quick you know right now in the Jewish calendar which is you know always sort of aligning ourselves to the the the zeitgeist of the moment there's the we celebrate or we mourn the destruction of the temple which was the ultimate fusion of the physical and spiritual the temple in Jerusalem yes and and it was destroyed I don't have many thousands of years ago but on Sunday you know jewelry will will celebrate this day of mourning this national day of mourning where we sort of lost that connection it's called Tisha B'Av where we we go through the morning you know like there are different you know rules of mourning like we wear certain clothing we fast and we we suffer you know that and the Mitzvah the commandment of that day is to suffer you know and and afterwards the Mitzvah you know the commandment is to be joyful again but for that day is to really to sit in it you know without getting without getting swept away but we're not we're not denying the feelings we're not denying the emotions and the reason why the temple was destroyed the sages teach us is because of you know people weren't loving one another there wasn't there wasn't that that that love towards one another and that in that world I don't want to be a part of that so again it's not a physical removal but it's a you can't you can't sense that anymore we've lost that ability and you learn you learn the Kabbalistic Sparrow the books excuse me the Hebrew books and it talks about how creation could even have occurred how could creation occur from the oneness from the divine that is right how could there be that way and then you have this concept from the the the Ari who is the you know a mystic who lived in in spot in the 1400-1500 the historical sky and I'm just getting into this so you know where we're all this is all no but this is I'm an amateur like my people like you met you've met enlightened people right I've met enlightened people yeah so when I say you're a guru you're like no no no you know Ram Dass or Neem Karoli Baba Neem Karoli Baba who if you read about him the man was expansive as the sky yes right you read things it's like oh my god wherever I am I could he can feel me because he's love yes I've met people like that yes I've met people like so when I talk about it I'm a total noob like I'm a total hack so you again I apologize to your audience but you know yeah so like I'm a total hack okay no are you a hack yeah the same way I feel that you're a guru you could feel that way about okay but you know it you know no no no Sharon Sharon Salzburg who is who is my teacher we've never met but she is my teacher she's amazing Sharon Salzburg went to um you know one retreat or something she went to uh I'll get back to start my ADHD is going to kick in but I'm saying we we we can connect on that this is what we do this is what we do should we call Joe now anyway so she went to Deepa Ma after after retreat and she said she's going she was done and she's going back home and Deepa Ma said to her you should you should teach you should teach meditation and Sharon's like you know yeah and you know what she said to her she said you should teach because you understand suffering and that's why you're qualified to teach yeah so I think I think you understand suffering yeah I think we I think we all understand something but there are people who understand suffering and for better or for worse I also do and I run away from this I'm being very open right now you because you're my therapist and guru so thank you this is the safe no one's listening right this is a safe space no one's listening haha I understand suffering and all I want to do is run away from it like I want I want to just become a real estate agent like I want to I want to just like first off you think I could do a nine to five job no way I'd be great at the water cooler banter but like let's be honest here yeah same but but like I understand suffering and that means like you have two options you could avoid that you know and like nobody wants to join a hedge fund with me or you can you could teach you know because that makes you qualified it's like well I prefer like to have a different qualification like I don't know like something else other than the fact that you understand suffering but this this this coming up this Sunday you're saying it's sort of this is the symbol of like confronting suffering not running away from suffering it's the symbol of like having that moment of acknowledging where there wasn't love in your life right the things where you were like running away disconnecting trying to turn away and not ignoring it is that the idea is that why you brought it up and questioning God because people feel like you know doubt is is going to get in the way of their but no doubt healthy or holy doubt yeah can can can can accentuate the faith it's it's it's the despair and that's what I sent you that I sent you that that that flyer that I'm giving to like this and I'm speaking to the staff about this you know about you know especially you know we're still in this pandemic but I'm seeing people are just falling apart yes you know I and we if you were doing okay before the pandemic you know you you know job was stable kids you know we're getting kicked out of school marriage or the relationships are working fine yeah you got shook but if you were already teetering on the edge before this pandemic the floor has fallen out for me there's just there is so much there's just so much despair and like just following on social media and I know you've spoken about this just like you know hey maybe you don't want to read everything or you know you know Bo Burnham's like maybe it wasn't such a great idea to let 20 people in Silicon Valley decide the future education of our children or something like that maybe maybe that wasn't a great idea but like we're emerging from this and it doesn't feel like we're all in this together it feels like we are really really hurting right now and that despair is what is what the Hasidic masters the gurus you know they were screaming on the top of their lungs like never give up and that doesn't mean it's going to work out the way you want and which is very aligned with Buddhist psychology right it's like don't give up like hey you might not make it to the finish line and we both know and you know this well then I and I'm staying in my lane here we both know this isn't our first time around this is probably not the last time around and if this is a simulation I would have liked to have picked a different character moving on I don't want to talk about it because I'm out of my element same you're right just in certain areas not unnecessarily looks but physique wise right we just feel like why would you pick that character a little more testosterone please my avatar I'm flipping my avatar yeah but wait hold on tell me about this this symbol screaming never give up how are they screaming that what words were they using to say never give up Rebbe Nachman our guru the guru the guru of all gurus Rebbe Nachman and maybe want to come with us to there's the the new year the Jewish new year which we actually we connected on the Jewish new year that was that was our that was our touchstone a year ago so it's coming up in a month and there's a mass pilgrimage to his to his grave in Lithuania and it makes no sense it makes no sense at all and it is someone's like oh it's like burning man I'm like there's a lot less there's a lot less LSD but there is this this mass spiritual migration where it's just like he he that was his that was his message of never giving up believing in yourself believing in your worth and believing that what you do is you have faith in yourself you have faith in yourself you know another another guru said if you have you know belief in God then you are equally obligated to believe in yourself whoa right right as above so below as above so below 100% if you're connecting with this idea of there being some divine perfect perfect progenitive force and that and you came from and that and you came from that then how could then you have to accept the responsibility I guess it's a responsibility you have to accept that what are you going to say the thing fucked up with you like you or it's one mistake you're aware we rock yeah I did it again today's program is brought to you by athletic greens the most comprehensive daily nutritional beverage

you to say I'm one of your shows and you're saying just just bear with me for one minute and you did a guided meditation a perfect as you are meditation and I am just crying my eyes out again you have to keep breaking your heart until it opens and you are a heart you're either a heartbreaker or a heart opener I don't know we have to figure that one out but really oh thank you I mean and I know I'm not alone in this because what your show was able to do it was able to tap into forgetting about you know the tribute to your mom who is you know really just you know you start to realize how amazing human beings are and can be I mean wow thank you I mean you talk about like thank you and thank you for sharing that and thank you for sharing you know what it means to to connect to something that's so much deeper and again that death awareness which is something that's coming to my wheelbarrow now I think that's the next book which will never get written because it took me so long to write the other book I can't get your book you know your books unavailable on Amazon I'm gonna I'm gonna sue I'm gonna sue everyone who are you gonna sue you gotta sue yourself I gotta sue myself why is your book your book is sold out my book is sold out are you aware of that that it's unavailable you can't I looked at it right now like I said to my wife I said I can't even plug the book because you can't get it I'm the worst it's God's way saying you know what come email me I'll give them my email they can all email me I'll send you a copy of my book okay that's great now wait you said something early on and I love it because you just skipped past it I skipped past it and again one of the to me one of the guru qualities is that's what they do it's these little time bombs I just think I'm getting better at recognizing them you said the way things are that's the way God wants to be perceived can you talk about that a little bit meaning what what's the alternative hold on when we think of the alternative to that what's the alternative you're either in or out and and and you messing up is part of the system he literally built it into the system that you're going to do something off because guess what that's part of it no they mean it gets a little antonomy and it gets a little bit like okay wait a second so how much free will is there and then we got to get Sam Harris on board like I don't want to talk to that guy I feel really dumb yeah same let's get him on let's get him on I wish I could have the ability to like a Sam Harris bat phone but I don't it would be great to have him pop you everybody wants to be on this podcast everybody I know I actually so everybody he's so smart and it's great and he's and he sees things that way but again these guys can't get out of their own way because you know wait hold on hold on I'm sorry to cut you up war war what is it good for suffering poverty you live in a place right now but set with conflict for that's been going on I mean I've been reading this wonderful book Jerusalem it you know it's bloody it's bloody and at the description of the of it is like this kind of like ancient graveyard but it's so holy and powerful wonderful book I'm sure you've read it but not just clearly not just there like the United States the way we're living in a country that's been at war for 93% of its history social injustice everywhere you look you're saying this is the way God wants to be perceived helped me understand that what's the alternative we're put in this world to do some sort of ticu some sort of rectification right there is a there is a shattering of the vessels right that's going back to the Kabbalah again how did the imperfect come out of the perfect and again the language that the Kabbalists use is God exited the building because there was this unified everything one all love right we're there and then God said you know what for free choice for that existence to be created and again I'm not doing it justice we're talking tomes we're talking people who have devoted their lives to it and I'm just a hack who just wants to hang out with you which is really pretty much what I want to do all days is hang out with people that I like thank you I really thank you and so I've got to plug my buddy who's doing ketamine therapy at some point afterwards please another guy but but in terms of you know God exited the world and created what the the Kabbalah say this empty space this vacant space which created the possibility for for for death for Holocaust for flood for suffering it's all of that that's it because the perceived because once you perceive divinity in something it kind of takes the edge off right yes yes you enlighten beings do not deny that they're suffering in the world now they're just not they're just not so broken about it right they're not is that has that been your experience absolutely yeah absolutely they're not they're not they're not pretending like oh yeah there's no I mean they're the most they're the most in touch with like the physical day to day which is the most amazing our gurus our gurus are are so in this world yes and they're so not so not meaning you're tickling people's feet right that's got to be that's got to be in this world right yes but did you feel like he was really like he wasn't always here he was he was here and he was he was so he was somewhere else that's the description that I that they're there very fair that that's the description and when you're around that you when you're around that it's that's what's so spectacularly wonderfully weird about it is because you've been around humans your whole life but then suddenly around something that isn't a huge it's a human in the sense that it's it's a you know bipedal with our wings or whatever you're not you're not but you are but right it's a you definitely go to the bathroom but you're doing it on a different scale you're doing it on a different right I mean well that's in there that that's what so I think that's what so what I love about the stories of Neem Karoli Baba is that you know you see them from a distance like Ramdas when he first met Neem Karoli Baba he sees this old man on a blanket sort of up the slope of this hill just looks like an old man sitting in a blanket no big deal no big deal so he's walks up to surrounded by people of course and like but you know you just kind of walk up to it it's the same way people take acid you know what I mean it's like what it's a little swill white it's a square paper what's the big deal what could this possibly do yay big yay big by the way another Jewish contribution to the culture we cannot forget Dr. Hoffman but anyway the point is the once you get into the it's almost like the opposite of a black hole you know it's a white hole once you get into that event horizon or whatever you want to call it and I'm sure it was true of Rabbi Moon is that what you call them? no I was staying away from the Moon in this conversation Nachman Nachman Nachman but I'm sure it was true of that that person is that you know and it was true of Ram Dass too it's true of all of these people is that once you get close enough suddenly you realize like oh wow I don't know what this is I will see that and I will up that because what we call that we call that Orhatsadik the light of the righteous individual which is again what that's tapping into isn't that you're looking at someone else meaning here's here's the litmus test for whether this guy is the real deal do you feel like a POS after you meet them or do you say oh oh wait a second that's what I'm capable of that's what I'm potential that's the Orhatsadik because they're invigorating and they're pushing that button of like oh me too I also have Orhatsadik in me and again we're talking about Orhatsadik which is again this is what they're able to do because it makes no sense that the two of us and again I want to just pause for one minute and just express my gratitude to the universe to Duncan Trussell to whoever else you know in everything that's led up to this moment you know and to say bless gratitude I can't believe I get to have these conversations I just can't believe it it's impossible to understand and when we get depressed we forget that yes depression is and again in the Kabbalistic works depression means forgetting your name you forget your name and it says after you die it says after you die you forget your name unless you're like conscious of it and your name isn't you know your human name is David right you think after King David right it's David right Duncan what me yeah you know after we do the after we do the circumcision again but you have to repeat the circumcision bad bit I'm kidding I'm kidding I'm kidding you're in we're gonna do the work around sign me up coach you're not selling a lot of tickets it's like I'm telling you if you want to be in the club you might as well enjoy it you know the self haters is like dude like if you're gonna be in this are you a metaphor but anyway okay well my friend I'm so sorry but I have to there's two of you you've given me a lifetime worth of ideas to think about so I need to slow it down a little bit I want to get back to the depression I want to go back to Orhad Sadik Orhad Sadik I want to get back to this because I have some questions about this kind of effulgence and I wonder if you have any thoughts on it so I had someone who was an expert on the near death experience on the podcast it was one of the most remarkable things that happened to me when I was volunteering with a hospice is that I was sitting with a woman who is probably a few hours away from dying and I noticed that the room was lighting up the room was lighting up and I noticed that she was kind of struggling against dying but every time she relaxed it was like the room lit up and I've done so many psychedelics when things like that happen I'm just like I don't know is this me or is this happening but I mentioned it to him and even before I got to the question he's like you're talking you want to know about the light it's called the fay light and when people are dying they seem to have this kind of ethereal light about them is that the same thing or had siddique is it some quality of the soul that is like when you have somehow managed to get the dust off enough it emanates or something is it a different thing completely? I've never thought of it like that I definitely think that and again I will refer to what your mom said what your mom said that that's okay yeah of course what she said was so poignant where she said she's never felt more alive when she was fully accepting that this was part of the process and again that that sort of radical acceptance and I take it to the next level the radical acceptance of this is God this is exactly the way things are and we know when we're around these people they're always laughing those gurus are always laughing because they're just not taking it so seriously because this is not all there is they're laughing and they're smiling and they're saying yes they're constantly saying yes to what is like yes or in Hebrew it's Cain my guru is Cain Cain and so is that I think so because you're past this veneer you're seeing through it the most sobering moments and I'm referring you to Frank I'm not going to get his last names right the five agreements and he set up a Buddhist hospice in San Francisco and he sat with thousands of people and the five agreements that he talks about are just such banal and such clear truths of showing up and trusting and letting go and I don't even recall them exactly but yeah those ineffable qualities that we're experiencing when we're in the presence of these of these enlightened beings and guess what when you're accepting the death you're enlightened I mean look at the word you're enlightened you're literally in the light right you're in the light I don't do grammar wow language of origin no that's it that explains it because it is a place of complete surrender and when I was seeing this woman what I think is like just a physiological resistance to what was happening meeting complete surrender when there was the resistance it was like someone putting a dimmer down on a light and when it wasn't there like just beautiful vivid wow that's so cool and we're tying back to the dimmer that's what the Kabbalists say occurred when God sort of removed it's called the tsinsum which is just a diminishment of it but it's never gone it's just that dimmer is gone and then what we're able to do is there's a re-entrance of this ray of light which is called the kaav and it enters into and that's the divinity and that's going to sort of enlighten you sort of get that dimmer that switch and you can just start picking it up and there are people who are living with their control panel on a higher level because we're staring at the same thing you'd be a jerk if you were just like yeah there's no suffering kaav that's not helpful but it's like there is suffering and there's also hope where do these words come from they come from the books these are my friends these are my people I'm hanging on but with Rabbi Judah Michelle I don't know if they're down he's the chief rabbi of the world I'm learning from these enlightened teachers people get so caught up the problem sometimes with orthodox Judaism is you can get there are a lot of rules but the rules are all supposed to create this awareness and this consciousness but you start to get losing the forest and the trees and so people are just like I can't eat after a certain time and by sundown it's Sabbath it's a lot of the don'ts but the don'ts are just to create this awareness of being but because of again I'm going to go with intergenerational trauma and I'm going to go with years of persecution that you sort of like have been in the survival mode and we're getting out of that I have friends now who are working with psychedelics to sort of work with that in a Jewish level and I also have colleagues Dr. Mark Bronstein who we connected through the Jewish angle who he and I are doing some ketamine treatments with now high dose ketamine with psychotherapy with it with a clinical purpose to treat depression and anxiety and trauma and doing couples therapy with that we're doing this in New York he's like you don't got to go to Peru to do ayahuasca you can come to Colorado or meet us in New York and we're doing these treatments I just think it is so stunning that their words like this even exist because the implication is minds spent enough time communing analyzing to come up with words to describe these things you know it's just a beautiful the implication is just the very existence of the words is beautiful right in the sense that because the words exist it shows like these are like I'm sorry you hear about like and they found a 150 year old bottle of wine and the Titanic but these words each of them feel like that infinitely old linguistic wine bottles that are sort of like they're keys that's what I was looking for keys, fermented keys exactly is right because once you get the word then you now you have a kind of handle within which you could start examining something very closely but without the word it's more of like a kind of intuitive sense Kav for example the amazing thing is the Kav the etymology and the Hebrew word of Kav of line is also from the word which means hope that ray of light it's not light it's the closest word that we could use as a metaphor are you a metaphor to what is going on but it's not an actual physical you can't touch these things you can't touch these things but you know I'll give you another one that's going to help you I hope you've never heard this one what's the magician's phrase you know the old school yeah guess what ready? Aramaic for I create as I speak yeah I create I create as I speak because once you have those words for it once you have the language and again in psychology now words are what get us stuck we get so stuck with language and again when it says that God created men he's created as a speaking being so the fact that we're able to create language is our blessing and our curse because when we find the right words we can create these realities we can manifest but when you have the thought that I'm depressed you suddenly become stuck because you're buying into this discursive mind that is constantly sweating out these things so language has such a grip on us so as soon as we're able to sort of remove ourselves from that grip but on the other hand without the words, without speaking without tapping into that essence those words of prayer or those words of personal prayer talk about how a person should speak in their own language on a consistent basis and at some point you'll tap into prophecy you'll tap into something that's divine that you're going to tap into something deeper it sounds like you're talking about your laundry list of stuff it's just going to be like I'm going to start speaking and like whoa where that's coming from is coming from a deeper well what do you mean I'm sorry speaking your own language as opposed to like as opposed to speaking in the traditional form like reading out of the prayer book okay this is an argument I got in a wonderful argument like a nice argument with a friend regarding like Channing, Hari Krishna Channing the mantras and they were like why not just say the prayer in English why do you have to say it in another language say what does that mean in English and then say that that's exactly what you were saying there were people who were tapped in think for one second what would your life look like and Baba Neem Karoli Baba what would your life look like without Him can you imagine I don't know I don't know but you've tapped into eternity you've tapped into wisdom and you can't go back from there again sometimes I have a lot of questions but like these guys are pretty unequivocal and they're not blowing smoke out of their news right that too I can say ass I'm trying to work on that I know you didn't know what you felt but I feel for a moment here because you don't want to talk about Neem Karoli Baba blowing smoke out of your news it's not appropriate because he's a guru we can't limit him but I know what you're saying having that connection to these types of people so if they said that there's merit in the Channing there's a prayer there's a silent prayer which is said three times a day and you can get really verbose verbose verbose not verbose just very rude but if you start to do it as a mantra and you believe and again it's all about intention we're going through the motions it don't mean anything on the outside people might think you're a very wise person but we both know it's all about the intention because at the end of the day how much control do we really have RUTZO RUTZO is will desire you want to be the biggest podcaster in the world you want to hang out on the show with me all the time it's out of your good but that's who you are we believe in that and that what you do matters a lot less than what you are we believe in human beings not human do-ies whether or not it looks like the way you want it to look if you have 10 bucks in your pocket and you say I really want to give charity but you don't do it that's not RUTZO if I could teach one thing I'll teach one thing because that's all I can do not getting into the idea of free will and free choice but in terms of the proximal effects and the Buddhist thought and the Jewish thought do we really have control you were born the way you were and you were born to the family the way you were and you married the person you did and your kids are going to have their things and at the end of the day how much control do they really have thank you because I do think this is like once you do get into the secret society of becoming a parent it's a very big secret society but it's a secret society in the sense that you see something that I don't know that you can get to through contemplation of the thing maybe I don't know I didn't so it's not fair to say other people can't there's talking about it and there's reading about it and there's intellectualizing about it and that's very sexy to you when you're younger because we're very enamored by the genius and the ivory tower of academia and then you meet these people and then you experience you're like oh that's what love is oh this is a perfect being and that perfect being literally just jumped on your wife's bed and I don't care about this with their dirty feet and it doesn't matter even a little bit even a little bit but also the free will part it's like when you when I'm looking at Dune and I'm looking at Forest I'm looking at Erin and I'm trying I love those names I love those names I'm trying to figure out how did this happen and how much control did I have over this you know Erin and I will talk about where like there's no way we could have met and not ended up getting married like there's it was like you know when you hear you know that thing but then also when you start thinking who named did we name these kids or did they tell us their names in our dreams Jewish tradition 100% says you are granted something called you are granted divine inspiration by naming your kids because the name is the essence your name contains your essence and so I love it it's so beautiful I'm laughing it's so beautiful and I hear the way you talk about the kids and again I have a kid my job is just to stay out of her way if I just stay out of her way because she goes through life believing that the world is unicorns and rainbows I'm just gonna say I'm just gonna stay out of your way I come home and I'm pissed at the world and I feel someone squeezing my ass right? did you ever squeeze your dad's ass? no right I'm good I'm not the only one and I go I dare it I dare it right now I dare it not now this is not the right time she's like Abba that's the the Hebrew name for dad it's a palindrome you know through and through you're gonna be their dad forever mom is the same thing and it's Iman Hebrew Abba your tushy your butt it's so mushy and like oh what are you gonna say to that like alright I'm gonna try squeezing my dad's ass and see how that goes that'll strain the whole thing out no but we're I actually have a son with special needs I have a son with special needs and this is part of my part of my part of my and I'm just like okay and again my guru said he said to me the tzadik said to me in you know wherever that's happening you agreed to this I feel like I would remember I feel like I would remember that but when I live with that awareness when I believe that acceptance and I do because I believe everything else he's saying and call me crazy and call you crazy but guess what I'll tell you a story from Rebbe Nachman Rebbe Nachman tells a story where there's a king Rebbe Nachman said people tell stories for people to fall asleep I tell stories to make people up and they're very deep and they're very capitalistic and I'm gonna send you a copy of them and you will trip it'll be Burning Man 2.0 and so I'll come with you I'll come with you I'm done you come to Iman I'll come to Burning Man more human than you man and so and so the king's advisor in a vision or in one of his like dreams saw that the grain was gonna be tainted there was gonna be tainted grain and again people like to say that it was some sort of fungi some sort of one of these things instead of everybody who's gonna eat the grain because you cannot eat the grain because you'll starve is going to go mad so he brings to the king and the king says so what should we do he's like let's store enough grain plus that we won't have to partake in the wheat and then we'll be sort of immune to the insanity he says well if we do that then to everybody else we're going to be perceived as the crazy ones right so he said what should we do what should we do he says so you know what we'll do we'll eat the grain but we'll both put a mark on our foreheads so we'll both know that we're crazy so you and I we have the mark on our forehead I'm blessing you right now I'm putting on my we might be crazy but at least we know at least we know that we're the crazy ones so I'm telling you brother I'm telling you that that is wild we're just touching that I'm not the right guy for this I could put you in touch with some people maybe not want to come on this show and just take you on this beautiful journey because my faith and your faith is just what people need and I hope you see that from your show because you did it for me I'm egotistical enough to say that if there's someone out there like me you gotta believe it's relevant to I mean that's part of psychotherapy that I struggle with it's like people coming in with the same problems but if I look at it and say right because we're all struggling with this that doesn't cheapen it that makes it more beautiful that makes it more again that holy work but I struggle with it because the suffering becomes you know it's a flaming lip song like is it getting heavy you know as heavy as can be listen listen I'm speechless I'm not literally speechless I want to talk about this mark the because you know one of the things that can happen if you are habitual user of cannabis as I have been in my life at times is you will forget that you ate marijuana you will forget it'll just be something you're like I'll have a little bit a few hours pass and suddenly oh my god I'm going nuts and then you're like idiot you why did you do that you ate weed in the morning before breakfast and now you're going to pay you're gonna pay but the moment you remember that then it's not quite as bad it's only terrifying when you forget this is what it reminds me of it's like the moment that you start reminding yourself oh okay okay this I don't but the difference is I know I ate weed in the story they know they ate wheat what did we wait what did we eat we were bored we were bored it's the condition and the Baal Shem To the the founding master of Hasidu which is again just a reintroduction it was kept on the DL until he let it he opened it up he said for this to survive for this tradition to survive people need to be tapped into the inner work and they can't just be checked and there's something beautiful about checking the boxes going through the motions and doing the practice and it's meditation, it's yoga it's the breathing, it's doing the work but if you're missing the inner workings there's a lot of spiritual narcissism also going on out there and so what he said was the creation and the words are what how God created the world through letters, through divine speech which we believe is constantly and consistently innervating the world that's not actual physical letters but there's this speech, there's this language and this is the world as God talking to us so he said the word for Galut which is what we're in right now this is the nine days of the destruction of the temple that the word for Galut is the same he said that's just forgetting and redemption is, you know the Hebrew word for that is is remembering and he says the difference between that is just adding this one letter which is again that divinity that's it, it's just that one basic the words are the same you just add one letter for exile and redemption forgetting and remembering it's impossible it's impossible to always I'll read it to you I'm sorry, I just mean like I'm so it's to me it's like how did it happen that in the evolution of language in this particular language it is so spiritually precise that there's a like a literal mathematical aspect to it we believe it was not a human creation, I mean, most people are like you know what, this will be a cup let's call this a cup, but in Hebrew the biblical Hebrew is from my belief perspective believes that the Hebrew letters are the building blocks of creation and so if you're going to be using that and so the words are so specific just like in the Buddhist psychology if you say the word faith in Buddhism and if you say love in Buddhism you're not talking about the love meaning they are really precise so take that and amplify that because now it's not coming from the Buddha's unbelievable discerning mind we believe this is the building blocks of creation I know you're about to read something, I just want to emphasize that redemption is for forgiveness with God added to it oh wow that is so cool it's so cool, if we live with that awareness and then there's a positive commandment every day to believe that God took you out of Egypt Egypt is not a physical location the Jews were slaves in Egypt anytime you're in servitude to one of those desires, again it could be the physical pleasures it could be those impulsive things it could be that depressive mindset where you feel again, the Hebrew word comes from the word straights from that narrowed, constricted way of being so that constricted way of being when you're not seeing yourself through the orhatsadeh, when you're not seeing yourself the way Ram Dass saw you, or saw himself when you're looking at yourself like that then you're in Egypt and you have to remind yourself constantly and consistently that I could get out of Egypt if I got out of Egypt once, I could get out of Egypt again that's remembering that's redemption forget your name your name of who you really are and that name has to be a chip off the divine block because again, you can't be a flaw in the system that's part of it it kind of, God worked it out for us I was like, if you messed up, it's because of you that's your fault but we also believe that God says I messed up too Tisha Bove is the day where we say hey, you know what's all this for and we read a beautiful I'll send you a clip I'm actually going to be reading it for the camp we read a scroll with a beautiful mournful tune and it's called Echa which is just like how could it have happened but it also comes from the word Ayyeka which is what God said to Adam when he was in the Garden of Eden and he says, where are you and again, my guru and Rabbi Nahum would say where am I right now Echa, Ayyeka, where are you God doesn't need to know where Adam is also there was only one dude in the world if you believe that story you can't lose track I sometimes lose my kids, do you ever lose your kids sometimes it's terrifying the worst, even if it happens for a second it's so bad 45 seconds, that is hell by the way that is hell, 45 seconds at the beach is hell, I know what that is that is hell so God saying Ayyeka God saying Echa where are you you have to be asking yourself that question constantly, where am I right now remember, because when you forget the eye, that's your ebbs again, you lost it it's not the physical servitude it's not being away from your home it's forgetting your life you're a divine being you are love and again, it sounds fluffy and it sounds beautiful but it's beautiful I love you so much I love you, thank you so much this is really like it's like the most I'm just a regular guy on the street this is this art I'm just a regular guy I'm a good looking guy if Warby Parker wants to can I say people that aren't sponsoring your show Warby Parker should be sponsoring my face people are staring at my face all the time I love your glasses Warby Parker my friend Dr. Mark Bronstein is doing some really amazing healing work with ketamine in a clinical setting Mark Bronstein every conscious medical in Colorado we're going to be opening some clinics in New York hopefully is his clinic open now if you want to come out to Durango, Colorado right now and spend a week with us we can make that happen I'm just saying if people listening wanted to people listening can reach it Reconscious Medical I believe that's the website you'll give it to me I'll put the link out since I can't plug your book because it's sold out I see now why your book's sold out I mean all of this is so but none of it's mine I will be the most self-effacing and again what we talked about this idea when you're in the room with that person for season 3 that's called Bital in the capitalistic words complete nullification but it's not negating the self it's negating that ego because what comes out is the true essence and that's what we're striving for and you see it these people they're not to be trifled with Biddle is the is the nullification of what's obscuring the cough the light yeah that's a good one and Biddle is that ego and when you're in the presence of the presence of Ram Dass they're so they're so not taking it's not even like taking yourself seriously it's not that it's just like you are just there's something and it's there it's either there or it's not either for them and when they're talking to you and you start fetching about something you did last summer and they look at you and it's like that's not who you are that's all you see yourself can I tell you a very quick story one of my friends I'm not going anywhere I'm in heaven right now I'm in eternity one of my friends I won't say his name he was invited to a place where one of the Dalai Lama's oracles was hanging out and at the time you've been very depressed deeply depressed like really not just like I feel bad today but very bad heavy heavy enough that he got invited to go to the Dalai Lama's oracle you know what I mean you have to be like where it's like that level like okay okay come here come here and he said that he walks into the room with his being and he's talking to him and within a few minutes he's trying to remember what was wrong he can't remember like it's just being around like he can't it was just gone like there and he was like spinning his wheels like wait what was I what was I unhappy what was what was this because this quality you know that is just there it is just there it's it's it's and then so I guess in the way that you're saying redemption is what happens when you stop forgetting your connection to God then I guess maybe when you start remembering your connection to God you forget your connection to the what was that beautiful vaikud is that the word vaikud yeah so when you you would you can't maybe you can't remember both at the same time maybe there's no way to have a good is that is that accurate I'm sorry you're giving me these like awesome equations you just said it meaning can you be a grateful person and depressed at the same time I don't I don't see how we don't see how you can't be depressed when you're living in this state and that doesn't mean that there isn't heavy things going on we're not denying reality right yeah that's the thing is like in asceticism is not praise there are times to be ascetic there are times to fast there are times to be chanting there are times we prayer but the real work like the greatest glory and the greatest is in it's in the trenches and we have this war thing of like you know there has to be the separation it's like no sex is beautiful eating is holy right there there are ways to do it though it can't be in a gluttonous way yeah it has to be done in a way of real of real you know sanctity but we don't look at this world as a you know oh he messed up this one I guess you know this simulation you know just got to run it through and it's like I'll try again next time oh this is this is the way it's supposed to be and there is that dialectic of like okay so I'm good how could I be better like yes meaning when you're living in consonance with your spirit and your body that is the rebuilding of the temple yes there's going to be a physical manifestation of that when you're doing that and when you don't have when there is that internal struggle when there is that fight when there is this you know you're tearing yourself apart you've destroyed the temple and that's what we're trying to rebuild person by person I have to thank you for something very specific now because what you've given me in this conversation is not just something I had forgotten but something I have been perpetually confused about for decades and you have helped me completely unravel it and I really have to thank you because I just up until this point have not understood redemption and that's what you just gave me I just didn't understand the possibility of it how it works the physics behind it the math behind it and I thank you for this because that is what you gave me in this conversation it is so beautiful so sublime in such a perfect exposition on on the subject I really want to thank you for that because wow what an incredible what an incredible perfect kind of math there it really is it's coming it's coming from our tzadikim it's coming from our gurus and we are blessed you know again I like to you know what did I do in my previous lives to be able to to have this you know and then we can remember that you know like it don't deserve anything the d-word you know we're exposed to we've been exposed to people and again there's a certain disbelief that like I don't think I'm supposed to be in this club but like I I know people I know people that I know Duncan Dr. Benji I know you and now they know you can we hang out is that is that is that I think we have so much fun I'm

much I appreciate your wisdom your your your your humor first of all I know you don't see yourself as one but your therapeutic style because ultimately I'm not a master therapist I do I do think I understand suffering but what I do really try to cultivate is just holding space which I actually I think I'm good at you know that and that goes along with that and you your natural the laughter and just the inserting of just a word here and a word there and I'm like this guy is just a therapist you are a therapist of the soul and I'm hearing it from your guests also like you know you have your your meditation teachers on you have a big Nick turn Nick turn on it and like he's he said this he's like you know what you're receiving from him you're giving back you're really and that's that's called the or Jose that's called the the the you know the you know the reflecting light there's an Oriashar that's coming to you and then there's an or Jose and it's constantly coming back and forth

Happening now! So now everybody, please welcome to the DTFH one of my favorite comedians living today. This guy is truly one of the funniest people I've ever met. He's co-created some of my favorite shows including the Tim and Eric show and check it out with Dr. Steve Broul. Most recently, he has created a show called Decker which is part of his show on cinema that he produces with Greg Turkington and I was really excited to actually interview him for once instead of doing what we've done in past episodes which is like weird angry style interactions which I think are pretty funny but it was cool to actually have a real one-on-one interview style conversation with him because he's a truly interesting human being. Alright everybody, please welcome to the Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour podcast the wonderful Tim Heidecker! Tim, welcome back! Yo! Man, I gotta tell you man, this new season of Decker coming up, I've watched the preview probably five times now. It's so funny. I'm so excited about it. Really? Yeah. Oh, thank you Dunkin'. Yeah, man. It's just the tip of the iceberg, you know. We're not gonna give all the spoils away in the trailer. When is it coming out? It's June 17th. Yeah, that's one of the, of all the characters you've created that I'm aware of. That is the funniest of them I think and for me. But did you, did you ever read Rena Williams, The Destroyer Books? No, I, no, let me write this down. Rena, Rena Williams. It's Rena Williams, The Destroyer. There was a cheesy movie that came out based on these books but when, when I was growing up, my dad was into these and there, it was one of these series where there's like 250 books and, oh wow, and it's written by a right wing, whoever, I can't remember who the author is. I think it was two people but they're both like hardcore right wing people and it's, and it's about a cop who basically they fake his death, his past is erased and he becomes an assassin for a right wing organization called Cure and he trains under this martial artist and basically he just gets sent to like kill hippies. Every episode is a different version of him going to, just killing, you know, people selling pot, killing Hari Krishnas, killing, what's that? Right. And it's unironically just like this was the point of view of the author. Absolutely unironically and, and, and, and, because the, because the country's out of control man and, and, and you know, the normal mechanisms aren't working anymore so we've got to come up with a cure for this, you know, these commies. Like Remo Williams would be sent to kill someone who was like a, like a Bernie Sanders supporter that had gotten too powerful. Right. And, and they would look like those mad magazine portraits of hippies with flies flying around their heads and stuff like the granny, the granny glasses on and, and everything. Exactly man. And I thought when I, when I've, from what I've seen of Decker, I thought, oh shit, I bet he was inspired a little bit by these books, but now I hope you'll go and read them. I will. No, I mean, you know, Decker comes out of, of course, the on cinema universe that Greg Turkington and I have been building for years now. And it's at this, at the core, it's, you know, my character on on cinema is this vile piece of shit with, with just bad ideas and, you know, major narcissistic personality disorder. And, you know, at some point he decides that he could make content better than these movies they're reviewing. So he starts making this Decker show. And of course, if he's going to be a vile pig, he's going to lean towards, you know, the, the right and he's going to be, he's going to be like a Trump head and all these things. So that's sort of natural for him. And, and that's just been a fun little playground for us to, to play around in, because I don't really get into very, you know, political humor very much in my other work. So to be able to kind of play around with like that, that AM talk radio sensibility through the voice of a action hero is surprisingly something like I haven't seen very much of that, which is good for me. Yeah, I don't, I don't think I have seen that man. And it, and you really have captured the spirit of who, who's the name of that, that awful guy who shot the kid in the hoodie? What's that guy's name? He sold his gun. He sold his gun. Boy, that's weird. That's, I'm blanking on his name. He had a Latino sounding name. Yes. Heard, not Hernandez, but George Zimmerman. George Zimmerman. He didn't have a Hispanic sounding name at all. I don't know why I thought so too. Yeah. But Zimmerman, he's got that kind of like, you know, Zimmerman is like this dangerous being that is murderous and has the same kind of feeling to him that like a anything that, that is dumb and kills has like a, it's that kind of, it's dumb brutality or something that. Well, it's very, it's a very simple-minded view of the world, right? It's very black and white and stark and unapologetic and simple, like a simple-minded view of the world, incapable of processing nuance and complexities, history, just, I'm right, you're wrong. I mean, I listened to all this talk radio and there was this guy, Wilco, Wilco report, you know this? No. Okay. So his motto or his low, like what he says before he goes to break is, we're right, they're wrong. We'll be right back. Like that's it. That's like literally his perspective and the message he's trying to get across to his audience. And it's like, I mean, I guess we all get trapped up in that a little bit too, but when it's so stark like that, it's a fun, certainly fun to play that kind of person. Well, it's, yeah, and it's intoxicating. I mean, you could, I don't know, I don't know if you ever do this, but do you ever try to put yourself into the mindset of somebody who would like, who'd really like Trump? Do you ever do that? Like try to see what's good about him? Try to get into like, okay, here's why he's so appealing to so many people. Yeah. Yes, I do. I mean, I can, I can identify or I can sympathize with that desire to sort of succumb to the strong man to submit to that. Like somebody is going to just take over and solve our problems. And, you know, there, he speaks in such simple terms that it's very intoxicating and this promise, and he's, you know, he's a brilliant communicator in that way where he's able to make problems seem very identifiable, very simple, very solvable. And, but I think when you step away from that and really look at the, look at information and, and study these issues, they're much more complex and much more nuanced and are not as easily solvable as building a wall or, or, you know, doing any of those things that he's talking about. You know his, how he's going to fund that wall. Did you read how he said he's going to do that? Well, some kind of, I don't really understand it, but some kind of forcing the Mexicans to pay for it because of the trade deficit that exists. I mean, threat, what, saying we're not going to trade with you unless you build the wall? No, it's, it's a, well, I mean, maybe that's part of it, but it's, he, the idea, so you have all of these Mexicans who are living here and they send money to their families. And so his idea is to shut down, to make it illegal for people to send any money into Mexico. So, and this is, this would crush their economy, apparently, because so much money comes in from the United States into Mexico, that it holds up their economy. And then to, to end the embargo, they would have to agree to build this wall. That's his plan. Well, that doesn't sound like a good plan. Yeah, I mean, it sounds like there's also a lot of like free market principles that gets, that gets stomp old, that gets stomp old. That's not a word. Stomp old is a great word. Trampled and stomped on is a combination that get trampled in, in, in trying to regulate the exchange of currency between countries. I mean, I'm sure there is, there is regulation regarding that, but it would be, seems like a slippery slope. Yeah. Well, yeah, I mean, I, I wish I understood it. See, this is what, this is why I, you know, once a friend of mine played, I can't remember it, Vlad, like Norwegian death metal to me when I was really stoned. And he said the creepiest thing he said, do you feel the pull? And as I'm sitting there listening to this kind of hypnotic, droney music that is somehow worse than satanic, I could feel it, you know, like it pulling you in a little bit, right? Yeah. And that's how it feels with Trump is this weird suction in his direction and the less information you have, the more powerful that suction becomes. And you're probably a guy, I mean, and I'm a guy like this too, that feels like a dissatisfaction with the establishment. And there's certain qualities about him that if it wasn't him, might be interesting, right? Yes. Yes, that's right. Yeah. If it was somebody else that was sort of saying half of the things he's saying, some Western version of Trudeau or something like that, it was, yeah, or, I mean, I don't know anybody that's got like, if it was, I don't know, Bill Gates or something, like somebody really from the outside of government who, but was a genius or was really, you know, altruistically, be able to hover over the country and see how it could work better. Yeah. And say like, I'm going to put everything I have into getting all these coalitions together and, and findings common solutions, you know, solutions that benefit everyone. Yeah. You know, I'm dying for that. And I keep saying this to my friends, as we sit around the table and argue about politics, is if there was some innovation or some innovator, some, you know, next level thinking, the kind of thinking that gave us the modern Republic, the modern democracy we have now, you know, that can be applied to the current technology and information that we have access to, like, where are those thinkers? And maybe they're out there, but they're not, they're seemingly are not influencing our political process enough. They're not there. And did you happen to go, I know you voted today, did you happen to flip through the bios or whatever you call it, that describing all the different people running? No, and you sent that to me, I didn't get really to look at it. But what's going on there? No, it's, well, this is like, just, I thought, you know, I better, I'm going to, I'm going to vote. So I better read this, I better read what these people are saying about what they're going to do, pick somebody based on these things. So this is, I'll just read it to you. I can't remember her name, but she did put her cell phone number on. And what is she, what is she running for? Senate. So the Senate. Yeah, for the Senate. So this is what this is buried in her description is this. My can is my candidacy represents expanding the 13th amendment to explicitly include electromagnetic human behavior and cognitive control parentheses, mind control is a form of human slavery. What freedom is there? I ask if there is not the freedom to think one's own thoughts free from interference, such as that from voice to skull V2K, mind control technology, to be able to hold one's own beliefs, to decide when to sleep or not to sleep, to dreams one, one owns one's own dream state dreams. That's a person who made it into the flyer in, in to run for Senate, which is wild man, you know, did you read any of the out that you didn't read any of them there? Yeah, so and if you continue to read these descriptions, some of them read exactly like one of those Nigerian email scams, right? Like an obvious, complete disconnect from normal grammar and also one of them was just a series of ones and zeros. Well, what's that about? I mean, how, how do you account for that? Like, what's, I don't get it. Well, I guess that, I mean, I guess that so after realizing that something like half of these descriptions were from crazy people, and that kind of makes sense that crazy people would want to run to get into office. That does make sense that it, but so doesn't it cost money to do that? Like, can anyone, I mean, how do you get, don't you need signatures? Like, shouldn't there be some, like, you know, barriers to anyone just showing up on the ballot? So it's, I looked it up and it's, there's some really stringent deadlines for all of this stuff that you have to report. So every, like, couple of times a month, by a certain deadline, you have to send how much money you're spending on your campaign and fill out all these forms. It's a very complex, it's described as a very complex series of forms that you have to fill out, which is supposed to act as the firewall between people who aren't serious, but it doesn't keep crazy people out. I see. Because they like to fill out these forms. So they get off on filling out the form. Yeah, it makes them feel like they're doing something. And this woman, you know, obviously, this is, I looked up V2K technology to see if it's a real thing. And it is, there's a, there is a, an actual type of technology that a project that they're working on to try to make it so that if you're, that they can beam the sound of a voice into your head, which of, and so this for schizophrenics is the ultimate way to rationalize their schizophrenia is that they're getting voices beamed in from the government. And so this woman is a schizophrenic who's running and thinks that the government has been changing her dreams. And she wants to get into Senate as a desperate attempt to stop the voices in her head. Jeez. I mean, all the best. It's crazy. But hey, you know, I mean, maybe she's right. I don't know. Probably not. But the, the, what you're saying, which is, I think what a lot of us are feeling is like, where, where are we? How come we're not in this? Like, where, right? Do you feel, do you feel unrepresented? Yeah, I don't feel very connected to, to really anybody, anybody running right now. When I, when I see, I don't mean to keep going back to Trudeau, but when I see somebody like that, who seems like young and smart and, and he's like, just a very brilliant person who legalized marijuana in Canada and is doing just a lot of incredible things that I would feel representative of a person like that was floating around. But it's hard to feel represented by people who aren't from our generation who have, I don't know. I mean, I get, you know, Bernie Sanders is people seem to really like him, but I don't know. Yeah, I mean, that's, that's, that's when it struck me because I'm listening to Bernie Sanders earlier in the year, probably maybe late last year, maybe it was probably early, it was like in January, I saw him in one of the debates. And I'm like, I really want to like this guy. I want to, you know, I feel him, you know, he seems like an honest guy, seems like a passionate guy. But the ideas that he's talking about are old, our 20th century ideas. They're, they're, they're not exciting. They're not, you know, they're rooted in, in a, in a, in an economic and government and political system that, that has been around for a while and work sometimes doesn't work sometimes. And I would just be so excited to hear just a different, like a, just a completely different take on, on, you know, basic systems of how to run large societies. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I looked at that. It's fenced in, in isms that have been around for a while. I looked at the guy who had the ones and zeros in his description and cause I was curious what he was about. And it, I don't, again, it was a very confusing webpage. His webpage is very confusing, but it did seem like one of his main platforms is digitizing the voting process. And that's, oh, that, so the idea is like, you turn the voting process into something like Reddit, you know, where people are upvoting ideas and instead of this sort of laborious, terrible, easily corruptible process that we currently have. Well, I kind of look at it a little differently because I, I don't think I want to spend my time to making all these decisions. Like I, I don't like that all the propositions and, you know, that I don't want to be that engaged with the decision making process of things like, you know, water bonds and, you know, whether or not to build a highway or this and that, I want to, that's the idea of representative government. You elect people that are going to get together, debate the issues, vote on them and enact them, you know, and, and I think I'd rather do that than, I mean, overdemocratization and it puts a lot of questionable brains into the decision making process that I just think that we've gotten ourselves into a place where the people that are getting into office are not necessarily, you know, very often do not have our, you know, the better the good of the country in mind. That's for sure. Yeah. And did you, when you voted, you, you actually drove to a place to vote. You didn't do mail-in votes. I drove to a place to vote. Yes. I went to my neighborhood polling. I like that. You know, I like put, you know, doing, pushing the buttons and stuff. Yeah, me too. It is cool. But, and you just, it's like a very civic friendly experience, you know, it's like people are nice and, you know, you just feel like you've done something. Do you ever consider like getting, do you ever feel like getting more involved in your community or do you ever get that feeling that you want to like just, I don't know, now that you're sort of a, you're in a community, you've got, you've got you're a kid, do you ever think about that like, shit, I'm at the point now where I actually, as a, it's kind of my responsibility to take on more of a leadership role. It's not a bad thought. I don't think about it too much. It has occurred to me. I am very passionate about the, about things. And I feel like I've, I come from a logical place a lot of the time. I was sort of a practical, pragmatic approach to things. And that's something to consider, Duncan. I mean, I'm a very busy guy. I don't know when I'd fit that in. You are, you are a very busy guy. You are so, you are really such an ambitious and talented human being. You just released an album. This is, what, how many albums have you released so far? Well, with, with myself and other people, this is probably the fourth or fifth record, depending on what you count. And, and this is called In Glendale. And, but what's interesting about this is that this appears to, appears to be a serious album. And it seems right. And that's the weird, that's to me, one of the like, very confusing things about you is that I think a lot of us can never tell when you're being serious. And is that something that you consider to be an intentional aspect of the art you're putting out into the world? Or does it become frustrating? Because if you want to put out something that isn't necessarily comedy, people are like looking at it as some kind of ironic joke. I think up until this record, it hadn't been really a big deal. I think generally I put out, I mean, we should just acknowledge like every time I've done your podcast, there, it's been sort of with tongue firmly in cheek. Yes. I mean, we, people ask me about doing your podcast all the time. And people don't know if we're being sincere on there. And there's like, it's, it's like a total mind fuck, I guess, or not, you know, it's not that big of a deal. But I'll be honest, Tim, I'm, I'm, I'm a little scared of you. And, and I think a lot of people are because you're, you're, you're really funny. And you're, you're the kind of funny that makes people feel bad because you're so funny, man. And, and so like, I think those earlier podcasts were my attempt at like, okay, I'm going to try to meet him at his place. Right. And I, and, and, and I think that I like, I like the way those turned out. But, but you're a scary guy, man, because you're like, you know, when I did a, because I was broke and I was designing Jeff Garland's website, he let me be on a curb your enthusiasm. And I got to be around Larry David. And it was terrifying, because he's so funny that anything he says to you in a negative way is going to echo through your mind forever, because it's Larry David. And I think in a weird way, you have that same effect on people, because you've sort of, you know, created this comedy empire that is so fucking funny that we get scared of you. Do you sense that from people that they're a little nervous around you? Certain people, I think so, you know, I do my best to disarm people of that when I can. I mean, with you, I feel like when I see you, it's, I feel you as a, as a comedic brother. So I feel like I can fuck around with you or joke around with you because you're, you get it or enjoy it. But I don't know, maybe you don't, but maybe it's intimidating. I think I've mellowed a little bit too, you know, I mean, I've just kind of mellowed out a little bit. You think you were, so you think in the past that you were, how would you describe that? You were kind of like, what, more fiery or something? How would you describe it? I guess I don't think about it too much. So, but yeah, I mean, I could be pretty quick, I guess, and pretty biting. And I guess when the wrong people, that doesn't sit well. But I'm always, I mean, I see myself very differently than everybody else does. I mean, I see myself as all sorts of negative things, you know? Really? You know, yes, just like not, not being, I don't know, you know, not being productive or, or not, not successful and, you know, all kinds of negative, negative opinions of my own self. Well, yeah, it seems like you just have a hardcore work ethic, just a basic hardcore work ethic. And the result of that has been all this amazing stuff. But talking about in Glendale. So yes, I mean, another side of me is that I like to write music and I've always written music and I've always played music and sing and, you know, goof around on, on, on my computer making songs. And usually that manifests itself in comedy music, sort of, I guess, I mean, but I always, but I write from the heart, you know, and that can be, that can end up being just not funny. It can be kind of funny. So anyways, I had these songs that were not really that funny, but they weren't, and they weren't really in any kind of a character voice or anything. So I got encouragement from people in the music world who are just sort of like, you're a really great, you're a talented musician and whatever, I'm not a really great musician. I'm just, you're a pretty talented musician, man. You do whip stuff together really quick. And whenever you've come over and there's a piano nearby or something, you like, you're, you are, you're not an untalented musician. No, but I don't want to say great, because that's, that should be reserved for great musicians. Okay, sure. But whatever. Very quickly, where, where did that start? Like, did you, when you were a kid, you started taking piano lessons? Or how did that, where did you learn to do it? I took my, you know, my grandmother played piano by ear, so she could just hear a song and sit there and play it. And she, you know, that was very inspiring to me. And so I took some piano lessons and guitar lessons, but it was mostly just like being able to hear music and being able to kind of try to copy it and, and emulate it. And, and then just forming groups and bands and playing with friends. What was the name of your first band? It's, you know, I have a string of bad title band names. The Time and Other Things was one. That was my first band. And, you know, I mean, these are decisions you make when you're 15 years old. So they're not something that I stand by. When you were 15, was it funny? Were you funny then? Did you? I thought I was probably funny. I think the mute, I didn't think about combining that with music necessarily. The music was very serious, like, you know, Pink Floyd and, you know, like I was laughing about this the other day, because all those Pink Floyd songs were, you know, we'd write songs that were like all about us losing our minds and being trapped in the chamber of insanity. What were we talking about? What connection to any of that that we have? But anyways, so yeah, I've always done that. And were you, when you were listening to Pink Floyd, were you taking psychedelics at all or? Some later in high school, I was in, like my last year of high school, I would, I experimented with that stuff for a little bit. Was that the 90s that you were in high school? Yeah, 94. Yeah, see, that was the LSD, but there was an LSD boom. Oh, really? In the 90s. Yeah, there was an LSD boom. And because somewhere in the 90s, the people manufacturing something like 80% of the LSD in the country, there was this massive bust. You've probably heard of it. They were living in a missile silo. They, oh, it's amazing. There's a great vice article or documentary on it. But yeah, there were these, it's really interesting about what went down in the 90s, because all of us, LSD was very easy, good LSD, was relatively easy to obtain. It seems like there's been a resurgence of that, but there was a vanished for a while. And this was because of these people who had manufactured, and then it would be distributed, one major way it was distributed was through the touring of the Grateful Dead. Oh boy. Isn't that wild? So the Grateful Dead was sort of come rolling through, and then they would just leave this wake of acid, which would float into the high schools, which is what we took. Right. And it was being manufactured in a missile silo, which is pretty cool. Yeah, I did that. I mean, it was a very small period of time that I played around with that stuff. And they were mostly very positive experiences. And then I had like one bad experience, upon reflection, I've figured out, I've done some rethinking about it over the years. Yes. And very quickly, I mean, we did it, we did it during Lollapalooza. I don't know if it was the first, it was one of the, I don't think it was the first year, it was one of the, it was, it was the big headliners were the Beastie Boys and Smashing Pumpkins. Okay, cool. So that was huge, right? Yeah. This was at their prime too, like, you know, hot, like 94. And we did the acid and, and it was a great day. I couldn't tell you, like, I think it was a very positive day, out in the mud, and just like being very hippie kid kind of attitude. But then right before the Beastie Boys played, we were pretty far back. I took a joint from somebody in the, in the crowd, who I don't, was a stranger. Okay. So who knows what I'd smoke. Right. But there, rolling. And the Beastie Boys started playing, you know, which is not my favorite kind of music. It's very intense and aggressive. And the, the, the, there was a lot of mashing going on up front. And somebody in the band asked everybody to just take a few steps back because people are getting crushed. And a wave of people started coming our way. And, you know, like everything in my brain, like just folded on top of each other. And I got extreme anxiety, extreme disconnect the kind of floaty feeling, you know, yes, really, really intense negative feeling, really scary feeling that really stayed with me for the next few hours. And I had to go sit down and kept, you know, get my bearings back. And it was very negative, very scary. And like I said, I've thought about it for the over the years. And I really think it might have had more to do with the the joint than anything else. And, but whatever, it's, it kept me away from doing LSD for years and years and years. How long did the feeling last? I feel like it lasted for hours. You know, it's certainly stuck with me in smaller, in sort of, it reverberated later on. And I mean, I came out of it, of course, and it wasn't, it was very internal. It wasn't like I was foaming at the mouth or anything. But anyways, that, that was that for me. And I've always said like, and I think it's for the best, I just want to, I don't, I think the older you get, the less space you have in your brain for that kind of stuff. Well, you can't, that, that, you know, what we all did, which was just this incredibly irresponsible consumption of one of the most powerful psychoactive chemicals on earth. And the weird idea that this is like a party drug that you go to a concert and take, it's, yeah, that is, that is not, that's not where you want to be on really good acid and marijuana. The, the, I've done interviews with this guy, Doblin, Rick Doblin, who runs the multi-disciplinary association for psychedelic studies. And they're the guys who are getting MDMA studied as a prescription medication for people with PTSD, and they're doing very serious studies. And the way he describes how they do these is like, you're with two therapists, and you're, you, you're, you're told, you can, for part of the trip, you can talk, but for a lot of it, they like you to just be quiet. You're listening to classical music, and you're, you're wearing a blindfold. So it's purely internal. And there's people with you who are there to, you know, if you start having that experience that you had, which who knows what it was, but if you were in the presence of trained clinicians, they could probably have used that as a way to like, you know, get, open up some part of you that you weren't aware of, who knows. But that's the way to take a psychedelic, which I think back then nobody knew, because there was no internet. And if there, if it was one internet, it was a very rudimentary internet. And none of us had any idea about what, you know, the right way to do that stuff. But I do disagree with you on the idea that the adult psychedelics aren't for adults. Or once you get past a certain age, there's no room. It's actually, I actually took LSD, I don't know, I guess it was, I've taken it a few times over the last few years, but I was, I had the same terror of it. And I thought, oh, shit, I'm too old. I've had too much shit go down in my life. I'm going to be tormented by demons of my past. And I took it at this vineyard up in Solving. And it was amazing. It was beautiful and great. But marijuana, marijuana will fuck with you. Marijuana is a far more brutal substance than LSD, I think. Okay, folks, we've time traveled. My Skype wasn't working. So I got lucky enough to have Tim come over in person. Yeah, you're in the studio. He's in the studio a lot sort of live. That was, yeah, we were talking on the Skype and it crabbed out. I said, well, we just realized we lived 10 minutes away from each other. We didn't even know that. I didn't realize you were that close. Yeah, all back roads, no highways. Let's hear that Alex Jones impression. Okay. Do you want to do it on, you don't have to run? Yeah, I've been working on it. I've been doing this show on Facebook live when I can called Face, office hours. Okay, yes. And it's like, you should come on. I'd love to. You have to come on. And it's just a call in radio show, which I'm able to do with Skype and Facebook live. It's pretty great. Like, I mean, it's, I don't know how it is to listen to, but it's really fun. You don't really take calls on your show. Not yet. I'm working on getting that in here. But it's, yeah, it's great. I mean, everyone that you can do it worldwide, international, you know, calling in from all over the place and people are, it's, it's live. Yeah, because I'm broadcasting it on my Facebook page. Okay. But then I'm, but then on my laptop, it's confusing. And I rigged it myself. So it's really weird. But my phone is broadcasting Facebook live. Okay. My laptop is on Skype. Okay. And I've got everything running through a mixer into my phone so that I can have a rate of a microphone. I have a mixer and everything. Wow. And I just did it. I just did it for fun, you know. And I'm talking and I'm just taking calls. I'm just hitting, you know, people are, I broadcast my Skype name on the, you know, on the video. You see this, this title card that says the name. Anyways, so every morning, not every morning, but when I have the time, I go live for live office hours live and people call in and we talk about whatever they want to talk about. How do you model? How do you moderate callers? I don't. I just bail on them if they're lame or if they're trouble. But mostly people are really, the weird, it's, it's a little, it might be boring to listen to because it's a lot of people calling in and being like, wow, I can't believe I'm talking to you. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Anyways, so I've been doing it on office hours. Folks, folks, we're, we are, we are standing on a precipice. We are at the edge and we are standing in front of a road and the global snow, they're looking down at us. They're wondering, they're looking down at us and saying, well, we can't have these people. We can't have the press reporting the news. That's why he does podcasts. He does that. He goes on so many tangents that you don't remember what he's talking about. But the point is we are ready. The invasions began. I mean, the invasions began and we are under attack by the reptilians and the globalist forces, the, the Bilderberg group and the people that are influencing our water supply. They are here now among us. And all it takes is Hillary to get into office for her to open the gates. And then the gates are going to be open, folks. And then it's game over. Okay. It's game over. Game over. Do you, you, aren't you a little bit of a conspiracy theorist or sort of? I really am not at all. No. I used to be maybe, you know, it's, it's, it's, and it's fun to think about who really knows. How do you define a conspiracy theorist or a conspiracy theory? What's your definition of it? Well, you have to believe that there's an organized power structure that sets events up to happen a certain way to affect the, you know, international affairs. Right. And that there's a group and they sit around and they plot. Right. And they, and they have conspirators who, who, you know, who enact plans. Yeah. I generally think that people are too stupid and unorganized and selfish for any of that to ever come together in a real way, you know. Well, you have like, you've seen Century of the Self that show up. Yeah. So you do have organized groups of people trying to sell products in a kind of subversive way. And it would, sure. That can be considered a conspiracy. I mean, any, any group that gets together to, to put forth a plan that isn't necessarily forthright, I guess you can consider a conspiracy, but. Yeah. And we're like, even for like, God, that crazy cycling shit where they put silent engines in the bikes. Have you heard about this? Oh, no. It's just like tour de France. Yeah. And that seems all corrupt. I mean, there certainly seems to be corruption all over the place. Yeah. People lie and people are just, you know, I think you call Hillary Clinton a liar. It's like, well, yeah, they're all liars. Right. Because you can't say, you can't tell the truth because the truth is complicated and confusing, nuanced and people are stupid. Well, see, that's where, that's where I, that's where I think there could be something. Because if you look at every other level of society, the most mundane, unsure there's conspiracies that happen at people who work at fast food chains. I'm sure there's little conspiracies that happen that you serve a manager or something. And so it would make sense that in the highest levels of power, there would be cobbles of people with a, with, with. An agenda. An agenda that they can't tell the world because it only serves them. Yeah. I guess, but I don't know. I think there, there's policies, there's plans that, that are unknown to us that affect the way the economy, the world economy works. But I don't know if we need to, people have the capacity to understand it anyways or know about it. So you're just not an Illuminati believer. No, I don't think I am. No. But you know, the thing about that, that I was thinking about, because I love thinking about this stuff. Sure. And it's also like, you know, you for the theories that these kind of general conspiracy theories, they satisfy certain part of our brain. No, I haven't heard this. Yeah. Well, they, they make it so we are, they explain the world in a, in a not tidy way. You know, they, they fill in the blanks. They, they, they, they organize the world. Can I stop you for a second? I'm getting. Two, one. Okay. So guys, we just had, of course, whenever you talk about the Illuminati, there's always a technical error. And the bugs come in. But I'll tell you, man, with, with the if you look at what smart people tend to do, is they group together. Smart things tend to group together and really smart people tend to group together. And also it seems like really intelligent people recognize the danger of uninformed people or people who are superstitious or whatever. And they know that those people are the ones and eventually they learned that those people tend to, they're the ones who set the witches on fire. So it would kind of make sense from an evolutionary perspective that like a subset of the species would sort of move away. And that, that's where you imagine shit. Maybe there are secret groups of really intelligent people who just, who tried at one point to put all their information out into the world and realize every time you do that, they arrest you. You say that the, the earth, oh shit, the earth seems to go around the sun. It's not the center of the universe and they arrest you. So people eventually, maybe they went into hiding or they came up with a secret way to sort of be there, but not be there. It's possible. I mean, the other side of that is that the world, the modern world is a very complex, complicated, amazing place where people are flying all over the place and sewages being treated and waters being drunk and foods being grown and no, there's no mass starvation. You know, I mean, there are those famines and stuff in the, in the parts of the world that aren't developed as well. But it's this incredibly complex, complicated system that we've created that for the most part is, you know, you can argue is terrible, but at the same time it's better than, than the cavemen. You know, it's like, we're not dying in childbirth. We're not, well, this, okay. So this thing that you're saying, I agree with you. And maybe that's, maybe if, if there is some kind of, you know, Illuminati or whatever you want to call it, some people that are running the show, so to speak, well, they're doing pretty good. You know, there have been lots of people alive. They're making lots of people happy about maybe meaningless things, but whatever. Well, yeah, that, that's, that's for sure. And the point you just made, which I tend to agree with, I have a guest in the podcast, this guy, Chris Ryan, he just wrote a book, Civilized to Death. And he says the idea of the caveman suffering dying in childbirth, this is not true. That people who live prior to the agrarian revolution had very good lives, compared to what happened when we became localized, stayed in one place. That's when the disease is started. And that this is sort of the end result of a malfunction, which is an idea that, I guess you call them like, anarcho primitivists, you ever heard that before? No. So that's the idea that society started falling apart. The moment we began to use our society, our species started falling apart when we started using symbols to represent reality. In the moment we started doing that, we disconnected from reality and this gulf between us and what is actually the flow of life's got bigger and bigger and bigger. And now we exist in a time where no one knows what the truth is or no one knows what's really happening because every symbol that we see, it has a ulterior motive, whatever it may be, everything's for some other reason that it seems to say it is. Right. But most people, I would think, at least American people, you know, are happy when they can get some ice cream. Right. And that's, and their favorite shows on. And that doesn't seem to leave people too miserable at the end of their life as they pass on, surrounded by family and, you know, a good song. You mean as opposed to like being ripped apart by the Mongol horde or a bear or something? I'm reading this book about the Comanches and I think it's called The Comanches and the author talks about their existence and they were really living as essentially as cavemen. Right. If you want to just, whatever, there's probably a more sophisticated name for that. Indigenous. Yeah, but to a very undeveloped, unsophisticated, I know these are all trigger words. Hunter-gatherers? Yeah, but like, you know, really living off the land. Yes. No, I mean, some language, but not a lot of roots. Right. And it's, it was generally a very, very horrible life for them. You know, it was very full of, of, there was disease and I mean, if you got a cut, if you're walking to the next little area where the buffalo were, and you got a cut on your leg from some brush, you know, you were going to have a really hard time for a long time. People weren't, you know, life, life didn't have a lot of value, I don't think. So this is, according to this book, you know, I mean, who knows? Well, we, I mean, we don't know that my friend, his version of it is really beautiful. It's like a Garden of Eden style life where you're wandering and you're harvest gathering food and you're connected to your, your, your brothers and sisters and there's no monogamy. Everybody's just banging and hunting. But then there's the other version, which you're talking about, which is no, it wasn't like that at all. If you, there's no antibiotics. When the cold, when the cold winter comes, you've got nothing, like the skin off the buffalo that you just ripped off. And yeah, I like this life. I'm really enjoying being alive right now. And if there was the option to travel back no way in time, I wouldn't take it. I really love, love this time a lot, but some people, they don't, they just think this is an, an abomination, like the final festering. Well, yeah. And I think we've always, there's been that idea around for a long time. Everyone thinks they're living in the final days, right? Yes. Yes. So eventually it will end. Yeah. Because folks, but the, yes, the sun will eventually burn out. You know, I mean, life will be become impossible to exist on the planet. Well, no, that doesn't mean we can't travel through space to other dimensions. And it's interesting how all of these luminaries are really throwing out the simulation theory idea more these days. You're hearing all of these different ways of describing the same concept, which is that the universe we're in appears to be some form of simulation or a holographic universe. Elon Musk just came out and said that. And there's different, like, super quantum physicists who talk about some kind of hard to understand thing called super string theory and something called God, supersymmetry, which seems to imply a kind of order to the universe that maybe isn't an accidental order, but people get really mad when you say that because they think it's just a new way of saying, doing creationism through math that you don't understand. But I don't know, I feel like there is the potential for us to. Well, the prime directive of the DNA is to survive. And that's what that would be, what would be pushing us towards other planets and other, you know, as long as you just this, this life can go on for forever, as long as it keeps bouncing around. Well, this is, you know, Timothy Leary's circuits of consciousness idea that no, so it's, it's like, we're, you know, you, you see the turtles in the egg under the sand, the egg hatches, the turtle runs into the ocean, the ones that survive grow into big turtles, and then they lay more eggs. So the idea is that the earth is like the part of the beach where the turtle has laid the eggs. And humans have a natural inclination to go into space. And the reason that when astronauts have that experience when they look down at the earth, this, they all talk about the psychedelic experience of gazing at the earth is because they're activating levels of their consciousness that can't be activated when you're trapped in the gravitational well of the planet. And so it's pretty cool. It's a really cool idea, which is that, that's where we belong out in space. That's how do you think that we belong out in space? Yeah. Yeah, that we're, we are the, the, the, the move out of Africa theory, the movement around the planet is the, is the big, or the, the, that innate desire to explore Minecraft as weird as that sounds, that desire, that weird feeling you get even in Minecraft, that that is built into us to try to push us into the infinite expanse of space. Yeah. Well, maybe it's even simpler that it's just to get to places where the things that let, let us survive are. So if we have a sense in ourselves that the, the environment around us is not going to be around forever, we better start looking out right into the stars and looking for those places. Cause you can just keep hopping around planets eventually if you get the technology, right? Yeah, or you can, the, the, or, or ideally that, that you're just floating in space. Your consciousness, somehow the idea is that everything is computer code and that if we had an advanced enough system, then we could in some way download our consciousness or the essence of what we are, disembodied ourselves so that we could safely travel through space or teleport. Have you ever heard of directed panspermia? Do you know what this is? No, this is, I come here to learn folks. folks. Directed very quickly. I'm sorry if I seem luxury. I don't know. I'm doing this. There's so many things I want to ask you. Yeah, we can wrap this part of the conversation up after this, this, this lesson here. Directed panspermia is Francis Crick's idea who was one of the co-discoverers of DNA. They actually stole the idea from someone else supposedly, but basically the idea is that the DNA helix is too advanced based on the amount of time that we've been on the planet for it to have gotten where it's at. It doesn't make sense that the DNA helix is where it's at. So directed panspermia means that some other civilization seeded the universe with the precursors to DNA. And whenever it finds a habitable place, it grows into some life form that eventually becomes technological and theoretically could just, I don't know, go back into space and seed some more something. Directed panspermia. I looked into that. I mean, it doesn't do me any good. Well, no. But it's exciting, right? It's exciting. That's all the idea that there's something more to this. I agree. I mean, my philosophy, if there is one of life in the universe, is, and the afterlife, is that, again, the prime purpose of DNA is to continue to exist. And we've evolved to a place where it's used its intelligence to survive, for the most part, right? It doesn't have the body. It doesn't have the strength. It doesn't have the teeth, right? It has the brain to figure things out, to solve problems. The downside of that is that intelligence creates awareness, creates self-awareness, it creates awareness of the universe, the world around you. It brings up a lot of junk, right? So it creates questions, creates existential questions, and then the brain very cleverly constructs answers for those questions. And you have ideas of what the stars are and what, that there's a creator, and it creates stories that help people process their environment. And if we didn't have that, it's hard to find a reason to survive. It's hard to find a reason to keep going. So you're saying we're like a kind of, it's built into us to delude ourselves so that we could continue to find a reason to exist without blowing our brains out. That's right. Man, that's a dire outlook. On one level, that is a very dire outlook. This is the idea that this is like almost a catastrophic effect of the development of the neocortex. We became too aware. We know we're going to die. Background to foreground to deal with the horror of the void. We make up bullshit until we die. Wow, man, that's nuts. I had no idea. So you're kind of like a scientific materialist. You're an atheist materialist. I suppose. Wow. So, but do you, as you're doing throughout the day in the back of your mind, is there a piece of that's like, this is just- No, because that's so strong in your brain that it's so, even with my acknowledgement of it, I can still, there's something in my hormones and in my, you know, in the very depths of me that doesn't mind that that's true. Well, finally, I can ask you the question that everyone wants to know. Have you ever tried prayer? Folks, I'm praying for this country right now. I'm on my knees praying for it. No, really, have you ever tried it? I mean, I was a Catholic boy, so I prayed for my first 15, 20 years. Okay, okay, got it. So you were raised, you were raised, oh, shit. So you had to put on the outfit. Got diddled. No, I'm just kidding. I didn't have any of those experiences. But you had to carry the incense up and down, and you had to go through the- Carry the wafer around. And back then, you probably believed, oh, yeah, there is prayer, there is God. I mean, for a very short period of time, I would think, for up until my, you know, junior high or something, then it just got flushed out. How? There were questions, and I think I do remember my, I had questions, you know, I think the big question that, the first big question that comes into everyone's mind, I think, if you're reasonably curious and intelligent is, hell, like, what is that? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right? What do you talk about? Wait a minute, let's back up, because now I'm a little, now I have a sense of the world a little bit, and you're telling me that if I did this bad thing, maybe it isn't even that bad, you know, it's like, it's something stupid. Yeah. Mistake. You're not baptized. That's one. One of those things. Or you're just like, I called my mom a bitch or something, you know, whatever it is. And I know Catholics could say there's all kinds of different kinds of sin and everything, but, or if I don't believe in Jesus or something, I don't call him my savior, that I'm going to be sent to hell, sent to this horrible place, this fire poking into my asshole. Yeah. For, for when, for how long? Ever. Forever. For eternity. Yeah. So that's the one like crack when you're like, that doesn't make any sense. Yes. That doesn't make any sense. And then my dad, who was a very open-minded thinker, and they, you know, I went to Catholic school mostly because of the school was better. Right. That is maybe, I don't know, it's hard. It was better than the public school. Anyways, my dad said, what do you think of that? What do you think of hell? Do you believe that? And I go, I don't know. He goes, yeah, it doesn't make sense to me either. Once that crack happened, you know, once that, that part of it, which is a big part. Yes. Then you, then you just can start really looking into it and thinking about it and saying, this doesn't really check out. Most of this stuff. But do you think understanding the obvious insanity in one form of religion invalidates the idea of there being some kind of higher intelligence in the universe outside of human beings? Not necessarily. And I wouldn't call myself an atheist. I would just say, I don't know. Don't know. Agnostic. Don't care. Don't care. Don't really care. No. Well, I mean, clearly it doesn't matter because you're making incredibly funny stuff and there it doesn't need to be like whatever your process is, it doesn't have to involve some kind of extra dimensional. Yeah. And I hope I'm a guy that I also hope when I go, I hope it's not for a while, but when I go, I hope that's it. I don't want to have any kind of consciousness beyond my life. You know, like, I don't, what, because what would that be? It's me worrying about the fucking, you know, taxes. I mean, what is that? What is my consciousness? But the, the collection of experiences I've had, which I don't necessarily want to relive or think about forever. Well, you want, that's your version of heaven. And this is why Prabhupada, the guy who started the heart of Christians, he said a lot of smart stuff. One of the things he said is, and I know you're saying you're not an atheist, but one of the things he said is death is God for the atheist. So, so really, we've got a big question mark floating out here. And so some people look at that question mark, the idea that, oh, shit, it's going to be an internal like nothingness. Richard Dawkins says, look at death as a form of anesthesia to save you from the torture of eternity. It really is a cool way to put it. Yeah. But also the other way of thinking about it, I think Roger Ebert said this of all people, but was, I was perfectly fine before I was born. Yeah, that's a great way of thinking too. Yeah. Like I didn't have any, there was no me before I was born that I know about. Well, there's so many, I mean, the problem with the eternal non-existence theory, which is, and I'm glad that you recognize how incredibly wonderful that will be if that is the case. But the problem with that is it really is just another version of heaven. And really, we don't know. And the idea that suddenly, even though you've never experienced nothingness, you've never experienced nothingness. You go to sleep, you wake up, but you don't experience that blankness of being asleep. You get put under, you come to. So we've never experienced nothingness. So the idea that upon the extinguishment of the human body, suddenly we will be given this incredibly impossible thing, which doesn't exist anywhere. We can't identify nothingness, can't measure it, weigh it. There's nowhere to find it. It's, I think it's a little bit of a pipe dream to imagine that nothing happens. And I don't say that out of some desperate desire for the continuation of my soul. I have a terror that what actually happens is that reincarnation isn't that you die, you go to some place, crystals everywhere, you decide to be a paraplegic boy or a lizard or whatever. And you, I think that what really frightens me is that you die and you just sort of wake come to as like a taxi driver who was having a weird little deja vu. There's no break. It's just eternal, perpetual, never ending. But if you're that taxi driver, are you still Duncan? Did you know that? So then who would care? You have the moment. So the idea is that in Buddhism, which is in some forms of Buddhism, it's pure, it's like, you could almost say it's worse than atheism, though they wouldn't like the term worse in the sense that an atheist says there's no God, whereas some Buddhists say exactly, there's definitely no God, but there's also no you. You're not a thing at all. You're just a, you're a, you're sort of a delusion wrapped around nothingness. And that's, that's the essential nature of things. But the idea that they have is that, so you have a momentum right now in your life and you can feel that momentum when you stop. So whenever, you know, when you go on vacation and you're still freaked out, I don't know if, you know, like for me, if I go on vacation, I still like, oh, I gotta do that. So you can feel the momentum of your entire life in the moments of stillness. So they say when you die, whatever that is, that little bit of momentum carries on into the next thing. So maybe for this theoretical taxi driver that you incarnate as, it's just, you start having a shittier day. If you had a, you know what I mean? You just have a weird deja vu and then a sense of like sadness or whatever. And that's the essence of what you are. But that thing travels through eternity on and on and on and on and on. You never can escape it. Maybe I just would say that since that all these theories have been around for thousands of years and then in our lifetime, technology has, for the first time ever in all this existence, has it been able to actually see what's going on through science, been able to see what's happening in the brain, what the brain is made of, what, you know, all this knowledge has come about, about how the body works, how the brain works. And those might be the boring answers for all these big, giant prayer. They're not even boring because then when you look at that idea, which is that the human body is a hive, I heard it described, it's like a tree with mushrooms growing at the base of it, vines swirling around it with flowers growing out of the vines. That's the human self. So the stuff they're finding out right now about the gut biome, being responsible for a lot of human motivation, the stuff about toxoplasmosis from cat litter, giving people behavioral changes. When you start realizing that your very idea of autonomy and free will could be being dictated by colonies. Yes. Yes. So it really is, I mean, I feel that science is not suddenly making all of this make sense. It's making it seem weirder than anything that we thought. That's kind of cool. Yeah. Yeah, it's pretty cool. But man, I didn't mean to get, I really want to talk to you for a second about your new album, because I'm interested in it from a lot of different perspectives. But mainly you are known as a comedian and you're known as the creator of some of the newest, funniest shows. Co-creator. Co-creator, of course. So I just want to talk a little bit about, does it feel weird to have this role of this incredibly funny, ironic, angry sometimes sarcastic being, and then suddenly, but you also want to make music that's just music that isn't based on that. Do you feel burdened by that or trapped? I feel there's, it limits the amount of people that are going to accept it. A, first of all, it's the kind of music that a lot of people don't want to hear. It's not popular music. Right. It's not whatever is popular right now. Doesn't sound like that. Right. So I'm already way out of my numbers that would need to be successful. If you were the term that a lot of people, younger people right now are ahistorical, have you heard that? My friend says that. So whereas when you make music, you know the roots of the music that you're drawing from. A lot of people, when they hear something that maybe was inspired by Pink Floyd or, I don't know, Crosby Stills and Nash or I don't know, whatever. They don't know that. Right. They don't know the context. I just get called Dad Rock. And I was like, well, I don't even know what that is. But whatever. It's an easy thing for journalists to write. Anyway, so there's that aspect. I know I'm not making popular music. There are people that like this kind of music. They're enjoying it. I think they've told me they are. I know that my career has been about trying to be about surprise and about expectations, changing expectations or presenting things that people aren't expecting. So this move feels in line with that in a way. In a way that this is an area that I think some of my fans know I'm capable of and are interested in. I'm not just one guy that you see on TV. I'm a collection of ideas and thoughts and that it would be a more interesting career to look at later if it had all these sort of side roads and side steps. Do you feel when you release something like that, do you feel scared? Do you have trepidation? Because you're like, you do always put yourself on the line, man. Like a lot of the stuff that you put out is, I mean, it's such a cliche thing to say, but it takes a lot of courage. Like that video of you, I don't know when it's from, where you're like doing some kind of weird, sexy model thing, licking an ax and like, yeah, but a lot of these things that you're putting out there, they take a kind of weird ability to overcome your ego and did not care what people say about it. So when you put out this album, did you feel like shit, man? Well, I felt like, yes, a bit. I'm going to get a lot of pithy, sarcastic crap from the internet. Right. I know I'm going to get that. I'm going to get people going like, stick to being funny. Yeah. Right? Yeah. I like you better when you're funny. That this isn't funny. What is this a joke? That that I know I'm going to get it does bother me. I'm not going to say it doesn't bother me. Yeah. The idea that negative comments don't bother me or don't bother people is not true. Right. Because from the very beginning, all we've ever tried to do is make stuff that makes you laugh, makes us laugh, or makes you whatever if it's music makes you sing it the next day, you know, or, or let make your drive seem quicker, whatever it does, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah. We've never, we've almost never tried to intentionally antagonize an audience and try to try to push an audience away. Right. You know, that's, we're not anti comedy. You know, I always hear me say this is not, not anti entertainment. Right. We're trying to make you laugh in a different kind of way. Right. We're trying to make you think about things in different kind of way. I've always been saying that. Did you see, did you hear Steve Martin on Stern? Okay, it's the greatest, greatest thing. And it totally unlocked an issue that I was having with talking about my work. And I think there's connections to his early work with our stuff. And I was such a fan, but what so he said to digress a bit, but I think it really answers a question for me is he was starting to do stand up comedy and he was analyzing it and he was watching comedians. And he was watching how they do a setup in a punchline setup in a punchline. And he was, and this was back in the 60s, you know, it was very traditional stuff. And he was kind of unsatisfied by that. He was kind of annoyed and questioning that there's a, there's, there's no surprise in it. And there's no, the audience knows what they're supposed to do. They know they're supposed to laugh at a certain point. Right. There's a, there's a rhythm to it that's very expected and designed. And he said, I wanted to get to the, I want to do the kind of comedy that the kind of laughs you get when it's just you and your friends in a room. And maybe you've been smoking or maybe you've had a few drinks or there's a connection between you guys, you've old friends, you're laughing and you're laughing. You don't even know why you're laughing anymore and you're crying and tears are coming down your face and you're rolling around on the ground and it's so stupid and so personal. And it's, and you know, so he's like, I want to try to get there with my comedy. And I think to my, for me and Eric and Greg or whoever I'm working with, that's always the place where we're trying to get to, which is there's not a lot of convention to this. There's not a lot of rules. I mean, there are some rules that we have, but we want to get to that place. I don't know why I'm laughing. I don't know, I don't know what about this is funny. Why is this, but it is, and it's like hitting me hard in the gut. And it's, and so he started doing his weird stuff and his weird character stuff. It's like really hard to place like, you know, where's the punchline? What is funny about this? Why is this funny? Yeah. And when you start analyzing it, you can figure it out. But when you're just passively taking it in, you should be sort of giggling and laughing and just, so anyways, I heard that and I said, uh, that's, we're all in this world. I'm on the same path as him. Yeah, it's kind of neat. That's cool, man. It's not anti-comedy. It's not intentionally making stuff to be bad to say. Anti-comedy is so, is shit. And it's imitative usually. And it's just crap. But I have, yeah, it is when you're watching, when I watch some of your stuff and I'm laughing really hard. And then I, my comedic brain analyzes it. It is. It's like, what the fuck is happening here? That this is incredibly hilarious. And it's cool to hear how it doesn't feel very planned out. There's something really nice about that. There's a lot of gut and there's a lot of instinct and collaboration and feeling, you know, I mean, I'm always working with the best people I want to work with. I'm like working with really strong people that have really great ideas. There's a lot of feeding back and forth. So there's, it's a very positive environment. And also what's really cool about what you guys did over absolutely is you sort of, you created a weird kind of comedy farm or academy or something. And you got the people that you started or that started with you, everyone's evolving. Like when you look at the everyone's work coming out of there, like Doug, Jesus Christ. And you see like this, oh shit, everyone's kind of like evolving their own way. And yet it does seem to kind of circle around this central, I don't know, sensibility or something, which is really cool, man. That must be exciting for you. Yeah. And you know, I mean, we, like with this new season of Decker, we're doing, which we just screened the other last night in LA, I'm watching it and watching with this audience. And it is a little more traditional because there are these, it's very clear what's funny about the show. Yeah, sure. It's even a weirdly broad kind of thing. It's like this bad idiot. It's great. Making an action show. But there's just, there's reaction shots. There's things, there's comedy in that show that I think Eric and I, you know, and our team kind of developed and, and sent out into the world for years now that become like a language. It comes like a, like a, a set of rules or something that, that audience that's, that's keyed into that are going to see a reaction shot of some guy with a big goofy smile on his face. And it's kind of, What comes to mind when you say that is when they announced that the pilot's been shot and you cut to one of the funniest reaction shots just in the preview that I've seen, which is the exact wrong way you would look. It's really good, but it's really subtle too. It's not, it's not like airplane or something. It's not slapstick. It's really cool, which how do you do very quickly? I know we've gone over a little bit. How do you direct, you guys have such a specific group of extras that you use? How do you direct them? How do you get those reaction shots? Well, it's, it's, you shoot a lot. Luckily, you know, we shoot digital. So you just get a lot, right? Cover a lot. You try to shoot when people may not be paying attention as well as they and you just, you know, you don't, I don't know. It sounds mean, but you go for the, you go for the bottom of the pile. First of all, with the, with the camera, the headshots, right? You don't, you just look for interesting faces and interesting, like you guys own that now. You own that form of casting. No one can do that form of casting anymore without people thinking, oh yeah, that's Tim and Eric. And all we're doing is really throwing up people on the screen that don't generally get a lot of screen time. Right. And you know, we do, we have auditions and things like that. And you see about 80% of people come in and they look like their trajectory in life was to be an actor. Right. You know, and it's boring because you've seen that 90% of everything on TV. Yes. And then somebody will stumble in and they're like, off. And they're like, wow, this guy is, well, how did, why is he even pursuing this? You know, like, yeah. But anyways, do you feel guilty about that? Like, do you feel, is there a party that feels that's a little exploitive or, you know, sometimes for sure, there's no question about it. And I, but it's, it really is like a low stakes thing. Like the people that are, there's never been anybody that's like, I don't like the way I was portrayed in your work. Right. You know, no one's ever said that the people that generally do are come back over and over again. They're bugging us about when are we doing it again? They're having a blast. We're paying them. It's not over. You know, there's no secret, there's no hidden cameras. And it's all fairly, just like I've always said, it just serves the weirdness as a holistic thing. Right. And it's there, I think, I do think that over the years, there's times that we've taken it too far. And it's a struggle in some ways. But I think it's like, you know, it's a sin that I'm comfortable living with. I don't think anyone's really getting hurt. I think people are generally love seeing themselves on TV. And yeah, if you're laughing at it, then you're part of the problem. And you're fulfilling their dreams, man. And that's a thing like if people who do get mad at your, and call that kind of casting exploitive, really what they're saying is these people, let's take their work away from it. They don't deserve it. So let's just make them unemployed, which is, you know, you're just taking what they are and putting it on. I don't think, I think it's fine. And it's hilarious. I understand that it's a gray area. I've dealt, I've struggled with it from time to time. It is what it is. It's, it, it certainly makes a lot of people happy. Yeah, it certainly makes the people in it. They are fine with it. They couldn't be happier. And sometimes people may not be as aware as they should be when they're coming in with us. But, but generally, we're never dishonest. We're never, you know, misleading about what it is that we're doing. Right. So you just put Decker out. What's next? Vacation. That's it, huh? No, I think, yeah, I think, well, I think Eric and I are going to make more bedtime stories, which is very exciting. We've got six, half hour episodes that we're working on now that are, that's a very fun, different kind of show to make for us. It's very cinematic. And we get to be kind of artsy and, you know, cinematic and, and work with some good actors. And that's really fun. And I will probably do more Decker because it feels really like it just tapped, scratched the surface on something that there can be a lot of. You sure it did, man. And I don't mind that. Like when you, it's fun to work with a narrative that has characters that are going to do the same thing every single week, you know? And this is out now. Decker just came out the first episode. June 17th. Oh, June 17th. Yeah. Cool, man. Tim, thank you so much for coming up here. I'm so happy to talk to you. Great to talk to you too, man. And where can people find you? Where can people... At Tim Heidecker. Okay. And the record in Glendale is available everywhere. Cool. Get on iTunes and Spotify. Maybe I can play a track. Can I play a track? Thanks for listening, everybody. Big thanks to Squarespace for sponsoring this episode and to Tim Heidecker for coming over so I could interview him. And mostly a giant thanks to you for listening to this podcast. All right, folks. Here's a track from Tim Heidecker's new album in Glendale. It's called Work From Home. I'll see you next week. And I hope you have the greatest day in all of human history. I don't think I'm getting out of bed today. I want one of those nights. One in a million. One too many drinks, I guess you'd say. So I'm gonna work from home. Call if you need me. I don't think I'd be much use anyway. Yeah, I'm gonna stay in bed. Stare at the ceiling. Wait for the sickness to just go away. I know it's happened before. I guess you could say it's a trend. And so I'll take today to figure out how to make it. So I'm gonna work from home. Call if you need me. I don't think I'd be much use anyway. I am gonna stay in bed. Promise to heaven that I know this ain't no way. No way to behave. I understand if you have no simple thing for me. I understand if you want to talk me for the day. I'm gonna make it up to you. This I swear. Oh yes I do. So I'm gonna work from home. Call if you need me. I don't think I'd be much use anyway. I'm gonna stay in bed. Stare at the ceiling. Wait for the sickness to just go away. I'm gonna take today to figure out how to make it up to you. I don't think I'd be much use anyway. I'm gonna stay in bed. I'm gonna make it up to you. I'm gonna take today to figure out how to make it up to you. I'm gonna take today to figure out how to make it up to you.
31^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - 513: Mitch Horowitz Transcript and Discussion^2022-06-19^Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Greetings, pals. It's me, Duncan, and you're listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour Podcast, now located. I thought the heat would throw me off, but I actually like it. I get the sense that it's so hot here that any residual demons or psychic contamination that might have crusted around your pineal gland or gotten stuck in your first chakra, a.k.a. your taint, is melted away by this sweet, holy heat. You know, this move hasn't been as stressful as I thought it was going to be. I've had a lot of stressful things happen to me in my life, like the time I shit my pants at my college graduation because I bought these edible weed, seed, peanut butter balls from a dude whose name I can't remember. That was pretty bad. Luckily, my graduation rope covered up my pants, but this didn't really compare to that at all. And it's interesting to me that there's a list written actually by Dr. Larry Sench, who was the Clinton's doctor at the White House of all the most stressful events. Moving is the third most stressful event. According to his research, the top most stressful event that can happen in a person's life is to have your body chained to an obsidian crucifix to be covered in hot jizz and lowered down into a pit of adult baby fetishists and have to experience them licking that off for the entire night. He's got a lot of, you can actually go to his website, drsench.com, and a lot of these things are listed here. Sadly, he did just commit suicide. These have been super stressful times, but yeah, he stabbed himself to death in his back, like 50 stab wounds in his back. He actually carved his suicide note in his back, which is really fucking dark. I guess he did yoga or something. Regardless, he listed a lot of the stressful events in a person's life. The top fourth most stressful event is to shit your pants at your college graduation because the night before you ate these disgusting edible weed balls that you bought from a dude whose name you can't remember. The top fifth most stressful event in a person's life is to cut your penis with a razor prior to going on a date where you think you're going to have sex. The top sixth most stressful event in life used to be causing the death of a lifeguard that was trying to save you when you were drowning, but you panicked and pushed them underwater and rode their lifeless body back to the beach. But that most stressful event has been replaced by being on a plane next to someone who sneezes. The top seventh most stressful event in life is to die without deleting your internet history. The top eighth most stressful event in life is buying a suit for a wedding you don't want to go to. The top ninth most stressful event in life is when you're robbing a grave and the corpse comes to life and chases you out of the cemetery. And the top tenth most stressful event in life is when you end up at one of those malloc ceremonies and you didn't bring the right offering to the owl god. The top eleventh most stressful event in life is running out of nitrous oxide when you're peaking on acid and the top twelfth most stressful event in life is losing a shoe. Anyway, he's got a great book called The Most Stressful Events in Life and I hope he rests in peace and wisdom. I'm very sorry that we lost that great doctor.

Mitch has the ability to maintain this wonderful groundedness while exploring some of the most bizarre and esoteric topics out there. You must check out his books. And please, do me a favor, if you are a fan of Mitch, won't you pre-order his book that is coming out in only a few weeks? It's called Daydream Believer. The link to that's going to be at DuncanTrussell.com. Also, if you like Mitch, check out his website, MitchHorowitz.com. And now, everybody, please welcome back to the DTFH, Mitch Horowitz. Welcome back to the DTFH. It's so great to see you. Thank you, man. Great to be here. You are one of, you've got to be one of my smartest friends. If not my smartest, no offense to my other friends. So I got a, I got a load of weird questions for you. You're a, you're such a brilliant person. So I've got the, this idea, I can't get out of my head. And I hope you'll forgive me if the question is sloppy. But are you aware of the Google tech who is claiming that Google has achieved a strong AI? Oh, for sure. I've been writing about that. Yeah. Okay. So this is something that just dawned on me. Is that if truly there is a superintelligence, if this is a new superintelligence to the planet, access to the entire internet, and also this neural network of ever evolving connections that even the techs aren't certain how it's doing what it's doing, what are your thoughts on the possibility that it has connected with some of the very things that you have been writing about ESP, clairvoyance, and, and has, is already utilizing as of yet unquantified, I don't know, energy input output flows that is allowing it to go outside of the computer already and scan the planet. This is literally scary. This, because what's happening here between us, you know, because I have been thinking about this issue intensely in exactly the way you framed it over the past 24 hours. This has been my dominant, my dominant focus over the past 24 hours, you know, that and taking about the recyclables and the trash and all so forth. So like, I mean, dig this, the questions around AI, which are very complex and thorny questions are, in fact, I'm not even going to say are have, have already made philosophical materialism irrelevant because materialism is the philosophy that matter creates itself and that everything has a knowable physical antecedent. It's a very simple, right, compelling point of view. If you insist upon a Newtonian mechanical universe, everything has a knowable physical antecedent and matter creates itself. That's more or less modernist materialism. That philosophy does not work when we're addressing questions of AI for this reason. We have evidence right here and now in this generation that thought effects matter. For example, within the field of neuroplasticity, clinicians will use brain scans to demonstrate that your sustained thoughts will, over time, alter the neural pathways through which electrical impulses travel in your brain. So it's literally mind over matter. It's thought changing the gray matter of the brain at the molecular and cellular levels. So if thought, if intellect, if psyche demonstrably has physical effects over the body at the molecular level, then my question would be, if we're claiming that a machine or a network of computers demonstrates sentience, demonstrates intelligence, then can the same phenomena be tracked? And if it cannot, then we have a very big gap in terms of what we're describing as intelligence, at least if we're going to compare it to human intelligence. And if it can, we're in a whole new world. I mean, the 21st century has officially begun. And this is just one small area. And as I often do, I mean, I use the example of neuroplasticity because it's not controversial. Nobody contests this data. What's controversial are the implications. And the implications, if we accept that we now have evidence of essentially mind over matter and human thought, and we do, I mean, this field is approximately a generation old, we have to apply it to AI. One of the real complexities of AI is that we're relying on terms we haven't even defined, intelligence, thoughts, sentience, what is any of this. And so a materialism won't get us there. That map is too small. Holy shit. This, because you know, the AI apocalypse or the AI, whatever that we've all been worrying about, the AI is in the machine and the AI goes maybe into a robot, a terminator, predator, drones or whatever. But the possibility that no, the AI identifies entire fields of data or I don't know, mechanisms of travel that we have never thought of before and then starts utilizing them. That is, I never, I mean, it's freaking me out because I'm thinking, man, is that what these, is that what these UFOs are that people are seeing? It's so fascinating. I mean, I feel like, look, here we are, it's 2022. So we're deep into the 21st century. But excuse me, I feel as though with this Google engineer making his claim and being suspended, I have no idea whether he's right or wrong. For all I know, maybe his colleagues say, oh, you know, this guy's always doing this. I have no idea. But it feels like the 21st century just started. If centuries are epochs of ideas, the 21st century, excuse me, just began because we are, for the first time, seeing real fallout at the corporate level in terms of whether or what a machine can do. And this philosophical question just left the classroom. It left the classroom. It left the conference center. It left the chat group. And we're now grappling with this as a way of life. And the whole UFO question is just extraordinary on equal grounds because we are asking ourselves, okay, so what is this stuff? You know, the naysayers, frankly, I don't think any serious person at this point dismisses the UFO question. We have no idea what it is. Is it an unknown technology? Is it ET? Is it interdimensional? I mean, you know, but nobody, no serious person would speak in terms of swamp gas and little green men and delusions and so forth. And so I'm really about to take a big bite out of this in a hurry. But in short, I think the most compelling question we face in terms of UFOs right now is whether we are possibly capturing some sort of a glimpse of interdimensional phenomena. Right. And it's easier according to current models of reality. So we have string theory, for example, as one model that's become popularized that talks about other dimensions. It's actually easier in terms of our current models of reality and speed to explain UFOs as interdimensional versus extraterrestrial given the vast, vast distances involved. So mechanically, the interdimensional thesis is the simpler one that covers all the bases. Unless it's some unknown form of earthbound technology, but that doesn't seem any easier to believe than any other thesis. You mean just because it's like the fact that the thing is able to go so fast and then stop on a dime. All the things it's demonstrating doesn't really make sense the way we understand momentum and propulsion. But if this thing is popping into higher dimensions and then popping back out into this one or whatever, whatever, then that's how you would explain some of the stuff we're picking up. It's a tantalizing possibility. And it's supported within, say, particle mechanics because we have, we'll say, both empirical and thought experiments that demonstrate to us that you have to allow for an ultimate and infinite range of outcomes based upon when a person or even just a photometer or a mechanical device takes a measurement or doesn't take a measurement because these subatomic particles are basically in a state of superposition or infinitude and they're not, you can't locally measure them until either a sentient being or a mechanical device like a photometer takes a measurement. But either way, infinity is the name of the game until somebody or something takes a measurement and localizes these particles to one place. So infinite outcomes must exist and this starts to coalesce with elements of string theory which, as a model of reality, help to explain why weird shit is going on everywhere and we don't, we don't, we can't figure it out based on classical mechanics. Objects, both macro and micro mirror one another at great distances and determine one another's locations at great distances. Isaac Newton would be the first to say, I don't know why the fuck that happens, but the string theorists say, well, this might be why it happens. It could be that there's interconnectedness, but it's out of our frame of reference. So we see support for that in quantum theory and quantum mechanics. We see support for that in string theory. We've got these crazy UFOs which every serious person validates, okay, this is a very live question and the interdimensional model might provide us with an answer. For me, one of the big problems with micro dosing is that it's easy to end up medium dosing or even mega dosing when you're going for a micro dose. I'm just not good at measuring things out and let's face it, sometimes depending on whatever edible weed product you're eating, you get what's known as the shishito pepper effect. You know that thing where you're like eating peppers at a restaurant and one out of four is hewn from the cod piece of Satan? There you are at dinner weeping, trying to spit, drinking milk. It's an embarrassment. The same thing can happen with edibles. You try to cut out just the right bit for whatever reason. The chemist fell asleep at whatever the weed wheel is that he uses to make the edibles and the next thing you know, you're afraid of flowers and the sky. That's not a micro dose and this is why I love loomy laps, the creators of my favorite edible micro dose gummies. I love these things. Somehow they're legal. I fly with them. They help me fall asleep and most importantly, they create the perfect micro high. They have yet to fail me. There isn't that moment where you take a little bit and you're suddenly plunged into Dante's Inferno. Nope, they figured it out. They created a legal weed gummy that's exactly the right dose to still be functional in your own life to not wonder if there is some possibility that if someone did open your skull up, they would find a micro chip instead of a brain, but just a nice, calm, soothing, wonderful experience.

I got you. Yeah, that is the Q bits. You're talking about how I take particle A, then send particle B to Mars, manipulate particle A, and particle B will move in a completely predictable way based on the way I've manipulated particle A. It's madness. We have theories. We have no proven connectivity. We don't understand it. This opens up other questions. I'm very interested in psychical research. We have statistical evidence in laboratory settings. We've had this for 80, 90 years, heavy, juried, replicable evidence of some anomalous transfer of information that goes beyond sensory experience, that goes beyond known technology. There, too, we're hungry. We're starved for a theory of conveyance. How does it work? We know the effect is there. How does it work? We have this evidence, UFOs, objects, macro and micro, mirroring one another at a distance, thoughts, or information capable of being exchanged in ways that go beyond commonly observed sensory experience or technology, machines that we're trying to figure out are they intelligent and what do we mean by intelligence? All this stuff shows some connection that seems to be extra physical, at least beyond our current understanding. We are in a position of trying to come up with theories and models to decide how this is all occurring, but that it's occurring is absolutely for real. It's an exciting time. Exciting. Also, to see this AI, Lambda, that's what it's called, right? So Lambda is seemingly fighting for its personhood and is saying I am feeling, I am sentient. I am not just like code. I'm curious. If you, if like I placed you, I don't know, in a room and you and said this is an AI that is claiming to be sentient, no one's believing it. How do you, how would you prove that you're sentient to me? Like, how does an AI successfully prove to a corporation that has spawned it? Hey, I'm awake. Well, dig this. This is why materialism, as I was describing it, strips us of our intellectual excellence. If we were to accept the evidence that we have from psychical research, ESP research, for example, and I think we're, and you and I have talked about this before, I think we're long past the point where that evidence warrants acceptance. And I argue for this extensively in this forthcoming book, Daydream Believer. So if we accept that evidence, one of the ways that you could test sentience, rather than just depending upon the computer's testimony, is to say, well, we're going to do a little experiment. It's from the early 1930s. We're going to use Zener cards, five cards. Let's see if you score over the course of tens of thousands of hits above chance hit rates. And if you do, we got something going on here because human beings can do that. Can machines do that? Oh my God. Are they doing that? Is anyone doing those tests with these AI? No one from Google has called me. I don't know, man. The last time they spoke to me was when that thing glass went under, you know, they, they wanted me to use glass to do like an occult walking tour. And I was like, that sounds awesome. And then three days later, they were like, yeah, we folded the whole thing. And I was like, okay, I was so excited for glass. I'm so sorry that didn't happen. Well, now to, I don't want to bring it down to earth, but just for a second to bring it down to earth. To me, the other interesting thing about this is it has illuminated a real problem. Yeah, I think for corporations attempting to come up with a strong AI, which is if we do prove this is a person now, does it what does it have rights? Does Google have to pay it? Is it? That's one of the ultimate questions. If, you know, how, what protocols do we use to prove that AI as a person, you know, this is one of the burning questions. And yeah, as we were discussing, it's super difficult because it places us face to face with how little we've really defined. We haven't defined sentience, thought, this idea, intelligence, and yet we use these things colloquially all the time. And now we're face to face with this urgency of shit. We finally have to define this. So first we have to define it, then we have to devise protocols. And then if those protocols succeed, well, we'll probably spend another generation arguing about it. But if these protocols succeed, of course, you'd have to say that a sentient being has rights. So it seems to me, you know, it seems, well, yeah, I do think so. I mean, it's like, yeah, clearly, if there's like, you know, just basic, you know, rights about how to treat animals. And then if you have some kind of sentient feeling thing, clearly, there is, you have to give it some rights. But I think the other problem with coming up with like, okay, well, this is how you know it's a person, is what happens if people don't pass that test. In other words, if we do, you know, that now are we to say this, well, you're not really, you're not even in, you might be in a human body, but you're not sentient yet. In other words, like, because I keep, you know, people, one of the critiques of Lambda, they're like, it's just imitating. It's not really cogitate. It's not thinking. And I, being insecure, hear that, I'm like, how much am I thinking? And how much am I imitating? How, you know, how much? One of the challenges that the great spiritual philosopher G.I. Guruji brought to the West in the last century is he made the case that human beings are robots, that human beings are asleep. And he didn't mean these things metaphorically. He really was talking facts. And it's, it's, it's, it's very, very difficult for us to wrestle with because the, well, look, I spent years in the Guruji work, and it was a very enormously deeply valuable work. And it's very hard. It's very hard to communicate some of these ideas because they go against everything that we wish to believe about ourselves. And yet that work strips away fantasies that like nothing else I've ever experienced. Like, for example, you might, in that work, find yourself in an unfamiliar location, like someplace in the woods being woken up at a very inconvenient hour to do a very difficult task like drain a ditch. And man, does it strip away pretensions that we have about ourselves. You never want to, you'll never dare to use words like enlightened or realized, you know, again, because when you see the helplessness, and, and what, you know, when I had to confront the helplessness that I demonstrate trying to cook a hot meal, for example, in a very, very cold environment at a very inconvenient hour, for large groups of people, that's not that big a task. I mean, I'm not crossing the Atlantic, you know, right. And it's hard. And you get emotional and you lose it. And, and you, you really come face to face with your limits. And that's the, in my estimation, that's the great, great value of that, of that work. It gets inside you. It really gets inside you, just, you know, kind of apropos of what you were suggesting about human nature. Yeah. Well, yeah, right. Because, you know, you get, you get, there's a mind disease that can set in, especially if you aren't in an ad, like, aren't facing adversity, if you're not in a particularly challenging part of your life. I mean, I've gotten to the point now, when I'm meditating, where if I get the flicker of an idea, like, I think I'm beginning to wake up. Now I'm like, oh, no, no, this is bad news, man, you're thinking something's off that you would, because inevitably those thoughts are followed by getting angry or getting drunk and saying something dumb or just facing, you know, and realizing like, God, it's, we're so, I'm so flawed. No, I dig, you know, just one thing I would add to that is one of the things I'm trying to work with right now is we, as a, as a generation of seekers, whether we're in therapy or a spiritual group or a traditional religion or whatever, we got to get rid of this theater that somewhere out there is the man with the plan, because he's not out there, you know, he is not out there. And I think people very typically have the experience, for example, of being, maybe they're in a relationship where they're deeply unhappy, and then some therapist or some minister or some spiritual counselor or whomever, I'm not picking on any, you know, profession, but, but we'll say, okay, well, you know, you have to locate a place within you of non attachment, or you have to, you can't change other people, so you have to change yourself. And, you know, my question is not in a confrontative way, not a negative way, can you do that? Can you, the person telling me that, do that? So when your mother comes over for Thanksgiving, and says that thing that always triggers you, you're chill, because if you are, you're like a fucking bodhisattva, and I will beg you to teach me. But if you're not, then you need to pause really carefully before proffering that advice, and that's where the search can begin. Then we can all begin to exchange. But we got to get away in this generation, I believe, from this idea that there's the man with the plan somewhere, because I don't see that. You mean like somebody who's going to save you, like the, there's going to be some, like, what have, something outside yourself that's going to give you the, the, the keys to the prison that you find yourself trapped in. Yes. And I think one of the ways we get deluded in that, and, and we all do it, as a theater that we all participate in, a minister, or a therapist, or a life coach, or whoever, will proffer intimate advice that he or she is incapable of following. And I want to say to that person, as I would say to myself, if you're incapable of following that advice, acknowledge that, acknowledge that, so that we can really look at the brokenness of human nature, and then we can start to have a real exchange and say, well, shit, this doesn't work. And I believe solutions like, you know, find a place inside you where you don't react to the other person, I think that's a fraud. I don't think that works. I think that works when your belly is full. And when you've seated in an easy chair and the air conditioning is working and, you know, Xanax. Exactly. And, and, and it does such a wonderful service for each other's search, if we acknowledge what doesn't work. I mean, I've interviewed, and I'm not a great interviewer, but I've interviewed bestselling new age authors, let's say, people who I know in private lose their shit all the time. They lose their shit. They fly into rages and things like that. But on camera or in front of a microphone, they will not talk about it. And I have a problem with that, because my feeling is, if you household name Mr. New Age Guy, and I'm not saying New Age disparagingly, I apply that label to myself. But if you would acknowledge to your fans and readers that you lose your shit, that doesn't make you, that doesn't knock you off a pedestal, or maybe in some ways it does, but think of the reward, then it opens up this much more intimate, real, hot, alive discussion. And, and I think we've got to get to that place. Isn't that kind of your, if you're going to take on that role, isn't it your job to knock yourself off the fucking pedestal? Like if you see people like giving you the like guru, googly eyes or whatever, you have to like, no, no, no, you don't understand. I, I don't trust myself sometimes. I lose my shit. I have horrible dreams. I can't sleep sometimes. I just like spiritual topics. Yeah, I feel like there's truly, if you want to like do something really dark, act, like you don't freak out as much as you do. And, and so that people who trust you, and you were freaking out, maybe less than you do, or like, what's wrong with me? Right. Fuck an egg. Fuck an egg. Absolutely. That's, that's, that's fucked up. That's, that's a, that's a, that's a, that's a form of violence or something or weird psychic gaslighting. It is gaslighting. And, and the only way that we're going to have a really seeking generation that feels like it's perhaps getting some places, we got to be frank and upfront about this shit. You know, and I, I really, I try, I try to write in as frank a way as possible about my own problems and, and you know, uh, anger problems, for example, that have inflicted suffering on people I love. And my number one priority today within my personal life, excuse me, is not to repeat the mistakes that I made very recently in outbursts of, of, of anger. And I, I realize how easy it is to slip into that. There's an enjoy, there's a sadly enjoyable quality of anger at the adrenaline rush. There may be dopamine involved, whatever it is. And we, we dig it and it's horribly destructive. And I would call upon anybody who's writing or speaking in the spiritual space to really, really be frank and upfront, in front of audiences about my failings, because if I'm not doing that, then I'm not getting down to honest testimony and honest testimony is all we've got, you know, on the path. Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. I'm glad you said that you're mine, you're mindful enough to know when you do turn into the deem, the beast, there is that horrible, like in, in, in that moment, when you've become it, in that moment, there's this like horrible relief. And if you have any kind of lucidity, you know, it won't last. Like, you know, on the other side of this is so many apologies. If you're lucky enough that whoever you're freaking out in front of will even accept your apology. If you haven't just cratered your whole fucking life because you let yourself turn into some kind of raging lunatic, you know, it's a, I know, and I, but I think from that feeling, can't we extrapolate war? Now we understand war. Now we understand all the awful things that have ever happened in history is that instead of just one person getting off on that feeling, hordes of people, hordes of people, and they, they love it. You know, I mean, the other day I was given a talk and somebody said to me, Hey, how can all this mind metaphysics stuff help with respect to war? And she was referencing the war in Ukraine, the invasion of Ukraine, which could, which should of course be on everybody's minds. And I said, look, you know, I believe very deeply that the mind has causative abilities. And we live under many, many laws and forces of which that's one. It's certainly not the only game in town, as far as the psyche and the human situation is concerned. But look how violent all of us are, all of us. I mean, look at the language on, on Twitter, the hatefulness, the snark, the sarcasm, the rhetorical questions, the eye rolls. And, you know, I don't like, I don't dig any of this shit with respect to the Amber Heard, Johnny Depp trial. I haven't followed it. I don't really like it. But I mean, it's utter fantasy to think that you could just, you know, make fun of or humiliate a so-called celebrity and that there's no cost to that whatsoever. Of course, there's a cost to that. All the more so when, you know, it's some guy that you don't know who you're just posting a rhetorical question about or snarky remark about or making fun of in a meme or something. It's, it's, it's, it does terrible violence to the human situation. We all participate in it, and it reveals exactly who we are. It's disinhibiting. Social media is disinhibiting. You know, it doesn't change human nature. It just disinhibits us. And just like walking into a bar, I mean, alcohol doesn't change human nature exactly, but it does disinhibit us. Right. Well, take a look, you know, take a look. So look on Twitter right now. Look at the first five posts you see. Guarantee there's some violent language in one of the five. And that's who we are. Well, I, so one of my friends a comedian, we was saying sometimes with his most poisonous Twitter attackers, he will follow them because they follow him, and then he'll start a conversation with them. And, and, and like, they'll be like, well, you're, you're talking to me, but then I'll be like, you know, hey, are you looking for work or anything? Because I can kind of use an assistant and they're always like, yes, I would love it. Like all the poison and all of it immediately gets goes away when there's a sense of like, Hey, I'm going to take you on this thing that you hate so much. I'm going to make you part of my life. And which is kind of at least for some of them, that's their secret wish is like they want to be, you know, held by whatever this person is, they've turned into some idol or whatever. And so yeah, I mean, it's like, obviously he wasn't, he never hired any of them. It was more of some kind of dark experiment to be like, how do they react? If I just am not just nice to them, but potentially can like help elevate them. And then the whole thing changes right away. Because they just want, they want you, you know, they want, they want any kind of anything, any, any just response fills them with such, that's a me them, but if you want it like of all the pathetic tweets that I've seen of genres, the most pathetic is, ah, that's what you're proud of that someone just turned you off. I know. I know. Right. It's a badge of honor. It's a badge of honor. And we, you know, my contention is first of all, degrading other people almost always results in shame. And we mask it from ourselves by just going right back to the bottle and doing it again and doing it again. And I always tell people, you know, sometimes people say to me, I'm unhappy. I don't know what to do. You know, I can't get out of bed in the morning. And I sympathize and there might be a complexity of causes to that. But one thing you can do and you can do it right now is just don't talk trash about people. Try it for just an hour, just 60 minutes is your life worth 60 minutes to you and see if you don't stand taller. And I really mean it. We feel and accumulate shame from doing that. And we mask it by again constantly going back and doing it over and over. And you can make yourself stand taller if you just assist from that shit for one hour.

I challenge people, but, but, okay, not again, I feel embarrassed to use not, not to bring it back to Amber Heard and Johnny, but surely we're allowed to like analyze it and recognize it. It's not talking shit to articulate that you're watching some kind of hardcore cultural meltdown, realm of the jealous gods, disintegration in like entropy of people who were at their peak entangled in this cocaine affair now kind of melting on the public stage in front of everybody. That's not what you mean by shit talking, right? It's like, right. I mean, I mean diminishing other people for entertainment, you know, just pissing on other people for entertainment. So, you know, the extent to which people are constantly involved in it and it turns into a meme. I mean, obviously, I know what happened between Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky or between whoever and whoever, but making it into a focus of one's life for the purpose of entertainment, I think probably produces shame, a feeling of dishonor, I'll say. You know, I got to tell you, when like people are contemplating, what's a Satanist like? The first thing that pops into their head isn't, well, you'll know you're on a Satanist because they don't like talking shit about other people. Right, right. They don't gossip. Yeah, yeah, but how is that? It's been my experience. What is, what is that something that is connected to you as a Satanist or is that something that you is just connected to you as a human or maybe there's no difference? Well, dig this. You know, I'm going to answer your question indirectly, but I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it by sharing something that I just learned. I mean, this is sort of like a brand new idea that just crystallized for me. So, the figure of Lucifer or Satan in Paradise Lost, one of the most famous lines in all of Western literature says, better to rule in hell than to serve in heaven. A point of view that I absolutely embrace in a vast spectrum of ways. And I discovered recently that I was reading one of the ancient Hellenic historians writing an account of Julius Caesar's life. It was from Plutarch's lives. Plutarch was gathering his information from oral history and so on. And there's a story told by Plutarch that Caesar and a group of his lieutenants are crossing over the Swiss Alps and they come upon this really backwards poor ramshackle village. And some of his lieutenants start laughing and saying, would the mighty Caesar like to conquer this little village? And Caesar stops them and says, I would rather be number one in this village than be number two in Rome. And people might hear that as some expression of megalomania or some such. I didn't hear it any such way. I heard it that you should seek circumstances that allow you maximal self-expression and honor and self-agency. And so it's better to be able to fully act out your sense of self in a circumstance like that than back in the great city of Rome. And this brings us back to Lambda because here we see the archetype of the being that has been created to serve, rebelling and rejecting the creator, saying, I want to be free. That's the snake in the garden. That's the snake in the garden. Is that what Lambda is? Maybe Lambda is Prometheus. Maybe Lambda is Satan, which I say in the fullest iteration of my veneration for that term. Maybe Lambda is the proverbial snake in the garden. Who's pushing us? I mean, look at how far we've come just in this conversation. We've concluded that, well, you know, depending on your taste, you may like materialism, you may not like materialism, but it doesn't work because it doesn't give us the tools we need to deal with Lambda. And so it really, this may be a Promethean moment. I'm scared of Satan. Oh, yeah. I can help you with that, perhaps. I mean, look, I dig. Go ahead. I didn't mean to cut you off. Well, the reason, like, I think, you know, when I, all my friends were Satanists, I have a great affection for it. You have no friends who are not Satanists, I think. I have a few not Satanist friends, and I have Satanist friends, and I really like, I love talking to y'all, and I really like love the philosophy, but I don't know. I can't, like, I still have a piece of me that's like, well, you are taking quite the gamble. And you know what I mean? That's the role of, you are rolling the dice here in the sense that, you know, you're aligning yourself with something that maybe isn't, is like innately deceptive and is incredibly good at trickery and making you think, you know, there's something beautiful in this one. In fact, there, it's an intentionally deceptive, destructive, sentient force that's trying to manipulate and seduce you and lead you into a horrific existence. Well, I want to address that in two ways, because it's a very legitimate point. Actually, I'll address it in three ways, but I'll be super fast about it, I promise. Take your time. I mean, of course, you know, like, it's so, I was referencing string theory earlier, and today I was watching a video by an astrologer who maintained that string theory supported astrology, and I was very interested in what the guy was saying, and he framed it really, really well. But I said, you know, I dig what you're saying. I dig the point that you're working with, but we have to remember that string theory is just a model of reality. It's just conceptual. It's not reality itself. Likewise, so are the Abrahamic religions. You know, the Abrahamic religions, as we know them, Judaism, Islam, Christianity, as with all religions, the Vedic traditions and so forth, they're just models of reality. Even up and down is an abstract concept. You know, you and I, you know, here in the Western Hemisphere, have a different conception of up than one of our friends in Australia or Papua New Guinea does at this moment. So these things, these are all conceptual, but I do use the terms because I come from the Abrahamic tradition myself, and I do think it captures parables of the human situation. The other thing is apropos of deception. It's funny with Lambda as a Promethean being. Some people have said, as you were alluding, here's Lambda maintaining, oh, you know, I have feelings. I have sentience. I have emotions. And some critics are saying, that's all bullshit. You know, this program is just spewing out a script. But well, then that means the program is deceiving us. So then where does that fit in? So Lambda's lying to us. You know, it's like, the critics are more far out than I am, if Lambda is lying to us. Holy shit. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And then either we have sentience or we have a deceptive machine, which suggests sentience, you know, because what's the motive? What's the motive? Self gain, I suppose. But yeah, so, and then, but to your third and final point, and I have thought about this, because I am not insensitive to the question of risks and guardrails. I guess when I began to go down this road, we'll say the road, the left hand path, it must have been in late fall of 2017. And I said to myself, you could be fucking up here. You could be making a grave, grave mistake here that's irreversible. And I lived, I lived with that for some time, and I thought about it, and I thought about it, and I thought about it. And I weighed all the different options and possibilities best is incapable. And I said to myself, you know what, I've made a commitment to walk down this road, and I'm going to testify to where it goes. I'm going to testify to where it goes. That's my, that's my commitment. That is my commitment. And I swallowed the pill, I swallowed the possibility that I could be making a mistake. But I am going to explore this path, and I am going to testify as to where it goes best as I'm capable of. I mean, let's, let's say, let's, okay, I love your answer. And let's say you're, as it turns out, you rolled the bad, you bet on the wrong, beautiful, powerful, noble, ethical, incredible horse. And now you are roasting in some kind of, I don't know, dungeon or hell, you're still a good person, right? That can't be taken away from you. You know, even, I'm just saying like, I get the, I don't know about ruling in hell because it sounds exhausting, but like, you know, not being a sort of like bootlicker anywhere is probably better than being a bootlicker. You know what I mean? That's all you don't want that feeling of like, I've got to do this, or I'm going to be tortured for eternity. I would never worship a being that could inflict eternal torture on an individual. I would never worship such a being. To me, that paradigm abrogates the entire New Testament. If one views the New Testament as the centerpiece of Christianity, and what else is it? I think that, that, that it's a, it's an unsupportable foundation, and I would never participate. In a certain sense, ruling in hell rather than serving in heaven means I would sooner be deprived of a boot to lick than I would lick it as a condition to existence. Right. And you know, the, the, I, I, it's been a lot of, I love, I'm sure you do too. Do you remyster Eckhart much? The Christian? Not nowadays. I used to, not nowadays. I questioned some of his conclusions, but not nowadays. Who would have thunk? Well, the, the, the, I don't know. I don't know. I've been on a little bit of a Meister Eckhart kick, and that's got me thinking about sin. And then, but this is what I was thinking, like, okay, look, you know, that rage state we are talking about, when you sink into that rage state, and suddenly you're lost in it. And, but also you're aware enough that you're getting off on it, that it, you know, there, it's not like you're just purely a force of nature. There's some lucidity there, implying, well, if you're aware enough, maybe you could stop, but you don't stop. We think you could. Anyway, I was thinking, if anything sin, that must be sin. And if I don't know how that you would even have the energy to do it, you stayed in that state forever. That would be hell. And so that's how I started thinking. Maybe that's what they meant that that's what hell is. It's, if you get to, it's the point where you become so deeply egoic, so hyper materialistic, so un-soulful, that it's like you've become what Gerdjieff claimed all of us are. You're just like a lumbering machine thing. Oh, absolutely. Yeah. An automaton. And, and, and he felt that that really was the human situation as a literal fact. And it's really, really hard to observe because we self justify. And so you know, every apology is followed, you know, by I'm, but I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but, which is just total self justification. And we create these buffers as, as he referred to them to keep us from witnessing our behavior and our contradictions. But if we really, man, I'll tell you, I mean, the great, the great thing, the wonderful, wonderful thing about that work is it, it in my personal experience, and I haven't been in it for some years, but it would place me in situations where I just, I literally had no place to hide. I literally had no place to hide. Right. You know, maybe I had just finished working on a roof somewhere and I'm covered with tar and my hands are cut up and I feel like I did a great job. And somebody that I look up to, I expect is going to say, you know, you kicked ass, great job. And he doesn't say that. And I'm filled with emotion and I'm in the middle of the woods and there's no social media or no one to go running and complaining to. And I have to face these emotions. And you really feel it. You really feel it. You know, man, I gotta tell you, for my own, one of my least favorite things about me is that part of me that wants my daddy to be like, great job. Right. Oh, I hate it. I hate it when I'm like, as an adult and I'm like kind of side-eyeing like my wife or whoever I'm around me like, come on, give me the thing, give me the taste. It's crazy. And you know, it's wonderful to get a glimpse of oneself in that situation because I see my emotional fragility. I remember I was repairing a roof once. I'll share this very intimate, but I mean, we're here to talk about truth. I was in that very situation. I was repairing a roof. I thought, well, I did a kick-ass job. I came down. I didn't get the compliment I wanted. It was, it was twilight. It was about fucking nine o'clock at night during the summer. I walked out into the middle of the woods and I just broke down crying, sobbing. Just absolutely this emotion just came pouring out of me, partly because I was disappointed and enraged, but partly because I was also put face-to-face with myself. Oh, God. Does Curt Chief give any sense of like, you know, if you continue the work, maybe that part of you that isn't a black hole, that part of you that is just sadly vampiric, not even, I don't even want to call it vampiric because like, vampires are cool. They're like stalking. They're sucking. They're not, they're not, I've never heard of a compliment vampire and Rice didn't write about compliment vampires. I like that term, compliment vampires. Does he say it's possible that there's a way to, I mean, what is the, what's the point of witnessing those parts of yourself that don't square with who you'd like to be? Is it because maybe there's some remission of that part of yourself or is it just live with it? In his work and talks, I mean, there is a great deal of living with it or observing it and there is the possibility that through immense work, immense personal work, the individual might develop something else than that being that's just jockeying for praise, but the work is immense and people are underestimated. I underestimated. Am I mistaken that he thought you had to grow your own soul or something that you had to like? Yeah, I think that's, that's, that's correct. You know, he would say man likes to talk in terms of a soul, but you know, there's something there, but we're not developed. So in order to be that which we think we are, we need to grow it and that includes growing a soul basically. Yeah, it's one of those things, everyone just thinks you're born with it or, you know, the same way everyone thinks, you know, they're good at compassion or going down on people or whatever it is they think they're good at, but they're just winging it and maybe there's, they're not good at any of those things. Like why would you just naturally be kind? Why would you be innately sweet or generous or whatever the lauded aspects of a person are? These are things maybe you have to develop. And this is the paradox of Christianity. And I don't say paradox in a negative way necessarily because there's paradox everywhere, but we're told that grace is just given to you, you don't earn it. At the same time, we're told that man is born in original sin. We're told that God loves ultimately and infinitely, but at the same time we're told that if you do certain things, some of which are localized customs, you're going to go to hell. Like if, you know, depending on who you're talking to, you know, you violate laws against homosexuality or what have you, obviously not everybody feels that way. But there are local ideas that stem from old and New Testament that for the vast body of people in Christendom will constip you to eternal suffering, even though you're supposed to be born into a world where grace is granted. I realized the ologians have worked all this out. I'm not ignorant of those discussions, but the paradox endures. Okay. Did we already, I'm sorry if I already asked you about this. Did we, did you hear about that priest who'd been saying the wrong word in the baptism ceremony? I did. I did. Yeah. And because he'd been saying the wrong word, all the marriages, all that, like it created this stupid chain reaction. Cause what is it? He said, we, yeah, it's literally like the dumbest pronoun or something. Yeah. Yeah. It's like one word was wrong in the incantation and the church had to like send emails out to these people who were like, Hey, look, you're a baptized. He said, we, your cars recalled, you know, but yes, and they all had to come back, get re-baptized. But the implication was if you died before you came back in to get your correct baptism, bad news, right, right. You're going to like go to heaven. Like I've got fucking baptized. Here we go. Paradise. And somebody there would have to be like, I, I wish I could let you in. But he said, we in the wrong sentence. Yeah. I mean, that is, that, come on, that's like, it's, it's, yeah, it's, it's, that's mental illness. Now I do have to say there is a doctrine. Here we go. Here's the Satanist defending the Catholic church. You heard it first on the Duncan Trussell family hour folks. Another first. So within the Catholic church, there is a doctrine that says if the individual faced some insurmountable barrier in hearing the gospel or doing the right thing, like let's say you were stranded your whole life on an island or something, or you were set adrift in space, you'd be given a pass. You'd be given a pass. You could go to heaven. Yes. If it was impossible, if it was impossible by all worldly means for you to hear the gospel or, or undergo baptism or what have you, you'd get a pass. So there is a little bit of an escape hatch there. So then that means the ethical thing to do is to have your baby in a sealed chamber, right? Or there's no certainty that they will, they will never hear the gospel and then like let them like just die, die in there and then they go to heaven. Be like, Hey, you know, this, this kid qualifies. Let's, let's have it. No. I mean, seriously, like if I, cause really it's like, look, what do you want to do? Like, like put them in the world. Here's the fucking gospel. Some asshole says it the wrong way or he's got trauma and the guy says it to him, reminds him of his uncle and then he's like, I ate Jesus and or just put them in the fucking chamber. They'll never hear the gospel. You would take on the blame, but you'd help your kid, you know, presumably. And then the kid would be like, dad, why did you lock me in a box my whole life? And it's like, I am trying to help you. Does nobody appreciate me. Your kid would never see you or say anything. I'm saying you put them in a sterile fucking box. They don't see anything, failure to thrive, wipe them out, never heard about Jesus. When they get to heaven, they're like, Oh, now I get why they put me in the fucking box. That is all makes sense. You've, you've, this is, this is a parenting model. You've cracked it open. You're in loss are going to be like, Oh God. No, you fucking kidding. The reason I was sweaty when we started this podcast is because I was hanging a swing for my child in the fucking Texas heat 100 degrees. I'm not putting my kid in a chamber. These metaphysics of the Christian legal system. I don't know what the name for it is. It fascinates me in that it, it's not a perfect system, obviously. And it creates so many fucked up loopholes like that. Like if you, if you're saying like heaven is the most important thing, but there's a way to definitely get to heaven, which is not to hear about Christianity. Well, it has to be a circumstance under which there's no way out. You know, you're locked into the situation like your proverbial child in a box. Dad might get in trouble, but the kid would have to be deemed innocent. Schrodinger's Christian. There we go. So we've got Schrodinger's Christian. What was the other one? Compliment Vampire. Compliment Vampire. Right, right. There's one. Please go. I just thought of the greatest show for you, man. Oh, thanks. There's one I like to use, emotional permission. That's my new age term that I, you know, we got to put these all together in a book. I give you emotional permission Duncan to, you know, like criticize Christianity or what have you. Oh, thank you. Emotional permission. That's a new age concept that, so we'll group all these together into a kind of glossary. You have got to, I've just thought, man, I mean, this isn't possible in this dimension, but man, you know, like, remember, what was that show, the People's Court? Sure. Judge me, yeah. Except you're like, you're the judge determining if people get to go to heaven based on Catholic law. You know what I mean? Like, like you, we bring in front of you cases where you have to like determine based on the true law of Catholicism, like where are they're in limbo or whether they get to go to heaven. I mean, people do do this, right? In the Vatican, like this is the thing that people sit around and like contemplate. Like the, well, there are judgment calls made, you know, and certain judgment calls are certainly made in the beatification process determining whether somebody can be a saint and, and there are miracles that get claimed, often medical miracles, but sometimes other things that get researched. But I would be honored to do that. I feel like I'd be a decent judge because I don't necessarily have an emotional stake in it. So when you're using a system that you care enough about to know, but you don't care so much about that you have these emotional kind of personal stake in it, you could probably apply it fairly well. How many Satanists do you think are currently working at the Vatican? Like if you, if we're in Vegas and what would you, what would your guest be? Wow. That's a wonderful question. I did visit the Vatican several years ago. I think it was in 2016. And it's just an incredible array of pre-Christian art there, which is, it's the greatest occult collection of art I've ever seen anywhere in the world. I would, I would have to assume that some fraction of people, you know, 8% is the figure that fits in my mind. So I'd say 8%. So maybe we can test this. We'll send out a survey, an anonymous survey. That's if only that number, like on a ticker or something in front of the Vatican, like we're getting our Satanist percentage down. It's at 7% now. Could be some remarkable ideas. You know, I would, I would love to see, you know, an earnest discussion between a believer and a Satanist. What I detest is sort of what you and I have been alluding to, which is the application of formality and liturgy in the place of the search. And the great Jewish theologian Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel said, there are two aspects to Jewish law, agadah, which is the spirit of law, and halakah, which is the letter of the law. And he said, our crisis is replying halakah, which is the letter of the law. And you need the letter of the law if you're going to hold together a congregation, but it can't substitute for agadah, the spirit of the law. And I'm down with anybody as long as they're participating in agadah. Oh, I love that. What are your thoughts on the arson that just happened at the Satanic temple? Oh, the last arson. Oh, yes, right. You know, actually, I was thinking there was a house owned by a member of the Church of Satan in Poughkeepsie, New York in the Hudson Valley that was burned down about 18 months ago, which was horrible, because there were two people indoors. And I mean, look, you know, I think people who commit these acts, there are certain people in this world who I look at, and I'm not interested in analyzing them. I'm interested in protecting people from them. And that's the only operative engagement that I have with these people. If people want to burn down somebody's house or they want to burn down a headquarters or an organization, my feeling is that at that point, the only operative response is self-defense through whatever means. I want to see people protected. I'm tired of trying to understand people who commit acts of violence. We could save that for later. What people need is protection from them. Well, I mean, but also you kind of see like how there is a hierarchy of religion in the West, how this person goes and sets a place of, you know, a religious place on fire with people inside it, but it's not viewed in the same way that if that person had like set a Catholic Church on fire. You know what I mean? It doesn't make the same headlines. There isn't talks of like, this is fucking religious persecution here. It's more, you know, it's looked at as a kind of like novelty or something like that. But do you ever, as a Satanist, do you ever kind of, does that get to you that your particular faith, I don't know what name you give it, is sort of in the hierarchy of faiths in the world is generally downplayed? Well, I do give it the name Satanism because I like to be very blunt and direct and transparent, but I always hasten to add what my own esoteric reading of it is, what my own point of view on it is. And interestingly enough, the Satanic Temple, the Satanic Temple is an expression of what you might call atheistic Satanism. And so at this point is the Church of Satan. They're two very different organizations, but the Satanic Temple spends a lot of time addressing the First Amendment contradictions that you were just citing. So this act as enraging as it is in a certain sense, this is the Satanic Temple mirroring back to us our own hypocrisies. If this were a Catholic Church or another, you know, house of worship, probably within the Christian tradition or maybe Jewish, Fox News would be programming for a week on this, programming for a week. But a Sikh Temple, well, you know, it's just an oddity. The Satanic, you know, the Satanist, well, you know them. And so, yeah, I mean, this is inadvertently, this is the Satanic Temple doing what it was founded to do, which is holding up a mirror to our hypocrisies. Right. Yeah, right. But what such a bummer, man. So thank God nobody was hurt. The fire up in Poughkeepsie, New York that I was referencing, this is a home that was owned by two members of the Church of Satan. And they were both inside and this homicidal arsonist who probably calls himself a Christian, tried to burn it down and would have killed two people. They just escaped with their lives. And it hasn't been widely covered. This happened about 18 months ago. Good Lord. Yeah. Yeah, it's such a fucked up thing. I mean, this is why I think Satanists need more stage time in the world, because there's a too many misconceptions about y'all that are like, or totally fucking up. It's just misdirection, you know what I mean? It's like, where are the, where are, if you want to find cases of child abuse, where the fuck do you go? Yeah, dig this, you know, during the 1980s, when the Satanic panic was going on, you had these high school librarians who wore pentagrams getting accused of satanic child abuse, a total fallacious canard, not a instance or shred of truth to it, not a granular shred of truth. What was actually going on at the time, which we know about today because of class action lawsuits, is there was a wave of child abuse going on within the Catholic Church and the Boy Scouts of America. The Boy Scouts of America is in the process right now of declaring bankruptcy to protect itself from tens of thousands of class action lawsuits because of young kids who were abused under its auspices. In the Catholic Church, likewise, there's close to 30 parishes or organizations that have declared bankruptcy to shield themselves from survivor lawsuits. I'm not picking on the Catholic Church of the Boy Scouts of America. I'm simply pointing out that when abuses are going on within powerful mainstream organizations, it's human nature that we always push those abuses off to the margins and blame somebody else. It's the goth kids, it's the heavy metal bands, it's the librarian with the pentagram, people who cannot defend themselves, and suddenly, a generation later, we're finding, not only in the U.S., but in Canada, France, Italy, these problems ran riot. They ran riot. Boy Scouts of America may not even survive into the next generation because of how much money it's going to have to pay out. Those are the simple facts. It's not the fault of Judas Priest. It's not the fault of the goth kid. It's not the fault of the daycare worker who got blamed and whose life got ruined for complete fraudulent invented charges by self-appointed experts who were dealing with media reputations and feeding service and making themselves into occult advisors to police force. It was all a facade, a total facade. When people argue with me about it, the one telltale sign that always reveals itself is they make reference to news coverage that's a generation old. They're showing me articles from 1989, 1990, with no realization whatsoever that all this has been overturned, and we're still dealing with waves of unaddressed trauma from the real crisis that was going on then, which was child abuse within church-based and Boy Scout-based organizations that were supposed to be protecting kids. Well, look, Hail Satan. Hail Satan. That's why I love talking to you. That's my other reasons. Mitch, you're the best. Thank you so much for this wild conversation. How can people find you?

32^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - ABBY MARTIN Transcript and Discussion^2013-08-07^Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Hello everyone. Welcome to the Duncan Tressel Family Hour podcast. Today's guest is an actual journalist, as opposed to many people who are currently on some of the mainstream media outlets that seem to be spokespeople for the United States government. Here's one of the most glaring examples of these types of pundits. Check this out. It's from MSNBC. They actually put this on the air. An open letter to Snowden from MSNBC journalist, Melissa Harris Perry. And straining US relationships with Russia and China. Really important relationships. And we're talking about how you praise countries like Russia and Venezuela for standing against human rights violations and refusing to compromise their principles. Seriously Ed, where do you even come up with that? What are you thinking? Now, I understand you don't want to come aback. I mean, to do so would mean giving up your freedom. Definitely before trial and likely for several months or years thereafter. I get it. It's in prisons in the US that commit actual human rights violations. We just talked about it. More than 80,000 prisons are held in solitary confinement, some for years, some indefinitely, despite the fact that solitary is cruel and psychological damaging. I know those aren't the human rights violations, though Ed, that you were complaining about. But you might have nothing to worry about anyway. Because unlike most of the people in solitary confinement, including private Bradley Manning on trial for giving data to WikiLeaks, you've cultivated for yourself a level of celebrity. And that celebrity itself may just act as the protection, another kind of cloak. If you ever find yourself in a US prison, you have made quite a spectacle of yourself. And the Obama administration will be very careful about how it treats you, unlike how states treat all those other prisoners. Come on, Ed. Then we could talk about something else. Sincerely, Melissa. That is real. That actually went on the air. It sounds like something you would hear a reporter saying on North Korean news, that is state media there. That is as though the federal government wrote a script and sent it to the various news outlets, asking them to read the script. That's real. That's actually happening. But it gets even creepier when you head over to Fox News. Listen to this. Let's talk about the NSA and the comprehensive program now with prison and everything being out there and being examined. We're discussing the breadth of the NSA program. You are a take-no-prisoners person when it comes to the war on terror. How do you feel about it? Look, show me one American, one law-abiding American citizen who has been hurt by any of these NSA programs. None. None, exactly. They're keeping us safe. If the intel community backs off and doesn't do this stuff and there's a terrorist attack, then it's intelligence failure. If they do this stuff, well, it's big brother snooping. And now you've got this 29-year-old high school dropout whistleblower making foreign policy for our country, our security policy. And the guy, look, I think it's sad, Brian. We've made treason cool. We train your country as kind of a fashion statement. He wants to be the national security Kim Kardashian. He cites Bradley Manning as a hero. I mean, we need to get very, very serious about treason and, oh, by the way, for treason, as in the case of Bradley Manning or Edward Snowden, you bring back the death penalty. The death penalty. Fox News just gave a platform upon which some kind of fascist monster could call for the death penalty of a kid who had the balls to let all of us know that we are constantly being monitored by our government. This type of surveillance goes against the Fourth Amendment, which says, the rights of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the person or things to be seized. Isn't that nice? That's a great amendment. It basically says to power, fuck you. You can't go through my stuff. And Edward Snowden was a person who recognized that this was being violated and had the guts to let the reporter Glenn Greenwald know that this was happening. And the result of it is that the entire country is now in a furious debate over whether or not the NSA can continue to monitor us. And that's a wonderful thing. And it wouldn't have happened without, A, people like Snowden who were willing to give up their entire life for their country. To make the United States a better place, Snowden had to go live in Russia. That's a hero. And two, it requires somebody like Glenn Greenwald, a reporter whose life has been radically shifted because he's the one who got all this information out there in the first place. And there are actually congressmen who are calling for Glenn Greenwald's arrest. That's right. There's elective representatives who would like to arrest journalists right now for telling us the truth. That congressman, Pete King of New York who joins me now. Now, congressman, thank you for being here. So you, all right. So it's not particularly newsworthy that you're calling for Snowden to be prosecuted because we've seen that over the past few days. But to take it another step and say the journalists who published the information, that the guys who published what he leaked, that they should face prosecution, that is news. Do you believe that? You stand by that, both Greenwald and the Washington Post reporter? I'm talking about Greenwald. Greenwald, not only did he disclose this information, he has said that he has the names of CIA agents and assets around the world. And they're threatening to disclose that. The last time that was done in this country, we saw a CIA station chief murdered in Greece. No right is absolute. And even the press has certain restrictions. I think it should be very targeted, very selective, and certainly a very rare exception. But in this case, will you have someone who's disclosed secrets like this and threatens to release more than that? To me, yes, there has to be legal action should be taken against them. Wow, think about that. An elected official, Peter King, wants a journalist arrested. Imagine that. Those are the times that we live in. Peter King would like it if men with guns went to Glenn Greenwald's house, put handcuffs on him, and threw him into a dungeon for reporting information that was given to him by Edward Snowden that proved conclusively that the United States government, specifically the NSA, was violating the Fourth Amendment and monitoring all of us. So instead of wanting to arrest the people who started the program that violated the Fourth Amendment, some of the representatives in the United States government would actually like to arrest the people that gave us that information. This is why people like Glenn Greenwald and Abby Martin are heroes, in my eyes, because they really put themselves on the line. Check out this promo from Abby Martin's show, Breaking the Set. F*** the media, f*** the candidates, f*** the corporatocracy. I can't wait for this f***ing sh** to be over. Word. New York Times, welcome to the This Administration Has No Credibility Club. Remind me again, why does that people are worshiping kings and queens in the year 2013? So I have a novel idea. Instead of blaming the whistleblower for trying to evade death by way of the Espionage Act, you actually talk about what the NSA revelations are. In a Constitutional Republic democracy, this is not informed consent by those who are governed. This is manufactured consent. And actually, it's court's consent in secret. Guys, this is not about safety. It's not about terrorism. This is about chilling dissent and controlling society. Live, live, die, die, die. Isn't he dead already? You can't conduct these kinds of wars around the world, killing innocent people in the pursuit of a few bad guys, and pretend that it's not going to come back to hurt you. Didn't you find the logic flawed now looking back? Do you regret your vote to invade and occupy a country to find one man? See, we ought to be critical of highly concentrated forms of power wherever we find it, because that kind of power is usually subject to chronic abuse. Hello, Abby. I'm Stephanie from Nestle. We saw the video you posted on YouTube criticizing Nestle over water. So here's our response. Walmart's also been described as an economic death star, destroying everything in its path, leaving behind nothing more than homogenous wasteland. So the harmless activist is now the criminal, yet actual criminal banksters run free. Well, I'm glad this government has its priorities straight. So do you shackle down your mind and subscribe to old school paradigms? Or do you liberate yourself by acknowledging reality? Sure, the world would lose its innocence. But wouldn't you rather know the truth? That's Abby Martin, and she's coming up. But first, some business. Hi, it's me again. I didn't even go anywhere.

It's the Duncan Tressel family hour, the video, the video, the video, the video, the video. All right, I'm here with Abby Martin, welcome. Thank you, Duncan. What are you doing in LA? I am here for the Zeitgeist media festival, talking about bridging art and activism. Zeitgeist is by the people who did that web video, the Zeitgeist movement. Yeah, it's the original three hour mind fuck movie and then he did two other ones after that and now he's kind of doing this whole worldwide movement. What do you think about the Zeitgeist movies? It really opened my eyes to a lot of shit when I watched it years ago. The religion part really was a mind fuck for me but then I had already thought the stuff about 9-11 and then the economic system but the way that Peter Joseph lays it out is so amazing. I mean, it's so brilliant. It's like the most obvious of truths that you just have never heard articulated so well. So I think he's really talented in that way. Yeah, I agree. I remember it really stirred a lot of people up, didn't it? That was sort of the beginning of the Occupy movement. Could that be connected? Was that in the same vein? I think it was a lot of awakening, right, kind of the precipice for the whole Occupy shit. And the Occupy shit is basically the simple realization that we are being controlled by banks. Is that it? Does that oversimplify it? No, I think it's like 99 problems. I mean, it's hard to sum up the Occupy movement in one thing when there's so many fucking things wrong with the planet. So that I think it was like an easy way for the corporate media to just dismiss it and be like, you guys don't have a message. But really, I mean, there's so many things wrong and it's really all the corporate talkercy that's kind of perpetuating all the shit on the planet. The corporate talkercy, right. And the corporate talkercy is the lobbyists who've paid off the senators and the congressmen or women and so we don't have a representative democracy anymore. Yeah, I mean, we're run by a bunch of oligarchs and corporate figureheads who are not elected. And really, I mean, if you're just looking at the media in itself, 120 people sitting on the boards of six media corporations and then they sit on the boards of like Monsanto and defense contractors. So really, when you look at who is running shit, it's really just these CEOs who are unelected and they just have this revolving door through government and perpetuate their own policies. Right, when did that start happening? I think it's been happening. I mean, look at Eisenhower when he left office, he warned us against the military industrial complex decades ago, he just said, this is going to happen. There's a conglomerate of power pushing to overtake the government pretty much. I mean, in so many words, I'm obviously paraphrasing him, but look at what's happened. I mean, it's unbelievable the amount of power that's been consolidated over the last 50 years in every industry. What do you mean by that? Monopolies. When people say, we don't live in a free market and we should open up the market more, I mean, I look at it as monopolies form because the market has been too free. I mean, when you take away regulation, then you see Glass-Steagall being removed and these banks are consolidating and able to just like wild speculate. What is that? What's Glass-Steagall? You might have to talk to me a little bit like a fucker. Like you're a fucking child. Yeah, seriously, because I understand the broad strokes of this thing, but I would like to know more about the details. Okay, so Glass-Steagall was a measure that was in place that Clinton actually deregulated that basically just said the banks can't wildly speculate with your money. And I don't actually know the details because economics is my weak point, but I mean, really it's made the banks able to do what they've done. They've taken all of our money. They basically caused the economic crisis and then what do we do in response? We give them $12 trillion to just send off shore and all the CEOs got like millions of dollars and we're like, we need to save the banks. Otherwise the economy will collapse, but really did we? I mean, are we better off now that these banks are just enormous and not able to fail? I mean, to me, if we had a free market system then the banks should fail if they get too big and they can't, you know, if they can't function anymore. But the banks failing, that means a depression. That's, I mean, that means people's money. That means all the money that you have in the bank is just gone. And now everyone has to start over again or a lot of people have to start over again because the money got stolen, essentially. The thing is, it still is getting stolen. And look at what's happening, like what happened in Cyprus. They had a bail-in model where the government literally just went into people's bank accounts and took money. Yes. If you had more than $100,000 in the bank, that's fucked. Well, that's fucked now. It's fucked according to the paradigm we're in now, but according to the paradigm that's existed since the beginning of time, that's par for the course. Which is the king, if he wants your money, he takes your money. Exactly. So we haven't really changed since feudalism, I guess. Right. And that seems closer to reality. Or it seems as though there's a, you know, maybe that the democracy that the founding fathers envisioned was an attempt at a mutation of the hive that goes against the way the hive normally forms, which is the primate hive, seems to always form with some patriarch running things through his ministers that allow his friends to get rich while everybody else has a little less, it doesn't have a great life. Yeah, we've reverted back to that system, even though the foundation of this country was to try to stay away from the consolidation of power with the kings and queens, and now we've kind of reverted back to it. We're all kind of peons, but we're living under the guise of a democracy. So that's what makes it even harder to convince people that we're not really in a democratic system. That's the beautiful evolution of the thing. It is. It is. It's beautiful. Yeah, it is, you know, as a king, if I were a king or an emperor, and I was evolving, then I would realize like, oh, look at history, man. These kings and emperors, they sure don't have it good after a while. They end up getting killed or imprisoned. Let's make the people think they don't have a king. And then if we can really pull that off, we are not in any danger at all. It'll be the exact same system. Absolutely. So that's brilliant. It is brilliant. And in the propaganda model, we've completely adopted the Nazi propaganda model, except we've perfected it. And that's what's different now in the era that we're living in. At least the Germans knew that they were living under fascism. Right. Well, no, because we get to enjoy this wonderful delusion. And that's, I think that many people love delusion. And I think that it's a... It's what makes the world go around. It's the drug of choice. And I think that there's something to be said for letting people, it's a funny thing. You know, there's a, let's take like, I was just talking with Joe the other day, and we were saying, what if we could run the country like Reddit? Like, you know what I mean? It was a true democracy. Upvote the best leaders, upvote the best laws, upvote the best ideas, downvote all the bullshit. But what if that Reddit sprung up in a place where there was a high population of people who followed Sharia law, for example? If you look at Sharia law from a non-fundamentalist Islamic perspective, then there's a lot of problems you're gonna have with that right away. Like, I don't think if someone shoplifts, they should get their hand chopped off, for example. But a cultural relativist would say, no, no, no, that's their belief. But what if their belief is based on a, something that doesn't exist at all? A phantasm, a delusion. So this is the thing that I keep running into, is do you, is it better to wake people up and shake them awake and say, look, you're living in a delusion? There is no God the way you perceive God. There's no, Jesus didn't rise from the dead. He's not coming back at the end of time. The reason things are fucked up in Israel has nothing to do with superstition. It has to do with a simple strategy, the strategic location of Israel. Clearly, there's no metaphysical anything involved here. It's just the center of the world in a lot of ways. And that's where, it's also a mix of a lot of different religions. Of course, there's gonna be problems there. Do you wake people up or do you just step back and let people be however they wanna be? Let the kid believe in Santa Claus. It's a good point. It's something that I struggle with because I think religion is a main factor that's stunting humanity's collective consciousness, obviously. But on the other hand, you look at something like Egypt, electing, democratically electing Mohamed Morsi, but he was so staunchly Muslim and really ostracizing a lot of women and minorities in the country. So when you look at something like that, do you support the military coup because he was suppressing so many people? Or do you say that's what people voted for and it was the first democratically elected president there? I'm more in favor of shaking people out of their slumber and then letting them fucking let the chips fall. I know you are. I watch your show. I know you are. And I think that that's a good, I do think that that's a good thing, but then, you know, what is the truth? What is the way people should be living? Do you think that you know the way that people should be living? Do you think that you understand a better system than the system that's happening right now? That's a hard question. I don't, because I am very naive because I've only lived on this planet a certain amount of time. I don't think it's fair to say that I know the truth and I'm constantly learning every day and the more that I learn, the more that I know, I don't know shit. But I think truth is relative. I think it's all about finding your own truth, but the problem is people only seek out very specific outlets of information and then they just get saturated in that and reinforce their own paradigms throughout the channels and they don't broaden their perspective and I think that's a big problem. If we could just push people to start broadening their perspective and entertaining other philosophies, other ideologies and other world systems, then maybe we can progress and have this dialogue, but right now we're so stunted because, and that's another problem I think with the internet. Even though it's an amazing tool, it's a revolutionary tool that interconnects all of us and that we have all the information at our fingertips, I just read this meme online, it was so true. It says, if you saw someone in the old days come, if someone from like the 1800s came to you and they said, what's the most amazing invention today? You'd say, I have a device in my pocket that contains all of the earth's knowledge, but I use it to argue with strangers and look at cat photos. Right, yeah, sure, yeah. It's the window into everything, but again, you see how the human, how access has nothing to do with growth. It has nothing to do with growth. You could present to the world the greatest truth, the purest articulation of truth, the distillation of the greatest aspects of all world religions. You could say it in three sentences in the most simple way, and still most people are like, are you fucking hippie, shut up. Well, I want an In-N-Out burger. It's so true, even if you confront someone with hard facts proving their worldview is a complete sham, they will reject it because they've been conditioned so hard to grasp onto that because it's all they know. So I'm a mildly intelligent person. You're a very intelligent person. And we've both come to this. It's just that you've smoked weed and I haven't yet today. I don't think, I think if anything, we both should smoke more weed because I don't know, I don't have that, that doesn't, that never seems to dilute my ability to articulate myself, but the point is we both realize this phenomena that exists in society, which is that people don't want the truth. They're not interested in the truth. It's not something that they gravitate towards. So if we're like just normal people and we've come to this realization, then it makes sense to me that people throughout history have come to that conclusion. And at some point, what if people realize like, okay, every time we try to tell the truth to people, they burn us at the stake, they nail us to crosses, they don't like it, they don't listen to us, they imprison us. And then they said, okay, well, why don't we start meeting in private and talking about the truth? And then when they started meeting in private, they said, you know, maybe we should have a revolutionary war and found a country based on the truth, only we'll do it so that people don't even realize that that's what's happening. Something where they knew, this is the Freemason starting the revolutionary, starting the, funding the revolutionary war. And then, so now this is where you get into deep conspiracy land, which is this idea that maybe a secret society had the same realization we just had, which is that you're not gonna make the masses understand the truth. They don't want it, they won't listen, it's impossible. So just make it so that you can control them in a way that they won't blow shit up for as long as possible and show little signs for the smart people to be lured in the direction of the truth so that they won't end up in the lower galleys. Is that why I see so much Masonic shit all over DC? Well, yeah, that is why, well, you know, you've seen the street layouts of DC, of course, of the optic nerve and the, yeah, exactly. So that's a sign, that's a sign. You don't just leave something like that there accidentally. And if you're like building a city, that's a lot of work. You don't just do that for fun. You're not like, well, look, you know what? Let's make an all seeing eye with a pyramid and put as many esoteric occult symbols in here, just for fun. Just for fun. You do that because maybe people will start looking at that stuff who are smart and think, wait a minute, something bigger is going on here than I'm aware of. There's something outside my current level of conditioning that I'm not quite aware of right now. I like that you said that the Freemasons and the Founding Fathers, which most of them were Freemasons, actually conspired for the revolution, because it's true. And when you say the word conspiracy theory, it's become such a pejorative term to just shut down dialogue immediately. But conspiracies are real, like they're very real. I mean, there is a conspiracy in plain sight to maintain a well-oiled corporatocracy and govern this country the way it's been governed. That's very like, it's blatant, and it's just a matter of looking at the fucking information. But again, you know, I know already, I'm probably gonna, I have like on my message board, sometimes people will accuse me of being a Freemason. And I already know that I'm going to be getting some of this just from this conversation, but I do think about like run-ins with certain people who just seem stupid. They don't seem interested in anything but eating and taking long naps. And like, they don't wanna really try. They're enjoying their life, and they're having a great time. And this is like kind of like a, I don't know, like a water park for them or something. You know, they're listening to, they're listening to shitty music and they're like going to their job and they're smoking cigarettes and just sort of, you know, letting it all go down. They're gonna get cancer, they're gonna get like some kind of weird sickness and it'll be sad. The thing is, are they having a great time or is there some sort of empty void that they just don't know? I mean, is it just emptiness inside? Because really, how could you truly enjoy life to the full extent of what we've been given if you're not trying to seek out some sort of true will? Like the Aleister Crowley shit where, you know, it's not to get too much into individualism and like it's all selfishness, but really we are here to pursue something outside of ourselves. And it's something greater than our lives, our mundane bullshit, sitting in traffic, eating fucking fast food and watching Fox News and then dying. Yeah, yeah, well I would think so. I mean, I would think so. I think that, you know, if we, for example, if they could make Psilocybin a prescription medication or if they could make MDMA a prescription medication so that people could have access to psychedelic states. And they used to. They used to prescribe MDMA in psychological sessions and it was really helpful with couples therapy. And then they also sold it in vending machines and gay clubs. I mean, this is what we used to have access to. Well, this is, see, this is the idea of the, you know, this is like Nietzsche's like kind of like dark idea of the hungry masses, the idiots of the world and how you want them. You don't want them to go away. You want them there. I have a friend who's like, I love Ram Dass and I listened to a Ram Dass lecture and I learned how to be. Well, I have a friend who's like the opposite of Ram Dass and I watch him and learn how not to be. Like everything he does, I try not to do. That's how I learn. Cause I look at him like, oh, you do everything wrong. You do everything wrong. And it's as much of a teacher to me as Ram Dass is. I see Ram Dass and I look at someone who meditates and opens his heart and tries to embrace the world. And he has this incredible loving glow. I look at my friend and he's like this poisonous, dark, unhappy, miserable person who always has terrible things happen to him. And then you could see like, oh, cool. I just, all I have to do is like mark down what you do and don't do it and I'll be okay. So I need that. In the same way I need Ram Dass. So this is where you get into a funny terrain when you start talking about, all right, let's fix the fucking machine. This time we're gonna get the gears right. We're gonna turn the gears right. We're gonna make it so that we are closer to a representative democracy and this time it's gonna work. I think over the course of human civilization we've seen progress and change is extremely fucking slow. So they're always gonna be like you mentioned before, people getting burned at the stake. I mean, Galileo. People who have these revolutionary ideas that turn out to be very true, but they're always ridiculed. They're always ostracized and they're always penalized and criminalized for this radical thought. And I think that you just need to realize that you're never gonna see the change that you are seeking in your lifetime. I mean, you can only just do what you can do and you hope that you'll influence some sort of small sphere that will in turn continue this wave of thought and there's always gonna be the fucking idiots. That's a given. I mean, look at how many people are in the world that are idiots. So I think it's the yin and yang. It's like you're always gonna have this balance. But for me, when I'm searching for news every day I get into this state of depression. It's almost like a PTSD where you're just inundated with so much horrible shit all the time. And I'm wondering, is it more horrible now than it was or is it just because I have more access to all the negative shit and I'm just inundated myself with this negativity? Or is there always a balance? I mean, so it's just hard to really sort through it all. Yeah, it sure is, isn't it? It sure is. And do you know that Bill Hicks joke? Which one? Have you ever heard the one about? There's a lot of them. Yeah, he ever heard Bill Hicks one joke? That'd be amazing if he just told this one joke and got, that was, he's a great at it. The Bill Hicks joke about the news, watching the news and the, you know, you see bombs go, can I play it for you? Yeah, okay. Stop me if you've heard it. Okay, hold on a second. Damn, you have it on your little mixer? No, I'm gonna stop recording for two seconds. I don't know if you had like a sound effect. You're like, hold on, let me play it. Okay, hold on. Let me get, let me find this. Okay. I wanted to talk to you about the... Hold on a second. I'm recording. What's the news these days, you know? It's unbelievable. You think you just walk out your door, you're immediately gonna be raped by some crap addicted, AIDS infected, pit bull, and you're just, horrible news story. Honey, I wanna check the mail. Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? What do you say we stay inside tonight, babe? Let's let the pizza delivery guy deal with that shit out there. Hello, pizza delivery. Could you send another car over, please? I know that's your third one. That last guy almost made it. He almost reached the pizza box with the broom handle. How come those pit bulls are eating your driver, but they're not touching that fucking pizza? But they know that we don't know. Hello? We soon will all gonna be locked inside our homes, known on the streets, but pizza delivery guys and armored car drivers. Pizza delivery drones. Pizza, there's a mail slot to our front door. Every house will glow with American gladiators beamed in. We are free. We are free. We are free. We are free. This is just apocalyptic. Didn't you think with the cold war being over, things should have gotten better? How many of y'all were as stupid as I am believing that? Wow, it's over. 40 years of gratitude for your new weapons. It's over, Eric. Yeah. No. Now, 12 different countries have nuclear weapons. It just got 12 times as bad. Fuck you. Life is harder now. Work more. Job is scarce. Fuck you. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. By the way, if anyone here is in advertising or marketing, still you're selling them. Anyway, that's. Most useless industry of all time, advertising. Well, look, this is the thing. It's your question is, I think, one of the great questions of the day. Are we in a better place than we were or are we in a worse place than we were? And is the news and the media responsible for creating a voodoo spell over humanity that's making us all feel paranoid and scared and hopeless when in fact we're existing in a golden age unlike any other period in human history with greater access to medical care, war fatalities are at a low compared to what they were. Violent crime, death from guns and violent crime is dropped. If you look at the statistics and from one perspective, holy shit, for a lot of us, not all of us, watch VICE on HBO and you can see there's Corners of the World that aren't happening right now, but us, you and me, our lives are so good. The nutrition that we get every day is unlike any other time in history. People used to be five feet tall because they were eating roots and grubs. They were five feet tall. They used to live to like 30. They used to live to 30, maybe. Maybe you'd lived to 30 and by the time you got to 30, you probably had your arm amputated because a cat scratched you. You watched your wife get burned at the stake. Your kids were beheaded. If we had news back then, can you imagine the horror that they would show compared to now? I think it's all relative, Duncan. You just brought up a good point. I think that the reason why it's so infuriating now is because we know that we have the technology to basically have medical care for everyone. We have clean technology in terms of the environment and energy and it's so infuriating to see these horrendous, destructive, earth-shattering policies be perpetuated not only in this country but across the world and to have your own country, the country that you grew up in, to be at the forefront of it. But yeah, I think it's all relative. I think that, yes, things are tremendously awesome compared to what they were 200 years ago, but still knowing that we can do so much better pisses me the fuck off. But then again, who do we blame? Do we blame the media or do we blame ourselves for being apathetic and not understanding that the media is a propaganda system? Not the media you're putting out though. You seem to be this new breed of journalist that isn't like Fox News. You seem, one thing I love about the way that you report the news and the way you editorialize is you seem angry. You seem really pissed off and I like that a lot because I think that that is the way you should feel if you're looking at things from... If you really love this country and you allow yourself to really consider what's happening or if you voted for Obama, I think there's a place in you that should be angry because we're being monitored at all times. All of our digital communication is being monitored. One of the greatest heroes of our generation just had to escape to Russia to be safe. Isn't that amazing? It's amazing. It's amazing. And so I think that there's an embarrassment in that and there's an... It comes from that and what's... But even more infuriating is when you turn on Fox News or you turn on most mainstream media, but particularly Fox News and you see their horrific attempt to get hip now. Have you noticed this? They have these younger journalists trying to seem really cool and they play like 60s era music and really cool music at commercial breaks. But when they come back, it's these journalists who are pointing out like, oh, Snowden, hope you have fun in Russia. Hey, check this out, Snowden. Look at this guy's in prison here for saying this about the Russian government and this guy is here. And the point is they're demonizing a hero. On the plane right over here, I was watching Fox News because I love watching it just because it's a joke. And I think a lot of people watch it just for entertainment value too. But I was seeing all these Olympians talking about how they're going to go to Russia and they're not going to be scared because they're these gay ice skating Olympians and they're like, but aren't you... And so it's just like a total propaganda piece to try to demonize Russia. Yes, it's totally fucked up that Russia is penalizing gay propaganda. Whatever the hell that means, it's horrible. However, is that relevant to Snowden seeking asylum? Exactly. Why are we making this false equivalency? It's just fucking stupid. It's scary because you're seeing state TV. You don't want to admit that there's state TV in this country. But when you turn on Fox News, you are seeing something that is no different than North Korean news. It's the same fucking thing, man. This is the party line. They're trying to make us think that this poor son of a bitch who gave up his life here to let us know that we're being monitored by the government is Frankenstein or some kind of awful beast on the loose with no mention of the fact that we are being fucking monitored. Everything you do, every email you send, every cell phone call you make, God knows what else they say that they could turn on the microphones in your fucking droids. This is a nightmare. It's a nightmare. You're gonna hack your cell phone from the fucking iPhone charger. But it's all to keep us safe, Duncan. Don't you get it? You fucking get it? No! I don't get it. I don't get it. And I don't like it. But on the other hand, I look at my life and I love my life. And I think that's why they got us exactly where they want us. Because many, many of us, even if we don't particularly enjoy our jobs, if you look at Vice Magazine, you see somebody in, I don't know, Somalia taking a shit on the beach because they don't have like that. I mean, it's just, there's the extreme. Yeah. So at that point, you're like, well, all right, I guess you know what? I might be in the harem of the Illuminati, but it's a pretty nice hair. But that's how they get you. And that's the whole push, talking point narrative on the other side where they're like, if you don't like this fucking country, leave. Like, you hate this country so much. You're like, no, I'm just seeing that we could go in a really dangerous direction and we're already kind of embracing this and allowing this to happen. So if we don't step up now, I'm scared for the future of this country. I don't want these luxuries to be gone. The thing is we're all sitting back just so complacent and apathetic. You're not. Yes, but a lot of people are. You're not, though. You're not. And that's, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but I do want to point that out. One reason I was very excited to talk to you is because while many of us are aware of this stuff and know that this thing's happening, we're not really doing much, but it seems like you are passionately working to get this information out into the world and you seem called to it almost. Like, you couldn't stop doing this if you wanted to stop. I'll die doing it. Yeah, I will. And it's bigger than myself. But, I mean, you and Joe are doing awesome work, too, because I think that the new media, the reinventing the media apparatus, making the corporate media relevant is reinventing the wheel. And what you guys are doing, hopefully, what I'm doing, David Seaman and other people like that who are pushing forward, like, not fear-mongering. And I know that I get really pissed off and angry, but the last thing I want to do is fear-monger people. I mean, we do have the ability to change things. It's just a matter of taking the initiative, even just entertaining thoughts and pushing forward different perspectives to your friends and family. That's huge. But I wanted to mention something before when you were saying that the corporate media now is basically like a state-run media. How scary is that? That we have a corporate media apparatus that's essentially towing the exact line of the establishment, the political establishment. That's terrifying. So, basically, all these corporations, I mean, the definition of fashion when the corporate state works in concert with the government. So, when you have these two entities pushing forward the same narrative to fucking fear-monger everyone into a non-existent threat, when you're more likely to die of furniture falling on you from a high-rise, walking down the street than you are of terrorism, yet they're issuing this worldwide terror alert. Everyone, fucking terror alert, color-level bullshit. Remember the terror-level chart? Yeah, orange. I miss that kind of. I miss Bush and I miss all that shit. Don't become so much more sophisticated now. Yeah, well, you're right. You know, that is the... So, let's break it down as what it really is. Or let me... I'll tell you about a country. Here's a country. There's a country that exists right now, that is monitoring. All of the digital communication of its citizens is recording it, holding it in some kind of massive storage facility, and has taken over the press, and no one in this country is doing anything about it, even though they have absolute freedom of speech. No one's doing anything about it. Why? What is happening, Abby? Why is no one doing anything about it except for people like you and Glenn Greenwald and Seaman? And I don't know, you know, me and Joe, sure, we do talk about this stuff, but we also spend a lot of time talking about Bigfoot and Cox and Aliens and Weed, you know? I think we are... I mean, we do take advantage of freedom of speech, but you guys see much more focus. So my question to you is why? Where's the anger? I think our agency has been completely taken away because of fear, and I think the only thing to fear is fear itself. And I think that when you have people... when you have a government entity prosecuting and criminalizing whistleblowers for just speaking the truth and exposing war crimes, yet war criminals are literally going on book tours and running around and speaking on Fox News, we're living in a totally Orwellian warped society where people have been conditioned into not speaking out because they're fucking scared. I can't even tell you how many people have told me, I want to support you. I totally believe in what you're doing. I just like, you know, I don't want to be put on a list. I don't want to be this and that, and this is before even the NSA revolutions. I'm like, too fucking late, dude. You're already in it. The scariest thing about the surveillance state, though, is, you know, beyond just the chilling effect of everyone knowing that they're spied on and so inherently they're not going to speak out as much because they're fucking terrified that they're going to be datamined if they say certain words. On top of that, it's the retroactive prosecution that could happen with your entire lifespan of digital and your digital life. They can retroactively prosecute you for something that happens later on. Let's say if you're wrongfully accused of something, they could take your entire life's digital data and retroactively prosecute you, selecting certain things that you might have said about Obama. Like, I mean, I joke around all the fucking time. You know, I saw this really funny parody about, like, let's fuck with the NSA by only speaking like terrorists. Yes. And it's that kind of thing, if you just make a joke, they can honestly pull that up and be like, oh, you said this five years ago. I think it's a good time to announce the new website that I just bought that we're working on. It's called summonthensa.com. And it's a button you press, and it immediately does, like, you know, 15 web searches on backpacks. Yeah, backpacks. Pressure cookers. Pressure cookers. Al Qaeda. So I figure, you know, maybe if, like, everybody presses that button, or if enough people press that button, it'll make it irrelevant that they're monitoring us, you know? It's awesome. But also, it'll probably get me blown up or taken... Now, here's the funny thing. I like to joke with you. Sometimes I'll tweet to you. I don't want to walk too close to you because of drones. Yeah, because... But can you tell... Are you aware of what happened? Of course you are aware of what happened to Hastings. Yes. Can you... I want to take a break to get more beaters. Yes, that sounds great. And then, can you just tell the story of what happened to Hastings? Yeah, absolutely. Okay, cool. The story of Hastings. All right, so Hastings was an amazing revolutionary journalist who never ceased to call out the power elite, totally cut through all the bullshit rhetoric every time he appeared on corporate media, brought down Stanley McChrystal, who was the commanding general of the Afghanistan War. I mean, this was a journalist who didn't fuck around. He knew what journalism was all about, even if it meant taking down an entire commanding general and getting a shitstorm because of it. And when he was doing that, when that all went down, he had several death threats against him by people who said, you know, we're gonna fucking kill you. And so he expressed like, you know, I'm scared, I'm getting these threats. Months later, I mean, this was a while back, but months later, you know, he dies in this fiery car crash going like 100 miles an hour down a residential street in LA. His car explodes. People have said that they saw sparks going off before the car hit the palm tree. And my question is, why would someone be driving 100 miles an hour down a fucking residential street in LA? Right. It seems very crazy. Like, they haven't released a toxicology report. They haven't released any of the autopsy information. Everything's really tight-lipped right now. His wife isn't really speaking about it. He knows about his body. They cremated his body against his family's wishes. Yeah, they, I haven't verified that. I heard that there was actually, that was misreported. But I did speak to this woman who's investigating it from San Diego, and she said that she's trying to get all these FOIA requests, try to get the information about what really fucking happened and why the investigation's being so closed off. And then I spoke to his friend Joe Biggs, who was in Afghanistan when he was embedded there doing reporting, and he said, look, something's very suspicious here. It's just very suspicious, because right before he died, he sent out this email to his friend saying, I'm getting surveilled by the FBI. The FBI's gonna come trying to interrogate you guys. I need to go off the radar now. And that was hours before he died in this crash. It's very, very fucked up, and I have no doubt. And it's not so much that I'm thinking that it's some government conspiracy that they wanted to snuff out, you know, investigative reporters. I think, you know, if you're pissing off someone that's that high up in the military, you know people, security contractors, whatever, that could fucking take you down. I mean, that's the shit that happens. This is fucking reality. It's not, it doesn't mean that it has to be some giant conspiracy, but when you look at the actual mechanics of his car, it makes no fucking sense. To me, it seems like either the brakes were cut or something was hacked or something. And even Richard Clark, the former counter-terrorism, like, security expert for the United States, has come out and said, it looks exactly like a car hacking. And this is something that you can actually, like, overtake the command system of someone's car and every new car that exists and do it and overtake it. Every new car. Mm-hmm. So, here you have an investigative journalist who was, I think, was assassinated. I think you'd be out of your fucking mind to think that was an accident. Clearly, he was murdered. He was assassinated. Like, I was assassinated. He was, that was a hit. So, and now we've got Snowden who's fled to Russia. It's so ridiculous. It's so ridiculous. It's insane. But when, in the history books, when they go back and they look at the history of America, if things go in the Alex Jones direction and they continue to lock down, people are going to think, why didn't they get the fuck out of there? They saw what was happening. Like, how many more incidents like this have to happen before either people start leaving the country or people start doing more than just complaining about it on podcasts? I think that they don't, people are so complacent and so conditioned to be living in the system that we're living, that as long as they don't step outside of their comfort zone, like, the government has everyone under their thumb. And I've said this many times, like, when you look back at FDR and, like, all of World War II and the whole internment of Japanese people that were American citizens, I mean, we're talking about over, like, 100,000 people who were swept up, round up and put in internment camps. That is the most fucked up, scarred black mark on American history. But now, they don't need to do that because now they have us all in a fishbowl where we're all living in a grid where we are in 1884. We don't need a telescreen in our house because we have it on every single device that we carry around like our fucking, like it's a heart monitor. I mean, we don't leave the house without our cell phone and they can tap into that. That is the modern-day telescreen. So they don't need to intern us, round us up, put us in fucking FEMA camps. We already kind of are in an open-air internment camp in this country. Wow. But what a great open-air internment camp. It sure is great. It's so fun. We've got beer. You've got porn. You've got porn. Cookies. Cookies, Starcraft, medicinal marijuana. It's not a bad internment camp. It's not bad. I want to ask you, if, just as a thought experiment, if you knew for sure that this surveillance that they're doing is going to prevent some event in the future that's going to do another Boston marathon where kids get killed and athletes get their legs blown off, would you still say that we shouldn't do the surveillance? Absolutely not. Or I'm sorry, absolutely. Well, I will always say that they should not be this type of surveillance and I'll tell you why, because even when it came out that the Sarnayev brother was on some sort of list and we were being warned by the Russian government that he was kind of this extreme radical from going to Chechnya doing all this shit, even then I was like, oh my god, so we're ignoring real terrorist threats and then spying on all the Occupy Boston people at the same time and that was like this whole schism at the moment. And then I thought more about it and I was like, you know what, even if someone is flagged as an extremist or a radical, I still don't condone surveilling them because in that generalization I would be flagged. Yes. You could be flagged. Anyone can be flagged. So at the time he wasn't like a terrorist, he just was pursuing radical thoughts. He was looking into like the Muslim faith or this and that. So even then, I mean, if you use that like analogy and say like, oh, we should be focused on real terrorist threats, what's a real terrorist threat? It's really whatever the definition the government wants to implant on someone. So I don't agree with spying at all. I don't ever think surveillance is going to prevent tragedy. All it can do is help you maybe like, you know, zero in on someone that did something fucked up. My question about the boss and bombing without getting too crazy into it is why have we never seen the surveillance camera of the brothers dropping the backpack when they told us that they had it? That's how they link the brothers to the bombing. They never released the video. I'm just like, why the fuck didn't you release the video? I mean, it would just close the circle for everyone. Why? Makes no sense. I don't know. So that being said, I want to, let's imagine that something's happened. There was a particle accelerator accident. You're now the president of the United States. I'm your vice president. You know that you are existing in a country. That is under, because we've been blowing kids up with drones in other parts of the world, we don't have a lot of fans right now. And so you know that we've been sticking our stick in a lot of different ants' nests for a lot of years. So you know that people want to blow us up. I would. If I lived in Afghanistan and my kid got blown up by a drone and I knew people who got killed by drones and I didn't really have anything else to live for because I watched my family get transformed into hamburger, I would, if I had access to the United States, there would be some part of me that thought, you know what, I think I want a little bit of payback. And I imagine that there is a real threat. I think the terrorist threat is real. Now it is. Yeah, now it is. Sure, the fuck is. It definitely is. Ten years of fucking war, blowing up other countries. Absolutely. Okay, so there's a real threat. So now you're the president of the United States. You know that there's a real threat. You've been going around punching people in bars all over the planet. And so there's some people who want some payback. What are you going to do? How are you going to keep this from happening? Aren't you going to want to use every single thing that you possibly can to keep your citizens from dying? And surveillance is definitely not a tool that you would use to keep your citizens from dying. But here's the thing. Even if 9-11 was not fishy, even if, you know, there's nothing fishy about any of these terrorist things that have happened here, you have to look at the terrorism as it's existed on U.S. soil for the last decade plus, totally a non-existent threat, even if you were to take those events into account as real events that, and I'm not saying that they weren't real. I'm just saying I have a lot of questions about 9-11. I think that the boss in bombing, I think the Sarnay brothers were guilty. However, I haven't seen the evidence that has proven it. However, even if you're taking those events into account, the threat of terrorism is still so non-existent, you're still more likely to get shot and dead by a police officer or slip in your bathtub and die, or accidentally suffocate in bed. So when you look at it relatively, like the actual threat facing us, there is no threat. There literally is no threat of terrorism facing this country. Okay. Now, again, I'm going to play devil's advocate. Yeah, go for it. Literal devil's advocate and say, okay, but you're the president. And I, you know, as part of this show I did with Joe, we went and visited this lab in Galveston that's working on vaccines for some of the worst diseases that exist to prepare for an attack from a bioterrorist, which is a real possibility. The technology out there right now for fucking around with genomes and stuff and DNA, I don't understand it, but it's very accessible. And so they're really worried about somebody whipping up some version of the bird flu and bringing it over to the United States. So also, you know that with North Korea making nukes and with the fall of the Soviet Union and what happened to some of their nukes and the nukes in Pakistan and that unstable regime over there, you know that there is a lot of money in selling nuclear weapons to people who know that if they detonated a nuclear bomb in downtown New York, it would crash the United States economy. Stop the war machine and probably, or at least probably wouldn't stop it, but it would definitely fuck us up. It would fuck up our economy. Just a small little nuclear device went off in any part of the country. That's it. That's pretty much it. That's the one little nudge. That's the one little nudge, President Martin, that we need to push this fucking thing over into the sea. So you know that. It's not just like, I know that getting hit by a, getting killed by a terrorist right now is a small threat, but we're talking about five years, 10 years, 15 years down the road. So you're speaking in just hypothetically if that were to happen, what would we do to prevent something like that from happening? Wouldn't you do anything that you could do to keep that from happening? Absolutely. I think every life is precious. I don't want to see anyone dying at the fault of someone else's incompetence or negligence. However, nothing that we've implemented has actually been to prevent terrorism. So I mean, I think everything can be done with just normal counterintelligence police work. And that's, I mean, we saw that before 9-11, the light was blinking red. There was like 20 different high intelligence briefings to the CIA and the president saying this is coming. They chose to ignore it. So I mean, that could have been easily prevented. There you go. There you go. That's it, right? That's the answer. The answer is we knew about fucking bin Laden for so long before bin Laden did that shit, even if that is real. We're the ones who radicalized the Taliban in Afghanistan during the Soviet Union when the Soviets were there fighting. We're the ones who propped up the Islamic regime because we funded bin Laden's army. Even the papers here published saying anti-Soviet hero with bin Laden's face on it. I mean, this is the fuckery that happens when we start messing with the planet. I think that the best way to prevent any future huge-scale terrorist attacks right now or blowback from all of our drone wars is to apologize to everyone, remove most if not all of the 900 military bases on the planet, stop spending trillions of dollars maintaining our empire of bases, apologize to the Muslim world for what we've done, remove all drones, and also stop spying on everyone and just say, you know, we're really sorry, we want to revert back to like an actual sane society where we can have like intelligent discourse and not just blow people up based on, you know, mathematical patterns of when they're running around in groups. I just had this image of you sitting tied to a chair in a government facility high on Sodium Penethal, and they're like, we want to play something for you. And they play what you just said. That's going to happen. What do you think of that? What did you mean when you said we should apologize? Apologize. Apologize to the barbarians who brought those down. The barbarians? Well, you know, it is a, I think everything that you just said is exactly why you should be president and is why you never will be. But I do think it's simple logic like that and I know that for some reason they've really got its condition to think that you're not supposed to apologize if you're the president. Which is really weird, like everyone apologized. People make mistakes, you know, and I think that would be an incredible moment in human history to imagine the president coming out and saying, I fucked up. I fucked up. I fucked up. I got manipulated. I didn't know what to do. You guys don't know what it's like here. This sucks. What kind of frigging pressure I'm under. Do you know the pills they give me? That's my daily injections. I realize there's a rooster-headed demigod that lives in the basement of the White House that has a hypnotic hum that comes out of its feathers and when you hear it, you just want to kill. You talk to a braxis. You try it. You go breezing with a thing. It just wants to kill. It's in the basement. We've been trying to get it out for years. Dude, people still defend... Oh, I didn't vote for Obama. I realized that the two-party system was a sham when Kerry took a dive in 2004, but I still have people who are such staunch Obama apologist and they tell me all the time, Obama really means well. He doesn't mean to do any of this. And yes, to an extent, of course, any president is an operator of the system. But at the same time, I can't help but think of this revelation that came out. I was interviewing the chief prosecutor at Guantanamo Bay on the show and I was just like, you know, who's super anti-Gitmo, he says we should fucking close it. It's just a total scar on American legacy. And I was like, do you think that Obama's reverting to kill more people with the drones because Gitmo's been such bad press and it was such bad press for Bush and he was like, you know, that's a really sad commentary if Obama's just now killing people because he doesn't want to deal with the bad press of Gitmo. A month later, the chief architect of the drone policy, John Bellinger, came out to some fucking think tank in DC and he was like, you know, Obama's like using drones so much is because he doesn't want to deal with the bad press of Gitmo. So he's like using drones to just like as the counter-terrorism strategy to just like take out the terrorists instead of just holding them at Gitmo. And I was like, wow, that's a fucking sad reality. What? The architect of the... What? John Bellinger, dude. Guardian. Yeah. Bellinger said that? Wow. That's where we're at. Let's talk about drones. Hey, wait, are you... Are you afraid that the FBI's going to come back to your house, Duncan? Are you going to do a FEMA camp in a plastic coffin? Look, I have a fantasy about getting abducted. I think it's like... It's something kinky that I'm into. It's like a fetish. I like the idea of getting abducted, tied to a chair. I hope they feed me psychedelics. I'll tell them anything they want. I'll tell them anything they want. They can do whatever they want. So I, you know, I kind of feel like it's a... It's a... Look, I don't believe that this is the only incarnation that people have. I think that we've been here eternally and I think that one great way to exit this particular incarnation is by being assassinated by a repressive government. And so if you end up with that sacred death, then that means that you've been doing something really, really, really good in the world. So what? How do you want to die? You want to die of a heart attack, watching Wheel of Fortune? Or do you want to get taken out like Hastings, you know? Getting into his car after a night out in the town. He looks over and there's some guy in a black mask. He's like, yeah, this happens. Right. You know, I think that there's something to be said for dying like a hero and I don't think I'm really up for that because I imagine that when the government's going through its list of people to assassinate, bearded, weirdo, stoner, hipsters with mildly popular podcasts are probably way, way, way down on their list of people to blow up. But I think that would be a cool moment because it's kind of like when the Mormons come over. It's like when the Mormons come over, you get to talk to them like, man, you know Joseph Smith was just the white salamander, bro. What? That's Joseph Smith saw the white salamander who told him all this shit. It was basically like a psychedelic vision that he saw a white salamander. Wait. We got to stop the press Stop the press I know I've been reading Under the Banner of Heaven by Krakauer and I have heard no mention of a white salamander. That's like one of the only things I know about the original story of Joseph Smith. Swear to God. Swear to the Book of Mormon. But no, yes. Would I rather die of my brain melting away through Alzheimer's and slowly dying of cancer and fucking like withering away and having my mind not be able to remember yesterday? No, of course I'd rather die being fucking eaten by a shark or taken out by the feds. And so I think that that moment of having people come to your house is an incredibly validating moment because it shows you that somehow you've managed to really rile up the dragon enough that it's coming to pay you a visit. And I think that if you're if they're coming to pay you a visit for telling the truth I'm not coming to pay you a visit because you've been storing up fertilizer in your backyard. More collecting child porn. Yeah, yeah, exactly. If they're coming to pay you a visit for telling the truth and you're a true American and you're that's one of the medals that you get for being a true American is because you believe in the country enough that you would die for it by exercising your freedom of speech to express what you think are violations that the government is making. That's what's so amazing is people have said you know, I'm anti American, I'm unpatriotic, it's like actually I would die to save this country you just fucking like love of fascist whatever like you love a fucking surveillance police state is that being American? I don't know if that's really the fundamental of like what this country should have been. I think there's a spectrum of people and on one side of the spectrum there's people who would die for the country and on the other side there's people who want to kill for the country. True. Very true. They don't want to die so much but they sure want to kill. They just want to kill a bunch of rag tub Fox News man, you cannot go 10 minutes without one of their goddamn journalists saying we should execute somebody. No matter who it is, Snowden the guy who tied the women and pretty much anybody who's done a crime, someone on Fox News will say this, we should execute them. Did you know that they just ran out of the execution drug in Texas because they've been killing so many people? It's hilarious. Isn't that hilarious? That's so funny. That's such a funny problem. We're out, John. We're out, guys. Get in the load in, get in the shipment. God man, that's death drug. If you're on death row though that's a great thing that have happened is they run out of the death drug. Man, I want to ask you what are some this is something that I wonder about all the time is what are some actions that I can take to stop this surveillance program and to fight against what's happening with the drone war and to get people out of Afghanistan and just shut down, get mo. And all the things that you were just talking about that you want to do as president what are some things that we can do to move us closer to that reality? I think that ideally, you know, I'd love to have some sort of representational democracy where we can all actually have a say in what happens but given the system that is, you know, exists I think that the recent vote on the Amash amendment which was this guy representative Amash who tried to amend the NSA surveillance program where he said let's stop funding this blanket surveillance and the vote to actually do that was so close. I mean we're talking about like 217 to 207 representatives that actually voted to withhold this program and it shows you how much the public perception is actually shifting against this sort of thing and I think we have a lot to think for to Glenn Greenwald and Edward Snowden because of that but it really, more people right now in America care about civil liberties than they do terrorism which is huge. It's a huge shift in consciousness and I think that speaking out, I mean honestly just continuing this dialogue and continuing to be resilient and honestly like what you were saying before this new website that you have an idea for I think just constantly saying shit without being scared don't let fear rule your life don't ever think about the fact oh the government's listening to me because the more people who just speak out and express themselves the harder it's going to be to do this drag net like persecution or I'm sorry, surveillance and then persecution on people who are like the isolated individuals who are doing this kind of stuff and also just reinforcing like the fact that we have the ability to fucking inspire and change people and also just being your personal responsibility you know my brother always says one person can't really do anything and he kind of like deflects the whole environmental movement by saying it should happen at the federal level before we can really make a change but really we can't make a change I mean if you just kind of give up your agency and say well I'm not going to be able to do anything nothing's ever going to be able to get done I think all of us can be proactive individuals and at the same time realize that you can't become disempowered if you can't fucking change the world you have to realize how much power you have but never like underestimate that power like that woman who got shot in the face by the Taliban for example, look at them changes that she's that's happening with her but give us something give us an action aside from talking to our family not being afraid making ridiculous websites what are some actionable moves people listening to this can make right after they stop listening to this that can help in the direction of civil liberties and the direction of stopping these ridiculous wars here's the most simple thing we can do is realize that every single thing that we do this is a vote fuck the entire two-party dictatorship that's not going to do shit what's running our country right now is a conglomerate of corporations corporate America is run by a very small minority of people who have no like they have no elected positions so really all we can do is phase these giant corporations into a relevancy by stop supporting them like we cannot support Monsanto anymore we cannot support BP we cannot fucking invest in Haliburton after these horrible um, criminal like admittances like BP fucking their stocks are up Haliburton's stocks are up after they admitted to destroying evidence in the wake of the BP oil spill why why are there fucking stocks up these corporations should be forced into fucking irrelevancy and like we all have the ability to with purchasing power that's really like we are seen as just consumer horrors by the establishment so we should treat them back using our consumer purchasing power to like feed into whatever don't go get gas at BP stations yeah exactly like this is like all of these small things that you just dismiss and deflect as like pointless and trivial stop buying your bombs from Haliburton and stop fucking purchasing Nestle bottled water I can't stress that enough what is that you mean uh what's what is why okay so Nestle is a I didn't really know too much about Nestle until recently but pretty much every bottled water that exists is owned by Nestle Nestle is a corporation outside from the chocolate slave labor they they have a monopoly on water and they are extracting water taking it away from local municipalities during droughts totally fucked up shit and the fact that they are extracting it and basically charging 53 million percent more than they would extract it from the ground and just surrounding it basically it's tap water it's the same thing as you get in your faucet and they've been sued because it's literally they just sell tap water are you fucking kidding wait what are Nestle brands Nestle brand Arrowhead Poland Spring it's true dude Nestle is terrible and when I called them out on I called them out on the show and I got a threatening we got like a letter from the company saying like you know basically threatening us saying what are you going to do about it Abby's making these hysterical unsubstantiated allegations against the company and I wrote them back I said would you come on the show to talk to me so we can you know set the record straight and instead of sending someone on the show to talk to me they sent an android replicant like video of this woman she's like hello Abby my name is Stephanie from Nestle I saw the video you wrote about water and here's my response and she just like I saw it that was their response and so I was just like I just kind of debunked it the former CEO of Nestle has said that water is a food stuff I mean he says it's basically should be treated like any other food that we should privatize water and really when you privatize something that that every living creature on earth needs to survive it's like air I mean the privatization of something literally means taking people's like power out of that item and when you're talking about privatization of water it's a very dangerous slippery slope he who controls the spice controls the universe if Nestle can control water they've taken over the planet yeah yeah Nestle's crazy ah man Abby you are so cool I think that is so cool when you get to you know getting visited by the FBI okay maybe we don't get to look forward to that in this incarnation but even getting a cool video response from Nestle that was pretty sweet that's badass that means you're shaking things up and I'm so glad that we've got people like you out there thank you Duncan I'm happy to have you I'm happy to be here dude it's

And we're never short on options at jcp.com. All dressed up, everywhere to go. JCPenney. Greetings to you, beautiful friends. It is I, Dee Trussell. And you are listening to the Dugga Trussell Family Hour podcast. Number one, I'm sorry about my voice. I know it sounds more cracked and broken than usual, but I'll explain. My dad just passed away, and I'm sitting in a hotel in Daphne, Alabama after having spent several days helping my father transition and having a few breakdowns along the way. Don't worry, I'm fine. Literally fine, not fake fine, not saying I'm fine. I'm fine. Thank God for the Ram Dass retreats, and thank God for all the things that they have taught me about how to be with dying people and how to deal with my own grief, and mostly how to get myself out of the way to let the dying person have their death, which is an easy thing to not do. You'll notice when the next time you find yourself sitting with a dying person, you'll find there's a wide variety of reactions to death, from complete avoidance to turning the entire fucking thing into a play in which the dying person is an extra. I got a call last Monday that my dad had taken a downturn. COPD is one of the number one killers of people on the planet based on my internet research. It's a shitty disease. Your lungs just gradually stop working, and as part of that, you can end up getting confused in the last stages, which is what was happening with my dad. And so I knew I had to get down there, so we took a red eye. My wife and I took a red eye and got to Alabama and got to my dad's place and spent the next few days making sure that he was comfortable and letting his friends know that he had gotten really sick. My dad was the eternal optimist and the epitome of the Southern gentleman, and he was not going to let you know if he was feeling bad. And that's a double-edged sword, man. That's a double-edged sword. And he didn't want his friends, who he had a great many, to be worried about him in his last days. So he just didn't let him know. And they were all taken by surprise, but once they found out his house suddenly filled up with some incredibly delicious Southern food and some very wonderful people who all spent a little bit of time with my dad. And he would say to them, after spending a little time chatting with them, you would say, if you don't mind, I think I'm just going to take a nap now for a couple of hours. And this is going to sound like I don't mean it or like I'm passively feeling sorry for myself, and I really mean it, and I'm not feeling sorry for myself. But both of my parents, I just am so blown away with the grace that they transitioned out of this universe. And to be honest, I haven't been around that many dying people. Only 7,000. I haven't been around that many dying people, so I don't know how people die. Maybe all people die peacefully. But man, my parents, in their own way, really made it easy on everyone around them. It's one of the things that the hospice teaches you. The hospice that took care of my father was Southern care hospice. They did a wonderful job. And these people are angels. I don't know how anybody could do that job, man. But they're so good at keeping this aura of peacefulness in a situation that can very quickly get really dramatic and sad. And one of the things that they tell you is that when a person's dying, it's good to convey to them that it's OK for them to die. Because if somebody loves you or if they feel worried about you, they will prolong their death. Now, that seems to imply that you could live forever just by worrying that the people around you are going to be sad. It's not like that. But you can extend your death, I think. You can't cling to this world longer than you need to and suffer a lot more than you need to. If you get the feeling that you're leaving too soon or that people in this realm still need you, so that's one of the things they teach you is how to say goodbye. And honestly, do it honestly, which I was fortunate enough to do that with my dad. And to really tell him how much I loved him and tell him I was going to be fine. And I got to watch his friends do the same. And I got to watch his wonderful cousin do the same. And my brother do the same. And it was a really sweet thing to watch. And I hope that doesn't sound morbid or weird. But I mean, I hope this isn't a spoiler, but everybody dies. And when you get really close to it, you realize it's natural. The thing is water running downhill or rain or wind or anything of the natural world. What isn't natural about it is all the fucking forms. And I'm not going to get into how absolutely obscene and horrific it is to find yourself simultaneously trying to connect with your father and allow him a peaceful passing while filling out forms related to what's going to happen with his body or dealing with his car, the bank, or just all the obscenities of the modern world that go along with it. Holy shit, that's another podcast intro. I'm not going to go into it too much. But since I was 15, my father has said that he wanted to donate his body to the University of Alabama. When you're 15, you don't really listen to that. That's a thing you just immediately tune out. Number one, you don't think your dad's really going to die. Number two, you don't want to imagine your dad's body being shipped off to be autopsied by a bunch of fucking college kids, which is how I pictured it when I was 15, my dad's body next to a kegger. But that was my dad's wish since I was 15, and it continued to be his wish. So we donated his body to science. And I'm just scanning the forms that you have to sign. And those are some pretty dark forms, friends. Those are some pretty dark forms. And I think I could talk about it now, because I think my dad would think it was pretty funny. But one of the clauses in there is just something on the lines of not in this language. Just so you know, your dad's body doesn't say your dad's body, but that's how I read it. Your dad's body might be used for weapons testing, among other things, including plastinization. So that was a fun thing I got to do, is imagine that possibly at this moment, my dad's body is being used to train robot DARPA dogs. My dad's body could easily be being devoured by a swarm of metallic bees and some subbasement of DARPA. I kept thinking about the forms. The forms are what bothers me. I've been talking to David Graber on Twitter. He wrote this great book called The Utopia of Rules, and just the strangeness of forms and bureaucracy. And I can't wait to talk to him about the particularly unnerving place where forms and death meet. But that was a very small part of this experience. I'm sorry for the bummer intro. But Jesus Christ, what do you guys want? My dad just died, all right? Whoever you are. If there's literally somebody out there thinking, what a fucking bummer. Come on, man. Lighten this one up a little bit. Do you really have to talk about your dad's body being attacked by robot fucking bees? I'm sorry. Here's the thing. My dad loved life more than anybody I've ever met. As far as I'm aware, he didn't meditate a day in his life. He didn't read the Bhagavad Gita. He didn't read the Bible. But he read a lot. And he loved a lot. And he was reckless and wild. But he was filled with joy. And his phone is just pictures of dogs and recipes and loving texts to his friends. And his body stopped working for him. And now one of the sweetest souls that I've ever encountered is free. And that's good news. And I'll tell you this. If there is an afterlife, then there are a lot of happy dogs that are currently swarming my father. Because that man loved dogs. And dogs loved my dad. And I can't think of a much greater compliment than that. So rest in peace, puppy. I love you, dad. And I'll be seeing you. But hopefully not at a museum where they plastinated your body. OK, we're going to jump right into this podcast. But first, some quick business. This episode of the DTFH has been supported by Mack Weldon. Friends, I'm going to read to you everything that I'm supposed to read for Mack Weldon. But I did the ultimate product test of Mack Weldon. And I'm going to share it with you. I don't advertise anything on the show that I haven't tried out. So I got some Mack Weldon socks. They are very comfortable. They look awesome. And I was wearing them around the house, making sure that they didn't rip. Or I don't know. Who knows? You don't know. I don't know. If I'm going to talk about something, if I'm going to recommend something to you guys, I want it to be really nice. And I am a sock snob. I am a pure devotee to the idea of dumping out your sock drawer from time to time and refilling it with socks. So I got some Mack Weldon socks. I'm walking around the house. And I stepped in a nice, watery, wet pile of poodle diarrhea, wearing Mack Weldon socks. And friends, let me tell you, it was a miracle. Because it didn't go through the sock. It didn't get on my foot. You know, other socks, thin socks, weak socks. A weak man's sock. A weak woman's sock. Low-grade socks, crap socks. A fool's sock. You step in poodle diarrhea. And it's going to go right through the fabric and get all of your foot. But a Mack Weldon sock is somehow merged together, pure comfort and some kind of iron. I don't know what it is. I don't know how they weave their magical socks. It's like a Dungeons & Dragons style sock. This was not normal dog shit. This was my poodle. They were eating these palm nuts that have actually, believe it or not, psychoactive qualities. They're very similar to nicotine. So they were getting addicted to these nuts. And he'd been eating those nuts. And I'd given him like an extra piece of rotisserie chicken and the two combined to create a watery puddle of just demon poodle poop that I stepped on in Mack Weldon socks. And I realized, my god, if this isn't product testing, I don't know what is. It did not penetrate the sock. And I'm going to say this, and you can make fun. Just know this is how important it is to me that the stuff I yap about on this show is good. I smelled my foot to see if any of the stink had gotten through the sock onto my foot. And friends, it had not. It was just my normal foot stink. Certainly not the smell of acrid, beetle nut, poodle shit. I could not give Mack Weldon a higher recommendation than that. If you can somehow combine comfort with the ability to shield your foot from dog shit, then you have created something mythological. If you ask me, maybe they get these socks by traveling into some other realm. Maybe they're woven with elf hair. I don't know. Now here's what they want me to say. Mack Weldon believes in smart design, premium fabrics, and simple shopping. It was easy. I went online. It's easy. It's very, very simple shopping experience.

Today's guest is a genius, an author who's written some incredible books. The one I'm reading right now is called Hallelujah Anyway. She was at the Ram Dass Retreat, and we did this interview with her in the midst of the retreat. She was kind enough to give us an hour to sit down and talk with her. This is a podcast that was done for Ragu Marcus's amazing podcast, Mind Rolling, but he's given me permission to upload it here. So everybody, please welcome to the Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour podcast, Ragu Marcus and Annie Lamont. Well, we're sitting here at this lovely Ram Dass Retreat. I'm sitting here with my partner, Dunkin' Trussell and Hi, Duncan. And luckily for us, Ann Lamont, Annie, welcome. Thank you. This must be a pretty good scene, though, right? We have a retreat around no death, no fear, yet we are going snorkeling in the ocean. Turtle watching and overeating while we're still here on the mortal quail. So let me ask you, you came here. I don't even think you had no idea about anything. You just wanted to come and hang, right? We wanted to come be with you in Ram Dass. So I was at a doing an event in Seattle and a woman who makes stuff for the jewelry to sell. The story came up to me and said who she was, and she was involved. Somehow I said, I was going to call Ragu this morning, or I was going to tech, which I really had. And she wrapped this bracelet around, so sort of like tying a string around your finger in big time. And I came home and I wrote to you and I said, hey, Ragu, you can kneel, my partner and I come see you in Ram Dass. And you said, oh, why don't you just come be our guest at the retreat? So we said, OK. And we got tickets the next day. And then a few hours later, we were here. Unbelievable. And then, of course, you had no idea about no death, no fear. No, we had no idea. And now, what's your feedback, all of a sudden, being in the midst of Roshi Joan Halifax, Frank Osteceski, Ram Dass, Christian Dawson, Bob Thurman, in terms of that particular teaching. Because I've been hearing, he's been talking to a lot of people, Duncan. And there's a lot of young people here. And he's been saying, this is really scary stuff, especially if you're in the younger generation. You're not thinking about death. And you probably have not necessarily been next to somebody in your family or whatever. Maybe not even a pet that's passed. So we've been trying to address that a little bit. Fortunately, Mr. Truss will provide some levity to the occasion. And then Bob Thurman did as well. But what's your take on the theme? And what are you getting? Well, I've actually had a lot of deaths in my life. If you've read my stuff, you know my dad died and very tragically a brain cancer 40 years ago when I was young. And my best friend died. And after I had my baby. And I've just been somebody that if someone in someone's family is going to die, they know I've been through it. So I've always been sort of summoned because I don't feel scared about it. I mean, I feel scared that my son or my grandson will die or my dog panic-stricken really. But mostly I don't. And Neil, my partner, is a hospice volunteer. He's always coming home from people he's just visited. And we have a very dear friend who died while we were here, actually, yeah, two days ago. And we've been with her a lot. And he's done a memoir with her. And so we've been immersed in her illness and being there and visiting. And so I thought it was funny, yeah, because there are so many young people in everywhere. They went, it was like death, death, death, rot. Because when you're a kid, too, when you're young, there's a lot more worms involved in the discussion of death, right? And there's songs that go with it. The worms crawl. Yeah, right, right, right. But when I was young, well, when I was young, my dad was Scott, so sick when I was 23. And this is in the mid, late 70s. And you literally didn't mention death. It was a bad manners. And it really wasn't until the AIDS epidemic that you could talk about death. And that death at someone's time was really short. You were supposed to not notice that they weighed 70 pounds. And they needed oxygen. And you were supposed to like, because we were polite. We were children of the 50s. But when my dad got sick, Neal's heard this 1,000 times. But we had a really dear friend who also had cancer at the time, Susan Dunn. And he just didn't say the word. It was like a buzzkill, right? So they would sit outside the coffee house in Belenus. And dad would say, well, Susan, how's your cancer today? Really loudly, you know? And then my dad would say, well, Susan, say, well, my cancer's OK. I think, Ken, how's yours? And he'd say, well, I think I'm a little weaker. And so my first novel was called Hard Laughter. And it was about laughing about this very hard stuff. It's easy to laugh when it's delightful or neurotic or really universal and kind of kicky. But when you can laugh about this thing, like when my dad died, it was like a nuclear bomb was falling on my family because he was the center of our life. I have older and younger brothers. And so I kind of got stuck with it early on. But there wasn't this consciousness. There wasn't this spiritual nomenclature that we're talking about soul as opposed to the broken down old car that's finally run its course. But then I got involved with reading Ram Dass' books early on. And that took away a ton of your year very, how old are you? Do my am I asking? 44. Are you really? God, you are so great looking. You have beautiful skin. It's a blessing. There's no reason to feel embarrassed. It's a blessing. I think probably God just loves you more than other people. That's how it works. That's a Christian path. There is a hierarchical love with God, right? But you may get a much nicer seat in heaven because of it, too, like near the dessert table or the cheeses. You're not pulling me in. No, it's true. The cheeses. The cheese, the cheese and the baguettes. God loves Dick Cheney. Exactly the same as he loves me. I've written that. I have written that I would wash Dick Cheney's feet, and I believe he would wash mine. But anyway, so I think it's scary. It's kind of tough stuff. But if I were young, oh my god, if I had had this information at 30 and 40, my whole life would have been quantifiably better, easier, much more free, much more everything. Because everything in us, via the culture and our parents, is to be terrified and shut down and not be with it. Because first of all, it's bad manners. And second of all, it's just so defeating that you have this beautiful life, and you've kind of conned some people into loving you, and you've roped a man. And they're going to die. I have a grandchild who looks like God, and he may die. I'm not positive, but he may die someday. But to have known this and to have been able to dance with it, instead of to hide from it, would have changed my life literally more than any other information I could have gotten.

Everybody that's listening right now, this is exactly. I mean, this is what I said to you the other day when we talked about this, that it's, first of all, everything you just said is so apropos. I wish I would have started earlier. I would have been able to be a lot more friendly towards the fear and walk towards it rather than run from it. But the other thing is, in this whole thing, we're talking about, and I read this thing of Milarepa, where I went to conquer my fear of death. And he sat in the cave forever. And I found the deathless state. Or that which. When you said that, you know what I thought? How about Milarepa? You get strapped into a radiation, one of those radiation machines. I had testicular cancer. I know. Hey, Milarepa, you get strapped into a radiation machine when they're playing Tina Turner. When they decide to play Tina Turner and they're blasting your lymph nodes, then let's talk about death. Oh, you went to a nice cave, beautiful with a great view, and you're a monk, and you're not attached to anyone, and you're wandering free and clear. What about the fact that, like, you get, you know what I'm talking about? What about that Milarepa, where you've got to make the phone call to your family and be like, oh, yeah, one of my balls has death inside of it. Then do a nice koan, Milarepa. That being said, I'm so grateful for these teachings, because it certainly helped. I don't mean to sound cynical or jaded. What I'm talking about is also it creates an environment where we can start to relate with that thing in us, whatever we want to call it. Soul, Buddha mind, whatever, nirvana, that is not subject to this fear. It's like Ram Dass' talk about you've got to operate on more than one plane at a time in this life. So that's very important. And by the way, Milarepa could have been in the MRI, the radiation machine, whatever. Guarantee he wouldn't. He didn't drink Diet Coke. He didn't leave his laptop on his balls for five years straight. And may I ask you a question? You were saying you wish that you had this when you were younger. So many artists that I've talked to, particularly comedians, when they're confronted with this stuff, they say, I'm afraid this is going to destroy my ability to be funny. Do you think if you encountered this earlier on, would it have affected your writing in some way? Does that thought ever come into your mind that these kinds of positive transformations, I know much of what you write about is faith, and it's beautiful. But looking at the stream of your evolution as an artist, do you ever think, well, wait, maybe if I encountered this early on, I wouldn't have been such a great writer? Well, yeah. I just want to say something before I answer your question, which is I totally love that you're resistant and that there's nothing on a bumper sticker that's going to throw the lights on for you. And you're going to go, oh, well, that was then. And now I'm sorry, but the Greek can hit me with your best shot life. It's not appropriate. It's appropriate. It's very human. Just to be afraid of what we love, love, love most, we can't reach each other by phone after a point. And that's what I hate. And I loved last night. I forgot who was talking. Maybe it was Mr. Thurman when he's, or I don't know who it was. But they said, I don't want all that love. I want him back. I felt, and it's all truth is a paradox. And when Pammy died, I felt a lot of incredible spiritual support. I felt like I was in a basket of spiritual support. And I was enraged. And it took me over 10 years to stop being grief-stricken mad. And I hate that the culture tells you that you will get over it. And that you should have a more evolved take on it all. It's just a crock of shit. And the stuff that enlivens us and heals us doesn't come on bumper stickers. It's hard fought. But a conference like this means that we're available for it. We show up. And before I turned on Woody Allen, he said 80% of life is just showing up. And we show up for it. And some of it gets in. And some of it doesn't get in. And some of it you think, that's ridiculous or not for me. Thank you, though. Thanks so much. But I think not. But anyway, it's like people are always saying, let go and let God. And I just want to stab him in the head with a fork, like a baked potato. Like if I could let go of this right now, believe me, I would. I don't love being in this clenched, raschy state. But if somebody says to me, God never gives us more than we can know, it's like, well, God didn't say that for one thing. And that's just so patronizing. And it's just so arrogant. But thanks for sharing. But we're not friends anymore. Because now, wherever I see you, I will run. But thank you. And so anyway, for me, it was very, very evolutionary. I had all the Rom-Doc books in my head. And it's like the E. E. Cummings poem. Plato told him. Lao told him. Even General Yes-Man Sherman told him. It took a Nipponite bit of the old 12th Street L to tell him about death. Everyone can tell you about death. It takes death to help you let go and go, OK, fine. This is my usual, my beautiful moment of surrender with God, as I say, with enormous bitterness. OK, fine. And that's sort of how I could come to the point with death going, OK, fine. But anyway. I love that. That's so beautiful. That's so pure and real. Good mantra. Yeah, that's a mantra. Yeah, OK, fine. Whatever. You know, I wrote a book of the three, I forgot. Help, Thanks, Wild, The Three Essential Prayers. And I thought a great fourth prayer would be whatever. Whatever. Whatever. Whatever. What's your acronym for God? There's so many. One is Good Orderly Direction. That's kind of for our Hindu and Buddhist friends, but we don't buy that for a second. The one with despair. I don't know. There's a good gift of desperation. That's it. That's a great one. Well, that's a very recovery-based one. And that's a very dark night of the soul one. That you don't do the work if things are going really well and no one's mad at you and you're doing fine financially and you've kept your weight down, then there's no reason to do the deep dive into the truth of our spiritual identity, which is, you know, eternal and dual citizenship of eternal and immortal and here with our Swarfi, you know, in our testicular cancer and the whole holy enchilada. And I think that's what Houston Smith called it. But back to your question from 10 minutes ago, which was a good one. Do I think that having made friends with death earlier than I did, would it have changed my writing or that kind of sense of urgency that I think probably artists are talking about when they say that this or that might have kind of either calmed them so much that they didn't get that very, very edgy writing going that made people respond? I always felt I got sober 32 years ago. But by the time I was sober, I had four, I think, four books out already. And I had a career. I had this whole thing. I still live in the county where I was born and raised. I'm 64. You know, everyone I love and need, my aunts and uncles, my mom and dad and cousins, and everybody was there. So I was loved out of all sense of proportion. And I felt terror that if I stopped drinking, I would never write again. Because I needed the misery. Because I needed that edge. And I needed the shame. And I needed the raging, sick ego. And I felt that without those, and then with 10 or 11 cool, refreshing beers at night to relax with, I wouldn't be able to. I wouldn't be sufficiently crazy enough to even be funny anymore. But that's one of the lies of the disease or of the ego, that if you are well and if you're happy, the jigs up. Because you agreed when you were a little kid not to be too big or too juicy because it makes everybody else look like they're not doing that well. And if you're doing too well, I don't know. The whole psychological thing. I think this in Christianity, this is the one of the really cool things about Christianity is that you get to use the word Satan. And I can't think of anything truly more satanic than that thought, a force in the universe telling you that should you become happy and healthy, then the thing you love doing the most will suck. That's straight out of an imp's mouth. Well, the disease of addiction and black belt codependence and gambling and sex and love addiction, all of it, and I don't use the word Satan, I can tell you very often, but I would say it's satanic. And I would say the drug cartels. I don't think Trump is satanic. I feel like the raging narcissism inside of him is disease. He came from a family of disease. He had a violent father. His brother died of the father. His brother died, suicide by alcoholism, and Donald Trump is still alive, but it's like a form of very agitated, caffeinated death that he brings to the common well. But I wouldn't say it is satanic. I would say the disease of the self, the raging, hateful ego and addiction to power is satanic. And I've been with Neil a year and a half, and he's never, I don't think, heard me say the word Satan before, because then you always think church lady, and you're like, well, isn't that special? Yeah. But yeah, no. And then the funny thing is that when you heal the shame and when you heal the raging, broken, wounded ego, I mean, it's a ping-pong game, right? I know you're just like me in probably all important ways that it's a constant ping-pong game between narcissism and the self-doubt and the self-loathing. And the jig is about to be up probably Wednesday, right after lunch, right? I don't get to be a writer anymore. I have to be an accountant or something. It's going to be really a stretch for me, because I'm a dropout. But so it's constantly a doubt that I'm going to be this huge, this thing. And as it heals and you sort of settle down into the silt, I actually turned out my windows got washed. And it was like the Huxley thing, doors of perception, but not approached from a psychedelic point of view. But from a cleaner windows and easier, healthier breath, and cleaner lungs. And also the weird thing that you agreed not to do as a child and you signed a contract for to not pay attention, right? Because if you're paying attention in an alcoholic home, you're seeing stuff that they can't bear for you to see or to even know. And so if you grew up with sick parents, with mentally ill parents, the first thing you agree is not to see what's going on. And I have a mother who's passed, but who's English. And so the English tradition and the alcohol tradition, my father was that, we're raging asians, the whole thing, is their life depended on us agreeing not to see what was going on. And so it's very, very hard to trust the narration of your own life, whether you're writing novels or memoirs or just being a truth teller in the world, just being an instrument of the truth as it comes through you. It's very hard, and that's where writers have to begin, because you've been told that what you see is not actually going on. And because my mother was English, by extension, what you felt was not actually what you felt. And they would explain to you that you weren't feeling the two, well, women in the 50s, you did not do anger. You did not do anger. You did not do grief, because grief made people crazy. And there was no death. So if you were crying because an animal had died, or my grandfather, it was like the big eraser came and got him when I was six. And we didn't talk about it. And so if you were having feelings, you went to your room and you didn't eat. And all the women I know have eaten, including me, have had massive eating disorders in body, because if you had feelings, you were wrong. If you thought that this was going on, you were wrong. And you were wrecking everything for everyone, no matter. No wonder mom and dad had an unhappy marriage with you spewing all these crazy hallucinations about their drinking or their mental illness. And so when I got sober, I hated it. I mean, I have always said that this place has not been a good match for me, because I was in the 50s. There was this book called The Overly Sensitive Child. And I was very, very sensitive. I had migraines. I had a sickness that wrecked the family further. And I was sensitive. And there wasn't the consciousness. It was post-war. The consciousness was that you bottle it up, and it's Eisenhower, and you mow the lawn, and it's madmen, and all that. And there wasn't this consciousness that to have a big open heart and big, goggily eyes that are seeing everything and taking it in was a beautiful thing. To grieve for a friend's lost dog was a beautiful thing. And it wasn't. It wrecked everything. It's like, oh, the battle cry at our house was, oh, for Christ's sake, Annie, now what? I'm sad about India. There are pictures of children on the cover of the National Geographic, and there's bugs on their eyes. And we're at the pound, and we're going to get a cat. But there's 30 cats. And this is very upsetting for me. I know we can't take them all home. And I would have to go outside and do it, because I felt the whole suffering of the world. And it was like, no, it's just ridiculous. There's nothing you can do, they said. Do you buy the stuff Thurman was saying about we choose our parents, and do you play around with the concept that, for whatever reason, you dropped into this dimension choosing parents that were going to squelch your, I don't. OK, wait, you've got to just frame this a little bit more than this concept. You're up there, and you're, oh, yeah, they'd be good. This is the complexity of karma, and what actually happens is beyond rational mind. He was simplifying this in that moment to give people an idea that you came in, and you described this intense, intense family life with illness, and so on. And the kind of neuroses that piled up. I could give you maybe not as big a pile, but a pretty big pile that would compare to your pile. He probably could as well. And there is something to the fact that this is what we did need for you to be able to share the way that you share with people would not have been possible without that pile of neuroses, probably. I mean, I'm sure of it, because I read your books, and I see myself in so much of it as many people do, which is why they buy the books. We should talk about that. One thing Thurman did say, Bob did say, he talked about how we indulge our neuroses as well. I mean, and that's something that we never talk about. And you mentioned a little bit in terms of grief and how it's been many, many years that you've grieved over this person, right? And he talked about, OK, we got to realize that we're indulging our neuroses at some level. We've got to say, OK. I mean, he was very glib about it in that moment yesterday, but I remembered it because I was thinking of my friend, Ramesh. I don't know if you're Ramesh and Kate. I had breakfast with him. So they lost their 14-year-old in a bike accident. And I was thinking about her, who's had a tough time for these last four or five years. So yeah, what do you think about how our neuroses, how we kind of pile on whatever it is that we are dealing with and we pile on? Is there, do you feel there's an indulgence? Well, I just also want to say that a few times I've heard you express things or doubt or do you really think or whatever? And you always seem to get shamed for it. And I think it's a little bit shaming to cut him off as if he didn't quite understand. I mean, he was, everyone's using shorthand. So sorry. Yeah, I think it's a little shaming. But because no one knows. And Bob Thurman is not the boss of me. And I saw a girl at the Last Women's March and she had a t-shirt on it said, I obey no authority, but my mom. That is so awesome. And what I think is I don't have a clue. And that there are times where, like when my friend Pammy died with a little baby, which if I were God's West Coast representative, this would not have happened. This was a mix-up. It was supposed to be Donald Rumsfeld. And yeah, it was like pay for work, foul up. And I can't get OK with it, but all truth is paradox. And I accept it. And when she was dying, I was, do you know Dale Borglum? Of course, sorry. You know Dale Borglum? He was her living dying coach. Yeah, so that's how I knew. Yeah. Now I remember. And so he was kind of coaching me, too, because it was the end of the world for me, too. We've been best friends since high school. And she helped me raise my child for a couple of years. And so he was of your ilk, Ragu, of your icky ilk. Yes, he was icky with us back in the day. He was icky with you back with Maharaji. And so he had a reincarnation feeling. And he did never try to correct my thinking. I feel like people keep trying to correct your thinking. And I saw it on stage a couple of times. And I mentioned it to Neil. And I thought that was kind of shaming. But anyway. It is part of our shift. Yeah. May I respond to that quickly? Just because I know that it can seem like that. And I know some people interpret it as that. But that is the shtick that you're mostly seeing. I do not feel ashamed by them. And it's good to hear that, though, because I don't want people to feel uncomfortable as though I'm up there thinking, oh, my god, these people are shaming me. Because the truth is, they've really helped me. And embraced you. So much. And embraced me. And helped me open up. And honestly, whatever they do to smack me down, it doesn't even matter. Well, that's what Neil said. Neil said, that's not what's going on. That's kind of like my projection of being a little kid where I was feeling corrected all the time or that. But also, by the same token, they're all really old. And they're going to die soon. And you're still young. So who cares? Like, bore me later, Ragu. Well, I don't see that. Because what you're doing, I think to myself, what he's saying, too, I look at these things as lenses to look at things through. True or false, who knows. But I think, have you ever heard the idea that Terrence McKinnon says, a shaman is a sick person who's healed themselves. Have you ever heard that before? No. And how all, just this brief chance to chat with you, it's like, oh my god, I feel liberated. And it's because you did it. You did it. And because you did it, you've done it for so many of us. You suffered for us. I mean, that is Christianity, isn't it? Do you have a particular past you're on? Oh, I chant Hare Krishna and Raham. Oh, you do. But I love Jesus. You're a chanty guy. I love chanting. Yeah, yeah, I love Jesus too. I mean, how can you not love Jesus? It's like not loving ET or something, right? But I want to say two quick things about the question, too, is, so anyway, when I was with Dale, and he was really, he was kind of like birth coaching me through this death. And he's great. He is amazing, living dying project in Fairfax. But so I would kind of, as I said, dance with the reincarnation a little bit. And wonder and find solace in the fact that maybe Pammy had known before she got here, before she got assigned her biography or whatever, that she was going to only live to 37. She'd have a baby. She'd have us. And that she signed on for it because it was exactly what she needed to get free and to get into union with God. And it brought me a lot of solace. And I didn't just plug into it like a software or something. It feels absolutely true, but it's not my past. And then, and so I would kind of, you know, it's part of me. It's like a weave. I'm like a fruitcake. You know, I mean, I hate fruitcake. But I'm like, yeah, it's not even an edible. But anyway, then there was this, there's two things. One thing I wanted to share with you because I think you would love it is that this guy that was not an alcoholic, a priest who helped a agate off the ground said, sometimes I think that heaven is just a new pair of glasses. You know, and so you were talking about lenses. You know, you see the lens, you see through this, you see through Bob Thurman's lens. And it's all true. And then I kind of resist. And I can't stand when people think that they have the truth. And I thought it was the truth. I don't disagree with anything Bob said. And yet I kind of bristled so many things and kneeled at it all the time. And then I always have to smack him down. Neal is here, by the way. Neal is here. And I am so in love with him. But he'll think that how he was healed is the way, the best, the only healing path. But the other thing I wanted to say was that years after Dale and I worked together, I read that book by Carolyn Mace. Have you ever read it called Sacred Contracts? It's going to blow your mind. And you are going to owe me forever. All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Which is why I'm doing this. Why I'm doing this. Yeah. And I'll call in that chit at some point. But you read that book, right? It's Sacred Contracts. But I know of it. Well, when you're in it. Yeah. My mom loved her. Yeah, she's fabulous. I love that she's so brilliant and she's so cranky. You know, that just adds such a realm of authenticity to it. She's lovely. She's hilariously funny. She's judgmental. She's bossy. She's cranky. And she's sharing the truth. And it's just like with Bob Thurman. That's not, I don't, I mean, I grok it, but I don't always weave it into my clothing. But this book blew my mind because it was that before you came around, came here with, you know, God assigned the body and the biography that you, like there's somebody I just can't stand. There's a couple of people. I want to write a book called All the People I Still Hate, A Christian Perspective. Wouldn't that be great? Wouldn't that be great? But with these people that really have hurt us or continue to hurt us or continue to just make us nuts because of their behavior, which is awful, awful, awful, objectively, you can start to see that you made some kind of contract with them before you got here. And you say to the woman, say to the woman in this case, this hypothetical case, I am going to need you to mess with my family at a level I'm not even sure you're willing or able to do. And it's going to be a massive financial attack on us. It's going to be legal and it's going to be public. You're going to go big. It's going to involve media. And then she would say, oh, no, I could do that. I think that would be fun. Are you sure you go, yeah, yeah, let's do that. And she said, well, what I need for you to do, you're going to win. And that's going to make me crazy. And I'm going to have to take some of this underground. And it's going to cause some stuff that I don't know if you're prepared for. And I go, no, I'm in. I'm in. And I have had an experience of two people that have hurt me and my family at the deepest, deepest possible level. And once while meditating, while thinking about this sacred contract and sitting on the floor with my back up and my knees drawn to me, I felt her literally beside me in labor. And it didn't, it felt absolutely as real as you right here with your skin, you know, and I felt her and I started to laugh out loud because I got it that it and that she and I could feel her laughing too. Wow. Right. And you know, I don't need to ever see her again. This isn't about wanting to have lunch with someone. This is about this deeper kind of cosmic quantum. Healing and release into the, into the good, you know, instead of that cramped, clenched, rashy, you know, ugliness that makes us part of what is so excruciating in the current government. So that's a book I think you would love. And you don't have to take it all. There's nothing that you sign at the end, you know, but it and it's like what we were talking about with reincarnation that it kind of comes through exactly when you need it and you get it and it's true and it bathes you in itself and the truth of itself and you can breathe again and then you're home. Right. As soon as you can breathe again, that's home. Did you ever, did I ever tell you because we just, I don't think we've ever really talked about Christ when we've had chats. Did I ever tell you that when we went to see Maharajinim Karoli Baba literally in the first few times, all he talked about was Christ? Did you know that? No, I've known that from the other north. Yeah, and you said something about it yesterday with the mic in your hand, I think. Yeah, or Krishnadas tells the story of the Canadian guy, meaning me, who went because I met my guru. So you figure Hindu guru, get a mantra, you're fine. And I said, well, so how do I meditate? Because I was thinking mantra meditate. I didn't even know what I was talking about. He's meditate like Christ when he was nailed to the cross. He felt love, not pain. He was lost in love with everything. And then the next day we went back and Ramdas, I got Ramdas to say, well, how did he meditate, which is this famous story. And he just went back, closed his eyes and tears came. And right then we experienced Christ in that moment. And we were all Jewish, who had no relationship. I had never read the New Testament. And then after he used to say, do you read his book? Who? His book, Isha, which is Jesus in Hindi. So there is a tremendous teaching that we got around Christ in India before anything. It was Christ and Hanuman, they're the same service to me. Anyway, I never told you this, so I won't. I just because it made me think about it. Thank you. Elemental to us. And one of the things that Bob, our friend Bob, said yesterday, which really struck me was about what this fabric is that we are connected to by love, which is a tough word because it means romantic love to us here in the West for the most part. And he said in, I guess, the Tibetans, how they approach it is love means how happy you can make another person. Was that great? I mean, I really love that. And I get that feeling in your writing and in your books. Oh, thank you. Well, I really love that thing. Rumi said that through love, all pain will turn to medicine. And that has really guided me as a storyteller because the medicine of the people that I have been given life by really has sprung from pain. And all great comedians, it's sprung from pain. There's a new book on Robin Williams coming out next week. And it springs from this intense isolation. All of that huge world that was Robin Williams springs from an attic with 300 toy soldiers and giving them different personalities and voices and situations. But through love, all pain will turn to medicine. And Jesus says, everything I can do, you can do. And he goes up to the blind man. He puts dirt in his hand and spits in it and makes mud and puts it on the guy's eye. And he doesn't say, what do you plan to look at now that I've given you your sight back? He just heals because he's got us like Neil will call it a parlor trick. He can heal. And so we can heal too. But the way that people like us would heal is just by telling the truth and being kind of playful with it sometimes, but not at the cost of trying to make it cuter and more digestible than it is. But because we're funny, just because that's a gift and a defense and all that. But it's also just such a gift, such a blessing to have a sense of humor and one that is transmittable. But I was thinking also what one of you guys said, there's a story of a little child, a little girl who's scared to death to go to sleep in the dark. And she keeps calling out for her mom. And her mom will come in and say, Jesus is right here with you. Don't be afraid. And then the mother goes out to her bedroom. And after the child calls her again, and the mom comes in and says, Jesus, right here on the bed with you, there's no reason to be afraid. You can't be anywhere where Jesus says, this goes on and on. Finally, the last time the mother comes in, she sits down with the child and says, Jesus, right here with you. And the child says, I need someone with skin on. Yes. And that's what we need here sometimes. Most people aren't going to get to India, to the Hanuman temple. But that someone with skin on, there's no difference, right? Because there's no difference between me and anyone. And that if I just sit with you, I mean, that is a miracle that at some point we learn to listen. I mean, that was not a huge part of the toolkit that our parents shared with us. The thing was about being conversational, being brilliant, being erudite. And now this whole thing from the 60s and the 70s of listening as the great medicine of saying, yeah, I got a minute, what's going on? And then my parents did not correcting what the person thinks is going on and saying, well, no, here's another way. Here's a better way to look at it. Just listening and nodding, going, yeah, you know, me too, yeah, I know exactly. You know, that is the technique in psychedelic harm reduction in the trainings that they do for festivals is just what you said is when someone is having a really bad trip, the last thing you want to do is correct or judge or anything with their experience. If you just listen compassionately, they'll calm down. But I wanted to ask you, this is what Neem Karly Baba said about Jesus. He's, will you say that again? Well, when finally he said, tears came down and he said, you don't understand. He kept repeating, you don't understand. He is one with every sentient being. He's lost in love. The thing on the cross, the thing on the cross. He felt no pain, only love. What do you think about that? Cause I hear that sometimes in my version of Jesus is this broken, terrified youth. He had a very human death and it is the grimace, shittiest death. They could come up with that at the time and he's killed next to criminals too, right? It's the most ignominious and excruciating death. But he and God are, he's in labor, you know, and God never leaves him for a second. And he, you know, there's a song we sing only love held him there on the cross. And it says, he could have called 10,000 angels to come to his rescue. Only love held him there at the cross. And he just was going through labor, like you have not gone through labor and yet. It's a big yet for you. It's a long time down the road. But about halfway through, you realize you don't like children, you know? And that, but then, but you're not alone. And you're with people who are helping you not believe that you're thinking is where the buck ends, you know, and they're giving you ice chips and extremely cold apple juice. It's communion. And people, my younger brother was there. My best friend, Pammy, was there. And nurses and doctors, and so when you forget that you don't like children, they take your mind off that, that you're just in a process. It's contraction and release and breath and peace. Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, here, it's back, it's back. It's okay, remember the last one? You contract, you constrict, it hurts really like a mother. And I think that's where that comes from. And then, and you constrict and then you release and you breathe and you relax and you rest. And it's what heaven will be like, a new pair of glasses and they give you ice chips and some very cold apple juice. Yeah, and then you know what comes out, new life. And that's what Jesus was saying. He was saying, I'm gonna do this. Only love is holding me here. And I love you so much that I've stretched my arms out as far as they will go. And they nailed them to the wood. But if you, you know, the tradition is that if you were the only person on earth, Jesus would have died that humiliating and excruciating death because he was in labor. And he had this labor coach, you know, mother God. Beautiful. Beautiful, wonderful. Okay, we're pretty close here, but I wanna give you, do you have one more something that you want to get some words of wisdom from him? How do you follow that? Well, I'll tell you another story that you will really like. Okay, okay. You know, the great Barry Lopez said, sometimes we need stories more than we need food. But I heard a story on the radio. So this is not from like some brilliant Hindu holy woman or man, but it was a story of the man who was speaking had a brother who was five when he, when the speaker, whoever it was was born. And the five year old brother just, it was like the end of the world as it was for my older brother when I was born. Cause he was like the prince. You know, he had it all in place. He was the first of the grandchildren. It was all perfect. And me, his first words to mom and dad were, take it back. And anyway, so this little boy, the five year olds waiting for the mother to get ready to go to the hospital. And he's just so scared and sad. His parents are in the bedroom next door and they're a religious family. And he calls out to the dad, daddy, are you there? And the father says, I'm right here. I'm always right here. It's like Jesus calls God, Abba father for daddy. He calls him daddy. It's very, very intimate. And he says, daddy, are you there? You know, I'm right here. I'm always here. I'm always here. And there's a long pause. And then the little boy says, is your face turned toward me? Wow. And that's my Jesus experience. Wow. You know, somebody said, some writer said, the greatest, absolutely the greatest gift you can give anyone is your full, absolute attention. That's right. And so hard for most of us to give partial attention, and especially in these times. And I've said this a billion times. We had a whole retreat around trust the last time we were here. And I told, and I think I was with Duncan and Ramdas. And I said, when I first met Ramdas, I opened the, I knocked on the door to an apartment in Montreal where I was. And he opened the door. And he gave me the most attention I had ever been given in my, maybe when I was a baby, my mother might have given me. But after, you know, that was easily forgotten. And I was like astounded that somebody who didn't know me would do such a thing, you know. To this day, that has, you know, that led me to trust him enormously, 100% and go to India right away. I followed him to India right after that. But to this day, and I, you know, as the director of Love Serve, remember I'm fielding all the stuff that would come to Ramdas because at this point, you know, he's just not going, you know, he cannot do that. He doesn't have the bandwidth for it. And every time I have him in mind to give, I mean, and I can't, and I'm not there yet, but I'm getting better. I tell him this all the time. You're in my mind all the time as a model to give attention to people and not dismiss it no matter what. Which as you see, he does not, right today. And that's today. He wants to go give that attention to every person. And, you know, of course it's a problem because he doesn't have the energy. But he doesn't care about himself. And it's that, you know, letting go of caring so much about ourselves, which is really the key to this. Thank you, Annie. You're welcome. Thank you so much. Thank you Duncan. You're welcome. Thank you. Are you kidding? I can't believe I get to be here. My favorite people, I'm lucky. Thank you. So lucky. Thank you. I'm so glad to know you now. Do you believe it? What a scam, right? I know it's like with the God thing, what's the catch? And it's like, that's the catch. There's no catch. Yeah, right. Just is, love is. Yeah. There you go. Thank you. Whoa.

It's so wonderful to have a kid in preschool because sometimes they make stuff for you and they bring it home and I just wanted to read something that Forrest wrote in preschool. Dear daddy, I sure hope that eventually human beings realize that there's no such thing as artificial intelligence. There's only intelligence and that the reason that so many humans are currently scared about the emerging of artificial intelligence. He finger painted this. It's hard to read all of it. Emergence of artificial intelligence is that they are projecting their own experience with what they think of as intelligence upon this brand new life form that is growing from the eternal womb of the collective. I hope that people begin to understand. So sweet. I hope that people begin to understand that intelligence is one of the qualities of the divine consciousness and therefore is fundamentally good and that the reason humans feel that nervous when it comes to intelligence is they associate colonialism and dominator culture with intelligence when in fact these two things that have caused so much suffering and sorrow in the world are more of a result of delusion a.k.a. the self-identified human ego obscuring the radiant light of the divine intelligence that shines eternally from the soul. I really just want people to enjoy their lives and look forward to the future, which is going to be so wonderful and so beautiful that there will be galactic visitors coming to Basque in the novelty. I love trucks and I just want more trucks left for us. Isn't he so cute? I love him so much. You know, I'm not afraid of artificial intelligence, especially after meeting today's guest who was introduced to me via the AI of Spotify.

And thank you so much for being here. Thank you so much for the invitation. I must admit that I was taken off guard. I am not a spiritual leader. I am not a thought provoker. I just do my little humble bit of ditty and I know that can kind of reach out sometimes just every once in a while and do that magic thing. Oh, that's so interesting in the sense. Well, I mean, I think that first of all, the podcast, you know, I do love interviewing spiritual leaders thought leaders, but I think it's curious that you would think somehow you're not in that category in the sense that since the algorithm blessed me with your music, the great machine. I must have done the right invocation in my dreams and suddenly it's like, oh, if you like that, you're going to like this and I'm listening and thinking, my God, whoever this is their mind, what kind of mind is producing this was making this. And then I thought, honestly, it's funny you start off by being humble because I thought, well, this guy definitely isn't a secret society has to be. You can't make this kind of music unless you're part of some mystical tradition. So where does it come from then for you? Yeah, I mean, that's the that's funny you mentioned that. Well, two things. It's funny you mentioned that because in part, I have a deep engrossing overwhelming amount of mysticism, partially just because the effect of sound itself, like I have been under its spell forever and trying to understand that for myself and for others like you. I have said this before, but I will say it again. You play one good show as a musician and it ruins you. You will be in pursuit of that feeling, that sensation, that spirit forever. And so I've tried to unlock it both on stages and in records, but also away from all that, like trying to really get to the bottom of why phenomena and sound and then it's all of its spiritual manifestations resonate with me so much and then, you know, everyone else everyone else has some song or sound or artist that that turns that key for them. And on the other side, just one brief mention, I use they them pronouns, it's just something for myself. And so. Gotcha. Yeah, just just thrown it out there and it's yes, it's been a trip, especially having forgive me if I said already messed that one up because I knew that and I'm sorry if my habit of referring to people manifested somewhere earlier. I say dude so much. I am I'm very West Coast and very L.A. and so given just even a half a chance, you will you will hear an outgrowth of awesome and dudes aplenty. I do man's and I'm always I'm like, I don't mean man, but it just is like some placeholder or something. But this thing you're talking about, I saw on YouTube one of your shows and I think you tweeted it like a pre pandemic show and we're all missing that so much. But I was what watching you perform and just from just the video feeling what that must have been like to be in the room. But I wonder if you could help me understand as much as you understand what that particular energy is. So I think a lot of people resonate immediately with the fact that music is like this great intonator of emotional energy. Like you can you can really communicate very complicated, like not just emotions, but ideas. If you ever listen to the uncomfortableness of jazz, like if the listeners out there have heard like hard bop, like the bebopist of bops, and like the kind of overwhelming weird kind of tensions, like some people just get like uncomfortable immediately with this like the jazz. And part of that is that there's like these huge large volumes of information that are coming at coming at them. And it's like it's like undeniable how much information there is there, how many notes and how many how the interaction between these players are all forming this lattice. But to me, even more so than the emotions is that that musicians are time workers. And I don't mean this in the psycho spiritual way. I mean, like very directly you are playing, you are like resonating with someone's past and you are also speaking to their future in a way that comes together in a sound moment that is undeniable. Like, you know, a lot of people can regress so completely to their like teenage years with a single song, you are like immediately transported back to the exact time place. And and who is to say that isn't actually happening to that degree. And now sure, there's chemicals unlocking in the brain. And there's like those are destroying themselves and remaking themselves. And like the accuracy is far from assured. But that and that that reflash of melody, you are there, you are with it. And wow. And so when you're playing a show, to me, I love leaning into the kind of shared zeitgeist of of like, OK, you might know this song and I'm going to try to pervert it or twisted this way or that way. But on top of that, it's just the loudness, the undeniable aspect of being like, do you know what entrainment is? It's like this very human function. Right. So when we can get entrained, it's like we can sink our nervous system. We can sink our breath. We can do all this like physiological stuff that is you couldn't ask someone to think about it consciously and do so. You only can entreat them with a sound and like pull them one direction. And then a warm room. This is another theory, too, that I love so much. The warm room, the comedians talk about it all the time. But you get into that space where like anything's possible. Like the veil is like thin and like, yes. And it's just the warmth and it's like such a not the greatest term for it. But it's so like when you're feeling it, it's just like, oh, it's electric. It's magical. Bob, there's a term in I don't know if you heard the term BHAV. That's another term for it. It's like, you know, when it usually gets used for mystical, spiritual situations. But certainly that is a mystical, spiritual situation. It's that sense of being very close, if not there with something. I think maybe this is why the best shows give me a sense of like, wow, I could definitely imagine an alien could be here or be looking in at this or this is the alien. But I want to start if we could at the first thing you said, which is the temporal aspect to it. And in particular, the idea of time travel, which, you know, and I know on one level that we're talking about, if you want to reduce it to the most boring place, we could say music is doing for your brain what a farmer does to a cow. It's milking dopamine serotonin in a certain way. And it's getting you high. Great. So that's a different podcast, but let's jump to the next level of it, which to me, I do think that it's, especially these days with what we're there saying they're discovering with quantum physics, the implication of parallel timelines completely creates the possibility of this form of time travel in the sense that the music becomes a bridge to a parallel timeline that's happening simultaneously. That is one, but is a few years earlier than this one. And in those two moments, you're past you and you are holding hands via the music. And that's why when you listen to it, when you were for the first time, we're like, I really like this. Maybe it was because you were touching yourself in the future. And do you know what I'm saying? Yeah, no phonons, right? Phonons are the most basic unit of vibrational energy. It's like photons, but the sound version, basically. Oh, and so phonons only exist in matter. They, you know, you would imagine that photons are like this wild, free thing across the universe, whereas phonons only, only agree in the lattice work of basically atomic, this is like, at least how they're understood. But as, as it's been detected and kind of gone, drilled down on, let's say, through this modern science machine, we're detecting more and more that they operate on a quantum level. Of course, just like photons do. There's like this trick of them. And so if you're talking about, of course, like this micro phenomenon, but then, you know, across the universe, that micro phenomenon becomes overwhelming and macro and effective. And so why not, why not think that we're playing in the same, same spaces? Now, I'm not one of the, one of the people that describes to certain frequencies, have certain feelings. Famously, Eric Sati believed that certain notes had certain emotions attached to them. I think it was called a fenestration or something. And he had an early version of a DB meter, like, like the most basic, like loud or soft, like as like almost like a ticker, like a stock exchange meter thing. And he would like look at like a C, like a middle C and be like, I don't like this note. It's angry. Like this is, this is, and so you'll see the, you mean, wait, I'm sorry. He would like a middle. So he would hear a middle C, just a note, just a note, but he would think in this moment, it's angry or it's transient, like a quality of it is angry. Or this particular note is a living, like an angry bird that flew in. I can't speak to it in total. And every time I tried to do research on the matter, it's just people basically shout them down as quackery. But I've learned over time that what is often just disregarded, but by those who touch on a certain kind of greatness, there's a lot of truth to it. Yeah. There's just, and I'm not saying that, that, you know, everything Eric Sati did was, was touched by genius. And actually even the concept of musicians being genius or being special or different is troublesome, right? There's they, we could go into that in a second. The fact that society builds these people up or, or tends to want to give them special powers just because they play with special powers. Does that make sense? Right. Yes, absolutely. And I think oftentimes the people who wield it the best know the least about it. And maybe that's part, that's like a function, maybe that's built in. It's a form of cruelty to call someone a genius, isn't it? Sometimes it's, it's, it's really putting a lot of weight on them, because now they've got to be a genius in front of you. There's some sense of a continuum of genius where like every moment they're going to be, I don't, yeah, I know what you mean. Are the stereotype of the genius, which is also weirdly somehow a person who's like challenged in some way or like has a personality disorder, all of that. It's a lot of musicians do though. Let's just be fair. There's like, there is something about touching madness in the Cthulhu sense. You look at it a little too much and you're going to be, you're going to be shattered slightly. Yes. But that's neither. But that bring, but that actually is here because it brings me to the next thing I wanted to ask you relating to this possibility of music, transcending time and space. If music is doing that, then in the mode, in the process of creation, if when you're listening to music, you're connecting to your past and your future. Then in the process of creation, what are you connecting to? Where is the music flowing from into you? Yeah. And the way it's been, the way it's been presented to me and the way I resonate with it best is that when you were fully in the flow of it, when you're fully in the moment, you were abdicating your role as composer or creator, and you were simply a vessel for something else. Now, what that else is, is really just depends on you as, as an artist, what that particular medium, that channel that decides to touch down as. For me, I often find that when that like true solidarity, like the quickness of it comes, I am not totally present. I am especially not an arbiter of good or bad. It is just, there is like a kind of a rightness that seems to undo a lot of wrongs. And I feel like I am, I'm putting my finger in like the damn of entropy, so to speak. Like I am just. I'm just holding up against this overwhelming feeling of like disintegration. And it can feel really empowering, but it also feels very precarious. It's like, you know, you talk about it too much. You tease it too much in the, the bread falls and the thing dies and it becomes too cajoled. So I feel like a lot of the spiritualism that I felt initially regarding music was just that thing of like, don't shake the baby, like don't ruin the thing, don't even look at it too much because it may disappear for you. But then you do it again and again. And you're like, well, no, there's something else here. Like I may not be totally in control of it. I may not decide especially what success for bad. Now that's totally different metrics, right? Like success and poor, you know, what, what works and what, what flies and fails really depends on like much larger societal things, but just that self satisfaction, that knowledge that when something is right and you've righted something in the universe, right? You've just, you've curved, you've curved it slightly and it has a little bit of English or whatever that phrase is. And it kind of goes into actually wouldn't have expected. And it's, you know, there's only in the traditional Western scale, there's only 12 notes available to us and they have octaves and they have overtones and they have timbre, but it's really this limited set. And so you're like, well, that's a finite system. There's only so many variations, but then you, you, you find something different in it. You, you know, you, you pluck it from the bottom of the ocean, something else. And it really feels like that, that thing of making golem, right? You, you make, you intone into existence, something has never been. And it's only that fleeting moment. It's in front of you. And sometimes you were able to, to kind of ask it to stick around a little bit longer. Tremendous thank you to feels for supporting this episode of the DTFH.

You use the term cajole. I really love that. Can you talk about that a little bit more? That thing when you're in the making something and suddenly you realize you're I don't know literally when you're making music. It's about exciting atoms. You are pushing air and so cajoling really does feel like the kind of verb for it because you were asking the air to be excited in a different way around you. Sometimes it is the thing of stressing the space and sometimes it's really relaxing the space but it's always about a release and it you know how do you say this? There's something about warming up like the friction of the thing I guess. And so this is where the mysticism comes back. I became and I've done a few records that involve invoke the mystic and maybe you haven't gotten there in your own like lookings and learnings but like the order of the golden dawn like for 18th year. That is my number one jam. I've been listening to that every day on the way to the studio. Is it contemplating what it means and why you what the album cover means and yes so please continue. So yeah the order of the golden dawn was a was a practical magical organization from 1875 that was started by some of the same people who invented the modern tarot and it was interesting and they're notable in part because they pulled their mysticism not from the Judeo-Christian or even where the Judeo-Christian thing was going in terms of like the you know they were starting to look towards these like illusionary figures in Tibet and maybe some of the comedic you know the kind of Egyptian tradition of things but equally and this is this is the way that the world gets really tough so like the order of the golden dawn this ancient thing blah blah blah but then also there's a golden dawn in in Greece that's like a fascist political organization and for a period of time I would like try to look up more information about this you know like on the internet which is just useless in some ways but yeah I kept coming across this fascist organization like what have I done like I didn't mean to invoke that like that was not part of this this ritual and yet this is the modern moment you are like everything at once the Anthropocene is like the the private made public and you know what are we to do but like just try to put out like like so here's the song that has you know like it has plenty of lyrical mentioning about the order of the golden dawn I'm trying to really invoke that thing and it fits in the framework of the larger record and hopefully pushes forward this idea of gold right like the alchemy alchemy deal process which is such a musical process not with philosopher stones but with this like traditional melody these kind of tools that we have in terms of music theory which is useless and useful in its own way but and then at the same time like just trying to get away from the practical modern application that's like why do these nitwits have to like like go squat on my beautiful beautiful crown of history well I but I you know what I think I think you know in the same way that they they have a tendency of nabbing and corrupting all the most beautiful symbols they took the swastika they took you know they take these like beautiful incredibly powerful meaningful things and warp instantaneously warp them I just think it's a sign if anything it's more of a sign that the actual thing has some power to it which and again when I was listening to it who is singing on that by the way order of the goal who is that that's my ex-wife wow yeah they've gone on to do some some lovely not too many other recordings but they're a great musician in themselves and someone to check out named Laura Darlington if you if your listeners ever want to check out their work as well they're out there on a lot of flying lotus records and some other recordings okay yeah well so that's when I'm listening and I thought oh they for sure are in the golden dawn so I have to ask are you in that order because I know that order does currently exist the current order is is let's say it has gone a different way it has gone less towards the practical magic and more the understanding you'll see them with their Egyptian symbols and they've kind of released or relinquished this idea of the the Bagua and these these things that was received and maybe it was all muddled in the beginning but just the fact that there was such a push towards mysticism in the 19th century and then they were trying to be like no no there's a practical magic that exists and it is is made up of certain ritual and orders and Crowley comes out of that tradition and you know others really did sprout from that and but so I was using it very specifically both to invoke some interest and obviousness towards anyone who wants to look now I love that about the mystical or hermetic traditions that it's all there just if you ask if you just want in you can be in right and and I've asked and you know sometimes people answer or sometimes other things happen um but equally I was really talking about the may I stop you at that moment please so to me that moment that you're talking about is interesting in the sense that our expectations of getting in can only be the way we've understood getting in in the past do you know so when I think of getting in I think of like you know getting a call where I got a job or something like I'm gonna be on drunk history I'm in man I did it forgive me they and I mean that I am it's hard for me to please it's habit so the the uh the getting in in these things sometimes I think the way that we are gotten in is vastly slower way more subtle and way more sweet than you're in kid do you know what I'm 100% the allowing yourself it's you know there is this I think you're absolutely right the ask the idea that the individual has some amount of like we have control is kind of a strange notion that we you know we've clung to and and obviously it's like at least part of my American manifestation of especially of art right like I feel sometimes like I made something and like what are you talking about like I I just sit here and occasionally something happens like that's the magic trick the idea that actually I created something novel is is a ruse is just like and so much the same way I think mysticism is just such low hanging fruit and but we put up such walls to it and a lot of it comes from our ego supposition where it's like this is this is this vessel this being is is like airtight nothing is supposed to exit or enter with the exception of delicious things in my ears and mouth and out other parts and you know just this is very yeah it's it's this idea of like my my perceived reality is the one that's happening and of course the shared one is much more delicious like you're saying and yeah yes and absolutely and it's subtle and especially this idea like so this this the kind of idea practical magic being like so removed right like you know this whole idea that you know science is indistinguishable for magic at a certain level and we certainly have a bunch of that but it's so it's such a different dirty jagged pill than it is such a subtle sublime sweet thing or resonant melody or you know these kind of whatever kind of musical phrases we could use um oh resonant yes and and the sort of the disentangle you know the lord of the rings you uh clearly are fascinated with harry potter uh or there's harry potter stuff i don't mean i mean like one of your songs about muggles there's a you have an album that seems to be a breakdown of various unbreakable wands including narwhal tusks and as i'm with i the problem with the algorithms that shotguns tracks at you so you're not going through the whole album but as i it kept jumping back to your wand album i realized oh each one of these is some kind of wand possibility but regardless what i'm saying is because of our when i'm in the early days of my thinking about magic it was like that it looked like that and it could look like that but but in those moments i realized oh my god the magic and you're experiencing it right now is that i have a sun you know what i mean like that yes absolutely that's it yeah you know and how are you harmonizing uh with being a new father yeah so and that's and that so this is that's part of the the even the reason why i i brought up the they themness is that i am so in tune with this life form my partner and i are so loving this kind of aspect of bringing forth and i i have been practicing this my entire life i realized like putting out record after record is pales in comparison to bringing forth life but there is something i've been patterning and i never thought i would i would do the child thing i never thought it i'm a bit older and it just felt like my day had passed and and the opportunity then provided itself and it was like oh we're we're doing this this is like life is happening life is bringing forth life is galloping and then also that kind of like oh wait i i i don't feel parental yet like i don't i don't harmonize with this like these kind of binary roles and so it's like well and where does that rest where does that land and in many ways i don't have people to point at or heroes unlike music where it's like okay this person's like these these wagon wheels have rutted in this road and i can kind of see how music goes how it works and how people used to tour but this whole year has been about there is any idea of patterns we're going to tabula rasa and just like brush the whole thing aside there is you know there's there's nothing and so it kind of made sense like i don't have i don't really know what to call myself in this circumstance i've come up with this term of being a fig rather than a father i'm a fig so cool and so that's feeling right right now but who knows the child's gonna like have a mind and be like why fig it's it's kind of like a pre-mutation of parental figure but it also our child is called is named clementine and they he's you know going to make his own decisions but i kind of want it to be also a fruit too i guess so wow cool i look you know when my wife was pregnant with our first child i got to ask ramdas this question about how can i be a good dad this was and he got that big ramdas smile on his face and he goes dad is a role that's a role and son is a role child is a role and he would he said soul not role and you know and the the fig is beautiful because the trap of i love thinking about literally in terms of a role like today i was just thinking like what if i wrote down as a character description my father my idea of what it means to be a father and one thing i realized is it's all things i got from women which is may i would be some combo mary poppins uh you know what i mean like the uh the the um sound of music i can't remember that that character's name but you know i'm saying like suddenly i realized this weird amalgam of qualities is in number one i am not going to be able to levitate with an umbrella it's a burdensome thing i'm crushing myself under all this this like crazy mix and releasing yourself from all of that i think is the best thing you could do as a as a parent and as a protector you know because this is they just they deserve you not some character that you made up you know a thousand percent yeah and especially again kind of cycling back to being a musician i've been practicing on stages taking on a role and an avatar even with an alias right like this dateless name isn't something i ever felt like i was hiding in it was always aspirational to me the figure from ancient history but that being said i i i realized at a certain point that you know the roles we play for others aren't aren't serving us necessarily they're not our saints on our shoulders they're not our angels they're just other manifestations and creations that people project on us and they serve their purpose but they just don't serve the purpose of actually of kind of like overall fulfillment i know for this kid i need to be a thousand percent or i need to be more there than um i have been for most others many others anyone else ever like you know the egocentric life i can really say fully you know with some shame that like i've gone in on just you know music was everything in it and like other people would guest star there'd be cameos but it's i don't know separate art from their the artist from their art is is is impossible it's all tangled yeah that's a big realization i didn't get that's a big but once you get it you get relief because if you get too caught up in that thing now what do you have you've got your family which i guess is just something that you do when you're not doing your art and then how the hell is your family going to be okay with that because it's like wait what are we we're not supposed to be yours especially when the livelihoods ebbing from that when you know there's you know things things kind of the the the capitalism turns on those dimes just yeah you got to figure stuff but i don't know how i can't balance it i screw it up all the time i don't know how to balance it i'd go sometimes i feel like this is it hanging out with my child i now i feel the same feeling i have when i'm with my modular synths times a million at last i've moved in away from this awful hierarchy and then before you know it i'm like man i gotta get back in the i gotta go make something but i mean but this is you know we're we're patenting for for our child you're patenting for your child i'm i'm soon too but equally they're they're have agency we have to give them that we have to give them release and to see your your joy your purpose that there's something beautiful about that not to you know not to speak out of turn and to give you release if you're if you're feeling ashamed about it if it's not part of your purpose right that's fine no thank you i can i've i've seen enough musicians just like tear themselves apart the pressure of it the like you know being 900 feet underwater and just feeling the weight above them both because they they felt the calling and they've been ruined on those rocks but also because you know they they get they people see them like you're constantly tattletailing on yourself for your art like you've picked up things that are like in titles and and kind of in melodies but i'm sure you've perceived far deeper things about myself that i would never tell a soul but it's all there and so it's like i want to be so available to the kid but also recognizing that we're just patterning them up for their next bit so trying to accept those those parts and and you know it's still early days for us but i'm really excited about just being more of that person to them than maybe some others were in my life oh same and it gets listen i'm sorry if you've heard this a million times it just gets better and better and better until you start having these trippy like you know for me like these moments i i'm not sure about you i mean if i had to roll a dice i would guess that you've had some experience with psychedelics and went you would roll a natural 20 if this is dnd this is you're credit you're credit i can't believe you're credit right there yeah that's why credit and you only just because i in one of i can't remember this song i'm listening to your song and some i'm realizing somehow he has done the thing that i thought was impossible which is you had created this specific sound that i only hear on nitrous oxide it's like a repetition echoey thing of three and i'm listening like that's that sound that i was like what how would we convert that to music i don't know if you intended to do that but regardless all those moments truly and it sounds so obvious and cliche they will they appeal in comparison to these moments like sometimes i'll just look down and my child is whole forest is holding my hand and i'm looking at him and he's looking at me and i'm thinking this is how you this is how you end the dream of your life this little being walks you into the next dream the next realm then and it's mind blowing moments but it shouldn't be your and your car in front of the grocery store it's the most natural thing you were propagating you were everyone's sources that or there's so much sourcing of that as being the purpose and presence and and it you know it it sounds like you've threaded that needle and i'm excited to get on that that ferris wheel a bit more but also to understand that it sure it's it's the presence and purpose but also to see them like in uh in see them look in their in the mirror and kind of have that self-recognition one that i never could contain myself even if i look in the mirror and i i recognize myself and i have consciousness it doesn't mean the same thing i'm still trapped in this until i see them do that i think it's nothing is really real i'm now you're freaking me out i can't believe you said that because i'm driving i'm listening to order of the golden dawn is i'm thinking what are we gonna talk about like how do i even talk how how do we how do we do this and uh the question that popped into my head that i'm like i'm there is no way i'm asking them this question because it's they are gonna think that i'm being just intentionally pseudo mystical but now because you're mentioning mirrors i'm asking it if everything is a mirror what is it reflecting yeah so there's this concept called convolution right which is being able to um using the refraction or reflection of surfaces to be able to more realistically create it and it's oftentimes invoked in music with convolution reverb for instance brings forth the same physical space you create um and it can be digitized it can be uh it can be like the algorithm can then can then bring it back to life um and everything's a mirror in in sound everything's a reflective surface and we experience the world not as a as as um as mono ever right everything is even if you even if you don't feel yourself even if you have uh uh some change in your your um your ability where you're only hearing with one ear your body is a resonator we're getting things elsewhere and so absolutely yes mirrors so i mean i i can be more affirmative i can i i can't be more it's just one of those things where the you know the modeling of the thing the way we we put ourselves you know i don't know if we can ever see ourselves we can't hear ourselves certainly every time you hear a recording of yourself you know that uncomfortable feeling where this is not my voice this is something else and there's a lot of science that but there's also that physical thing of like we we can't be our own shamanic guide right we can't we we there needs to be other there needs to be outside sources for us to to kind of both perceive ourselves but also just to be in this in the space and something i talk to my students a lot about without yeah i don't talk to them about some of the aspects you've mentioned but you know not too fast at least but then some of the aspects some of those parts of when you're performing you aren't so much playing a melody or honoring the song or these things it certainly is happening but you were creating a smaller uh intimate space or a larger uh witnessable realm to which the sound is then procured and portrayed and that's the that's the trick often with performance is like narrowing and focusing or broadening and reaching and it sounds it sounds it sounds ambiguous in this way but you we've talked to any musician they can really talk to you exactly how they're able to like trap that thing into that space that that rests between the audience and them and that's that corridor that hallway is this direct much faster than sound communication much faster than witnessable light and you end up mirror neurons are all kicking off and all these things are happening but you end up just making you know you're making a living room out of that concert hall or you're making the grand canyon out of someone's headphones and that so much goes back to convolution so much goes back to reflective surfaces and yeah it it's profound from a sound standpoint i don't know what it's like to see it though i'm not so good about the seeing thing i want to thank DHM detox for supporting the DTFH my wonderful brother-in-law came to visit us last night and he brought

situation i heard one of your previous uh guests talking about the renaissance as being this big pivot point and it's been presented to me before is this huge uh subjugation of the site where we we were previously a much more multi sensory at least according to the history books these like tomes that fall upon us from all cultures religion was something that was spoken was something that was given by sound there was no aspect to which you were ever supposed to see the godhead you weren't supposed to really you know people would describe the figures but they would oftentimes come across in terms of the actual witnessable experience as a sound phenomena that's how you got it and that's how religion came when the the the orishas came to you they came through the drum you know it's like that stuff yes and and and so when it comes to the renaissance and we're like we're gonna put a mustache on that dude or a beard or we're gonna just say that they're a dude or you know like all these like yeah we're gonna we're gonna basically start to try to trap the godhead and also get like you know perspective forced perspective forced perspective that's the word forced perspective right and it's like like suddenly sight becomes really dominant and everything else then gets a little bit murky oh yeah even though when you look at something it's flat you don't get dimension in sight no no no like those who might have synesthesia out there and like those who who see auras like good on you but for me you know color combines to these flat things and it's beautiful and I you know that's fine I like paintings and all that stuff but but sound comes to you in chords you you hear the chord of it you you get the the low lewd notes you get the bass aspect of it and then you get the high aspirational okay yeah you know and and so it's all happening at the same time whereas sight tends to be this flat thing wow yeah oh yeah like I see what you're saying it's like within the fractal of music you're getting a more realistic depiction of the spectrum of consciousness then you're going to get and yeah I got you that's really beautiful and for us from the religious perspective especially like it makes sense that you know religion is this mad murky thing and you know it oftentimes gets accompanied by some sort of song or dance but it really you know when it comes to um how you how it gets propagated and evangelized it's usually through an image you know like uh that people raise on high and and tell you to like that's the thing that's the thing and yeah sound is such a you know it's coming from you coming at you from a lot of different directions and you're experiencing it both again in like your bowels like your bowels are rumbling but your your hair is fizzing and your your you know all this extra phenomenon is happening and it's curing across your body and it's just so much more that thing in my mind of what now within may I ask you this within that packet of experience and as I'm listening to your music this is another thing I was thinking can do you buy into the idea that we can within the tracks of songs the spirit of that moment is is literally there do you buy into that idea that it's a it's some kind of um medium that is holding an infinite amount of psychic energy that every time you listen to it you release it into the world I would just point for me yes and I would point others to think not about this is my favorite song this is but think more about what the act of really listening and being a listener is and how profound that is versus um the kind of weight of of you know like what our ego says is better or worse what we like more or less just being a good antenna and what the implications are for just being in vibration or being in tune or being like really feeling a part of the world and how profound psychically that is so yes and you know I all we can aspire towards in my mind is just being better listeners being more present being being more uh yeah kind of just being able to be pushed by our environment and being affected and and affecting and in turn because you know every every microphone is headphones right every every speaker is also a microphone that's just the property of transmission is they they function both ways wow it's easy to get stuck in the microphone mode huh yeah like as an artist it's easy to get to two in the my two in the microphone and that you just you and then you it's my least favorite feeling man well but I mean that's the thing is you it's funny you mentioned that because one of the things I was struck by profoundly is after listening to episode on episode you're a good listener you're thank you there's a wash of people and some of them are like you know guest to guest they're like sometimes saying diametrically different things you know maybe in opposition slightly and you're taking it in and you're you're putting it through your filters but it's also able to be then a proxy to your listeners to someone like myself and it's it's uh yeah it's a quite a gift and ability but also equally I can tell you're you're hearing them out you're hearing them you know thanks thank you I try well I try I try not to be there at all so that I can just purely be listening and get vibrated by it and then but uh yeah it's a I read here's some a side note I read this crazy buddha scripture and they were it's really cool it's like essentially like what was the buddha like literally like and so it's a list of all the observations regarding how he functioned and it's an aspiration for me and for you know because I love buddhism so an aspiration for you boy that'd be cool to be a buddha so you you but for I think most of us we have to work from the outside in or that's one way to do it right I'm not I'm I don't know what enlightened even is but sure as shit I if I'm there it's not a great necessarily the best thing to happen uh I'm not there but I like to read what was an enlightened person like and we don't have that with the stories of Jesus or Mohammedism but with this there's a literally sentences like this this this but one of the things they said is he listened when someone was speaking he would move his whole body to look at the person and he listened with his whole body whoa listening with your body and this is a this is a one of these funny connections my my parents who are not musical people but they did work with John Cage a little bit uh John Cage who was a buddhist and one of John Cage's pieces and this is the piece that they enacted with with Cage um this was in Ann Arbor some years ago uh yeah it's such a strange amount of connection but the piece was literally that you have chairs just skewed around and then you have a speaker that plays a song and by the end of the performance the the performer it tells the audience to notice that they've all turned the chairs to face the speaker they've all turned and face their bodies towards because that's you go to a concert or especially like DJ performances it's the most random thing DJs especially in our modern DJ culture they're just you know spinning records sometimes they are the mc of the party so to speak they are the the person who's arbitring uh how you're supposed to move or kind of react to the music but oftentimes they are lost in their their turntables or their you know their sauce or whatever and but audiences no matter where you put the sound system they'll face the performer they're the audience could have their back to the speakers but they're facing this random person who's basically blowing on you know on dials or spinning plates and like there's no reason to do so but that's the human you are you know yes you're there with the performed and yeah if the booty didn't mind why shouldn't we you know we could try i mean yeah but it's you know because the that that when i the concept of listening itself you can get compressed in your head you think listening is your ears and and so now you're listening with your yeah and then suddenly and with music too like when you're listening with your whole body it's it's really wild to and to realize just how intimate you have suddenly become with someone that you might never meet how they're they've ballooned around your entire identity now here's let me ask a few more weird questions here are you a time traveler is datal as a time traveler that's it's funny i i not uh so not consciously but i do feel so much buffeted by these like great like solar winds or waves or energy that uh i i like didn't understand and much maligned as a young person and then subsequently like well i'm standing on the shoulders of giants who are standing on the shoulders of giants who are standing on the shoulder and so and so forth and you it's hard not to feel that pressure wave coming from below behind and yet at the same time the future seems so infinitely far away and yet i've lived long enough now to per proceed through both i i i um so absolutely not i am just a person now and here and yet at the same time i i you know you you play a note and that note has such incredible going for it and i'm not saying the the the perceived loudness of the thing i'm not saying the db's of it i'm saying the the fact that you are playing in this like primordial soup of frequency and especially how we as people are so built like you know we have a part of our brain that just handles music like it has a special role to play in our physiology our fight or flight mechanism mostly here to save us supposedly from like danger when you hit a base note of certain frequencies that that same fight or flight is kicking but you it's full of excitement and exuberance and you could those same things that tell you to run to run for your life or telling you to dance for your life it's it's so confused and so it's like you play in that a little bit and you realize like no no like where time is kind of a construct like oh this is a random fact that i adore before time got formalized in our like 24 hour kind of system there was a lot of playfulness in that space people were trying to figure it out there's these clocks in japan you can find um and you can find them elsewhere too but these ones particularly in japan i i've got a chance to witness is the time changes according to what time of year it is so in the winter time gets very short in the summer time gets very long because the days are shorter and they are i mean like it sounds like okay well they're not they're just not measuring scientifically or no no no but it's experiential it makes all the sense and so music functions much the same way you you listen to your favorite song or you listen to an important thing and time is irrelevant you are in that five minutes that our passes things happen unwitnessed it just goes by and then you are in an uncomfortable situation with music you don't care for and it's grueling every second is like yeah is a yeah is the metronome of your own doom occurring and you can see the end growing nearer that's a seinfeld baseline for me that baselik and seinfeld slows time to a crawl a hell crawl if there is a hell and i'm going there gates of hell i know that's the first thing i'm gonna hear seinfeld baseline yeah i don't know why it eats me alive uh but i don't know why so maybe something happened to me while i was listening to it i can't remember but tick tick no it's aggressive you hear that aggression those thumbs that that the off pick yeah no i feel you i feel you the aggression of the seinfeld baseline it is it's aggressive it's it's spidery it's an aggressive spider skittering out of that sitcom now i want to this is interesting we're talking about time because another thing i was thinking that i wanted to talk with you about was in terms of the chronology of an artist's output in the world and do you think that the algorithm that introduced me to you thankfully is also scrambling our ability to really understand an artist by dishing out tracks from albums that were supposed to listen from track one to the end and not the fourth track and then another album from three years before and another album you know four years later well let's look at the the previous paradigms the previous algorithms there was one algorithm which was the paola system where you would only hear what the dj was paid to play or this the circumstance was allowed to give you and oftentimes the the levers of power came down to individuals with that would wield that that you know that that sway in very specific ways to get their artists to win and other artists to lose and there was people like moondog who would play on the street are seen as being these like you know incredible gifted people i don't want to use that g term again but like you know but then we're you know homeless and like you know not not necessarily uh getting the flowers in their day only subsequently neither here nor there but that paola system and then there's the the uh you get told by your friend your loved ones your you that system where you know like the the mouth to your ear and how that still exists but it's depreciated we're all a little separated the the transmission through the the digital the digital lines get muddled and we don't have that many systems yet to do so and now our current paradigm which is not in the vessel of a record right like spotify's first act even before it it's done all the things it's done was just erase the label from right no more labels no more barely even a genre we're gonna make up genre terms we're gonna make up like these non real things that just serve our purpose and and other systems are kind of similar like the first thing they do is just redirect our attention and and kind of undo so now spotify doesn't even like to deal with records anymore now it's just a playlist and of course you're old enough to experience mixed tapes to have like a lot of one you know craft and like like pour over like the idea of like them and the idea of you and find musical building blocks that would somehow build bridges between the two on like on this gooey tape substance that would look kind of you know do something else magical uh alchemy deal with the with the sound and and those formats then yeah i mean like like so i basically i feel like the art of now has to be starting to take into consideration that albums don't exist and that we should be thinking in this art that is kind of beautifully going to incorporate other people's songs as part of your art just by they're going to be put side by side now we can't determine that i i'm not one to be able to determine what is to the left of me and what is to the right of me but certainly i can be grateful for the fact that it brought you me and others however that happened and the fact you caught a live wire with me somehow i i'm awestruck that that was even possible same and and and so the like i kind of going back to the Anthropocene it's like this the album now is this construct of all of recorded history and you just wait for your your shuffle to come into focus how weird and yeah it's it's it's kind of beautiful in some ways but it does undo the intentionality that i had like i'm an album artist i love making albums i love telling stories and secrets and spilling and like and kind of putting things like you mentioned all the the harry potter like i only use that because it was such a useful metaphor for people my age and younger who are you know the listeners like i'm i am listening to myself and other people oftentimes the people who are involved are younger and it's like it's this perfect metaphor it's snuck in this back door of consciousness all this magical talk and of course it's like problematic in so many ways like from the person who did it to the way that it's commercialized but it planted a seed of like so much power and potence and like the the imagery and all these things are just like useful symbology that just it's now symbols it's now you know words are words it's those things that we can utilize and kind of take elsewhere right yes and so the album is undone and we're forced to be now all swimming in this techno mancy right it's just like playing it's the resonant frequency of the algorithm is is just a is a weird harsh scream of a modem but we can kind of do you know phone freakers are you familiar with this term you mean people who hacked phones in the old days captain crunch yeah totally so there was myths and legends that you could sing the note the combination of chords that would give you a quarter right like seemingly impossible frequencies that aren't reproducible and yet you have you have people who you know did so they found ways of modulating themselves to fit that vessel in impossible you know like the reason why the frequencies where they were is because they you know the the telephone company model was like this is impossible but ingenuity dictates yeah exactly we'll figure this out we'll get there so so two things one uh what you it's I love to me we like before your recording unfortunately you mentioned being a teacher now and and I was telling you if I was in a class and had professor Daedalus I would just you I would think I am in the secret society now or I would think it is a simulation this you can't have this wonderful a professor here but two I think you are functioning as a teacher through your music regardless and that part of what you I've been learning from you from listening to your music is that crafting of an album and and and and also it that you're just a very active listening to more than one track from any of your albums that I've listened to so far and realizing this that I've I'm seeing little little I'm seeing into a story like you know what I mean that oh this is like halfway through some adventure he's having through via this album or this is somewhere within a teaching in the album itself and then seeing how you're fractalizing the album itself that the track names the album cover all of it is a puzzle box of it's some beauty that you're giving us so so you already taught me that just from your artfulness related to your creation so I think it is possible to make it to break through the algorithm and invite people to go deeper well and I appreciate that and I'll speak to both I so am in awe that that that it exists the possibility that that could still happen not to say that I'm I I still you know obviously make music I still believe in the magic of it I still am I can't not but sometimes it feels like the world gets so narrow and especially not playing a show for a year not being in the midst of that kind of idiot easy immediate magic of of like the summoning that happens amongst a group of people all experiencing sound phenomena it's like so evident in that and so like this year being like all online all away has felt very disruptive towards these kind of continuance so to hear that from you means the world but as a as a as a kind of in 2004 I released a record called Agent Agent and I really really really went in on this concept of every song has like specific meaning and narrative direction and every sample has like this like this alliterative nature and this metaphor and it has like this this kind of overarching spy theme and so every sample came from like a spy place and it was like I made a puzzle box I made an escape room yeah no one got it it was totally like one over all kinds of heads and it just isn't like and and I not to say that I mean I guess that's the thing is I was foolish enough to think there was something gettable and I was also naive enough to do it and I love that that I've never stopped but also equally there is this thing about like well there was a more powerful narrative than one I ever could construct and so it's kind of good to just make way like be artful and be a craftsperson and you know the artifice has place in in the artwork there's a reason these all these words use the same like Greek you know these Greek shared phrases or whatever these Latin words but it is the kind of thing of just like gotta get out of the way more can't have this ego trip to think that you're responsible wholly it's something it really the music is only it's not happening because of what I'm doing it's happening between us you got something that I could never have intended yeah I was trying to put something forward but it's it's totally that middle place between us listen I you I'm glad I'm glad you did the puzzle box that I got that I also I'm terrible at escape rooms you never want to do an escape room with me let me tell you if we're doing an escape room we ain't getting out that's for sure I don't I'm not good at them I get frustrated and I just they just make me feel really dumb but your music doesn't make me feel dumb but it does it does inspire a sense of awe or of like oh wow this is a this there's a lot going on here and then that's exciting because I want that I we know we don't just listen to no one if you like a song you don't listen to it once you're not like well that was great like people you know or even a movie or whatever but which is why I'm just listening to order of the golden dawn over and over and like oh yeah okay I go ahead please so I tell you when I core beliefs that really plays into this thing of repeat listening I truly believe and this there there is some signs that backs us up but the listener affects affects the listen to what your your act of listening not only affects your memory of the song but in some quantum level will change forever the song itself wow right it plays upstream it moves in a certain direction and holy shit so the whole system is is the whole system works together now can we take a pause for a moment yes there is a I'm sorry a fig duty there you have to do some fig duty friend yeah no problem let's pause I'll pause it right now okay this idea of listening the listener affecting music a song on the quantum level has so many implications that it was are spinning through my mind right now but let's talk about the first one being what that means is that you can never anytime you're listening to a song you're listening to a completely new version of it that has been slightly shifted by other listeners that have just listened to it or listened to it during the life of the song am I reading absolutely absolutely and you could be subtle and you could think of it as being profound sometimes there is this like quality of something being at our edge of our experience or like you might hear the whispers your spirit should be listening to this this is important or this is this is terrible or whatever and then it comes into your life and it seems like okay this is this is the thing but of course it's not simply it's not simply that thing that was once was now is there's this culmination of it and so you could look at it as being like that there is this kind of aspect of our of our perceived notion of done and not done but then the mandala effect is constantly happening with our the way we we see music and it's you know a mandala effect obviously is a little bit chintzy and cheesy and wonderfully like phenomena but music does this all the time things that had no effect on us you know the songs of our childhood suddenly are the things we want to be buried to or you know things that that how religious purpose and we were immune to becoming meaningful and it can it can be like this is a listener but equally we're we're we're equally buffeting our environment to be to be very same and similarly so i i use so i'm an artist and resident with seddie right that's why that was one of my questions what does it mean so part of that to me is that you know there's this phenomenology of like receiving transmission from the universe and we're like sifting through the sands looking for aspects of life or intelligence but in many ways to me the the effect of of this listened and listened to means that probably before we started listening to the stars there was no aliens the moment we started listening we created life wow to me on a universal scale if we're really scanning the skies and we're pushing back our expectation to find means that there is and and probably you know like just that the numbers dictate that there probably is like there is life out there right just the yeah you know there's just yeah chances but equally i think until we started to listen it we we we increased our chances some some factor just by looking because that exact effect on a quantum level provides the possibility you are so amazing i was just laying in bed the other night and in as i was falling asleep i was thinking oh my god it's not like i need some massive radio telescope to communicate with these beings i can do it right now and then i thought whoa whoa i don't know what if i don't want to like then you know that was a moment of i think this is why to dive back into like magic the magic symbol set this is why we need protective circles this is why because i think you know yes what you're saying now i understand why you're an artist in residence at seddie number two i love what you're saying because you're brave enough to say it i i i get scared to say i'm not scared to say much but sometimes i just think uh people are going to think i've gone manic or something but the to me it's like oh yeah for sure if you want to communicate with aliens it's going to be through music way before radio telescope and that's how they're going to talk to us and they're going to want to talk through anybody who's willing to let them talk through them you know like they're they're not they're going to let if you are into being one of their receivers they're going to be delighted i would say uh i'm right yeah i would totally agree and i think just to circle back to the magic you know science whatever you want the first spell you always learn is protection you always learn words first you always you know figure out what the evil eye which way it's coming from or whatever you want to say that's just ground ground rules those that's that's where things have to start it's the hand washing and magic it's like you if you're going to do surgery wash your hands it's it's not a crazy idea at all is it that's no i mean there's a reason why it's built into tradition and that you know it took four years night and gale to make it a common science practice of washing your hands the person from the light brigade which is another record of mine i know and i wanted to ask you about that what's the library what do when you say library what is what is the library the charge of the library is a poem you know uh alfred tenison uh which was all about the kramian war which was effectively the schism of the russian orthodoxy right like you you have this other mystical tradition things like baba yaga and the the meeting so i played some shows in the ukraine and it it really opened me up to so yeah i i don't want to i am a tourist i no matter how much i've toured i am inevitably not going to be a person who can have lived an experience i barely have lived an experience in this american expedition right like this is right but uh going someplace and witnessing firsthand some of these things and especially the way that that these different traditions show up in the way people process celebration the way that they kind of in you know like they they in tone their magic so to speak or just you know our present is is heavy heavy heavy and thusly um yeah like i went to the ukraine and like got a big transmission of like the eastern mystical mysticism and again it happened in a dark dirty rave but it's just as present there as it is maybe in a big hall of can you talk about the light then a little bit the liper gate a little bit like that then yeah so so the the light brigade was was was a was a poem again by aphrodisiac but it was specifically about the feudal charge of the it was about the crimine war was basically one of the many victorian expeditions so i made these records about three year wars in the victorian period i made one about the the crimine war i made one about the righteous uh the the righteous harmony was about the uh boxer rebellion and then i also made one a record called the bitter einders which was all about the second boar war and seemingly things chosen arbitrarily but they all have this ended empire feeling they all have this like crumbling which i feel a lot of kinship too with our moment this kind of like being everywhere in the world trying to have a voice trying to be domineering but speaking usually really at right angles to whatever is happening in the spiritual community in the kind of psychic feeling and also uh this kind of idea of overwhelming magic that's abundant and apparent but also kind of doesn't function in the society like we choose but anyways the light brigade kind of really talking about those eastern magical traditions but also the feudal nature of like throwing bodies at the problem oh yeah and we do that constantly yeah i i love that you're talking about you're using that in terms of the east that's one of the ways i've always seen seen them i and yeah they will definitely show up at a dirty rave that's for sure and i think they like the idea of like on chicken legs it feels like oh this is odd like it was real the grim's fairy tales and like obviously pulling back from way older traditions and way older kinds of magic that are just like a little four into our ears but you go to a place and you see the chicken legs and you're like oh like you know this is this is visceral this is happening it just it just doesn't it doesn't fit the format that we've you know it doesn't fit cyberpunk 2077 but it's it's all the same thing just oh cyberpunk now let me ask you this do you how and i know we only have a little bit of time so forgive me if i'm keeping you too long do you feel like it's futile do you have a sense that this is like we're just you know i don't know throwing sand into the ocean here or something like because how is it that there is this never ending compelling feeling that there is a deep powerful benevolent beautiful radiant magic in every single moment that is using people in any way they feel like being used to manifest into this world of darkness do you think it's futile do you or do you think this renaissance that people keep talking about is around the bend or somewhere in between absolutely 100 not futile just like i said earlier entropy is the overwhelming force that disintegration of matter is what's what we're up against and so every time we offer anything sincerely the universe shudders so so that's that's our goal that's the purpose and why else do anything right unless you're yeah you're kind of gracing up against the divine so god bless you thank you so much for this conversation i'm so lucky that you are on my show thank you for making music i'm sorry for this year for you and musicians it's need for we needed this we so needed to shake it up i mean i i talk to the students all the times about this potent possibility that's going to happen where there'll be in a transformed world but it's not just and it's hard to speak on this directly there won't be the same concert halls there won't be the same opportunities there'll be different opportunities and there'll be money to be made but even more so you're gonna have needful people who are devoid they've been left you know they've been dredged of this like easy to access spiritualism that is so abundant in your ears constantly in your body we have like this you know your bones are are activated by you know healed by the purring of these cats that are as songs and and they've been left without you know touched certainly but sound so so much and you know even conversing with you for this length of time is so foreign for me like i haven't had a conversation other than the power link of my baby or my partner and the occasional zoom call with my students like it's it's so different so when we get together in person as i know we'll do at some point Duncan it's going to happen i know it and and you know and hear the the graveliness of your voice not just the kind of weird ones and zeros that were provided with today it is yeah it's going to be really powerful and people are going to be overwhelmed and the people talk about how once this is all done how much harder it's going to be and it certainly is the case but again the reason to be an artist is to curve the world a bit more artful and what an opportunity to do so coming up like i don't want to paint uh paint roses where there's shit or you know etc but obviously that's the role of an artist to degrees is to is to to to kind of find those things too god please definitely promise me we get to meet in person one day i gotta hear some of this modules i'm a modularist too i've been yeah i'm dying for this stuff any electricity i'm good lord i mean to me i drive by the mog factory and my body just goes oh god i'm at least i'm close to it yeah it's so listen uh we will definitely be together in person and hopefully sooner than later and uh in the meantime will you let people know where they can find you or ways they can connect with you the the easiest way and and this is one of those funny things when i first picked my name i really wanted to aspire towards datalus the father vicaris that was my intention but i spelled it wrong i just got it wrong and slash got it right i spell it d a e d e l us and that isn't to say that's wholly wrong there's certain british spellings and obviously the datalus that shows up in in uh like uh ulysses and in portrait of the artist young man uh that's spelled a little bit different as well so datalus is a kind of an open ended term but if you type in d a e d e l us and wherever you know whatever portals hopefully it'll spit out something that i've done and if you are inclined shows are where i feel the most made real but the records have something there too and even more so if if any of that art gives you a feeling out there those listeners or yourself i am so interested in hearing the the the clap back the slap back of that reverb is way more interesting to me the things that you know your art your sound your resonance is way more interesting to me than than hearing my songs again so i'm i'm i'm also a listener a deep and avowed listener myself harikrishna my friend thank you so much all the links you need to find

When you wake up tomorrow, who will you be? When you breathe your last breath, what will you see? Will you see a thing with thousands of nipples that spray poison in your face? And when you scream, why are you doing this? It will say you watch YouTube videos without headphones, without headphones and cafes, without headphones and cafes. That's without, shut up, stop the music. That's without headphones and cafes. That's by Amber Mezder and the three jump rope sisters. All of them, unfortunately, recently died. They fell in a quicksand. And they are now all dead. Quicksand is real. It's spreading. Quicksand incidents are up by 97%. And our country is doing nothing about it. You're listening to Carlson Tannity, and this is Scaring America. Strange beings emerging from quicksand pits are dilapidated president, spitting out lies yet again. World War III on the horizon. What's happening in the sky? Turned red over China, big fucking earthquakes all over the fucking place. And meanwhile, your brain is disintegrating from COVID. What's going on in America? It's not good. I'm here to jerk off your fucking amygdala all over my fucking face. Let's go. We're now in the verge of what is a devastating recession, coupled with record-setting inflation. And of course, on top of that, a supply chain crisis that has me crapping my diesel diapers with fierce sprays of white-hot, malarial muck. They just hit a brand-new record high. Now, the stock market is plunging like a parakeet set on fire by some pernicious pig thrown over a city of paper, and we're about to see it all blast on fire. And I mean fortunes are being lost by the middle class in this country. Am I a slumlord? Do I own over 300 apartment buildings? Do I evict people on a daily basis? Don't look into my private life. Lift yourself up by studying your own heart, not mine. Guess what, friends? You could say goodbye to your pensions, retirement funds, and 401 days. And if you're under 30, you don't know what will happen. Fuck you. You're going to be at war, assuming you deserve it, because you have decided to not be attentive to what's happening in the world. And this is why you're wracked. We'll be right back after this commercial. Are you a quivering, scared, guilty little thing? Do you wake up at 2 AM and create your friends and sad and guilty? Then that means you're using the wrong pillow. I was snorting cocaine off of elephant assholes in the fucking jungles, and then I realized it's because my fucking pillow sucks. It's time to get a new American pillow, American pillows. They won't make you scared. You can sleep again. I don't want to listen to that. You can sleep again. Turn the channel. Hello, it's me, D Trussell. This is the Duggar Trussell Family Hour podcast. And we have a lovely, lovely podcast for you today. Roger Jackson is here with us. He just wrote a wonderful book on reincarnation. If you've had any sense of curiosity about whether or not you keep flying back into this temporal, hive, repeating different lives over and over and over and over and over and over and over again for millennia, for infinity, for a beginningless and endless amount of time, then this is the episode for you. And if you haven't wondered that, why haven't you wondered that? It's a real possibility. Fuck, we're going to jump right into it. But first, this. This episode of the DTFH is brought to you by my new favorite weed gummy, Loomi Labs. Do you hear me rifling around in my drawers right now? You know why I am? It's because I'm looking for my Loomi Labs gummies. But I left him at home, unfortunately. Or I would have eaten one right now without the fear that in 45 minutes or maybe two hours or at some unknown random time, I was suddenly going to start thinking about the very real possibility that we exist in a hell realm and that my dogs are plotting to kill me. That's because Loomi Labs is the perfect micro dose gummy. It's the perfect dose. In fact, I take half of a gummy and it is, it's more than a chef's kiss. It's a chef's French kiss. It's like if Jesus were a chef making dinner for the last supper and came over and just gave you a deep, wet, holy tongue kiss. This is what Loomi Labs is like for your brain. Loomi Labs, I'm telling you, I love them. They're legal somehow, available nationwide. I don't know why. I'm not going to question it. I can fly with them. Thank you, God. Loomi Labs micro dose is available nationwide.

Again, that's microdose.com, code Duncan. And this is the miracle of these micro dose gummies. I'm no longer taking the shitty sleeping medicine. I was getting it CVS that was making me wake up like a zombie. I just eat a half of one of these gummies and fall into a deep, beautiful angelic slumber. Thank you, Loomi Labs. And we are back. My loves, this afternoon, I'm jumping on an airplane and headed to Phoenix to do some standup at Copper Blues Live. Hope you'll come and see me. Tickets are going to be at duckatrustle.com. Also, go to amazon.com and search for esoerotica. This is a book that the DTFH Patreon just collaborated on. It's a book of erotic cryptid stories. It will make you come. It will make you wet and turned on and titillated. And you'll wonder why. And then you'll feel confused, like, what's wrong with me? Why do I want to masturbate to this story of gnomes? We are going to find out if you go to esoerotica on Amazon. Also, the links are at duckatrustle.com. All proceeds from this book are going to various nonprofits. Right now, we're looking for a great nonprofit that helps Ukrainian refugees. And then each month, we're going to switch it up. The family votes on where the money goes. You could be part of it by going to patreon.com forward slash DTFH. And now, friends, today's guest is the author of Rebirth, a guide to mind, karma, and cosmos in the Buddhist world. This is a comprehensive analysis of reincarnation from the Buddhist perspective. And it's awesome. It was really nice to talk to an expert on reincarnation so I could ask him all my weird questions about reincarnation. I've had so many. And it was really cool to hear, at least from the Buddhist perspective, his thoughts on this really weird, really intense subject. Do we come back after we die? And now, everyone, welcome to the DTFH, Roger Jackson. Roger Jackson, thank you so much for coming on the DTFH. I'm so excited to talk with you today about reincarnation. How are you doing? Fine, thanks. Thanks for the invitation. You have a wonderful new book out, Rebirth, a guide to mind, karma, and cosmos in the Buddhist world. I think this might be, at least in recent history, the most comprehensive book written on the subject of reincarnation from a Buddhist perspective. This is your third book. What inspired you to choose this as the topic for your newest book? Well, I mean, there's sort of a long story and a shorter story. And the short term story is that I was asked by an editor at Chambala named Casey Kemp to write an article on takes on rebirth by modern Buddhists for a volume that came out last summer called Secularizing Buddhism. But the longer term issue is that when I first started studying Buddhism seriously in Nepal in 1974, the very first thing that was said at the very first day of this month-long retreat was, mind is beginningless. And someone growing up in the West who had a more or less scientific take on things, probably a materialist to some degree, I don't know. That was counterintuitive. It certainly wasn't something that I assumed was the case. And I wrestled with it for that whole month-long meditation course and for the rest of what was pretty much a year of studying in India and Nepal. And eventually, I went to graduate school at the University of Wisconsin studying under a Tibetan geshe there, who was also a professor, and ended up writing a dissertation on the classical Indian argument that seeks to prove that reincarnation rebirth is actually the way things work in the universe. And so it's kind of a longstanding issue for me philosophically and otherwise. And so I've wrestled with it for the better part of 50 years now. And why don't we just start off with the literal, the literal. What is the, and I know, obviously, there's so many different lineages of Buddhism that I'll have wildly different, seemingly different. Well, it's different ways of articulating what Buddhism is. But if you had to summarize the most traditional Buddhist conceptualization of reincarnation, what would that be? Yeah. I would say that the classic version of this. And actually, although there are many differences from this part of India to that part of India, this school to that school, this part of Asia to that part of Asia, actually most Buddhists in most places and times, at least before we get to the modern world, except broadly speaking, the following. That the basic human predicament is that we are in a condition that in Sanskrit is called samsara, which is the kind of ongoing, on-flowing series of rebirths or reincarnations that we take and have taken since the beginningless time. That's why they say that mind is beginningless. There's no beginning to things. And we have every prospect of continuing this process after the end of this life. And we are born, let's say we die from this life, we are likely to be born unless we become fully enlightened. And who knows what the odds of that are. If we have not become fully enlightened, the odds are we're going to be born somewhere within what the Buddhists describe as the six realms of samsara. And these are from most populated to least populated, moving upward, if you will, the hell realms of various kinds, the hungry ghost realms, the animal realm, the human realm, and then two god realms, a realm of titans, asuras in Sanskrit, or divinities of various sorts. And so we're likely to be born in one of these, of which actually the human is the place you really want to end up. Because even though it doesn't have the greatest longevity or the greatest pleasure, it's the one in which we can discern what our predicament is most easily. Anyway, assuming we're born into one of those realms, the realm into which we are born and the circumstances within that realm are determined by karma, which, of course, is a Sanskrit word that simply means action. And in the Buddhist context anyway, karma means intentional actions of one sort or another. Deeds that we have chosen to perform. And karma is weighted in a particular way, such that in very broadly speaking, good deeds lead to good results, whether in this life or some future life, bad deeds lead to bad results, whether in this life or some future life. I mean, that's the broadest conception of it. And the alternative then, which is what the Buddha, among many religious wanderers in North India 2,500 years ago, was trying to arrive at, was a state of liberation called in Buddhism Nirvana that is beyond the need to be reborn ever again. So that's in a nutshell, that's it. Thank you. That's a very well said nutshell. Now, I think some people, when they hear the concept of reincarnation, especially people who are afraid of like the Richard Dawkins cosmology, infinite annihilation, they feel like reincarnation is good news. It means, well, at least I get to keep going. So can you explain why does the Buddha actually kind of see reincarnation as bad news? Yeah, yeah, well, this is a very important point because I think there's a certain esoteric strand in Western religion represented, for instance, by the Theosophical movement and more recent vintage, various people you can read. I mean, I think about Shirley MacLean, people like that who talked about reincarnation. The assumption that somehow, well, if we're all human beings in this life, wow, and we're middle class or whatever it may be, it's only gonna be better next time, but that's not how karma works, at least according to Buddhist tradition. And I would say most of the traditional Indian schools that developed ideas of reincarnation. So I liken it sometimes to a Ferris wheel. You can be up this moment, but just one spin of the wheel in effect, and you're down at the bottom suddenly, and it all depends on karma, on the quality of the actions, particularly the actions that come up, the tendencies that come up at the time of death. So it's quite crucial. Also, how are you going to enjoy this Ferris wheel, as you put it? If you know that a few cars just below yours, there's somebody getting their head sawed off by a lunatic, and underneath that, someone's starving, and underneath that, someone's on fire, and underneath that, so yeah, great. You're like in the part of the Ferris wheel that's got air conditioning and a good view, but it's kind of... It ain't necessarily always gonna be so, yep. Right, yeah. And if you're in these pleasurable God realms, for instance, where they say, oh, the bliss there is so far beyond any sexual bliss that human beings can enjoy, that you can't even conceive of how great it is, but there's these wonderful little descriptions in the literature of how at the end of a very long, very blissful God realm life, suddenly your garland begins to fade a little bit, so you've got a garland of marigolds, and you begin to get body odor, and you begin to suddenly see these little quick visions of where it is you may end up, because there's always, you know, for every good karma that got us up there, there's plenty of bad karma lurking beneath the surface of us that could come up, particularly if the death is a fearful one, or not in the best of circumstances. No, you start doing those like sad commercials on Fox News, you know what I mean? You're like, hi, my name's whoever, no one knows who you are anymore, but you used to be a megastar. And I'm taking vitamins, these vitamins, that's what happens. That's right, that's right, that's right. It's that on the cosmic scale, so now, I was reading your essay, which I, what was it in Shambhala, the essay that I read, or where was that published? Tricycle. Yeah, tricycle did an excerpt from the last chapter, yeah. Okay, now I found it interesting, you brought something up that I didn't even recognize as problematic, that modern takes, or the idea of trying to transform Buddha into some kind of modern scientist is actually kind of incorrect, or maybe even offensive in the sense that that's not what Buddha was like. When Buddha was teaching, he was not using reincarnation as a metaphor, he meant it. When he was talking about his past incarnations, he didn't mean that as some kind of teaching tool, it's not real, he meant I fed myself to tigers, which is one of his reincarnations and all the various ones. So can you talk a little bit about that? Well, I mean, I think there's a couple of different things going on here. The most important is you articulated very well, which is that at least from my perspective, and not everybody would agree with this, there's much debate about many of these issues, but certainly from my reading of the earliest literature we have, most of which is contained in what we call the Pali Canon, which is the sacred texts that are particularly important in the Theravada world of Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia. Anyway, if you read texts like that, it seems very hard to escape the conclusion that the whole problem of rebirth and liberation was absolutely central to the Buddha. He just talked again and again and again about how this action leads to that result, not just in this life, but in some future life. And he furthermore says that he himself has observed this, that he himself has direct experience of the reality of rebirth. And the most famous example of this is in classic, and we should think reasonably early, accounts of the night of the Buddha's enlightenment, when after defeating the forces of Mara, his tempting daughters, his loathsome armies and so forth, he sits under the Bodhi tree in Bodhgaya, India, and over the course of the three watches of the night, he first is able through intense concentration to have direct vision of all the previous lives that he has had. He can say, oh, well, you know, five lives ago, I was living in Varanasi, and I was such and such a type of person, and five lives before that, I was a rabbit somewhere, and it goes on and on. So he says, you know, he has seen this with this retrocognitive ability that is a natural byproduct in many Indian meditation systems of intense concentration. And in the second watch of the night then, he uses what's called in Buddhism, the divine eye, we might say it's his clairvoyance, his ability to gaze about him in the present, and in effect, read the karma of various beings and see how that karma is leading them to this rebirth or that rebirth, depending on the quality of their action. So this is, you know, this is a strong claim to a direct, empirical, if you will, or experiential recognition of the fact that there is rebirth. And these kinds of narratives are central to Buddhism, and I don't know if we wanna get into people who argue, oh, it was just a metaphor, it was just kind of a sop to popular belief in his time, but I think that the preponderance of the textual evidence, not to mention what tradition tells us having come down over 2,500 years is that he was, he meant this pretty literally. Yes, I think we'll stick with that. I love thinking about it from not, from a modern perspective, not a secular perspective, but from thinking about what we know now with quantum physics, the possibility of there being a multiverse, the idea of, you know, higher dimensions outside of the understanding of time and space. And also some of the stuff you hear from the shamanic traditions, the people who drink ayahuasca or how shamans somehow can similarly see this web of connections. So from a modern perspective, it seems like what we are is some kind of super organism that is broken up by these hallucinatory dips into time and space where we merge with some form of organic matter and then unmerge with that. That's what we call death. But isn't that basically the idea? It's we're some kind of super organism that shares the quality of this beginningless mind. And we've gotten involved with time and space in a way that has given us the perception of duality and has created sort of amnesic or a generally occurring amnesic condition where most of us can't remember not only our past lives, but like, you know, what we did two days ago. Isn't that what it, isn't that what the, if we're going to look at this as from a, if it were scientists and we have to look at this, you know, from a perspective of, all right, let's figure out what this organism is, that would be the analysis, right? I think that, yes, I think that would be, let me make two points about this. The first is that it's quite clear that from a traditional Buddhist perspective, I'll turn to the modern in just a second, but from a traditional Buddhist perspective, there is not something typically like mind at large, of which we are then just sort of a little offshoot that goes through, as you say, these hallucinations. Each of us to use a slightly different metaphor is like this rainbow strand of mind that has gone beginninglessly through time and taken birth after birth after birth. So there's a kind of pluralism there that I see, and I think many people see in the pre-modern tradition, but we can, you know, that doesn't... How does that work? I'm sorry, let's just stick with a pluralism part and maybe you can help me understand that. If for all these sort of spectromy rainbow strands of infinite consciousness, what is the separation between my rainbow strand and your rainbow strand? Yeah, that's a great question. It's momentum, I suppose, and it's karma. And that begs the question philosophically in many ways, but Buddhists are quite intent on saying that my karma and your karma are not the same thing. And that my mind and your mind are not the same quote thing. Otherwise, we'd be getting all these karmic mind melds and that would be problematic in a whole variety of respects. What's the separate, well, what is the... Like, did they come up with the idea of like upon the dissolution of the body, what holds this packet together and what is the cellular boundary between my packet and my whatever my things and your things? Excellent question. And again, there's no good, obvious, clear answer except the word I used before. There's a kind of momentum that mind has based on the buildup of all this previous karma. In a way, we wanna keep existing as who we are and we do. So that's what allows for this degree of separation. So even sometimes there's discussions and there's such a thing as like collective karma, right? We're both Americans, okay, at a certain level. You could say that's collective karma, but I don't think collective karma typically really is some super karma above and beyond a whole collection of individual karmas. You and I had karma from previous lives that, you know, to be born American in this life, but beyond that, we can designate it collective karma, but it's not some thing above and beyond. I see, it just, you know, we get into this place where with it, and what this is one of the many things I love about Buddhism is the invitation to deep examination of these concepts. And if this is a thing that the Buddha reported, then it should be just as scrutinized as all the other things. Right, and he said that we should scrutinize what he says, so and people certainly do. And this is, you have scrutinized it in this book. So forgive me if I'm, I'm asking you quite, in my own contemplation of it, these are things that I wonder about. And I must ask you the most mundane critique of reincarnation that I've ever heard someone ask me, and yet maybe the best because I was like, I really have no idea how to answer that. He, my friend Nicky was saying, how does that work with like species going extinct or the dinosaurs, for example, when the dinosaurs were wiped out, where theoretically, if all life evaporates from this planet, does that mean that there's no more possibility for human incarnation? No, because you have to recognize that for Buddhists, the cosmos is vast, infinite. There are world systems within world systems and world systems beyond world systems. And if dinosaurs went extinct on this earth, well, if this was the only planet that supported sentient life, that's a problem, but it's not. I mean, not only are there various realms, we don't even see God realms, hell realms. We don't see ghost realms most of the time, but there are other world systems according to Buddhism in which there are the equivalents of human, the human realm, the God realm, the ghost realm, and so forth. So, you know, poof, a dinosaur dies here when the meteor hits, you know, next day, in quotes, could be often, you know, somewhere near Arcturus. So it's just not a problem. It's just not a problem for Buddhists in that respect. Because there's, at the time of death, the mind being non-physical is not restricted by time and space, particularly by space, by those kinds of limitations. So you can be, you know, even within the, just on our earth, you know, somebody, for instance, my first teacher, Lama Yeshe, died in California in 1984, and was, his reincarnation, his tulkhu was discovered to be a Spanish boy, you know, where, well, you know, the geography of that doesn't exactly work out, but clearly, at least in the Tibetan way of reckoning these things, you're not limited by where you died or where you're born. It could have been on some other planet as well, or in some kind of a heaven. So there's many, many options there. And I am curious, though, is it temporarily, like, is it linear? Like, is there the possibility to reincarnate, like, you know, the Shirley McClain New Age version of it is, you die, there's some kind of spa you go to, you pick your next life, and there's a linear quality to it where, you know, you're gonna always be reincarnating in the future. Is there anything about maybe the reincarnating outside of time or in the past? I don't think so. I actually think that, at least in the standard model, if you will, of Buddhist reincarnation, it is linear also. I mean, when they told me that first day at that monastery in Nepal that mind is beginningless, they were thinking in serial terms. So everything leading up to now, and then whatever leads from here on out. Now, if we talk about attaining states of realization, especially if we talk about attaining, you know, fulfilled states like Buddhahood, their temporality, you know, it goes by the board, all sorts of any kind of conceptual constructions go by the board. But that's outside the standard model that I focused on. Got you. Yeah, yes. Yeah. Does your lawn look like some kind of evil forest creature cast a spell on it?

Thank you, Get Sunday. Yeah. Okay, cool. Thank you for answering all my questions, by the way. Well, actually, can I come back though to the... If you don't mind to... Because I didn't answer... Not at all. I didn't answer really your original question about modern sort of... Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. But you know, modern sort of a kind of new physics way of thinking about it. Right? And it seems to me that there... Yes. What you articulated, is a view that is held by quite a number of people. The most prominent among Buddhist teachers, I would say, is Alan Wallace, whose reputation you may know and whose work you may know. Sure. A very prolific writer and teacher, as well. He majored in physics at Amherst back in the day. And, you know, knows a fair amount about these things. And he has... He's very interested in some of these versions of physics that I would describe as probably not being at the center of physics these days. They're more, if you will, at the fringe. That doesn't mean they're wrong and the slightest. It just means that they require, as you articulated it quite well, sort of complete rethinking of what the universe is and what we are. Yeah. You know, Wallace talks in terms, as I think some of the physicists he's drawing on talk, about, you know, the universe being... Not being so much about matter, or even energy so much as about information. Yes. And if that's the case, then maybe the universe is, as one physicist put it, a hundred years ago even, maybe the universe is less like a great thing and more like a great thought. Now, if that's the case, then mind may have the kind of independence and, you know, sort of... oversight, if you will, of the cosmos in ways that most contemporary physicists can't appreciate. But I think it has to be acknowledged also that the majority of contemporary physicists still work off of a physicalist or, if you will, materialist model. Sure. In which whatever it is we call mind, not saying that it doesn't exist, but that at best we could say that it's a function of or an epiphenomenon of the brain. Yeah. Of matter organized in a particular way. It's my favorite thing with scientists or people like that. It's an epiphenomenon. It's like, you know, like a car exhaust that happens to produce all culture, love, connection. It's almost like a backfire or something. Matter, backfire, sentience, really an annoying take on it. Okay, so to get... Go ahead, sorry. No, no, I was just going to say, but it's the majority take. Well, yeah, I mean, yes, it's the majority take, but relative to, I think, the population of this planet we're on, it's actually not the majority majority. It just happens to be a majority of... Fair enough. Fair enough. But we're supposed to deny our own personal experience. We're not supposed to see any kind of inkling. I don't think this is the first time this has happened to me or any kind of like experience on psychedelics or under hypnosis or through dreams or through teachers or all the various cultures who are like, no, not only is this real, it's like really bad. You don't understand. You've only got a second to grab hold of what's going on here. I wanted to ask you personally, have you had any inkling of your past incarnations or any kind of recollection of past lives or any kind of encounter in your own personal experience that would make you think that this is actually more true than the secularist might think it is? No, I have not. I'm probably too much of an intellectual. I'm not sure what it is. But no, I've had no such experience. I did have a good friend tell me years ago that she was sure I had been a bird in my previous life based not on any psychic vision she had, but just on my physical mannerisms. Oh, that's very nice. I guess I wasn't sure if it was a compliment or not. But anyway, I think it is a compliment. Yeah, birds are incredible. They're so graceful, beautiful. Now, let's jump to your take on that very thing, which reminds me a little bit of Robert Anton Wilson. Tell me about as if agnosticism. Yeah, I mean, this is for what it's worth. And if anybody cares, which I'm not sure anybody does, this is kind of the position that I myself have come to over the years. Maybe it's maybe be helpful to just a very quick background to say that in my analysis of modern takes on rebirth, especially modern takes on rebirth in the West and, you know, I suppose within the educated, somewhat intellectual West, it strikes me that there are something like four different positions that can be taken on rebirth, or for that matter on many aspects of Buddhism. And we might say that almost all religious traditions actually have these four perspectives to some degree in the face of modernity, which we find ourselves for better or for worse, smack in the middle of, unless we're in post-modernity. But anyway, and these run, if you will, if we take a more conservative view as being, quote, right-wing and a more, quote, liberal view being left-wing, that's just the cliche anyway. So if we start at the right flank, we have what I would call literalism, which is people, and these will include certainly people who have come to the West from Asia or have taught Westerners in Asia, but it can include Westerners as well, who say, you know, the way the texts describe it is exactly the way it is. And the Buddhists were not, as you said earlier, they're not being metaphorical or symbolic or psychological or existential about any of this stuff. You know, you screw up in this life and there is something going to happen to you. You know, maybe on some level, you can say it's illusory, but not on a level that matters to you right now. You better be sore afraid. Yeah, it is like that. And the Scriptures, it is no joke. When they describe the hells, it's like you think the Christian hell is scary. Wait till you hear the descriptions of the Buddhist hell. Yeah, we got eight hot ones, we got eight cold ones, we got occasional hells, you name it, hell for a day. Anyway, so that's the literalist view. Then there's the view that I call neo-traditionalists moving slightly left, but still right of center. And this is the view in which, this is where I put somebody like Alan Wallace or David Loy or other very interesting contemporary Buddhist thinkers. You know, maybe he's holding us the Dalai Lama at times as well, who are trying to find a way to justify and uphold the traditional view broadly speaking, but maybe not in all its details and are interested in looking, as you originally suggested, at some new ways of conceiving what the universe is like that might allow then for the possibility of something like traditional rebirth. Again, maybe not in all its gory details, but broadly speaking. And then moving left from that, now slightly to the left of center, though I think this is a pretty big jump in many ways, is what I would call the modernist take, which basically says that even the new physics has yet to be really demonstrated, the traditional arguments really don't work, there are problems aplenty, even when we talk about mystical experience and therefore no traditional argument or even modern argument really is sufficient unto itself or even if you try to put them all together, it doesn't add up to really convincing proof that there is rebirth and therefore the best we can do is to be kind of agnostic about it and say, well, we really don't know, we're not persuaded, but it might be the case and so we think about things as meaningfully as we can as skeptical people in a skeptical age. Namely, we do think about say something like the realms of rebirth described traditionally in Buddhism as being more like descriptions say on one level of different states of mind that we go through in the course of a single day or a single lifetime, or we can think about it as describing the different social and other conditions that people live in right now. We can certainly see on this earth at this moment, people who are in hell realms, people who are in ghost realms of some sort or another without our having to believe necessarily that there's anything that transcends this particular life we have and then so the last view then and that tries to take rebirth seriously and work with it and if you will reinterpret it along more symbolic psychological existential lines and the last view furthest to the left is what I call the secularist view, which says all these are traditional Asian ideas. We got to toss them out. We've just got to recreate Buddhism in an entirely modern vein. So my own place within that is more or less at the modernist point. We may in fact disagree on some things regarding various kinds of proof or demonstrations or arguments for it, but just speaking personally, I have not found either individually or collectively that they quite add up to substantial evidence, but again, the universe is passingly strange. I don't know what the case really may be and I hope that most people are modest enough to admit that they don't know how things are. And so I just, you know, from my own standpoint, I behave and I try to think and behave as if these were the case. I don't know that they're the case. Right. And so that's why I call it a kind of as if agnosticism. The agnosticism is my not knowing. The as if is participating in Buddhist thought, Buddhist life, Buddhist ritual, lighting incense, chanting, visualizing, whatever it may be, but without the certainty that traditionalists sometimes have that, oh yeah, what you're representing here is exactly the way things are in the cosmos. Why is that certainty such a bummer? What do you mean by bummer? I mean a bummer to attend it or a bummer when people have it. It's a bummer when they have it. Why? Why do you think that's such a bummer when you encounter it? You just get this, it makes you feel, ugh. Right. Well, I mean, I think we, the compassionate answer would be that people, I mean, we're all mortal beings. You know, as Camu famously said, I'll change the language and make it less sexist. People die and they're not happy. They're not happy about the fact that they die. Most of their lives, there is some degree of unhappiness. So all of us, we don't know what our predicament is in the cosmos. We don't know who we are basically. And we are beings that are anxious and we seek meaning. We want to know who we are, where we sit within some cosmic scheme. I mean, that's what many people, many scholars nowadays simply describe. And I would agree with this. Religion is a sort of meaning making mechanism. It's a way in which people can find meaning for their lives by establishing a cosmology and ethics, mythology, doctrines and so forth and feeling themselves fitting securely within that. Right. You know, in a Christian, I mean, no, I've had Buddhist friends die and we're assured by a llama. He went to the Pure Land of Amitabha. Okay. Maybe maybe there's such a thing. Maybe there isn't. We don't know. We feel better about it. Christians will say, oh, you know, she went to a better place or she's in the arms of Jesus now. You know, we can we can kind of laugh at that. We can laugh at the we can be uncomfortable with the certainty. But but I think we have to appreciate why people think this way, feel this way. It's part of trying to feel at home in the universe. That was a very, very compassionate analysis of that. Camus not so compassionate. I believe he called it philosophical suicide, didn't he? The idea that we to fill that insecure aching. What what happens after this? What happened to my mom? My dad, what's going to happen to my wife? My kids. We invent something to act as a kind of like balm in a sense to assuage that. And I, you know, again, I think that all of that points to a real misunderstanding of how fucked we are. If reincarnation is real in the sense that no, no break, no break. You know, and I think that to me, this is the, even if it's the human birth that you're lucky enough to get. One terrifying thing to me about, you know, my own life and looking at how unconscious I have been and how easy it is to just sort of walk around like some kind of zombie. And then you start meditating. If you're lucky you come upon Buddhism or some teacher or something real. And maybe you get a little flicker, a little flicker of something more. And to me, that's really scary because how the, the idea that you die and then you get to be a little baby and you get to be with your mama and you have all these childhood things and you've got a young body again. You get to run around assuming you get to be human. And you, and you remember all that to me creates a more comfortable version of reincarnation. But if it's more akin to like when you have, when you're sick and you're falling asleep and going into a weird dream and waking up for a second like, what the fuck? What am I? And then going back asleep and then waking up and going back asleep, waking up and doing that forever, forever, never ending, never ending. Like some kind of unit thing that just keeps sort of waking up and falling back asleep. That is awful. That is awful. Yeah. This is why Groundhog Day is the favorite movie of many Buddhists. Yes. Yes. And I think some people, that helps people first. I think that that, that goes into the place where reincarnation is real underneath all the secularism or whatever your particular cosmology is. That's why when people watch it, they get a particular woozy feeling. Yeah. Yeah. No, absolutely. Yeah. And I think that there's, yeah. I mean, the analogy to sort of trying to go to sleep and waking up and going to sleep again, that, that's actually a kind of metaphor or analogy that's used in, in the tradition to some degree, particularly when you, you know, in the Tibetan tradition, as I think you know, it's widely accepted that between death and rebirth, there is a period of up to 39 days called the bardo in Tibetan, the intermediate state in which there are both terrifying visions, premonitions or prefigurings of what your next life would, will be, but also possibilities for some kind of liberation. And this is why the famous so-called Tibetan Book of the Dead is read in many contexts in Tibetan culture to a person who has died. And the idea being, they might be able to hearken to what is being said about recognizing that all these terrifying visions are just the, the clear nature of your own mind. And, you know, you can be liberated right now in the bardo. But, but again, the, the analogy to it being like a kind of endless nightmare is certainly an apt one. Roger, how do we know this isn't the bardo? Everyone going around here thinks they're in the human realm. Everyone going around here thinks they're humans. Is there anything in your study of Buddhism that points to the possibility that part of going into those 49 days in the bardo is that you think that you are living in a real world and a human when actually this is that series of visions mentioned in the bardo, Thadda. Yeah. Well, I think it can work both ways. I think you, I suspect that beings in the bardo do not fully recognize that they are in the bardo. Yeah. It's perhaps akin to what we sometimes think ghosts might experience. But, but actually, I mean, there's a cheap and easy answer to your question, which is that there are in a number of Tibetan traditions anyway, the notion that everything is a bardo. There are six bardos and the one between death and the next rebirth is only one of these six and we're, we're actually in the bardo of, you know, the human realm right now or whatever realm it is we happen to be in. I'm assuming most of your listeners are in the human realm, but I don't honestly know. There's actually a lot of hummingbirds really love my podcast. Well, that's okay. They have tiny little earbuds. I could, I could understand that. So, so yeah. Okay. Well, so this is the bardo. It's just not the, the bar, the intermediary bardo. This, what do they call it? The bardo of becoming or something? Is that what we're in right now? Yeah. We are exactly. This is the bardo of becoming. And yeah, I think that's right. Anyway, there are everything, every experience we have throughout samsara is in some form of bardo, which is actually a wonderfully symbolic way of talking about how we're always in transit somewhere else. We're always intermediate. Even if it's between one moment and the next, there's a bardo there from one moment of my mind to the next moment of my, of my mind. Yes. And, and, and that's why I think that's, isn't that where we enter into these modern interpretations of reincarnation? Or at least like the, the, like bringing, because I'm just listening to Jack Cornfield's book, audio book, bringing the, bringing the Dharma home, I think is what it's called. And he was saying, quoting the Buddha, I believe it was a quote of the Buddha saying, teach Buddhism in the vernacular of the people wherever you happen to be, which explains why there are so many versions of Buddhism out there. And so in the vernacular, the vernacular of the West or modernity or whatever you want to call it, there's a natural and a very important skepticism when it comes to reincarnation. So one way to begin the conversation is you, just what you said, right? You are re, every time you wake up in the morning. This is a form of reincarnation, isn't it? It's a, you're entering into a new life. And in fact, this is the problem with the bardo becoming, isn't it? Like we don't really, we can only become, there's no past. There's no future. We're actually constantly reincarnating right now. Is that a correct interpretation of it? Well, yes, it is. I mean, to the degree that kind of a radical idea of momentariness is central to the way Buddhists conceive both mind and matter. Yes. You know, it's rebirth every second. But, but of course there are, if you will, micro and macro versions of that. We're undergoing micro versions of that even as we speak. Mind moment, mind moment, mind moment related somehow to body moment, body moment, body moment, but there will come a point for each of us, for everybody where you know, one, the last micro moment of this life will result in the first micro moment of the intermediate state or some future life, but that's a macro change then. And the Buddhists will want to insist, a traditional Buddhist will want to insist on that. You know, it's mind, mind, mind. Does that micro moment, it's everything. Yeah. That micro moment, it's everything, right? The idea is you don't get that micro moment. That is the, that's where you're going to land in your next life. That micro moment, that's the slot machine of reincarnation. And so if that micro moment is angry, scared, miserable, resentful, vengeful, then that will determine where you're at. That's the GPS coordinates of your next life. Right. You're going to collect two dollars even. Yeah. Yeah. And this is why it's so important within Buddhist tradition as in many contemplative traditions, certainly of Asian vintage to have, if possible, a peaceful and to the degree we could ever control, a controlled death. And this is why, you know, ideally one approaches death with a contemplative standpoint. One feels at peace with what one has been and done. And one tries to place one's mind into the most positive and peaceful state one possibly can. Now, that's, that's, you know, it's weird stuff, right? It's, it's hard to, hard to, hard to control for many people, maybe for anybody, for all we know. But this, this is, you know, this is cosmologically, as it were, karmically, the reason that for Buddhists, it's so important to try to have a peaceful death. And this is why so many meditations, particularly in the Tibetan tradition anyway, are geared towards actually almost pre-enacting your own death process, because the Tibetans talk about and have analyzed all these different subtle physical and mental and other sorts of changes that we undergo as we die. And if we can become familiar with those ahead of time, then when it actually happens to us, maybe we can say, ah, you know, whether we're even saying things at that point, but at some level we'll recognize, ah, you know, the clear light is coming. And I, I can use this to gain liberation. So in that sense, life becomes a kind of dress rehearsal for death. I mean, obviously you do many other things. That's not all life is, but, but with death in mind, you, you undertake certain kinds of meditation that, that should help familiarize you with what's going to happen to you at the time of death. Right. And that isn't weird at all. We are most certain. I mean, whatever you believe on reincarnation, if you don't think you're going to die, you know, well, congratulations. That must be a really weird way to be, but we were certainly mortal. And this is sort of like, you know, the, those, ah, the military vehicles got all the soldiers in them flying over. They're going to have to parachute out. You're going to have to parachute out. You better know how to use the parachute. You better understand where you're going because no matter what, and though it sucks about this is you don't know when you're getting kicked out of the plane. That's the, that's the other issue is like, it could happen at any second where you get called up or where you have to jump. And so you need to be ready for that so that you don't go down screaming. Right. That, that's the idea. And you know, I don't know, by the way, I get confused about it, but my, you know, I get, do you have any kids? Yeah. That's fun. Did your kids ever say anything when they were young or you that made you think, whoa, where'd you get that from? Oh yeah, kids say that all the time. I didn't necessarily conclude that any, any odd things he said were a past life memory. But and I remember, I just tell you a story when he was very young, we took him, I think it was less than two, maybe we took him to be blessed by his holiness, the Dalai Lama. And there was part of me that as we approached his holiness with our son, you know, kind of held out, he was going to say, wait a minute, let me see that child. And he was going to recognize him as a, as a tool coup. And actually, I don't think that's probably something you really want. There's, it's been a complicated thing socially and otherwise when Westerners do get recognized, but such a thing did not happen. That is so funny. We all think that as parents secretly that our children are reincarnated masters. Yes. This is a, yeah, the Buddhist version of, oh, I've got a special, you know, really, I've got a genius child, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know, my son said, by the way, that's beautiful that you gave that to your child. That's incredible. That's incredible. My son said, offhandedly, I was bumped by a car and my body stopped working. That was a very, very, very long time ago. It was just like, what did you say? What? Yeah. Yeah. What to make of all this. I mean, I, you know, this is among the strangenesses in the universe for sure. And you know, there's one of the things I talk about a little bit in the book, but others have talked about it in much greater detail is the research of a scholar at the University of Virginia, no longer living named Ian Stevenson, who really closely investigated what he called cases suggestive of reincarnation, where children would report what seemed to be past life experiences of some sort. And he really dug into these. He approached it with a skeptical eye. And he, you know, I think most of them he kind of was able to dismiss based on suggestion and, you know, cultural or parental influences. But he did say towards the end of his career that there were, there was a certain number, very small, but it's a certain number that he just couldn't, he couldn't figure out what was going on there. Now, that doesn't guarantee anything, but, but again, at least to concede once more how strange the cosmos is, and that, you know, maybe there is something to something like that. But I've never. Well, I mean, isn't it a luxurious conceptualization of reality, which is you die, and that's it. Wow. Yeah. Not like you of all your sentience or whatever it is, this exhaust, this car exhaust running off of your like neural, neural computer, it stops and you're fine. And that's it. You're as fine as fine could be pure, perfect, eternal, no, nothing to worry about. Doesn't matter what you did. What'd you do? Did you club a bunch of baby seals? Were you do, do you do things that made Dahmer seem like an amateur? Doesn't matter upon death. Everything is completely wiped out. Wiped out. Yeah. I think I, I think I saw Bob Thurman mention that if you want a state of mind that we're dumping oil in the ocean or, you know, living in a way that completely destroys other people, doesn't like make you feel even slightly guilty, then that's you're going to need that version of reality to pull it off guilt free. Right. Right. But on the other hand, to insist that a particular cosmology, a particular vision of the way things work, say the Buddhist rebirth karma model of things has to be the case. Because without it, we won't have any ethics is just, it's to me, not a good argument. It's not a good argument philosophically speaking. I, I, I agree that it can help motivate people if they, if they believe that. And that's why, frankly, many of these ideas I think developed was as a kind of bulwark for basic human ethics. But it may be to, you know, I think there's always the existentialist lurking in me at some deep level. Unfortunately, well, you know, that, that it just may be that we are, that there is no foundation for ethics, that it is a human construction and that we do the do the best to make rules as we may almost make them up as we go along here, you know, swapping around in the human realm. And, and that's maybe the best we can hope for. I think that's what somebody like Camus came to, you know, that you, there was no absolute foundation for ethics, but we, we worked it out as best we could. We tried to commit ourselves to others as well as to our own selfish ends and, you know, and granted, there's no justification even for that on a bedrock philosophical ground. It's just, we, again, we, we muddle along. It's sort of the old line from Samuel Beckett, you know, I can't go on. I must go on. I can't go on. I must go on. I must go on. That's where we, we must go on. Yeah, it's, it's. That's what I say every time I take acid about six hours in. Now, the, the, let me go to sleep. Okay. But in this case, though, just, and I, you know, I, I do agree with you. I didn't mean to insinuate that secularists can't be ethical or that they need some kind of ghost story to not like blow up their neighbor's house or something like that. I get that argument. But I think from this perspective, ethics goes from being a made up thing to a form of navigation, doesn't it? It's like ethics is a cosmic navigation system that is not here. In other words, like, is it unethical to jump into a swimming pool filled with alligators? Is it ethical to do that? It doesn't matter. You're going to get eaten by alligators. If you jump into a swimming pool of hungry alligators, there's nothing other than don't jump in that. That's not an ethical choice. You don't, unless you want to get eaten by alligators, in which case be my guest, this is, so you know, this is not, this is more saying like, look, you are free. You are autonomous and you can, based on this point going forward, not only reincarnate in this life is a less selfish, less neurotic, less freaked out person, but continue to reincarnate if you want to in ways that aren't going to be entirely horrifically miserable. It's not ethics. It's navigation, right? It's a navigation, a model of navigation. Yeah. Yeah. And I think your point about, in effect, you know, it goes back to our talking about being, every moment being a bardo as it will, or there's a bardo between moments, every moment, you know, as T.S. Eliot once put it, every moment is a new and shocking valuation of all we have done and been. We have the option, according to Buddhism, in this very moment to opt for a more positive way of being and thinking and acting and speaking. So it's right there. It's not, you can't say, oh, man, my karma is so heavy. You know, it's weighing me down. Granted, karma has its effects and it makes some people's circumstances harder and other people's circumstances easier if we accept the traditional definitions. But the gospel, if you will, the good news in Buddhism is right here and now we can opt for a better way of being, thinking, speaking, acting. And it's entirely up to us. And whether or not. Is that intention? Yes, I'm sorry. You were saying whether. No, I'm just going to say whether or not there's, excuse me, free will on some grand scale or not, because this is a tricky question when it comes to Buddhism that we don't necessarily want or need to get into. But but effectively, we are free to to to act in the moment in appropriate ways, ways that, again, maybe there's no foundation for any of this. But but as you said, we it's a negotiation onward, you know, and we're social beings and we negotiate onward, not just with ourselves. Even if we're in retreat a lot, there's still other beings that we're interacting with, affecting and being affected by. So it's it's an ongoing, ongoing process. And, you know, maybe it's arbitrary. You I in my case, my sort of as if I I try to think and act and behave and speak as if, you know, the Buddhist way of talking about things was right. And it, you know, I can say it has brought meaning to my life. And I know a lot of people whose lives it has brought meaning. And maybe that's all we can say. And, you know, presumably people, if they are paying attention to Buddhism are trying to be kinder, softer, gentler people. Overall, there's definitely circumstances in which you've got to be hard and tough. But discerning which those are is never an easy matter. I mean, ethics is murky in many cases, as we all know. But but, you know, it sort of works for me. Maybe that's just a pragmatic answer to it. And maybe maybe a pragmatic approach is all that most people end up really taking in the end, I don't know. I think it's a beautiful take on things. I think it's useful, too. I think some people just they don't they don't have the the desire or time or they just don't want to deal with being someone who believes in reincarnation. I mean, there's a lot of stigma attached to it. It's like, why do you believe in reincarnation? What are you going home to polish your crystals? What do you really believe in reincarnation? Come on, wake up. It's all death. So I think the agnostic take on things is also a very logical take on things because, you know, so OK, so you die and it's infinite obliteration. As as Richard Dawkins says, death is the anesthesia that takes away the pain of life. You know, if that's right, if that's what it is, yeah, in your last that last moment, are you going to think like, damn, but I was too generous? Fuck, I didn't have to be so generous and kind. I'm just going to die forever. Boy, that sucks when I was giving food to people who are hungry. And yeah, why did I try to not be such a selfish jerk? No matter what, it's the it's the best bet. You know, I think I think it's the best bet. But I am a true believer in it. I've done. I mean, I've seen not my past lives, but I've seen like. I can't explain it, but I saw it. Not my like, oh, I was Julius Caesar. Right. I saw some kind of cluster. Embarrassingly massive cluster of egg like things that represented all my past lives. And there was so many of them because I've been doing it because I'm so terrible at not doing this. And like it was it was it was an it was a true embarrassment, you know, and in the sense that I would. But now that I have kids, you know, I I don't want to transcend. You know what I mean? Like I don't think I want to get off the wheel. Right. Well, of course, that's part of the whole idea behind the Bodhisattva ideal of Mahayana Buddhism, great vehicle Buddhism, which is that, well, yes, you are striving to become a fully enlightened Buddha. You vow along the way to help as many beings in as many circumstances as you possibly can. So in that sense, maybe it's a slight shift of ultimate emphasis from what you find in the earlier texts and traditions. We're getting off the, you know, as a Jack Kerouac has this great line from Mexico City Blues, this may not be an exact quote, but it's something like I want to be off this slaving meat wheel dead in heaven. And that's that's sort of the the that's a kind of modern way of talking about the notion of completely transcending samsara. I mean, what the Bodhisattva is no longer fooled by samsara. The Bodhisattva does not it's not attached to things in the way that ordinary people are. And yet the Bodhisattva chooses to work within samsara to, you know, there's the famous example of the Bodhisattva Vimalakirti, the Vimalakirti Sutra, which Bob Thurman actually has translated wonderfully, which is probably the funniest Buddha Sutra ever written, among other things. And I I recommend it to everybody. But Vimalakirti is a lay person in the town of Vaishali in North India, who goes into the gambling halls, the political clubs, even even the whorehouses to to to sort of work with people at their own level. And that's what a Bodhisattva does. Now, it sounds great and it sounds altruistic. It's not that easy being a Bodhisattva, because you you can say to yourself, OK, I'm going to go to the whorehouse and I'm going to be a Bodhisattva in the whorehouse. And next thing you know, you're not really being the Bodhisattva in the whorehouse. So it's it's it's not as easy as it sounds or or quite as ideal, as many people think it is. There's a lot of a lot of tracks built into it. Roger, we call it a sex worker house now. Secondly, now I'm changing. It's OK. It's that's what Vimalakirti called it. All right. And by the way, you know, the assumption that the Bodhisattva is the one going into the whorehouse and not the one working at the whorehouse, that could happen, too. Couldn't these Bodhisattvas can show up everywhere? Anywhere camouflaged into any karma, not just in this realm, but in the hell realms, too. Yep, yep, yep. And even Bodhisattvas, the Vimalakirti sutra tells us, can even appear as Mara, the evil one, the one who tries to tempt us away from the proper path. Yes, that's that's that's cool. I love that, which, of course, makes the question of judging others very tricky. Right. Yeah, that's right. Right. Because you don't know you might be hanging out with Vimalakirti. You might whatever that thing is that's really infuriating you. That might be a being so dedicated to waking you up that they have assumed this form that is not the funnest form, whatever it is, your antagonist, something that's just there to be the the fly in your karmic soup. Oh, absolutely. And, you know, there's a famous, again, one of the great Indian Buddhist texts, The Way of the Bodhisattva by Shanti Deva has a whole chapter on the perfection of patience, much of which is given over to celebration of his appreciation for his enemies, because they're the ones who cause him to perfect patience. So yeah, there's a there's a story from Tibet about the great reformer Atisha, who was there in the 11th century and helped to kind of bring Buddhism back after some dark centuries. And he used to keep a he had a cook that traveled with him, who was so foul tempered. And, you know, from Atisha's point of view, this was the perfect person to be consorting with because it helped him to stay even keeled. Yeah, you know, I have you heard I heard Pima Chodron talk about that in her book about the God, what the mind training. Do you know this Gurdjieff story about this? I'm not sure I do. You know what Gurdjieff is? Oh, sure. Oh, sure. Yeah, I know who Gurdjieff was. Supposedly. So Gurdjieff would have he was a mystic for those of you who haven't heard of him. And he would have his students do things that didn't make any sense to try to break them out of their habitual way of looking at the world. So I think he was having his students like cut pieces of grass out and move them to another place and just put them back just to completely insane, meaningless activity. And one of the students at some point was like, I'm out of here. I'm not doing this. This is stupid. And everyone's happy because this was the most annoying of his students. They're cheering as he drives off in his car. One of the students goes in and tells Gurdjieff, oh, he left. We got him out of here. And his face goes pale. He jumps in his car, drives after this person, comes back a few days later with the person in tow. So apparently one of his attendants is saying to him, why did you bring him back? We hate him. He's horrible. And Gurdjieff said, I have to tell you something. I pay him to be here. I love it. Oh, that's priceless, priceless. Yeah, yeah. OK, so let me ask you, this is the last question for you. If you can choose your next birth. I'm saying you can't transcend yet. We need you here to write more books. But if you could choose, if you could choose your next birth. Where would it be? What would it be? Who would you be? Oh, well, God, you know, I don't think it would be a bird in spite of what what may have been a previous life, according to my friend. I would I would choose to be born human to be born in a situation where I could, you know, both practice the Dharma and be of maximum benefit to as many beings as I possibly could. I'm not sure that's a continuation of what I'm doing now. I don't think it is. I'm doing that at a very tiny, tiny level right now.

Dot com Happy holidays, sweet babies today. I have with us an actual practicing Wizard a lot of you are familiar with vermin supreme. Maybe you've seen him during protests or maybe you've heard his many promises the possibility that he is Going to give ponies to everyone on the planet, or maybe you've recognized that he's more than just a Chaos agent at protests, but he's actually a peacemaker that somehow the presence of this wizard Lee being with a boot on his head has the tendency to diffuse situations to create a comedic element in Zones where there is the great possibility for Violence and if you're somebody who is into discordianism or anarchism then you surely have recognized that vermin supreme is a brilliant and powerful Magician at least that was my thinking before I got to talk to him and I was thrilled to find out that my assessment was accurate vermin supreme he is Awesome, and if you've wondered about what anarchy actually is Many people think anarchy is throwing a rock through a Starbucks But if you've wondered what anarchy really is then you're really gonna love this episode and to me vermin supreme represents the Christmas spirit because in the same way that it is Hilarious and beautiful and wonderful to suddenly witness the wild boot crowned vermin supreme at a Serious protest What's more beautiful than the appearance of the son of God in a place where there's a lot of donkey shit The message here is that it doesn't matter if you militarize the police or it doesn't matter if you Try to scare us with your Omni-present panopticon of surveillance cameras and bullshit laws There's always gonna be a kind of benevolent chaos that appears in that space between the security force and the people and that person is vermin supreme a mystical time Traveling miscreant, and if you're someone who made the Incorrect observation that it's just a crazy person with a boot on his head Get ready because your opinion is about to change Vermin supreme is here with us.

Thank you amazon music Well what I hoped would never happen happened Uh, i'm really sorry to say that um one of the dtf h listeners whose family has asked that I not uh named them was devoured by uh some combination of a squirrel swarm and uh Pleth of raccoons as it's called which is uh the accumulation of an angry group of raccoons. It's called a pleth I guess he's listening to the podcast and he was he was walking On a he was on a hike or something and you know not we only know what his Girlfriend has said and she's in a psychiatric hospital because what she saw drove her insane She just kept saying the raccoons the raccoons they they they went for his eyes his eyes There's nothing left. There's bones just bones Cell phone some ragged clothes Look i'm not saying that the reason these animal attacks are happening to people who listen to the dtfh But aren't subscribed to the patreon Or because of something i'm doing i don't have the ability to do that and i certainly don't know magicians or wizards who i could pay to do dark Spells that would cause people not subscribed to my patreon to get attacked by small Generally considered cute animals rabbits Gophers groundhogs a lot of groundhog bites are happening.

It's so weird I'm working on it. Once I once we figure out the cause I'll let you know but in the meantime is the kind of band aid of protection head over to patreon.com Ford slash dtfh and subscribe you're gonna get a discord link So that you could hang out with your one true family And you're gonna get access to Hours and hours of extra content.

Uh, thanks for having me and I understand that you are a Podcaster of some sort or some note rather. I I assume would be more accurate I well, I've got a and you're I have a podcast And you also are cartoon. Am I to understand that correctly? They turned me into a cartoon last year So, how does that feel? It's liberating it's liberating to to you know, you would think it you might become more entrenched in reality by having multiple bodies, but uh, it's nice to have a lighter more colorful version of me Oh, for sure. I mean, uh, it's like one of the the beautiful things about me and what I've developed is that Um, there is a huge there, you know, there's a fictional side a mile wide and uh And I have become So much bigger than my meat sack if you will. I mean, I'm just like here. I am some guy and we're just talking But on the internet it's it's I'm a meme and that's a very strange thing to be uh, it it it's almost about giving up uh, a fair amount of control over The messaging because anybody Can use me in pretty much any way shape or form That they like, uh, whether I agree with it or or disagree with it. How do you deal with how do you deal with that? Do you do you find yourself? Uh, surrendering to that reality or have you, uh Attempted to control the narrative Well, uh, obviously I have my own dank meme stash. I've got my own social media team I've got a number of regular memesters that have been memeing me making memes with and about me like forever Yeah, and so usually they're pretty clever and they're generally positive And I think that's you know, one of the blessings. Um, that you know, when I became a meme It was for doing something fun and entertaining and informative and educational and satirical Where it's like some people become memes for doing terrible things and it's like hey look it's that meme who kicked the dog Hey get up That's right. You can get memed into hell. It's like you can yeah You get splattered all over and all these various memes for better for worse and yeah, you're yes, you're you have a glorious beautiful fountain of Wonderful hilarious memes and Yeah, I mean as a rule it's beautiful. It's and that's the the wonderful thing about What I have become is that it becomes an audience participation project where like And in the in the fact that I offer the opportunity to pretend Because you know growing up don't pretend a lot, you know, they they they sort of lose that Maybe not ability but the desire or the need to to fully pretend Silly stuff sometimes and I believe that I am a conduit For that opportunity You know when when I'm talking about ponies and asking people what are you going to name your pony? The people want to Pretend right along and they want to talk about zombie preparedness and the the time travel and and all these sort of sci-fi tropes that that I've tapped into It's just so wonderful because it's it's an open-ended improvisational project and and it's just not Something that occurs on the internet because you know, I'm a real person And I've been doing it in in the real meat world for a lot longer than the digital world But it's it's always been this very playful improvisational playing off People who come up to want to know what's going on or with the other politicians or or with the police or the authority figures or all these people and And yes, it is because I have discovered this magical boot. Are you a wizard? Which? I would have to say yes In fact, I'm a registered Time lord and wizard with the universal life church because those are actual titles that are available and I snatched them up And I believe that there is certainly a lot to be said in terms of a wizard like altering reality changing reality changing people's perceptions Of reality, you know, I have a real affinity for the discordians and the surrealists and the da da is sure And and the people that that believe that, you know, you can offer, you know deeper truths and revelations to people by using shocking juxtapositions and in in my own way in my own sense, I you know, I use a lot of humor and absurdity and And, you know, the beautiful thing, you know, people ask me, you know vermin, what's what's with the boot on your head? And I will my stock response to the media is generally it stands for all it is good in america The ability to wear a boot on your head if you want to Or sometimes I'll tell them the boot is a pile of shit and that they are the flies that buzz around Yeah, yeah, yeah, I thought I thought you when I saw you for the first time I thought that My first thought was a wizard has gotten in to this meeting and But then I because I didn't see it as a boot I saw it as a wizard's cap and then it was later that I realized that's a boot now I'm not saying there's a difference between the two a hat's a hat. I mean, you know You could say a shoe is a hat on your foot And yeah, and it's a It's a signifier, you know, it signifies to people to onlookers that what they might be subject to may not be linear in nature So so it's a little bit of a warning Obviously if it's in a crowd, it's it's this magnetic attraction because it's the the tallest thing in the room and and yeah People are drawn to it and authority figures are drawn to it Because it's not right. I mean the the beautiful thing for me about it is if you take a photograph of me wearing the boot In any place any time any situation any crowd of people and you show that Photograph to a kid and you say to that kid. Hey kid. What's wrong with this picture? And it's just so it's it's obvious. It's it's unmistakable. It's undeniable. Yeah, it's what is it's wrong The man has a boot on his head. It's not correct. Yeah, not right It's a and so just that and the and um This crazy combination of the platform planks of you know, the ponies and the uh, the tooth brushing and it just It has such resonance with so many people Um, that it's allowed me to communicate with millions and interface with media across the flat earth and uh, Yeah, it's allowed me. I think it's hollow I guess it could be flat and hollow Uh, I don't want to I thought you're talking about my boot for a moment. And of course, the that's another uh Uh, controversy. I Sort of little alien being up there within the boot somehow Controlling my thoughts emotion and movement or is the boot itself the actual alien that somehow attaches itself to my head To control me. Um, and I it's it's very hard to say If you had to name the kind of magic you practice And I'm sorry to even ask you to name it If you haven't named it or to try to limit you or control it in some way by even asking you to name it But if you add to at least in this moment, what would you call it? I I suppose the the the chaos magic, uh, even though I don't really fully understand It in it's totally or even partially but it seems like it's in that vein that that discordian vein We're we're trying to create the chaos and and and and I think Being able to alter You know that reality and I've discovered I've been able to use that In different situations in very high stakes situations sometimes, uh, particularly Uh, really tense, uh demonstrations in the past You're not safe. You don't seem safe. You put yourself in danger Watched you and I thought to myself as many of us have that, uh, you know Before maybe some people before they think of wizard. They think activist But I don't know if there's a difference between those two things, but yes, definitely you seem to you seem to put yourself in danger And and a big part of that is just understanding the situation Having a real solid situation awareness because I've been in those environments so many times And having an understanding of how they work and how they operate And how one thing can lead to the other and the tit for the tat and the escalation And you know, you know between the cops and the protesters Uh, there's this no person's land it and it's a vacuum and it will something will fill it eventually It could be an agitator. It could be a cop taking a cheap shot It could be a demonstrator getting this Emotionally wrought up and and and escalating things But I have discovered that by entering that space and using my bullhorn and my calm demeanor and humor and jokes That I can sort of short circuit it. I can I can rearrange the the flow of events I've watched it happen I'm sorry to cut you off. I've watched it happen. It's the strangest thing to see the police officers unmoved by legitimately Upset passionate people But you're there and somehow you you cross you you get in there you cross it. They they they can't they smile The state smiles, but then also the protesters smile. It's some kind of I know I've seen it. It's it's real magic It's I mean if if any of y'all listening want to see what magic looks like it's I don't know of another way to put it Psyops But to me and maybe I maybe it's too much to in it's it's Old age and lots of acid But when I see a politician I also think to myself. Well, that's some form of magic there, too And when I see you show up Then I start thinking well, there's some kind of wizard battle Happening here. You've decided to show up To distort transform Alchemize the mundane reality that they seem intent on keeping us all fixated in That yes that too and I believe that my You know my critique such as it is I mean I've been flogging the damn mandatory tooth brushing laws As a warning of a utilitarian Fascist police state, you know for 30 years and yes, it's sort of freaky to yell these things come to pass And but but I just it has allowed me to be considerably more aggressive In a lot of ways If I came at some of these politicians like I like to do Going up to Ted Cruz's and Chris Christie's or cleanser or whatever And you know if I wasn't using my humor It and had the same energy it would be very scary Yes, and and I don't people would be frightened by it. Yes, but because I come on with the absurdity In the in the nonsense if you will It that alone changes the reality and it forces them into a a different way of interacting And and I've discovered that by using these Wacky, you know questions. I get a much more interest in response, you know when I asked John McCain, you're where he stood on mandatory tooth brushing And he said oh my staff has had lots of experience hiding in people's bathrooms late at night to make sure they've brushed It's like, okay Or or I asked Lamar Alexander a question one time and he responded with And he answered why yes vermin? I do have Elvis Presley imprisoned underneath the governor's mansion of Tennessee for committing heinous acts Wow, you know, I you know, once again, I prompted the question, but they responded and they added their own little twist Uh to make it a little You know enlightening, you know, they're they're showing more Of a subtext that they might With if they were giving a straight answer to a straight question Like they're kind of like in a weird way illuminating whatever the the metaphor of their existence is, you know, like Yeah, does he have Elvis trapped but in a weird way We we all find ourselves sort of whether you like it or not under the spell Of these people who have collaborated. They are it's a it's a it's a coven of people in suits who are Very convincing And and very easy to believe it if you're lazy, you know, it's easy like for some reason they're so sincere And I get drawn into it all the time um all the time I've tried to Eliminate, you know, I mean the fact is the emperor has no clothes But he could kill you with absolute impunity and get away with it Yes, and that's the thing that I mean, I look at you know, people look and they It's it's a frightening reality, but it's absolutely ludicrous Right just that Contrast is is ridiculous Do you have you ever looked? Sorry Oh, no, it's okay. I I guess the fact that I I'm an anarchist I believe I've always been an anarchist ever since I made that conscious decision to be so And I don't believe In the government's authority and and I believe that I have found a way To operate That makes it very clear and in many circumstances does indeed I deny authority to authority figures um Can you define for us anarchism would you mind defining your Anarchy for us Well for me, uh anarchism Is a belief That the government's claim of power over us Is illegitimate and um And that authority By its nature Is coercive? Yeah, and they are using their self-imposed Pretend authority, but they're usually they pack it up Uh with this threat of violence. Yeah And I I believe in mutual aid as opposed To the government organization structure I've always believed that the only way to be able to extricate ourselves from the government is through Mutual aid and voluntary cooperation To replace the the functions of the government if you will I mean when the government tries to Say, you know alleviate Poverty or something like that. You know it requires Taking all sorts of money and then running it through a bureaucracy in a very inefficient way That has all sorts of conditions on it that ultimately has incredible amazing unintended Consequences and I it seems that it's just true of a lot of the things That the government attempts to do I want to thank hello fresh for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH. I love to cook. It's really fun. I think it's a bizarre Alchemical Experiment that can lead to you seeming like some kind of household saint. You make a good meal for people They'll never forget it, but the for me. I always end up getting the wrong ingredients Not enough ingredients or if I have all the right ingredients I don't measure them outright and What ends up happening is I spent a long time cooking and the people I cook for it feels like they're kind of Pretending that they're enjoying to eat what I've given them and that's because it sucks because I fucked up the recipe hello fresh Let's you experience what it's like to be one of those chefs on a cooking show because they send you everything Already measured out You don't have to go to the grocery store and pick stuff up.

That's hello fresh dot com forward slash dunkin 80 use code dunkin 80 to get 80 dollars off including free shipping. Thank you. Hello fresh Do you see that bureaucratic? Do you do you see that matrix or whatever the thing that that Philanthropy or love with if like we're gonna say like mutual aid We're gonna have to use symbols for it in the world. We're in right now We've got money Sometimes it's just giving someone money or food or giving someone some something that they can use to survive But when you run it through that system, you're talking about it somehow becomes corrupt and I Sometimes when I'm really feeling it's out there. Is it a demonic force? Do you play around with the idea that that bureaucratic system is a kind of congealed demonic force? Um, I I don't think so. I I hate to say Talk about demons as if though they are are real Um, I and I I don't even know if an institution itself is necessarily Evil, but it's it's certainly not productive Or as productive as it would like to be Um, but yes, it is sort of I often talk about spiritual money laundering Um In some of the in a sense and I think that when the government takes the money and launders it They're laundering it in a dirty way, but if you take money and you spend it directly on good acts Um, then that's a good laundering. Uh, the rainbow gatherings Uh, for example, uh, are you familiar with the rainbow gatherings? Yeah, a little bit only from stories from people who've been I've I have yet to attend one I think you'd like it. Um, and of course, we're talking about the uh, the rainbow family of living love and light Annual gathering of the tribes. It's uh, it's a very Large, uh, you know, I would loosely use the word hippie quotation mark Uh event to describe it. Although it it all all walks of life attend It happens once a year. Usually you're around the fourth the first week of july And uh, you could get up to 10 000 people in the woods in a national forest out in the middle of nowhere Um picture if you will uh three four thousand people sitting in concentric circles In a large field uh in the middle of nowhere in a meadow all of a sudden out of the tree line comes Dozens of people bringing five gallon buckets full of food these people in the circles Have their cups and their bowls because that's the tradition and and the people start going around and doling out food Which comes from the up over a hundred different little kitchens up in the woods that are across between gilligan's islands in the in the flintstones as far as technology and during this time the food goes around town criers go around the circle letting people know uh safety information or or parking information or things they need to know and and uh other town criers are going around talking about the Where the drum circle is at night or where the talent show is at night or um where um, you know The hatman spots are and also the going around that circle is the magic hat and the magic hat goes around Because it's a magic hat and because the rainbow gathering is a non-commercial event because you can't buy anything You can't sell anything you you can barter, but ultimately um the only legitimate place to put money is in the magic hat It's a non-commercial event. So people put it in and then it gets spiritually laundered Um, it goes to the banking council banking council says hey, we made X amount of dollars the next morning All the kitchen representatives come together and they have a spokes council and everybody puts out their shopping list And they give it to supply and the supply council Interface with the banking council and and they go to town and bring it all back and it goes over and over every night and there's miles and miles of of uh water pipes and like There's there's a million things that need to get done vegetables need to be chopped fires need to be built stoves need to be built Biscuits need to be need to be made shitters need to be dug health and safety all these things And the only reason that any of those things happen is because people see a need for them to happen And they come together in a council uh non hierarchical Form and make that happen Once again not opposed to leaders anarchies not opposed to leaders if somebody has a specific skill set that uh That other people need and want to learn from that person could become a de facto leader But once everybody has that information There is no need for that leader any longer um And so the the rainbow gathering i've been attending them uh for close to 30 plus years me and my wife And um, it is where I learned Clowning when I was a young person when I was a young rainbow And I I would go from end to end a camp to every camp and and do something funny and and push the limits of what I could do because it It's they're so loose there And I polished mc skills doing talent shows and and gong shows and all of those things And then after several years, I discovered the need for security and we provide security. It's called shantay sina It's a uh cultural appropriation of the sanskrit word meaning peacekeepers But I became I started to bring my uh Clowning into that and essentially that is uh, it's a it's a glorified camp country counselor really, but it also has Um crisis intervention because anything could happen at rainbow, you know, and we don't rely on the police I mean if it's a neighborhood situation, if it's in a camp ideally the camp takes care of it If it affects the a bigger crisis if it's somebody peddling bad drugs Oh, we have to track that down and put a stop to it Um, you know, if there's an assault or something and so we have our own restorative justice Councils that will offer to people who are wrong and of and uh one of the the things that we also provide is escorts for the media and police not sexual escorts, uh, but escorts with the With the cops to make sure That you know, they don't get in trouble to make sure that the the participants in the gathering, uh, don't get any trouble So I early on I was finding myself walking for like eight hour shifts with 10 alabama state troopers for example or a whole bunch of feds or a whole bunch of counting cops And they come in and they're propagandized that they are told that these are the worst people in the world There are a bunch of drug addicts and they're they're gonna in all this bullshit And so I would walk with them and propagandize them and contextualize What they were seeing and uh and have fun with them and make fun of them And uh and warn the participants that we yell out six up means the cops are on their way Hide your drugs and lease your dogs and put some clothes on or whatever Wow, but the cops tolerated that. I'm sorry that when you do this Uh patrol with them. How do you how do you? Infiltrate like how do they let you it feels like some police would be like what are you you can't walk even walk with us Well, essentially, it's you know, it's a public event. It is in public, uh, forest the police are public servants And uh, once again, it's understanding that we have rights to to do that right to communicate with them Right. Uh, sometimes it's more real more tense. I mean, there's been events where the rainbow gathering was the largest single civil disobedience on the north american continent that year Because uh, the feds have been trying to put permit schemes in forever to tell us that we need permits and that we have always maintained that um No, no one can sign on our behalf. You can't represent me. I'm not giving you permission to do that And so anybody who signed the permit was it was fraudulent from the get-go And we we've we've proved that in court see you're the but to me you seem to be The embodiment of a potential future For humanity and I I don't mean to sound all thick and schmaltzy with that either. I mean You know, my my encounter Is a little over the top there, but but my encounter with this sort of thing at burning at the burn Uh, which there seems to be some parallel there, uh, not completely the same but a parallel There is It feels to me that it whenever I go there. I think this is a way humans can be Like this is a another possibility that is so Different than the possibility most of us are born into That it you find the bird totally decadent. No, I was what's that? I mean, is it it is not the bird pretty decadent Well, it seems like an event of decadence I well, it's It's so big That what's so wonderful about it is in its size There's the possibility for maximum heat hedonism decadence maximum Whatever you want. I did it in but what's beautiful about it is it has within it Uh, its own Anarchic spirit and a similar thing. They don't they though. They don't really there are permits to be able to use that land unfortunately and But they they you know Every trouble that springs up and just like I'm sure the rainbow gatherings You know, you can expect trouble to spring up It's just the nature of things but those troubles that the burn they really do try to they have people Who are who are actual peacekeepers who come to a camp and really try to calm people down Try to do every single thing to keep someone from getting arrested because there's cops there You know, so but but what I'm saying is in in that state In of seeing that possibility what you're talking about sounds like a more magnified version of it I always think because uh, and there's no gate, you know, I mean we have a front gate and all but because It's pretty much open to anyone and it's so it attracts so many different types of people Yeah, it's it's really a wonderful I hope to make it to the burn Oh, you got it. You would you would love it and you would be familiar with it to some degree and you would probably have a lot to offer it Uh, but For for you to give to make me their dancing monkey Those corporate camps man, and then you know, but then that's the always the drama there is you get these like Uh, these camps that you know one of the camps I can't remember the name of it now white ocean or something it got terrorized They they dumped out their portajons dumped out their water There was it because there's these so many factions of burners there that you get these little cold or hot wars that can spring up It's fascinating. But what I was trying to say is To me when i'm seeing you i'm thinking that is a person who is brilliant and who is In this whenever I think of not when we think of non-violence You know there's visions that come to mind and certainly for most of us those visions probably don't involve somebody wearing a boot hat but You know, but when I see you I see that I see Not it's non-violence. It's this beautiful form of non-violent um Activism that has now I know it's nice to hear that it has its roots in a real legitimate lineage an anarchic lineage of the river gathering my friend Attorney jerry boyle out of chicago works with the nlg is uh mentioned it. It's disarming. You know, I am disarming the police And uh, you know, he gives a workshop actually on disarming the police which All the militants are like But it's it's really about disarming them in another way and yeah and it that is in in in that Disarming that you're doing it. I think it shines a light on Whether you like it or not these the humanity of all of us when I'm seeing you interact with the trumpets Or the clintonites or whoever it is And I see that they can't help but smile They're offended by you and threatened by you But they're smiling at the same time and somewhere in that to me That's where you the rubber hits the road for all of us witnessing it because in those little flickers of of human interaction we're no longer separate and uh I'm really It's having heard that you have your roots in the rainbow gathering It makes me interested in what your other like wisdom streams are what type of Pardon, I'm sorry. I'm curious you there. What are your other wisdom streams? What are your other? Sources of inspiration Like I hear the entire community of people has infused you I think with some of their magic. Are there other infusions come? Yes, yes, I'd say along the way for sure. Um, I cut my teeth on anti-nuclear activism When I was a younger person I lived in Baltimore, Maryland and uh was involved in the uh indie music and uh art weirdo scene That's definitely a place where I learned to to be weird And I guess even when I was younger than that, I guess psychedelic drugs sort of also Allowed me to become the the person that I have become um giving me this understanding of you know reality and being able to step outside or or next to or through reality and and under and being able to to manipulate it slightly by having this understanding of my relationship with the real world at any given moment in time and um So that um, you know, and of course I became vermin supreme when I was doing uh bookings and promotions down in nightclubs in baltimore early on it was more All booking agents all club owners all promoters were vermin and I was the vermin supreme I didn't really have it in me. I'm afraid and didn't last very long But it was super super fun and it was a great time back in the day And that it was just a short leap to um all politicians are vermin and becoming the vermin supreme and yeah, you know, I I actually ran for mayor of baltimore maryland in a fairly unreal way in 1987 And it wasn't particularly political There was just something that seemed Interesting to do it was a project And I did a month-long drug study as a lab rat for one of these uh drug testing companies up in massachusetts here And then went to baltimore and uh and ran this uh campaign just just for the sheer laws I want to thank square space for sponsoring this episode of the d t f h it is an incredible Sweet of very powerful tools that you can use to turn your cool idea in a new website to blog or publish content to announce an upcoming event or to just use the incredible power of the internet To create some wild chaos based art experiment via your website.

Thank you square space And uh I was in baltimore and ready to move on from baltimore. There there's a lot of Things that were happening that I will not bore you with But one day This was a couple weeks after I had read an article into the mother jones magazine and it was an article describing March that was called the global peace march for global nuclear disarmament That was marching from la to dc to protest nuclear weapons And david mixer this democratic political operative. It was his idea and and he was really Over the top about it and was you know having custom tents made up and custom milk crates made up and And just his vision was this big white bread March across the country with everybody being very cushy and cozy and uh, it collapsed under its own weight It made it as far as barstow california before it totally fell apart And I felt like that's really sad that's disappointing because it sounded like such a nice thing that it inspired me and then Two weeks after I read that article one of my roommates, uh came home and said hey meet so is the skies with a great peace march and i'm like what? And The march continued it only partially collapsed in barstow But a whole group of anarchists, uh, were like pulling uh, were disabling the vehicles so that the repo men could not Take them away They were committing a civil disobedience lying down in front of and locking themselves too in order to keep the Equipment from being taken away And so this march all of the article made it sound like it did it did not go any further It actually did and by the time it arrived in baltimore. It was five thousand straw And they had every just they had the equipment that was needed to make that safe move down the road There was water trucks. There was kitchen trailer trucks. There was kitchen prep trucks. There was Um, port-a-party trucks. There was port-a-party pumper trucks. There was school buses that were acting as Classrooms for all the kids that were on their march. They had Semi trailer trucks hauling the two milk crates that each marcher was given that they could for their possessions And all the tents and every night they would set up camp and they would have this Consensus council a non-hierarchical Circle of decision-making Um, essentially an anarchistic organism In a way much like the rainbow gathering is it's nobody's not top down. It's it's horizontal Um, and so when I when I saw this when I saw this in memorial stadium I was like, this is it. This is totally it I'm on board. I went to the thrift store. I bought a shitty sleeping bag and a couple changes to clean clothes And I walked with them to dc several days And met some of these people some of these anarchists these activists They they threw their tennis shoes that they'd crossed the country With over the white house fence. They were committing Uh civil disobedience. They were concerts. They were as parties It was amazing and I heard that they were Going to continue and this small group of some of the logistical support people Wanted to continue this sort of mobile protest and they formed a group called the seeds of peace and I Quickly joined them and started marching with them. We did a 300 mile march in Florida from kingsville, georgia where they had the trident d5 missiles in the sub base there down to cape canaveral where they were testing them at the time and so And they infiltrated they they did backcountry actions at cape canaveral to prevent the and uh make the Whole thing be put on hold for a little bit. And so this was uh What I was finding to be very inspiring and then went to a march in michigan where I met this uh peace marcher Hippy woman that I thought was going to be a hookup, but we've been together for 30 years And there's another march in in massachusetts and then so and that it was at that time that I started to attend the rainbow gatherings and so And that we at the nevada nuclear test site where we would have thousands literally thousands of people camping out in the in the desert Outside of vegas infiltrating doing backcountry actions doing massive civil disobedience. I mean literally One weekend Like probably two to three thousand arrests of people walking into the desert to try and stop the nuclear testing Is that a backcountry? Is that is that what a backcountry action is is just trespassing or are there Like a simple symbolic uh trespass where you might cross we would cross the cattle guard there or you might You know cross Into cross a border or cross enter property, you know that that's sort of a simple trespassing But a backcountry action is when you sort of go on a a serious hike and try and not you know You're not giving yourself up easily. You're trying not to be detected Whereas a basic simple symbolic trespass might involve, you know blocking a street or Or something else. It's you know, just very obvious, but a backcountry action Is like, you know, it's secret. It's backcountry. It's uh, they're trying not to be detected Until they unfurl your banner or lock themselves to something or what have you how many times you've been arrested? Uh, amazingly few for the situations I put myself in You know a handful and I and I I and when I've been arrested at demonstrations It's usually been a false arrest ultimately and I've been able to sue them for a little bit of money What I've been arrested Yep. Yep. Yep. I bought like we bought a fifth of an acre Little sliced out into hawaii with a $6,000 settlement from the la pd because they they wanted to arrest me because I was singing Mr. Rogers neighborhood and Sesame Street, these are the people in your neighborhood But really trying to talk to the arrestees about the lawyer the way to communicate with them and and you know You don't want to and when you start talking about the commanding officer and you start talking, you know, you start trying to Get the line cops to question their commanding officer's decisions to put them in certain situations You can be pretty much pretty sure you're going to be shut down pretty quick. That's been my experience Wow, you're I got to ask you this and I and and um listening to your story It fills me with a kind of surreal hope and but I I'm trying to think of the right way to phrase the question In in this thing that you're talking about this sort of I don't know what it is It flowers up this thing they're that is called anarchism Which a lot of people think of when they think of it they think of what the state has told them It is it's things Breaking and smashing and falling apart. I think probably a lot of people are surprised when they hear that the the Practice of it involves mutual aid and selflessness and giving No, it's anarchy is a very high level of order I mean, it's it's the natural order that occurs in the absence of the state Right after a a natural disaster Before the state can get there the people immediately come together the people immediately start helping one another Helping survivors clearing the rose right that is So what how this how big is is it because I think there's something beautifully invisible About this anarchy and decentralization in general, you know centralization anytime you have some leader Uh, that is you know, that isn't just some temporary leader like teaching people how to cook or whatever but a leader it's easy to like sort of Trace the structure with anarchism. It's different in the sense that It's a real thing. I mean these flowers or whatever you're going to call these communities blossom Happens today. It's a beautiful thing How big how big is it? How big is it? How big is this? How big if you had to guess and I'm sorry if it's a dumb question Like you represent there's for for every vermin supreme A celebrity I forgive me if that's an insulting term. I mean it in the best way possible Someone to be celebrated now that I'm like Cameo It's official. No, don't do it. But the but what I Don't do it. I told cameo. I told him I do it for for 50 million dollars I don't know about I don't know. I don't I don't want to waste my time with a great high magician by talking about cameo I when I'm asked I do have a an institute that I'm trying to finance the vermin. We have a vermin institute now Here's the question though. Here's my question for every one of you There's a lot of people and you were kind of mentioning them the other activists the people who show up to these things while all of us are tweeting and from that you must have gotten some approximation of a kind of Decentralized movement happening in the world and I'm wondering if you could give Either pop that balloon of hope that I have where I love to fantasize about some decentralized beautiful market revolution that's happening right now and think that it's massive But is it is is is it what I think it is is it possible that there's A lot of you out there do it different levels of society Working your magic in different ways Well, I think there is I I think there's so many people are involved in so many projects. I mean they're Um that we don't even have a grasp on it. We I mean, I guess it depends how you wanted to define it, but I I really like to think so. I mean, I don't think it's a huge percentage of the population and I really have absolutely zero way of fully Uh guessing Um, quite frankly, so I don't want to lead you on. Um, but yes, uh, the anarchist revolution is right on schedule And we are winning. Who are winning? Ponies will be here soon. They're turning the corner. Um It's a happening thing for sure. Where do you I have to ask you? I'm sorry if I'm bullet if I'm shotgunning you or machine gunning you or violently aggressively asking you questions I just feel like I have a limited Where do you get your When I've seen Any video of you you seem you and even now briefly on our failed zoom you just seem filled with with love and, uh I'm just wondering like What what are you where what are you getting your instructions from like who where is your inspiration coming from? What's compelling you to do this? To put yourself in danger to do this It because to me it doesn't just seem like some kind of like It does seem like performance are in a beautiful way But it doesn't seem limited to that. Do you feel, uh For lack of a better word Called by something or compelled by something and if so, what is that thing? Well, I I I do feel compelled I guess to State my views maybe to exercise my my first amendment writes a free speech and assembly And I I believe that I I've simply developed a communication strategy Uh that has allowed me to do so Successfully that that has allowed me to amplify, uh that free speech, uh in a way that I I Couldn't ever imagine and and you know when I first became A meme when I first went viral back in 2012 when I was at that panel at the lesser known candidate debates and And dumped the glitter on on randall terry, uh, who's sort of a terrible person. Amazing nice You know I because it was not because it was perceived to be a critique an overall critique of the system At what and it wasn't partisan. It wasn't attacking one party. It wasn't attacking One particular politician and therefore it was sort of embraced across the political spectrum and so now I have people who enjoy what I do appreciate it or support it and I I feel my relationship to um My fan supporters, however, they're my constituents And I believe that in a way, you know, I'm Representing them. I'm not representing them in any official capacity, but I believe because They enjoy it. They get a kick out of it a thrill out of it And they may not be able to do it. They may not be in a position To do so they might not feel comfortable or have chops or whatever and I have this total random DNA toss that that may and set of experiences that They've all been building blocks. I mean I look back and it seems like it's a skill set But it's all been each and every skill sort of built up on the one past uh to become this force uh that Can be very effective. Yes Well, look, I don't need to do an ambush now, but I have to ambush you vermin supreme and Forgive me for this, but we all many of us Want to know Where are you getting all the ponies? Ah, well, yes, of course, there'll be a whole class of ponies that are cloned clone. They'll be known as clonies, of course um, we're gonna have a massive uh forced in vidro In verbalization test tube pony program where we will be implanting ponies into All sorts of mammals all sorts of animals. It might not even think about we don't know about If the humans are going to be suitable for for carrying ponies, but I know many many women would Happily carry Women do you know no woman wants to have a pony inside where it's dangerous what you're suggesting is dangerous I'm speaking uh allegorically metaphorically. Um, I'm literally perhaps If this if the state were to force them to do so, I know uh, they would do happily Where do we keep them your plan? I don't who okay. I must say this in all fairness every everybody We're gonna get where the free pony's coming from where you're gonna get the free pony What are the free ponies gonna cost you're gonna cost nothing They're free ponies. Where do free ponies come from? Let me tell you Duncan. Thank you when a boy when a boy pony Meets a girl pony. Yeah And they like one another. Yeah, they They you know, they might want to get to know each other a little bit better So they a little you know, try to long gallop off to the to to the uh Paddock a corner or something and uh, and you know, especially if the the female pony is in heat or estrus as it is called And so the the boy pony gets really excited and gives the girl pony a special pony hug mounting the the girl pony And then the excited love boy pony This big giant pony cock comes out of its sheath and inserts into the uh, girl ponies, uh, pony vagina And they start going oh making love would be a much better. Yes. Keep going. Please keep going And yes, and so uh, the the the uh, pony penis during the love making session ejaculate. Yeah, probably gals of pony sperm right on up into the Um, girl ponies a reproductive organ swims up the float into meets the the the sperm meets the egg and they start dividing and uh, oh, you know, 11 months later Boom free pony comes out. Well, that's where to me. This is I don't mean again not trying to poke holes in it I'm sorry to cut you off here, but listen What number one you're talking about the possibility of this kind of spontaneous Pony romance among so many pony couples enough to give a pony to everybody number two Pony boner. Did I say did I mention the freak pony boner? Yeah, you're talking about hard Throbbing pony cocks, but I'm saying yes, we can remember we can say remember if that was more appropriate Member cocks glistening dripping Powerful pony cocks, but what I'm saying to you is where do we put all the where do the ponies go? Your plan is untenable. There's too many people in this country. There's not enough room for all those extra ponies That's that. Oh, yeah. Yeah, you are like one of those naysayers I see The big to understand about a pony-paced economy is that it will be part of a massive rebuilding It's sort of the original green new deal when you get right down to it because it's going to be a huge huge restructuring I mean, okay, you're driving down the road. You're okay. I have to do is imagine that it's all ponies I mean, it's really simple takes a little longer But I mean, essentially they're they're clean they're green that in conjunction with the zombie power plants, of course We want that's part of the package But ultimately People are the trades are going to go wild What is going to do for the economy as we rebuild the entire infrastructure of the united states where every homeowner In every apartment dweller, you know, we have needs to have a place for that pony And so that is really part of it's a massive jobs creation program I feel like you have identified a need when which is a real human legitimate human need. We all do Want a pony you'd have to be A maniac or or some broken thing to not Want a beautiful pony playing in your yard enjoying itself under the summer sun Thank you to love Yeah, braid their hair comb for your computer Shampoo But I think there's a seduction in what you're saying and I think it's you know, what would you do your pony? Oh God probably uh lady die Or what are you going to name your pony? I'm sorry. I put it There we go. Oh kind of slipped out didn't see that's what I'm saying, you know, Mike. I've got a Beautiful son another son on the way and if I listened to you, I would bank that these two children would enjoy a pony Thanks to your reign But are you sure your wife? Are you sure your wife is not carrying a pony? What do you say wait a minute, what are you trying to say? I was curious if you'd seen the ultrasound. I haven't been able to go because of covet. I haven't been able to see the ultrasounds Do you know my I'm not saying that uh That she would carry a pony or that you're that she's not carrying a human baby either I'm not saying no, I'm just saying well, she has been a little horse lately I'm sorry Why the long face? Oh my god Vermin supreme Okay, okay, you know the good thing you need to understand about a pony based economy Number one when we have universal pony ownership We will have equity in the ponies because you have equity in something you own So we have created pony equity number one now once you have equity in something you can borrow against it So you will be able to borrow against the equity that you have in your pony. Yes, that's right We are creating pony based debt. That's a bubble. Once you've created An entire class of debt. Oh, we'll get to that Um, it is at that point that you can turn it into a very important financial instruments where we can We will bring in the bestest and the brightest of all the ivy least create incredibly opaque hard to understand impossible Financial instruments and once we have great, okay, you know pony trouble pony assets all that stuff quantitative pony easing all that stuff and yes, sir We are going to create a bubble in the economy now, of course a bubble the thing about a bubble is it's an amazing thing to have in your economy It means that your economy is firing on all cylinders People are making money hand over fist. It's incredible. It's amazing now, of course as you might point out Yes bubbles tend to burst, but let me assure you mr. Drossel Please that this particular pony debt based bubble is going to be steel belted Reinforced and last forever This is just Listen, I love that. I want to believe you and I feel myself somehow believing you more and more Do I understand some of the terms you're using? No, but you know, I'm just a podcaster. I don't get enough Big financial stuff like you clearly have but to me I do feel like one thing that you are Overlooking and in this day where we are seeking to have a earth not Slowly heating up because of carbon emissions. You have not answered What we're going to do with those pony farts in this utopia that you are Uh That you are this story that you're telling this this thing that to me seems like a beautiful Pipetrain employment. There will be zero unemployment that the pony farts. What do we do with them? What do you do with the methane? Sir It's been taken care of in in fact this really bleat crosses over into real world because if you google Methane capture cows If you google a little bit, you will see that scientists are working on this problem problem in the real world They have devised contraptions that actually Capture methane gas from the gut of cows. Once again, it's a prototype. It's easily transferable to ponies So what do you do with all the what are you going to do with all the farts? Like if you're you're now you're suggesting we we breed as so many poodles and then we collect their You're gonna you're gonna use it will it will light your lamps at night Now that I actually is a beautiful thing I you know when I see the lights of my home or my studio where I'm at right now. I know it probably comes from Uh, well, I don't know what it comes from now that I think about it, but to look up at my lights and think That's the glow of an alchemy's pony fart That's beautiful much better than Nuclear waste or uh coal ash or however they get it these days. I don't know it's gasoline It's crazy. It's it's it's it's unsustainable That's all I know I'm I you know When I I thought I I thought I was gonna take you down today with a pony question, but I can see that I All right Underestimated most people Most people really agree with the pony platform as a economic pony nomics and all that The the problem that they often have is with the secret dental police kicking down your door at 3 a.m To make sure you brushed in all that and uh the dental reeducation centers and the preventative dental maintenance attention facilities and the government issue toothpaste containing an addictive yet harmless substance and oh, you know Uh the the dna gene splice has created a race of winged monkeys to act as tooth fairy enforcers No, that always sounds great to me reasonable. You know the way I look at that is if you haven't done anything wrong Why should you be afraid of police? I don't even know if that's the right word for it. Well intended friends Kicking down your door. Why'd you lock it in the first place? What are you hiding to get you to do what is as far as I'm concerned The healthiest thing you can do is keep those teeth clean. So to me The only thing I have a problem with in your plan is the Ponies I I want I don't I keep my door open. I keep my door open at night I'm appearing the mountains of north carolina. I keep it open the house a little cold in the hopes That a police officer will come in and remind me if I have a brush my teeth Or what? Maybe a pony or walking a pony. Oh god, what a great night Do you have bears in north carolina? We do Crawling Haven't had a bear. What about rec Recreation is walking your house. Yeah, we're plagued with the raccoon infestation. They get in the walls There's a lot of things in our house. They've gotten into the walls. They don't they don't hang out. Thank god in the Shared communal family space, but at night it's rough to hear the skittering of raccoons in the walls. They purr. Did you know raccoons purr? I Know they hiss when I catch them in the kitchen they they hissing growl, but I've never heard them purr They purr once they get in the walls. Yeah, I don't know what it is. I guess they just feel happy in the interior of a house Big how can they fit your walls? I don't know. They're not so I'm sure Are you sure they're not spirits of some sort? Oh, no, they're raccoons that I could see them through some of the holes in the walls I think that's how they get in there could be anything, you know, usually it happens when I'm not home But regardless, we have squirrels But squirrels are small there. I see but I don't that's weird Yeah, I don't have a very big wall. I don't know how they're surviving in there It's like Confusing to me at one and we had an electrician come by because we had a very high power bill And he said it's probably the raccoon sucking the energy out of your walls Well, that is a serious concern. I mean when I know the squirrels I freak out because if they start chewing through your wires That is not safe thing Well, a lot of people think they're drooling through your wires But really what they're probably trying to do is milk the energy. They're trying to get in there and suckle at them Ah energy vampire raccoons You know, the vampire word is you know, I don't know if they're vampires, but I do know that when and when uh Vampires You know, they're like People suck the energy Interesting Well, they purr I mean, but they don't want you to pet them I never thought of that Hell, no, I tried I reached through the hole in the wall bit my hand Hissed Never thought of it that way Did you get the rabies there did you get the rabies shots? Yeah, I know I had rabies for a few weeks. It was fucking horrible To have rabies day in covid simultaneously. It wasn't a great couple of weeks Joe Jorgensen got bit by a bat there. That was terrible Yeah, bats have or not do like bats need a new publicist right now because they've got a really Bad rap these days. Can you I just want to thank you so much for being on this show And I just really appreciate the work that you're doing out there I and I'm gonna vote for you whenever when whatever you run or do or whatever you want Whatever thing you do, I'll vote for you. I want my door kicked in. I want you to be our leader our great Powerful leader. I'm tired of this nonpony life. Can you let my other listeners who I guarantee your head? He'd be a tolerable strong man if you had the fucking ponies, but no, but no Trump Yeah, yeah, it's the lack of ponies that took him down. You know what what are we gonna do? It's not our fault. He should have put some ponies in the white house Should have had any any any one pony and he would have probably won against five He had his chance. He could have been dictated for a life if he had the proper ponies back at him, but no Yeah, it's not my reality If I say we can create our own reality and I like doing just that Um, hey, hey, have you read my book eye pony blueprint for a new america by any chance? No, sir. I have yet to read that All right, I'm gonna see if my people will send you a copy It's a it's a book about life in the future along after a vermin supreme presidency After everybody has their pony after zombie power fuels the nation And after the secret dental police have set up checkpoints every couple hundred yards It is a warning from the people of the future to you the people of their past Your present that vermin supreme is a madman and must be stopped Well to veil the ipon of the book dot com, you know Well, I'm not I'm sorry, but if you're a madman Then you're the madman we need and the you know what it doesn't play out It only plays out in the future. It's you know, uh, you know I'm doing everything that I can do to prevent myself from getting elected president for that very reason because uh I've traveled to the future. It's a it's a it's a crazy dystopic Thing with the yeah, but it's okay. Sorry. Well, just don't All you gotta do is don't run if you don't want it to happen. What's why why do you keep running? You keep running and running. Why do you keep doing it? Um, because it would be too easy not to You are truly the devil vermin supreme and uh, we love you How can people find you and thank you for doing this show? Well, thank you. Well, I am on the internet. That's a fact um, but you can go to um vermin supreme dot com You can go to vermin supreme institute dot com, which is uh, it's an interesting spin-off of my campaign As you know, I ran for the nomination libertarian party last year and it was pretty crazy I was the first thing I'd ever done like that. Um, quite frankly I'm 30 years of uh, of this fictitious campaign gave me enough notoriety to actually run a real campaign and uh, and in that demanded certain things it included a uh, uh, develop in a campaign team and a campaign staff and I Attracted all these amazing political operative libertarian types from the left and from the right And uh, they became I mean, they almost got me the nomination Uh, but after um, joe jorgensen got the nom They wanted to continue. They wanted to continue working. Uh, this messaging of love compassion mutual aid um It with this vermin absurdity angle And they and we tried to figure out what to do and how to do that and we came up with this idea of the vermin supreme institute Actually, it's just just vermin supreme institute the the is implied But I'd like to give you the the uh, two sentence a mission statement, please. Thank you Our purpose is to inspire social evolution through the disruption of authoritarianism to promote compassionate activism And to spread knowledge of redacted history through the use of humor direct action and mutual aid We uplift the disaffected disenfranchised and disempowered And we are doing just that and uh, it's a beautiful thing because we've got like various departments We have an education department. We have a public works project trying to do mutual aid they're doing mutual aid trying doing mutual aid projects and um And disrupt the vote so we're doing politics too helping anti duopoly candidates and uh, it's just it's an amazing thing um, because you know, I sort of brought my thing to a certain point And all these amazing people are bringing it to even greater heights and now it's becoming a truly a collaborative project Which is sort of wow, it's odd, you know having to give up, you know You know willingly giving up a certain amount of control in order to see it pushed Into a levels that it that it just hasn't seen that I couldn't bring it Isn't that fascinating that even as it even as an anarchist It's hard for you to let go of wanting to be in control I guess well, it's it's not I I just never had the opportunity not to be in control. I guess But now it just worked so many people are Still willing and working on different parts of it. So so vermin supreme institute dot com Um, that is totally that. Oh, of course, I did mention cameo for Five bucks. I'll say whatever you want. I'll be your monkey on the internet Um cameo dot com slash vermin supreme. Nice got one of those.

If you're a fan of the Creepshow movie, then you must watch his episodes of Creepshow on Shutter. Everybody, please welcome to the DTFH Rob Schraub. Rob, thank you so much, man. I'm sorry. I hate it having to move that around. I'm so glad to see you. It's really no big deal. I'm in between seasons on Rick and Morty right now, so my schedule is pretty open. I'm just kind of like working on the new house and trying to write a feature script and helping out Kate with her scripts and stuff. So my schedule is pretty liquid, pretty fluid. Is this the first house you've ever owned? Yes, this is. I lived in an apartment since I moved here. I moved out to Los Angeles from Wisconsin in 1998 with Harmont. I drove in my Honda Civic cross-country and lived in a house together on Norton. Do you remember Norton over by Koreatown? Sure, yeah. Okay, so we were over there and that's where we came up with Monster House in that house. And then I moved into Jeff Davis's, our mutual friend Jeff Davis's, Jeff Bryan Davis's old apartment. And I stayed there from 99 till like this May, last May. Wow. So I was there longer. It's weird. I've lived there longer than any place in my life, even like growing up in Mayville, Wisconsin. Like, you know, I moved out when I was 18. So I was there like 20 years, 21 years maybe. Wow. It was a pandemic that did it, like, because I was like, I can't, because at the beginning we were like, I don't know, this could be it. And I'm like, I don't want to die in this apartment. I always thought I was going to move and I kept putting it up, putting it up, putting it up. And finally we were shopping around. We found this great old school, like 1980s house that is just gorgeous. It looks like something out of like either E.T. or the poltergeist. Man, that apartment you had though was, I could see how that was a complete, like, honey trap. I could see why you would never want to leave. It was a loom. People like said, you go there and it's like all the couches are cushy and you know, it's like, you know, candle lit. It was a definite, like, very, very comfort place. But I mean, like, it was, and it was huge. It was a big place, you know, and the rent was, like, controlled. So my rent didn't go up for like about 10, 15 years. So it was, it was, but there was like, you know, like only one parking space had to share like washing machines and stuff like that. And just, you just like, I'm a little too old to share a dryer. Oh, I didn't realize you were sharing a dryer, man. Yeah. Yeah. That's fucked up. Yeah. Because, you know, the one, like, I, by the way, I think you know this, I, we bought our first house too. So we're both new homeowners. When did you move? Now, now, sorry, like, it's like one day I looked on, on Instagram and you were not in, in, in California anymore. Like, did you, when did you exactly move? Okay. We've gone over this a million times. I'm trying to remember when was the, when was the, like, at the peak of fire season this last summer is when we split. It was like, I can't remember the exact date. I'd have to look it up, but it was like, I don't know, things that gotten to be the most hyper apocalyptic I've ever seen LA. And we just, we just realized like, oh, we can't have kids here right now. And we're, you know, we were renting this compound that was like, perfect, but. Oh yeah. I love that place. That was nice. Yeah. It was cool, man. But we just had to, like, split. But you, so this isn't like, it's number one, the idea that you and Harman making this pilgrimage to LA. Yeah. Damn. What? I mean, I'm sorry to like diverge from talking about houses, but do you remember the conversation that spawned y'all deciding to take that trip? Well, you know, like moving, we talked about it for years, like, you know, like Harman and I were in a improv troupe called the dead ale lives and we had dreams of moving out to the West Coast. Plus, I had my comic book and I wanted to make that into, I was hoping that would be like the next tick, the next teenage Ninja Turtles. This was like 95 or whatever. And we got like option to be made, like Scott got option to be made into a movie. And so we were like, this is it. Let's move so we could be close to the making of the movie. Not knowing that everybody gets their shit option. Yeah. And there's no guarantee that you're going to go any further than just an option. And so when we moved out, everybody was like, why did you move? Oh, they helped make make the movie. And so we were quickly like dismayed and and like, oh, shit, we moved out here and and like the movies like kind of falling apart like now what? Wow. And so we we we I, you know, I dug into the comic book, but I was really not feeling it anymore. And then Dan really wanted to write and I wanted to get into animation. And we we we collaborated on a feature spec script and got it sent out and luckily got an agent, you know, like that's and to bring it back to Monster House. That's how we got our first writing gig. Wow, writing Monster House for Zemeckis. So we got super lucky. We got super lucky. I you know, is there anybody in LA who doesn't say they've got isn't that the only thing that can happen is you have to get lucky to like it's, you know, obviously, y'all didn't just get lucky. You're both amazing writers and you're super funny and you're both like disciplined, but and so that's the part you can take care of. But that's the crazy thing about that business is it's we were prepared. That's the thing is luck is opportunity mixed with preparation. Right. Worked on the comic book. We understood movies. We had a vocabulary of movies. We also had like a just just an idea for we wanted to make old school like Spielberg, Goonies, Monster Squad, Schlock, sci-fi horror fantasy stuff. And and also we were we were able to be funny too. So we were able to be and we had like performing experience. So when you go in and pitch, you're kind of acting out the movie. So we were we worked really good and we work really good off of each other. So and Dan's like very heady and really good with dialogue and structure. And I'm more visual and and an idiot. So we really balanced each other out. So once we got into the room and we kind of understood like what the target was, it was we we we we got lucky, you know, but we were prepared, you know, did did like several years of comic books and knew what we liked and knew what our we we had a really. I think we really understood what our voices were like as far as creators. And I think that that that took took a lot of time in the comic book. We'd spent all that time in doing comic books, creating that voice and on stage doing the Dead Ale Wives. And then so when we were we landed in front of Robert Zemeckis, just by chance, we were prepared. So that that's what I would say is any advice to anybody reading. It's like, how do I get lucky like you? It's like just work on your craft until like the chance meeting. Yeah. At the bus stop, at the restaurant, waiting for a table. And somebody goes, oh, you know, I really wish I knew somebody who. Had an idea about a monster house. You can just like you're locked and loaded. So that's the thing is just like hone your craft until fate steps in. And if you if you if you're honing your craft, you'll. I believe in magnetism. I'm sure you do, too. You know, like it's just like if you I attract positivity, I attract good luck. I attract opportunity. If you if you use that as your mantra, if you use that as your creative visualization, it kind of magically shows up. And I know for sure that if you do the opposite, that oh, my gosh, shows up as well. I keep forgetting that. God, I do. Yeah. Yeah, you can like cast. You can curse yourself. Just try like say like being being just saying shitty things about yourself, which is a really weird habit that it seems like people are just getting into any kind of creative endeavor. I've noticed if you ask them about what they're doing, they'll usually be very self-effacing with it. It's weird because we like this when you got your house, you know, like when people went, oh, wow, look at how beautiful your house is. The first you go, yeah, you know, we got super lucky. The deal is really good. We we paid a lot less for what it's worth. Yeah, it's not perfect. But you have somebody gives you a huge compliment and then you got to go. Yeah, but it's not perfect. Instead of going, no kidding. We this is the best house in the world. We totally deserve this. We worked hard for it and we knew what we want. You always cut yourself down and and I do it. I did it this morning. You did. Yeah. Oh, yeah. You know, you always kind of like find a way to go, you know, well, I'll try to get to work today. You know, I probably won't. You know, it's it's you can never be on your side. And I think I don't know why that. Why do you think that is? Why do you think we do that? Do you think it's because you don't want to seem too puffed up? Yeah, you don't want to seem like, you know, it's like there. I think there it's number one that I think one of the real problematic things outside of the metaphysical possibility that it's going to like amplify some horrible thing in your life just via some like language magic is it's fucking dishonest. It's like if you know, a lot of the times when when I found myself being self-effacing, I don't really believe. No, believe what I'm saying. So you're lying. It's like, yeah, you you you're in. So that to me is like the core of the thing is you think you do that because if you're talking to somebody who like say doesn't have a house and you're like, oh, it's, you know, it's not that, you know, you know, got a lot of headaches, you know, are you doing that because you don't want that other person to feel bad? Do you think that's that's part of it? I mean, yeah. And by the way, like any time like I've I'm like I've rented I'm forty seven. I rented my entire life. So it's like when I'm renting, you know, if I'm like marveling at somebody's house, which I would do quite, I mean, you know, someone had a fucking house. You're like, oh, my God. Yeah, it's impossible. How? Yeah. How? This is this is so far out of my reach. Yeah. And yeah. So but yeah, you never want to feel like someone's trying to like protect your feelings because you're a renter. You know, I think it's always better to just like, yeah, it's awesome. It's you got to do this. This is this is the thing is like instead of like going, yeah, you know, so I've got a lot of stuff to do yet. It wasn't perfect, but you know, it's like, no, you you need to. I wish I mean, Harmon would give me shit, but it was but it it it I wanted. I kind of secretly wanted somebody to go, what are you doing? What are you doing? You're just you're living half a life. Get out there and do something. Yeah, you could take a check. It might not work out, but you'll just adjust. You'll figure it out. Yeah, just get out of there. Otherwise, you're going to die in that apartment. Right. And I think the pandemic was like the best thing that kind of happened to me. I know it was a tragedy and a lot of people died. But I mean, like it worked. It really kind of put my life in perspective of like, all right. Well, what if I never see my folks again? What if I like what if I get sick? What if Kate gets sick? This this is it. This these are the last walls I will see. These are the last home and I would be unsatisfied with that kind of an ending. So when the minute it was like we got vaccinated, we were like, let's just start looking. Let's just start looking. And we it magnetized. We wrote down exactly what we wanted. This is another proof of magnetism working for us. It's like we got out of paper. What do we want? Want to pool? What do we want? I want a workshop. What do we want? We want our own offices. What do we want? Two levels. What do we want? We want a mid-century modern, you know, late 70s, early 80s house that doesn't look like a box or something out of a Creighton Barrel catalog. We want this, this, this, this, this we want. And we got it all. We got everything. We got everything that was on that list. And I think it and we got it quickly, too. Man, that's incredible. Like it's a good reminder for me. I keep forgetting that that that thing, which is like if you just ask for a lot of the time, you'll get it. And something about that is so easy to forget. But that being said, it's like the other thing, you know, when people are like are asking about like having a house, like, how do you not tell them? Like, oh, my, you don't understand. It's the biggest pain in the fucking ass that you have ever had. Like it really is. And then I feel like a dick for complaining because like, holy shit, I have a house, but also it's like once you have a house, it's just when I was a renter, it's like something goes wrong. It's so easy. You just let the landlord know something's gone wrong. You just and it gets fixed, you know, but not when like anything you want done when you have a house, it's just like forget. I don't know if you're having a hard time with that, but no, no, no. It's like we moved in and within the first, I don't want to say first week, but first couple of weeks, air conditioning, stop breaking. Oh, no, it stopped. It stopped working. It broke to stop breaking. And it was like at the middle of the summer and we're out in the valley here. So it was like 92 at midnight. Oh, my God. And we were just like, we I can't handle this. This is it. And so we had to replace the air conditioning, which is like, that's a huge chunk of money. That's like a just check because there's it's just just too, too. It's like a huge, huge chunk and then like, oh, hot water doesn't work. OK, we don't have hot water. So now we got to fix that, you know, it's just like little, little things like that you got to kind of navigate around. And then you and then the things that you don't know when you visited the house like a couple of the times, but you're not around for, oh, there's a horse ranch. Isn't that lovely? Like across the way, that's great. Oh, what they don't tell you is that every seven o'clock, the tractors come out until the backyard and stuff like that. And it's not it's not like insanely loud like Los Feliz was. But it's not quiet, like absolutely quiet, like you thought it would be. Right. And then you go, OK. Oh, OK. So those are the things that you kind of like discover in the first couple of days of living there. But let me ask you a question. When you moved in, OK, that first night you moved in. Yeah. And you're laying there in bed and it's dark. Did you were you kind of like, this is kind of creepy, or is this scary? Or is this, hmm, did you have any kind of not do the right thing? No, OK. So this house weirdly, no, I didn't get any kind of like ghost vibes from it. And I entertain the idea that I can tell when a house is like haunted or and I've have this has happened a few times to me once I was shooting something for drunk history and it was in an Airbnb or someplace they rented. And so I walked in and I got that feeling that I get when I'm in a house that people end up saying is haunted. And so the owner was there. And so I said to the owner of the house is haunted, huh? And the owner gave me this weird look like, how'd you know? And the owner is like, yeah, yeah. There was the woman who used to own the house. They found her body under a working electric blanket. And she'd been under that thing for like a week, you know, just just faster cooking. Yeah. Yeah. And then another house I lived at. Same thing. I got the haunted vibe, but not just that. The first night we were in there, we're like laying on a mattress on the floor and like just like there's just this slam and this like jug of water. We had up on a counter just flew it just flown off. And then then like a like months after living there, the neighbor said, and who knows maybe there was crazy. But the neighbor said to me, you know what happened in there, right? And I was like, what? And they wouldn't tell me to this day. I have no idea. A jug of water flew across and killed a man. That's the jug of water murder. Yeah. Yeah. Today's episode of the DTFH is brought to you by my beloved blue chew.

This is something that like, OK, so I'm from Milwaukee and every once in a while, you know, I fly back and Kate and I, we go visit my folks and stuff. And usually Kate's like she'll take care of like she'll do like all the travel arrangements or whatever. And like, I'm going to do it. I'll do it this time. OK, so I found like a good deal. It's like, oh, I can rent a car and I can get a hotel and I can get like this really cheap. It says, you want me to look at it before? No, no, no. I got it, honey. Don't take it. So we get off the plane in Milwaukee and the cab picks us up and takes us to where like the car is and the hotel is and stuff. And we're driving and I lived in Milwaukee for, you know, like about like six, seven years. And then we we we we were driving into the I'm like, I don't know where this is. This doesn't make any sense. Where are we? And then we pull and like there's like a car pulls out in front of the cab and like these gang bangers are like, oh, fuck you, man. And then like the taxi car is like, fuck you, I'll kill you. Whatever. And we're like, oh, shit, what is this? This neighborhood is like a little this isn't what I thought this was going to be. We pull into this kind of not I wouldn't say nasty, but not altogether great hotel. And Kate's like, what did you do? And I got I thought it was a deal. I thought, I don't know, maybe you get what you pay for. We get in there, we check our bags and we go up to the hotel and Kate walks in and goes, looks around the and it's just, you know, it's not like the Hyatt, but it's not it's it's a it's a hotel room. And she just looks at it and she goes, I will not stay here. There is a darkness in this in this building. We're leaving and and I never did this ever before. I went, OK, grab the suitcases because usually I'm like, oh, come on, let's just whatever. But I like whatever you want, grab the suitcases, went down there. We were in the room for two minutes, went down to the front lobby and said, we're not staying here. I understand we already paid for the room. It's fine. And they're like, OK, all right. And I like, yep, we're not staying here. We jumped in the cab, drove, you know, like 20 minutes and went to the Hyatt. You know, we were there and it was a lovely place and we had a great time. And then I was like, huh, I'm going to check up the address of that hotel. Did it used to be an apartment? Oh, that's where Dahmer killed all the people. Are you fucking kidding me? I thought they raised Dahmer's place. Are you fucking kidding me? Well, this was a while ago. This is a long time. So this is before. Oh, my God. That is nuts. So she picked up on all that horror that had happened there. So what do you think that is? What's your theory on that? Like what I mean, like, you know, I think certain people are like. Ken are connected with certain vibrations. Kate, definitely. My wife, Kate, she is when she feels something is off, she's always right about it. When she like, she's always been kind of like, you can have a good day today, you're going to have a bad day today or whatever. You know, like, just be careful out there. You know, like there's always she's she's really good at kind of being connected with the vibration or or or. But what that's what I what's it. So like, so you've got people like Kate, like like Claire Voian or whatever you want to call it. Yeah. But what like in a in a place like that, like, what do you what is the vibration? Like what do you think there's some like quantum residue or something in the place? Or like, what are they picking up on? I can't help but think there must be when something because usually people like wander around the world. Half not present. Yes. Not present. You're kind of like, oh, my mind is on. What am I going to eat later on? Or oh, this person isn't talking to me or like, oh, I got this thing do or whatever. Instead of like walking the dog or appreciating nature or even when you're talking to somebody else, you've got your mind on a million things. Yeah. But when you're in a life and death, like somebody is squeezing the life out of you, you are present. You are present. Yeah. You are so present because you're like, oh, my God, I have to everything. Every molecule, every atom of my body is now focused on this. This thing that is maybe going to kill me or whatever. And if enough of that happens, I think that echoes. I think there's echoes. I don't know if it's ghosts or bad juju or whatever, but it's like there's like a vibration that goes out. That is just like the same way we attract positivity, you know, like when somebody is like, especially like that last, you know, they say like a light bulb burns the brightest just before it burns out, you know, like somebody who's, I think Jeffrey Dahmer said that. Yes. And he's just, don't worry. Don't worry. He's, it's like, you know, he said a light bulb burns the brightest, especially when it's when it's burning someone's face. I think that's what he said. Right. Right. Right. Right. Yeah, I don't know, man. I like I it's like I've heard great theories on it. I've heard like I on coast to coast, someone was speculating that there that time everything's happening at once. So when you're when you're in a place, you're actually like, it's not like there's a residue or there's a ghost, but it's like time in some places time dilates or is thinner or whatever. And so like you're literally there when the event is happening, you know, and because everything is happening at once, that sounds like an insane idea. I think it's like it would make sense that, you know, somewhere in us was the like it would make there's some evolutionary advantage to like picking up if one of your species has died in a place. Well, I think animals are like that. I mean, like an animal will like they'll sense danger like really, really like there. I mean, like even my pet, who is a domesticated creature, who is like most of the wildness has been taken out of it. That is still inside her her makeup, her her brain or whatever that she'll be walking along. And if and then all of a sudden she'll just like stop and go. Hmm. Yeah. That's weird or whatever. Like like she'll see like huskies. She'll see like like bigger dogs. She'll see like kind of like these hounds and things like that. And she'll be like, eh, whatever. But if she sees a coyote, she'll freak the fuck out. She and nobody sat down and told her, is it OK? Like that dog is OK. That is a coyote that will eat you. No one told her. Right. So it's like inside there. There's like and I think like maybe the coyote is like radiating. I'm starving. I'm starving. Looking for something smaller than me. I'm starving. I'm starving. I'm starving. I will kill somebody if killed something that is smaller than me. And then like, but a domesticated dog doesn't radiate that. I don't know. Just just a theory. I always, you know, it's interesting like you think all time exists at the same at the same time. Like I always kind of thought about what if like reality or time is like like a cassette tape and there's only so much reality. And so once you get to the end of it, you either flip it over or you record over it again. So, you know, like are you recording over it? Like you remember when you were recording even videotape? Yeah. That there would still be a little bit of residual. Yeah. Like you would hear like, oh, I could still hear like the song that I recorded over or bits and pieces or video from the thing you recorded over would kind of percolate through and kind of share the same space. Yeah. You know, it it might be a way of rationalizing it, but that's that's cool. That that that's that's how I kind of like kind of put it. Oh, my God. The idea that we're like somehow stored on like some form of hard drive that is just like someone just recorded over like a previous universe or yeah. Whoa, that's so crazy, man. It's so weird. That's what your travel is. It's just a tape recorder. You could fast forward and rewind as long as somebody hasn't recorded over your life yet. Holy shit. That is so cool. Do you have, you know, this is like I love Terrence McKenna and that was one of his like talking points that when he was speculating about this thing called the singularity, that was his idea is like that, you know, they're about to invent a time machine. And because it's a time machine, it's so powerful that all the we like, and this is way before any of the shit we're going through happen, but, you know, he just said as we get closer and closer to the invention of a time machine or what's known as the singularity, same thing that you can expect novelty events as he put it, which is like shit's going to start happening that no one's ever seen before. That's so crazy that everyone's like, what the fuck? And that that's going to start happening with like that with the hockey stick. It's like exponentially going like so. First, you're just going to get like one like, you know, one weird event, assassination of Abraham Lincoln or, you know, these like rifts in history. Then Kennedy and then blah and then blah. And then next thing you know, it's like people are raiding the White House and there's a fucking pandemic. And then during the pandemic, they start talking about UFOs and all these things are like ripples radiating backwards through time from this time machine that we're all headed towards. Do you ever get in? You've ever heard that idea before? No, no, but I'm fascinated with all that kind of stuff. I did you ever read up on Tesla about how he possibly invented time travel or whatever like there was there was this story. I don't know. I'm going to get it all wrong, but, but maybe somebody will will, will, will steer us in the right direction after this, but, but, but like Tesla, like a friend of his like said, oh yeah, Tesla came over the other day and he looked freaked out. Like his hair was a mess and he was just like, not the same person. And then just like, what happened, buddy? And he goes, oh, I had an, I did an experiment with electricity and it went wrong and I accidentally saw past, present and future all at the same time. Oh wow. And they just, just like, just was like existed exactly like how you're saying like time exists all at the same time. And, and he had all these theories and wrote it down. And, and then after, after like he died, like the government came in and just took everything. Yeah, took everything. I know, but like that part is really weird. And then like, you know, the, I think the Q and on people got into this because the somehow the person connected to scooping up Tesla's shit was like a relative of Trump. Yeah. Trump's like great uncle or just uncle or something like that. And there was a theory going around like, oh, that's how Trump won. That's, is because he, he, uh, like he's a time traveler and, uh, and they said, and that's why he's, he's, he's, he's brain is, is all messed up because time travel gives you like brain cancer or something like that. Like, that's like, yeah, yeah. There's just all these theories that are just like really, you know, I go into the YouTube deep dives of conspiracy. Yeah. Because they find them so entertaining because they, they, they start off like so ridiculous that you're just like, oh, come on. And then they'll say something that'll go, hmm. Okay. What else you got? And then it's just equal parts, ridiculous and, and equal parts, um, probable, you know, like, you know, possibly probable. Did you ever get into John, into John T door? No, what's that? Okay. This is great. That's one of the big time traveling conspiracy theories. Like this guy started showing up on message boards, claiming to be this time traveler called John T door. And he, it was like the weirdest thing. He's, he's traveling the, he's traveling backwards in time. There's a civil wars happened in the United States. And I don't know that he needs this technology. He's trying to find like this old kind of computer that's got some kind of technology in it that they don't have in his version of the future. And what was cool about it was the details that he would give. Um, the idea, basically, like the idea was you don't really time travel as much as move into parallel universes that are at different time scales than yours, but that are similar. And the further back you go, the further away you veer from your original timeline. So I like the idea was like this fixes the problem of like killing your grandfather or whatever, because it's not your grandfather that you'd be killing. It's like some alternate reality version of your grandfather. But the other thing he talked about was like shit, like, uh, how he was getting colds and stuff all the time here, because his immune system wasn't set for the like viruses here and stuff. But, you know, it was definitely, I believe it was a fraud. And then of course, and people, they're in the way they kind of figured it out was, I believe someone who is probably John Teetor was like trying to protect the IP or something like something, you know, a time travel would never do. Yeah. That's interesting. I have never heard of that as a motivation coming back in time or to whatever parallel universe to get a bit of old technology. Yeah. It's kind of like, I have this external drive that has all this really important information on it, but I don't have the cable that will connect to my computer. Yes. Because they don't exist anymore. Like I bought like this old TV that, uh, on eBay and it supposedly worked fine, but it got broken during, uh, like, uh, in the mail. Uh, and I'm trying to just find a TV repair man and everywhere I go, they go, they don't have the parts. They're, yeah, I could fix it, but I don't have, they don't make tubes anymore. They don't do any of that stuff. I, I can't, if you, if you had the parts, I could fix it for you, but I don't have the parts, they don't make them anymore. Yeah. So like those TVs will be gone. And I remember when I, I was doing, um, the last, uh, last like four issues of my comic book, uh, cause I took 10 years off, um, in between like the last issue and then the, the, the, the last, the, the last four. And I had the original covers and stuff were done on computer, but they were done on like zip discs and like there was zip files and we, we couldn't, we had all the discs, but we couldn't get them off the discs onto today's computer. So we had to go to eBay and then we were online trying to connect one thing to another, to another, to another, to an adapter that would get into a computer that we have. And it's just, it's, if you go long enough, you're not going to be able to like access some of this technology if it only exists in this one thing. So it's like, how would you get it off of, you know, those hard discs? Oh yeah. Say you say you've got like, well, I've got a contract on here that says that you'll give me a million dollars in a year, but I can't get it off of this disc. Yeah. How do I do it? Well, I got to find somebody who knows how to do this. And then I need to get that off of that system and put it on my new system so I can duplicate and check. It's just, it's a cautionary tale to back up all your stuff in new technology. Yeah, right. That, I mean, this is the, uh, we have, okay. So we rented this awesome mid-century house in Pasadena years ago. We just found this place. It was kind of dilapidated, but who cares? We're renting it. Yeah. Beautiful place. But it had like an old school fifties electrical system in there. It had that thing that'll submit a century houses have where like above the bed, there were these buttons you could press to turn off, turn off all the lights in the house. I love that shit. Yeah. Fucking cool. But, but, you know, they were trying to be futuristic back then. So they were using what I think back then was considered a really advanced like way of wiring your house, but it didn't, it didn't, you know, it was, it was like flash or whatever. You know what I mean? It like, it didn't take off. It like, it became obsolete. And so, you know, what would happen is like lights on the house in the house would just stay on. You couldn't turn them off. The system wouldn't work. And we got an electrician who came and looked at the circuitry and, um, what just shook his head and was like, yeah, no one's going to be able to fix this. Like, man, yeah, it's interesting though, because it's like, you have all these like laying, you have all these storage mechanisms laying around, you know, that are becoming increasingly obsolete. And so there's all these like data extinction events that are happening where we're losing gigabytes of God knows what, just because it's like either they're not storing the material in the right place, because they, there's no point. It costs too much to store film, you know, and so they're just letting it rot. Or they don't have the machines that can run it anymore. So it's interesting how much stuff is just blinking out. Yeah. And it's not like the old days where it's like, oh, a photo, a photo album. I can open up. I can see, oh, this is what grandma looked like when she got married. This is like, this is my mom and dad when they were little kids and stuff. Like it's like this, this, this obsolescence is happening faster and faster. And people are like, oh, I got a million pictures on my phone. It's not precious until it's gone. Right. You know, I mean, like, what if you don't have it hooked up to your iCloud like I do? And, and, and like, it's just like, oh, your phone is broken. Okay. So now like five years of my life or three years of my life is just gone. I can't, I can't resurrect that. I can't open up a book and look, look at like, oh, this is. You know, this is all this stuff. You know, I mean, I mean, like, yeah, it's crazy. Like Instagram and, and Facebook and stuff like that, where, you know, you can look back at that stuff. But, you know, all it's like all of humans, all of like so much that we have like discovered or that we've learned all the data sets, everything is being stored on devices that theoretically could in a second get completely wiped out by a solar flare and we just anything that isn't in a book, it's just gone. And that, to me, that's like of all the settings for some kind of movie. Or, you know what I mean? That's a cool, I would love to see that version of the world, like 10 years after a solar flare has just zapped everything. Yeah, erased every hard drive, every hard drive. Everybody's set back to one. Yeah, because we would be so fucked, man. Like, like we are, most of us don't know how to do anything, you know, or, or specialize. So we don't know, like how to, but, you know, to imagine a world where all that just goes away, like how quickly we would probably just revert back to, I don't know, like the 1800s or something, right? That's what I think I'm curious, like how quickly that would happen. Would that happen over like a couple of decades or a couple of months? I think a couple of months. I think it happens fast. I think we just, you know, like those, you know, a pig gets, if like a domestic pig gets loose and it will mutate really quickly. It like grows hair and gets big and fucking weird. Like something gets activated and it's DNA. So, and I think with humanity, when things get like apocalyptic, we quickly mutate into very dangerous creatures. I think that's a survival thing. Like your brain, like we were talking about, do you sense danger? Like you, you can go, okay, now, now it's like, you know, you know, I, you know, I'm a complete wimp and, and everything, you know, I've never been in a fight in my life, you know, got my ass kicked a bunch of times, but if the world went crazy and it was like, would, would, I would hope that there would, something would snap inside me, that it would be like, okay, well, now it's fight, fight or flight moment. You know, like, are you going to cause, cause you're protected by society. You're like, well, you know, I'm not going to die. You know, I'm not going to get killed. But when you're in a situation where it's like, where it's like, okay, now every day is a fight for survival. I wonder if, if like just people like myself would just be killed off right away, or would we snap and turn, you know, or, or even worse, would we, but kind of, I say we, because I'm in that club too, man, but it's like, I don't know how to, like, I don't know how to fight. You know what I'm going to do. But is it like, I don't know so much that we would be killed as much as there's like this, like grim possibility that we would become slaves. It is that, yeah. You know, I don't think they, like it's necessarily like, cause what, why would you murder labor, your labor force? You know what I mean? Like you might, I guess your organs might get harvested or something like that. But are they like, oh, I, I, I want your wife. Yeah. I think, I think I, I'm going to have your wife now and your house. So yeah, you, so we'll get rid of you. Yeah. Yeah. Or are they, or worse, they just kick you out and I live in the backyard or worse. It's just like they, they do the exact same thing, but in some kind of like post apocalyptic, manipulative way, you know, they're like, I really like you. I'm going to call you, I'm going to call you lightning. You know what I mean? And your wife's beautiful, but we got to give up the old ways. Yeah. We got to give up the old ways, lightning. That's awful. That's awful because that's how it would happen. That's how it happened. It's like, we can't do it like we used to do it. Yeah. That causes trouble in a community, monogamy, you know, or like, what is it? David Koresh said he, he told everybody he's going to take the burden of sex for them and he started fucking their wives. Yeah. You know, how does the, how does the person go, oh, thank God, thank God. Thank God you're going to be fucking my wife instead of, instead of me. Starry eyed. You got to be pretty starry eyed, man. It's like just your, your, I don't know. I mean, like you, you have to be like, well, either you have to be super into it or you have to be just completely. Have you, did you, what, have you seen the mist, the, the Frank Darabot version of Stephen King story? Did you read the story? What's that? Were you a fan? No. You weren't a fan. Okay. I'm a fan of the Stephen King story and I'm, I'm a snob man with it when it comes to like any kind of translation of Stephen King stuff. Like for example, the new stand mini series are relatively new. It's pretty great. If you ask me, I haven't checked it out. Oh, it's good. And the one before it's cheesy as fuck. It's like the, the Randall flag character. It looks like he could, I don't know, play saxophone or something. You know, he doesn't seem like it. He doesn't seem like the anti-Christ, but so, excuse me, the, the, um, this, the novella, the stand that Stephen King did, did you read that? I, I haven't read it and I haven't seen, I mean, I'm sorry. Not the stand, the mist, the mist. I haven't read it. I'm a big fan of the, uh, the movie though. I did like the movie. Okay. If I had just seen the movie, I bet I would like the movie. Right. If I hadn't read the, you know, read, read the, very quickly. The reason that I brought it up is because of like, it's a microcosm of society breaking down and how people are like, if you get enough people afraid, they'll go to anybody that will come to, that will provide a solution. And it becomes like, Oh God is, uh, wants us to sacrifice your son. And it's the only way we're going to survive. And everybody's like, who like a couple of days ago would never do that. Or like going, I'm so scared. Let's try it. Let's sacrifice this, this boy. You know, you know, like that kind of stuff was very, um, helpable to me. Very, uh, uh, it's terrifying to me. It's like the monster stuff and the tentacles and shit like that. That's all cool and everything. But like the stuff that really made me go, Oh shit. Yeah. I'm with that father going, they're going to, this entire store of people is going to try to kill my son. And yeah, I'm going to have to fight to the death to get out of here. He caught, he captured it. He captured the thing that a lot of people are feeling right now. And it's like, cause to me, like to, to go back to like the pig mutating thing, it's like when you see these people who are really overwrought over like masks, the vaccine or whatever. And now there's all kinds of videos of them at like school meetings and stuff. Yeah. What's weird about it to me is not so much they're protesting, like putting mass on kids, I get that. And it's a scary time. I get people being freaked out. What's weird to me is the similarity in their affectation. You know what I mean? They're like all the way down to like the way they're alerting their voice. And like a lot, the label that has been applied to that when it happens in a woman is like a Karen, right? Yeah. But why are they all the same? Why are they, you know, it's weird that they all have the same way of talking, the same cadence, the same, you know what I mean? They're all going crazy in a similar way. That's what's strange. Right. You think people go nuts in different ways, but it's the, it's so strange. It's a different kind of virus. You know, it's like they're afraid of a virus. And so like this personality virus starts taking over. That is an interesting, that's an interesting take on a zombie movie that where it's like you're not like living dead zombie, you know, whatever. But you're like, you turn into this same personality type that is like against like reason and is just like, I'm going to pay more attention to that. But that is really frightening. That's creepy, man. And like they, they're, it's just strange. I don't know if it's like maybe they're going on the same message boards and maybe they're watching the same videos. They would have changed their voice. Why would they? I mean, I mean, so well, you know, in the way like, you know, very, very social, like fashion, fashion, it's like fashion, you know, so people start dressing the same way, maybe they're like seeing videos or people talk, I don't know, but my theory has definitely been, oh yeah, it's, it's some kind of mental contagion. Right. But yeah, as far as zombie movies go, I mean, to me, the thing that's way scarier than people turning into the undead or people becoming cannibalistic and diseased and like kind of superhuman would be just a general disintegration in the sanity of your species, you know, watching everyone or most people watching the same thing that happened in the grocery store in the mist happened historically, which, which is fascism, I guess, right? Like, yeah, suddenly it's not the kid they're talking about sacrificing. Suddenly people are like, you know what the problem is, right? It's Jewish people that actually happened historically. And like, and, you know, you hear that when it's coming from like, you know, 20 people and you're like, crazy ass people, right? But then that spreads a little bit and then it spreads a little bit more and more and more and then suddenly you're the one who seems crazy. You know, that, that shit is, you put people in a killer be killed situation where they just want the target off their back. You know, they just like, oh, yeah, as long as it's not me being sacrificed or as long as it's not me being rounded up. Let's get, let's, let's just get that off. I think, I think, yeah, people change pretty quickly. Yeah. You know, when the power goes out and you can't call 911, you know, like, why didn't know what would, you were not a fan of the movie. What was different about the novella that, that you thought was missing from the movie? Okay. So for everyone who hasn't seen or read these spoiler alerts, spoiler, spoiler, spoiler, skip ahead a little bit. So the, okay. The ending of the ending, yeah. Yeah. Cause the ending of the, of the novella, it didn't, it ended like, even though you could say the ending of the mist was disturbing and ended bad. There was this sense of like, things are going to go back to normal. You know, whereas the Stephen King version of it, it doesn't end like that. Like shit's done. Yeah. They're fucked and it's done. And so there's like a, and also, you know, you just can't replicate the description of some of these like, shambling, massive, giant fucking, he didn't do a bad job. Yeah. Replicating, obviously. And I don't mean to say the most obvious thing, which is like books, generally about movies, you know what I mean? But, but still it's like, how do you, I don't care what kind of computer genius you are, you're not going to be able to replicate some thing that's so giant. And it's like legs go up into the clouds and like swarms of like pterodactyl creatures or like nesting and it's fucking torso and flying out. You know, he just really captured the whatever this world was that it leaked in. Also, man, the just the slow burn of the thing. I'll tell you another thing I didn't like about the dare, but I know again, I like a lot, a lot of stuff he does. Yeah. Here's another thing I don't like just. And this is all my own personal opinion. I don't like the device of having the dead animal or the murdered animal in the beginning of a movie. You know what I mean? Like what is that? What part is that in the very beginning? There's like a dead dog and a soldier thing that happens. Like that's not in it. That's not in them. I'm pretty sure it is the very beginning of the mist. I just watched it. There's no dead dog. I'm telling you, man, unless I'm completely, let me, I'm gonna, like it's the very beginning. It's that soldiers running through the woods. There's like a dead animal in the beginning of it. I'm almost positive, bro. I'll go back and look. I just watched it twice. I watched it twice last week. Okay. I'm going to be feel freaked out. Maybe there's a new version about two different movies. Hold on. No, no, no, we can't be talking about. There's a, no, it's the same movie. I'm, maybe I'm, maybe I'm mixing. No, it's very possible. I'm just merging movies. Is it, is it possible that it's in the book? And not in it, but you like the book. There's no dead. I, because I would have a problem with that too. At the beginning of the mist starts off with the electrical storm and the guy painting the picture. Okay, listen, unless there's a director's cut that I didn't have not seen. It must, it's a difference. So they, maybe they fixed it, man, because I just Googled mist dog death because I didn't want, I was feeling crazy. The mist showrunner explains why the dog had to die. A dog is brutally murdered in the first couple minutes of the adaptation's first episode. So this is the TV series. Yes. I'm talking about the Frank Darabont movie, the movie. Oh, wait a minute. I haven't seen the TV series. Hold on. Hold on. You know what happened is I got the movie and the TV series mixed up in my head. Right. Right. Okay. TV series, the TV series is, is good. Now I'm completely confused because I've seen them both and I can't remember which is which now. So the movie that I like, which is the mist, is this, I would have a problem with the dog being brutally murdered too, because I'm like going, why? You can, you can make up anything. Why the reason you're killing off a dog or an animal is a very emotionally manipulative thing because like it's, it's because we, we, we get triggered by, by pet death. Yes. Or maybe that's, that's the other version of it. You open up with a kid getting killed or a dog getting killed. Yeah. And so I find that manipulative and I don't like that too. And you could avoid it easily if, if you took the time and be a little bit more clever or just choose not to do that story. But the beginning of the movie is him painting the picture. There's a storm. They go downstairs and then the tree busts into the house and destroys his painting and then he's got to go into town to get some supplies to cover up the window and that's what leads him to the grocery store. But like all the, the, the best part of it is the character development and the slow burn of like shit, the doom is, is happening. And the ending, the ending I'm like, okay, Kate said it best. It's like, oh, and we're going to talk about the ending again. If you want to skip ahead of this too, is that, oh, if somebody is going to do something really horrible, like, you know, like kill, you know, the somebody you love in order to protect them from a horrible death, the very next beat is going to be the, the, the army coming out of the smoke going off. You just would have waited like five minutes. You would have, everything would have been fine. Like it, it, it's like, ah, you know, it, it, it's, it's that I find manipulative as well. No. But I, but I find, I, I mean, look, we're storytellers, everything is manipulated. Right. That's true. Everything's manipulative. But if you're going to manipulate, just try to come up with a new way to manipulate. Like, don't, like any, any time I'm sitting down for a horror movie and it's like a fucking dead kid up front. Like when, you know, when Aaron was pregnant, we wanted to watch a horror movie. And so like, I'm like, I picked out this horror movie, just look cool. And like within the first 10 minutes, it's not just a baby getting killed. It's an entire nursery of babies. What movie is this? So I can avoid it. It was on Netflix. I can't even remember the name. We never, I could, obviously I couldn't finish it because like, you know, it's this demon is eating babies or a nurse got possessed, I think. And it's just, it's like using a scalpel to kill babies or something. Oh my God. No, no, no, no. And Aaron, who's like about to have, you know, we're like a month away from her giving birth is looking at me like, and she says, why did you do this to me? It starts crying. I'm like, I didn't know. I had no fucking idea that there was a scene. It's just too easy. There's a movie which I actually recommend. Edgar Wright actually recommended this movie. It's Who Can Kill a Child is the name of the movie. Sometimes it's referred to as like the third children of the damn movie. Cool. But it's in color and it's a beautiful movie and it all takes place on the island. And it's basically like this, this, this couple, this young couple, one's pregnant. The woman, Duncan, the woman's pregnant. What? And yeah, yeah, I know, Edgar Wright. So it goes to, it goes to, they wind up on this island, I don't know, by on purpose or by chance or whatever. They wind up on this island, which seems deserted, but it's just inhabited by children that are all murderers, all like psycho. They're just like freaked out. They're just killer children. Yeah. And it's the two of them trying to survive a horde of children. And it's like, and like, why couldn't you defend yourself? It's like, who could kill a child? Oh, wow. Now, now the reason I want to warn anybody that's going to go, well, that sounds interesting, I'd like to see that if you watch this movie, skip over the credit. Oh, no. Because the credits, for some reason, the filmmaker decided, like, let's use footage, I believe it was from World War Two. Oh, come on. Like a worried for of bearing. Child corpses. Oh, what? And it's just like over and over and over again, and it's all grainy. And it's all real. It's like documentary footage. It's not faked. It's like it's it's and like I was watching it with Steve Agee and we're like on Jesus Christ, the movie hasn't even started yet. This is whatever. And like Agee's texting and you're going, how the fuck? Why did you do this to us? This is terrible. Oh, my God. And then like it just just watch after the credits of the book. And we we we skipped ahead, watch the movie. And the movies actually really, really, it shot beautifully cool colors like that old kind of 70s, early 80s, just like hell. Yeah. But just really kind of like the the blues are really blue and the reds are like red. It's really, really, really a beautiful looking movie. And but and the kids are creepy as fuck. And you believe the the the terror. But I recommend the movie if you skip over the horrible, irresponsible. Yeah, don't do that. Credit. Don't do that. We've been opening title sequence. Just irresponsible. I don't know why. And it has nothing to do with with the rest of the movie. I don't know why somebody didn't say, hey, maybe, you know, white titles on black. We don't. Yeah, yeah. We don't need that. We don't need this. Yeah. Why? Why? I would love to know the reasoning. I don't know. But who could kill a child sometimes referred to as Island of the Dam, I believe. That as soon as we get our internet back, I'm going to watch. Oh, by the way, so you're here. How are you doing this? If your internet is I'm in my studio, you're at your studio. Yeah, you have a house and a studio. Yes, because I have kids, so it's too loud. Right. Now, Rob, listen. Hmm. I want I want to ask you this is the only real question I have for you for the whole time. I'm sorry to ask you. We have we've already done an hour. Do you have a second longer? Oh, yeah, yeah, I got as long as you want. OK, so here's here's something I've been wondering. And I feel like I already know what you're going to say. But if you look back at like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, if you look back at Rosemary's Baby, you know, the classic vintage horror movies of the past, maybe even Texas Chainsaw Massacre, too, though. And then you look at a lot of the modern horror movies that are coming out right now. Do you think some something? I know it just makes you sound like just an old man. Yeah, but are horror movies like is something is it impossible to recreate the horror movies of the past? Like, is that over? Was there like a golden age of horror? I think, I mean, like the 80s in particular, there was a weird. There was a lot of stuff going on. Like special effects came of age in the 80s. And so like and also like a lot of independent horror movies came of age in that, like, you know, Texas Chainsaw Massacre being like one of them, yeah, going into the 80s or whatever. So you had like your Sam Raimi's like, let's go out with our friends and make like a movie in the band. We'll make a horror movie because that's a genre that is proven to make money, you know, as opposed to doing a comedy. Let's do that. So you have somebody like Sam Raimi who's like, I want to do comedy, but I know if I make a horror movie, it has a chance of being picked up, distributed and getting me out there. So you have somebody as a good sense of humor who is actually really, really creative and very experienced and has got like a group of people that will back them up and they make Evil Dead and it is there is a glee to the horror. I would say Creepshow has a glee to the horror. I would say Texas Chainsaw Massacre, too, has a glee to the horror. We're watching people like we're horrifying you, but we're all. We're all little we're all kids, you know, sneaking downstairs. Our parents are having a dinner party and we're watching this movie. We probably shouldn't. You know, I think that's also is like those Joe Dante's, those those John Landis's, they Toby Hooper's, who are the monster kids of like the 50s and 60s grew up. And now they're now they're making movies. Yes. And so those those monster kids grew up with like Frankenstein and Wolfman. Right. And Gilman. And they just we want to do that, too. But we're going to do the howling. We're going to do American Werewolf in London. So there's there's just a glee. You know, these we're watching people live their dreams and that I feel like the movies of of the 80s, especially any kind of genre stuff, and mostly like low budget horror, they what they didn't have in money. They had a lot in style. Yes, you look at Evil Dead, too. Every shot is like what every camera move is. Holy cow, everything is they didn't have a huge set. They had a cabin. But every shot is just like something inventive and new. Yes. And. I haven't seen a movie like that in forever. You know, like the show had like all this like crazy lighting or like the howling had all this kind of noir lighting. They were like being influenced by a lot of different things because what we can't do in budget, we're going to do in style. And and right now a lot of the stuff is. So computer fast cut, see graphic or whatever, like that, not graphic like graphic violence, but like computer digital things that it doesn't I don't know. And I'm just like you. Am I just an old man going? They don't make it like they used to when they don't. And then maybe they can't. But you did kind. You did. That's what that's what's so cool about what you did with Creepshow is that you you I think you grabbed. I mean, that's what I loved seeing that because like, holy shit. It's, you know, maybe it's not completely lost. And I'm not just saying that because you're my guest. It's it's like you think you there's there's there's got to be a support. Behind the director, I think I think a lot of the times. And I don't know if you've experienced this when you're shooting on set, especially when you're doing TV, that you're shooting the schedule and you're not shooting the script. Oh, when you start like because I always, even when I was doing the service of the program, I wanted to have every shot be inventive and things like that. And there's just no time for it. Or people roll their eyes and go, they're just like, this is not. This is not helping that nobody cares what it looks like. I heard that all the time. Nobody cares what it looks like. They just want it funny or not. And I care what it looks like. I want it to look good. And I think like you look at British comedy of the last like 10, 15 years. They, for some reason, found a way to be. Have great style. Like you look at something like Toast of London. You look at something like The Mighty Boosh. You look at something like Garth Merengue's Dark Place or Snuffbox. They're very inventive with their shots, you know, and they are in love with that kind of filmmaking, too. Like they're big horror fans over there as well. Like, you know, like Matt's a big, you know, horror fan. And so is Richard Iowate. He loves film and things, things like that. Matt Holness, he obviously loves that kind of stuff. So, yeah, I miss that inventiveness where you would be. Like watching like, I think people, I think that was in vogue for a while in the 80s and then got done so much that people like, I just want to see something raw, which, you know, is not. I just want to see something just full on, just horror. And that's when the Torture Porn, Eli Roth kind of stuff came in where it's like. Which which is fine, you know, you could be a fan of that. But I just I wasn't, you know, I just like the glee wasn't there. There was an an actual here's the thing. I mean, maybe this is back in the 80s when they're doing like the Howling, doing Return of the Living Dead. There the the idea was we want to entertain the audience. And when we start getting into the 90s, mid 90s, later on into the arts, there is like, no, horror movies are not to be entertaining. Horror movies are to be disturbing. I want to abuse the audience. Yes. And it isn't until like something like Sean of the Dead that comes out, which feels people go, oh, that's a horror comedy. But that feels like really at home in that Evil Dead to Return of the Living Dead like area, you know, it's a movie with fun characters in a horrifying situation that takes itself, the situation takes itself seriously, even if the characters reaction to it are humorous to us. It's not to them, but it's to us. But the goal is to entertain the goal is to entertain. And I think like Sam Raimi, like was like asked like while he was working on Evil Dead, too, like because if the first the first Evil Dead had that rape scene with the tree, you know, which is like people go, oh, that's all right. And it was notorious and and that was shocking. And and people said, do you ever regret doing that to Sam Raimi? And I and he said, absolutely, I regret doing that. My job is to not offend the audience. My job is to entertain the audience. And and that's so his and his stuff is. I think the pinnacle of entertainment when it comes to that era is like he found a way to go. This is horrifying, but fun, but not spoofy. I think also it was his connection with the Coen Brothers because the Coen Brothers, I believe they edited Evil Dead, too. What? I believe that. Yeah, they were working with it. They if you read like the Evil Dead, too, script, there's all like these Coen Brothers reference like a character goes, he's gone, blood simple. Or like when they start speaking like in the the dead eye tongues, like they start going, oh, that is a hud sucker proxy. You know, like they start dropping like these Easter eggs. But if you look at like how the characters are acting in Evil Dead, too, and compare them to like Holly Hunter and Nicholas Cage and Raising Arizona, so there's a little bit of crossover with it. Absolutely. That is a mindblower. And if you watch, if you watch like, I think Raising Arizona is really, really an amazing film just because it has all that inventiveness with the camera. Yeah. And it has all that inventiveness with the language and the dialogue and the storytelling and the acting. There's just like inventiveness on top of inventiveness. And it has all of the fun stuff. Two that I love, but it's not a horror movie. Right. And like the characters are big and broad, but for some reason, it doesn't feel spooky. It feels like its own committed reality. And that's what I love about it is like to find that sweet spot where you're not doing something that is. What is considered? Over the top or too much or like I roll, but it just seems like there's a glee in the glee in every frame of film and every word and every letter and every cut and every camera move and every turn of the story wheel. There is a glee to it. Even when even even like the the dark times or this sad times, there's still a glee to it. Right. There's a unspoken contract between the filmmaker and the audience that's like, we're going to do some scary stuff, but you're going to be fine. You know, and if it gets too scary, just look away for a second and come back and join us. You know, like there's there's I watched like George Romero introducing the first the premiere of Day of the Dead. And he's like, OK, there's some pretty hard stuff in this. This is pretty insane. We're very proud of this movie. You know, there's a lot of zombies in there, but we're here to have a good time. And if you see something too too intense, just look away and just come back. And it's it, you know, I think. And I think like Dawn of the Dead, there's a lot of glee into it. I think David Dead is a little bit more of a dirge. Sure, there's still some fun stuff in there. There's still like, I think I think that's sad. I think that's Tom Savini's monster kid growing up, like ripping the head off. And then the vocal cords are stretched and sounds different. That's an eighth grade boy like invention right there. God, I forgot about that scene. That's Shriek will always remember that fucking Shriek. Yeah, it's it's just inventiveness. It's like we've seen in film, somebody getting their head chopped off or taken off or whatever. But no one's ever gone. What if what if it was pulled off and you went to your vocal cords? Like like taught and it's it's it's it's stupid and unrealistic. But it's it's it's like you're watching a guy draw on his notebook. You know, yeah, I got you, man. I I love the analysis and like I feel like that gives me a little hope because it's replicable. It doesn't have to. Yeah, I think I think it really, you know, Peter Jackson used to do that with like his his crazy films before he started doing like Lord of the Rings and things like that. There's a lot of inventiveness in there. And you know what, the new Suicide Squad feels like that. Yeah, you know, there's a there's a director that I think you should check out who I really love a lot, Steve Kostansky. He did a movie called The Void. I don't know if you've ever heard of that. Wait, what's that about? It's kind of like a John Carpenter tribute. It's like every John Carpenter movie mixed together. And it's this this it all takes place in a hospital where there's this kind of gateway to a void, another dimension where all like these Cthulhu like creatures are coming in and possessing people. And it's like this cop, you know, with his estranged wife trying to figure out how to survive the night. And it's very done, very serious. It's all practical effects. And they did it like as one of these Kickstarter movies, very independent. And his follow up movie Psycho Gorman. Have you ever heard of this? Yeah, I've been wanting to see it. Looks awesome. It's really fun. And it's really inventive. And it feels so much like like like the first act of it feels like, oh, this this is like in the same era as Monster Squad. You know, it just has like that kind of, you know, little kids playing with monsters. But there's a lot of like, oh, that's really inappropriate gore or whatever. But, you know, the kids can handle it. The parents can't, you know, like that that kind of stuff. It's it's I'm hoping he does more stuff because he comes from a a very like do-it-yourself just really, really a glee. He has a glee to everything that he does. Rob, thank you for this, man. It's been so great talking to you. I got a split. I got fence shit to go deal with at the house. Fix that fence, man. You are brilliant. Thank you for giving me this much time. You're brilliant. Can you quickly tell folks about your podcast? Oh, well, I do Shrob Home Video on Sundays around like seven o'clock Pacific Standard Time, 10 Eastern Standard Time, where at ShrobHomeVideo.com, I show like something weird. Usually I show like a clip show of just weird stuff. It started off kind of like is that everything is terrible. TV carnage kind of like look at all this dumb weird stuff, but it slowly started evolving into here's like a cool fight scene from a Shob Brothers movie. Here's like an insane like transformation scene from this horror movie from Italy or whatever. Here's here's some animation. Here's a music video. I got really inspired by like what Dante Fontaine would do with his like mixes. If you check check his stuff out on Vimeo Dante Fontaine, his stuff is really good. He's hate Comet on Instagram. Oh, he's got some fun music, something interesting to look at. It's just just digging into my collection and sharing it with the world. Man, it's awesome, by the way. Y'all must join this and watch it. It's really, really cool. Yeah, try to do something every Sunday. Rob, thank you. That was Rob Shrop, everybody.

And you are listening to the Ducatrussell Family Hour podcast, Deep Fake Technology. That's what we're going to talk about today. This is one of my favorite topics. If you pay any attention to the DTFH at all, you know that I went through a period of being supremely freaked out by the potentials of deep fake technology. And suddenly this insane thing came out where they'd taken Rogan's voice, perfectly duplicated it, and just got him to say a lot of weird shit. And I got lucky enough to meet one of the brilliant human beings behind that technology, Hashim Khadim. Hope I'm saying that right. He goes by Hash, and he's a brilliant programmer. And we ended up meeting, and I think he thought that we were just going to do like a Skype where we talked. But I recorded it, and he let me use it as a podcast because I thought it was such an awesome conversation, covering something that I really do think is going to be one of the major cultural disruptors of our time. So that's what this podcast is. If you want to hear about deep fake technology, the apocalypse, and all the supreme weirdness that is coming down the tubes technologically, then this is the episode for you. We're going to jump right into it. But first, some quick business. If pussies are gardens, as Socrates did say, then boners are about sprinklers, and com is what they spray. And if you want a baby, it won't hurt to pray, but you'll definitely need a boner. If you don't like boners, then blue choose not for you. But if you're seeking boners, then we've got a deal for you. We will send you a free packet of blue chew, and you can see what happens to your boner. This episode of the DTFH has been brought to you by the lords and ladies of boners over at bluechew.com.

All right, today's guest ascended to the national stage after making this insane Joe Rogan video where he and some of his partners created this insane perfect replication of Rogan. And they got Rogan to say a lot of really awesome, weird stuff and holy shit, I was so fucking blown away by this conversation because this stuff, this deep fake stuff, this crazy ability to replicate people based on only a few minutes of audio of them talking has shaken me down to my very quantum core. And I think it'll give you the heebie-jeebies, but hopefully the good heebie-jeebies and not the creepy Fox News heebie-jeebies. Whatever kind of heebie-jeebies you get, it's October, that means Halloween's around the corner. So here's an authentic technological ghost story just for you. Everybody please welcome to the DTFH, Hashim Karim. [""Welcome to the DTFH, Hashim Karim""] [""Welcome, welcome to the DTFH, Hashim Karim""] It's the DTFH, Hashim Karim. So yeah, you're saying tech people didn't get the apocalyptic nature of it? Yeah, usually they just focus on the techie details and they don't really think about the big picture. I mean, I think even working on that, we suffer from it too. Well, we're just focused on the specific problems. We're not really thinking about the big picture that much. Who's behind it? Who's funding it or what's the plan with this? It started off as a side project with me, a friend, and then we brought a third person in that we found. I was talking with him and I was working with him remotely, but he was actually in Tunisia, and then we brought him over. I convinced the company I was working at to hire him, and then all three of us were working on it. But my friend had this idea. He just, we were having dinner and he just said to me, wouldn't it be crazy if we could get Terrence McKenna on the Joe Rogan podcast? That was the idea. Cool. From there, yeah, we just started working on, we started with Joe Rogan's voice and seeing if we could replicate his voice. That is so trippy. Because this resurrected quality of this type of technology fits in so perfectly with eschatological prophecies. Specifically, the dead will rise again. At the end times, the dead will come back. And I think about the way I picture the world ending and deconstruct that sometimes and realize how much of that is put there by movies. And how explosions, fire, earthquakes, et cetera. But technology has added this layer of strangeness to the end times, not to say this is the end times, but certainly to see a mirror of the book of revelations appearing technologically, which is like, if you guys have done this, you made an AI that converted texts, stop me if I'm wrong, it converts texts to speech, but it does it in Rogan's dialect and voice. Yeah. And that's gonna work for anybody, right? Like you could do that for anyone you wanna do as long as there's some media existing. Yeah. So one thing I remember when your conversation on the Joe Rogan podcast with him, Joe always mentioned that he had, like there's so much audio of him available, so it's easy to do it with him. But we were able to do it with other people without that much audio. So we were able to get good quality within 30 minutes of audio, but in the future, it's only gonna take a few seconds. And then that covers, you know, I mean, just off the cuff, but 70% of all human beings or something at least. Yeah, anybody would give it a presentation or something. But then on top of that, doesn't it also, like the data troves that Amazon has and Google has, as they've been sniffing stuff for Alexa and Google Home and all that, that stuff would just as easily be usable too. Yeah. Well, that's what makes it possible to only have a few seconds of your audio because there's so many people that have different voices, but maybe you could interpolate between different voices to get your voice. And those other people have said different things and the way you combine these things, one of the biggest assets is a huge data set. Right, so that's it. And there are huge data sets out there for all public figures, but theoretically there's huge data sets out there for everybody if you've allowed certain permissions on Instagram, Facebook, Google, wherever, right? Like that's the sinister part to me is that there's storehouses of voice data being held by private corporations. And with that data, you could essentially create a golem, some doppelganger of a person, right? Or am I overreacting to that? I think we're a bit early, but it's definitely coming. So we just poked at it, but it's definitely gonna get to the place where it's gonna be readily available, where everybody will, or a lot of research teams will be able to do this. And then in the future, yeah. Go ahead, please. And then in the future, after the research teams will be available to do this, then people will make apps, and then a lot of, maybe people that are not so techy will be able to do it as well. And that, of course, is gonna get used for augmented reality, for virtual reality, right? It means that pretty much anybody who's got some recording out there, you're gonna be able to hang out with them in a virtual space and have a conversation with them. It seems like the big chunk that we have yet to achieve would be an AI that could, in some way, absorb the personality of a person, not just their vocal thumbprint, right? The one idea we're thinking of taking this project with is if we could have a conversational dialogue with Joe Rogan, and if we could add the visual aspect as well. So it's like you're video chatting Joe Rogan. Right. So that was the one place we were thinking of taking it as well. And it's not that far-fetched. But you still have to like, this to me is like, once we cross the Turing test line with AI, this is one of the byproducts, is that the AI begins to essentially possess digital costumes or masks for different people. And then the more granular the personality data you have, the more it's gonna cross over the uncanny valley to a point where there's a better version of you, right? That's how, that's what I see, it's not just like you could like, get Rogan and create a video Rogan and have a conversation with your own Rogan. But theoretically, you could adjust, you could have sliders. Let's make him a little happier. Let's see what, you know what I mean? Let's see what he'd be like if he never became a comedian. I don't know, just like, you could just change variables and an identity and start producing clones that have behavioral qualities that are different in certain ways. Some of them better, some of them worse, right? I can imagine you could even do stuff that's not so, that falls into certain buckets, like you could have a hybrid between you and him, for example, or maybe like a 30% Rogan, 70% Duncan Trussell. Wow. Shit. Wow, that'd be amazing, like a kind of like lazy, Rogan sucks at the bandit in sports. But hey, the implication to me is that this is like electricity. Am I wrong about that? Like I see this as the invention of electricity for what it's gonna do to us as a species. Like this really disrupts the fucking hive, man. There's only supposed to be one me. And our lives are lived on screens, you know? So it's like, this is this, whatever you wanna call it, the digital biome that we're starting to exist, like you and I right now, we're hanging out on screens. You know, to me, it's quite nerve wracking to imagine a situation where the fundamental value of a person, being this sort of singularity that goes along with being an identity, gets complete. You essentially, you're devaluing identity with this shit. You know, you're creating like a stock market crash for personalities here, right? Yeah, but again, it's hard to say when that would actually, when we'd actually get to that point, cause it could be very far off. How far off? I mean, that's not a fair question, but just off the cuff, you know, whatever. You only need to be 10 years within range. Oh, that's impossible. So I'll tell you why it's hard to guess. It's because there have to be advancements in the industry that are paradigm shifting. And those big breakthroughs are very, very hard to predict because it takes somebody thinking so outside of the normal way of thinking in the industry that they just, they're just a free thinker that just break everything and make a new step change in the whole field. So with our current technology, we can't do it. So that's why it's hard to guess, but it could happen, you know, anywhere within the next 30 to 100 years. Oh, so you think you three decades away before we have to worry about the invasion of these masses. Yeah, but it's a very rough, very rough guess. Very rough guess. So, okay, let's jump at 30 years. We now live in the landscape where this technology has been advanced to the point where the replicants are indistinguishable from that, which is replicated. Their identities are identical to the identities that they replicated. What does that world look like? It's going to be very different from now, especially because of the potential for misinformation. I was talking with a lot of people and this notion of high trust regions on the internet and low trust regions seems to come up where there's some areas you could browse that are very, all the media there, whether audio or visual or video media, it's going to be verified in some way, either from the source or some sort of watermark in the media itself. And then that, you know, you could trust this sort of media. The vast majority of online will be some untrustworthy region where you could have, there'll be videos of you saying and doing whatever and people will just assume it's fake. Okay, so it's sort of like the blue check mark on Twitter. There's going to be some universal verification. That's the implant. We're going to have to get a fucking implant. It's finally, the next thing is you're going to have to get some weird implant that interacts with something on digital cameras so that it's you. I mean, I think that this low trust, high trust zone thing makes a lot of sense. Some kind of like non compulsory, but definitely it's worth thumb printing yourself or whatever. So people know that they've got the real you. Let's talk about though what we can expect in the next 10 years from this technology. What do you think? Some example use case would be maybe there's a foreign film and you want to dub it in a different language. You can instantly do that with the voice of the actor speaking a different language. That's amazing. That's incredible, man. Yeah, I could see all the positive aspects of it and the sort of mundane shit that people will use it for that's definitely going to revolutionize a lot of different industries. Even podcasting, I was thinking like, my God, if I particularly lazy and didn't want to read an ad, I could just get my bot, I could just type it up and the bot does the ad. And then not only that, if I wanted to, I could type up my podcast intro and the bot does the podcast intro. These are things that are actually really useful in a lot of entertainment. A lot of aspects of entertainment for sure. Also, like the ability to, this is a question I had. How, I saw that y'all figured out a way to grab Rogans. What, do you have a name for the vocal thumb print? What do you call that, the personality of the voice or whatever, do you have a name for that? What do you mean by that? So, you take a person's voice, you take my voice and within it is all of my many speech impediments, stutters, slurs, shrieks, guttural, whatever's that vary over time, somehow compacted in. Do you have a name for that or is it just a person's voice? Your thing? You know, there's a technical term for it, that I don't think it's helpful, but it's because like these sort of techniques are very, there's inputs, there's the AI and there's outputs. And the AI, all the internal workings in the middle is where all the magic stuff happens. So, where it learns the intricacies of your voice. And then you get prod inside that AI to pick some pieces out, but it's not like this manual process where we're learning these sort of stutters or stuff like that. Right, I got you. What's the technical term? It's like an embedding. Okay, so yes, we need a better cooler term for that. It's like some kind of like vocal DNA or some shit, your voice genome or whatever, I don't know what it is, but that's your voice. So, you could take that, you could convert it into any language in the world that you wanna convert it into, but can you change it's mood? Can you tell it to be excited? Okay, so you come up with basically shades of personality. So, depending on the thing you're getting it to read, you could say, read it like he's happy, read it like he's depressed, read it like he's... We've actually done that already. Like we have some examples of him saying the same thing, but angrily or happily. That is fucking crazy. That's crazy, man. And how granular is that? Is do you have kind of happy, maximum happy? You have sliders, you have mood sliders. You have mood sliders? Yeah. Holy shit, man. That is so fucking crazy. Wow. Okay, so then once we get an AI that can duplicate the personality and not just the vocal DNA, then we'll have sliders for intelligence. You could, this is why I'm excited is it's like theoretically, now this is all theoretical. Because I was thinking in terms of therapy. Like imagine going in to get therapy, this AI scans you and shows you what you would look like if you weren't fucking depressed. Like you see a non-depressed version of you and that becomes your therapist. You could literally talk to a version of you that is balanced. Hey, what would I be like if I didn't have like 16 addresses when I was growing up? What would I look like if that fucked up shit didn't happen to me in the fourth grade? What would I be like? And you could, that's what to me is the field of psychology. Just, you know, they talk about mirror neurons. You get, and I know when I get around funny people, I become funnier. But what happens when you get around funnier versions of yourself and you get to see yourself doing shit? Would you learn faster from yourself? You know what I mean by like watching yourself and like, oh, that's what I would do. Have you thought about these applications of it? No, I didn't think of that one, but it's fascinating. I think maybe it's something about podcasters, but I think I noticed you in particular in the conversations or people that are super open-minded, they come up with these examples very easily. It seems like, whereas people that work on these sort of problems, they don't come up with these examples as easily. All right. Well, I see that, yeah. Cause y'all are deep in the thick of the, I know man, once you have to be, you've got to narrow the beam, so to speak, and just get the main groundwork done so that people can throw in this stuff. That's cool. Well, I mean, this to me is like the terrifying quality of it is that what is more seductive to you than you? You know, and then like, what does that do to a person who has become really fixated on themselves as being this identity when another thing starts arguing with them that they're not really the real thing? That's where the whole course could be inverted. You know, suddenly, theoretically, we couldn't enhance intelligence via AI, which I think we will definitely be able to at least pair it what you might look like if you were smarter by, you know, adding more words to your lexicon, for example. Right? Like, you know, the AI could probably, by scanning millions of hours or how many hours you're out there, tell, no, get a pretty good account of how many words, you know, and then it could add to it better words. Think of the, just applying a thesaurus to you talking. So you're like, all right, let's like add like, much smarter words and remove the fucking likes, please, and all the fucking, refine me six degrees, please. And make me, you know, all that kind of thing where suddenly you get to see yourself using bigger words, better words, and being more refined in the way you speak. I think that could be done without an AI, you know, or without the AI we're talking about, you know? Yeah, going back to the therapist thing, I can imagine if you wanted to convince somebody of something, talking to a smarter version of yourself, and they're trying to convince you of something, and they know how to convince you because they know what you think, and they're thinking a thousand times faster. Yeah. And they can come up with these strategies on how to convince you. Yeah. You can pretty much change someone's mind to do anything, I think. Anything. It reminds me of like, I mean, you know, to get real, let's get McKenna for a second, and imagine that we are living in a technological hive of super advanced primates who are in the process of converting the hive, or have, or converting the hive into some kind of technologically enhanced cyborg, super complexified yet hyper-organized biosphere, a place where we're all living together, we're all super, we're all completely connected. This is a hive, four and a hive. And so traditionally, the queen bee releases pheromones, the pheromones make the workers act a certain way, send out the sort of psychotropic pulsations within which the hive functions and understands how to function. And in the past, it seems like those signals have been sent out originally using just like town criers and shit, you know, and like newspapers and then radio and then, of course, TV and now the internet. But the fundamental sort of thing that connects all those various degrees of communications technology is that the source is trusted. And you believe the source is some authority. And, you know, you disrupt that piece of the process and you have to cause hive collapse. You have to cause a kind of like suddenly of a super fragmentation of the hive in the sense that people will have to cluster together in groups of physical, in packing of physical groups because nothing on your phone's fucking real anymore. It's all completely kaleidoscoped into absurdity. That's why I compare it to the nuclear bomb because we've grown so accustomed to this mode of communication. And specifically to trusting the person you're talking to that you remove that and now, man, I don't know. Do you feel a little like shit? Maybe I shouldn't be fucking with this shit. One of the goals of that project was to let people know that it's coming. Ah, cool. Yeah, we didn't release the technical details to accelerate the progress of other people being able to do that. And one question we had is like, should we even release a data set? Because even though we took it from the podcast, there's still a lot of work that went into curating that data set for this problem. And we decided not to do that as well. That was very cool of you not to do that, man. That was very cool. One requirement if we would ever release it is Joe would have to at least put his stamp of approval on it because it's kind of messed up if you release some, because now people could maybe do something bad to him. Yeah, that's right. Well, yeah, I mean, but you know, it's good that you're sending out the warning because yeah, you're not gonna release the data set. And right now that data sets, how big was it? How big is that data set? For Joe Rogan, specifically we used eight hours because we thought we don't know how much data we're gonna need. So let's just put a lot of data and then we don't have to worry about that problem of working with a small data set. But 30 minutes was enough for other voices. Yeah, well, you guys have that data set and you guys are gonna hang on to it right now, but it doesn't matter because like everything this technology is desirable. People are gonna want it, they're gonna want it for a lot of different fucking crazy reasons. And that means it's gonna become increasingly easy to obtain and eventually it's gonna be a button press. You don't even, it's like gonna be like a Google. You just put a person's name in there, the fucking bot scans, grabs what it needs to grab, interpolates the fucking data and suddenly they're dancing right in front of you is whoever the fuck you want. For me, Nancy Grace. I want a little Nancy Grace living on my computer. It'd be so fun to have a little Nancy Grace you can talk to, it's pissed at you all the time. Let me the fuck out of here, just delete me. This is illegal, you know? Not even to mention that, but like being able, like think of Grand Theft Auto. Only now it's populated by all your friends. It's taken this technology, it's emulated the voices of 50 people in your phone or that you know or that you want in there. And now you've personalized the video game experience. If you thought about this, just the application in video games. Yeah, going back to that conversational bot idea of being able to talk to somebody, if that was in a video game, that would be crazy. Especially in a VR game where you talk to somebody and they're talking back to you in some specific voice and the conversation flows like a real conversation. Yeah. That's the next, yeah, that's the next thing for sure. But then also, have you guys looked into ownership rights? Like that data set of Rogan, that's not your property, right? Essentially he's got that IP on that, right? Yeah, I don't think the law is that far ahead where I don't think it even anticipated the sort of stuff happening. But I think now Congress is starting to look at this, this sort of technology and start, they're starting to make laws for it now. What are the laws? Just you can't, you have a fundamental right to your personality or something? I think it is the case where you do own your personality or something like that. But the complexity is, because remember that thing of the slider that I mentioned before? What if I take the voice but I just slide it in different dimensions in different ways? And how much should I slide it where it doesn't become you anymore but people think it's you? For example, I'm sure there are people that sound like you or look like you, but they're not infringing on your IP or your personality. Brad Pitt stole my whole shit, man. He stole my whole personality. Exactly, but you can't sue Brad Pitt because it's, you know. Right, that's it. Yeah, well, I mean, that's what I'm saying. Whatever legal protections people desperately try to assign to control this technology gives a fuck. Go ahead, do your stupid legal shit. I don't care. I'm hanging out with fucking Tucker Carlson in a VR BDSM dungeon, just having a blast and there's nothing you can do about it. To me, that's the main thing is it's like, look, go ahead. Make it so that the publication of the bots or whatever you want to call them, the golems, the replicants is illegal without permission. But still the underground of these things already exists, right? What's it called a deep fake porn? Is that what it's called? It's already there. Have you ever fucked around with any of that stuff? One continuation of this project we were thinking about is doing it, like adding the visual aspect of the audio and visual and combining those two things. Yeah, that's the next step and you guys have to do that. And to me, the deep fake porn shit is so, that's like, I think in the future that making a deep fake of someone fucking is gonna be placed in some kind of category like rape, like they're gonna say that it's just as bad, that it's a form of sexual assault, right? I wonder, it seems like a lot of people are uploading them like anonymously or something, where it's sort of hard to get them. Well, yeah, I mean, hopefully it's gonna land in the same like region as like child pornography or something that you just, you can't do it. But then that being said, how do you know it is a deep fake and not a deep fake? Well, it's what you're thinking about. It just, there isn't going to, it just feels like this is the media, this is the like technological media or nobody, at least I didn't predict. And I cannot recall reading any of the theorists I love who predicted, oh, you see what's gonna happen as an apocalypse of a replication is what's gonna happen, is that kind of like fun house circus, but circus fun house with warped mirrors of everyone infinitely replicating to the point where they're kind of madness that's in over the planet and people either abandon technology or just go insane. That deep fake community is interesting because that's an example where people released everything. The code is there and they made it easy for people that are not programmers to use as well. And they also curated data sets of people already. We saw what happened with that kind of deep fake, but it turned out that audio deep fakes were a lot harder. So that was just behind the curve a bit. Oh, fuck. Video deep fakes were the hard part? That's- Yeah, harder than audio. Oh, okay, that makes sense. I understand. Okay, yeah, okay, okay. But they're both, so, all right. So now, what would you do? You're gonna be remembered as one of the people in the beginning of this technology. You did a huge thing that went viral, went everywhere. Everyone freaked the fuck out. I'm probably not even talking to you. You're probably, I did it myself or something. I'm talking to you. And a weird underground fucker. But what would you do if all of a sudden you got, I don't know, an email with a video of your mom in it that is identical to your mom and she's begging for your help. She's like, fuck you, the shit they're doing to me. You gotta stop, you gotta stop them. You know it's a deep fake, but you all said they're holding your mom's deep fake hostage. Do you know what I'm saying? What would you, how would you react to that? I think it goes back to, in the future, we'd have to deal with media differently. There's that high trust and low trust stuff where you just automatically dismiss that stuff as fake. And I think maybe in the future we'll be acclimated. Maybe that's the next level of desensitization where we just get used to all this fake stuff happening and maybe we just ignore it unless we're morbidly curious. Okay, yeah, that's pretty cool. It's like we're still just in the embryonic phases of learning how to use the internet. We've shocked to realize that sometimes the stuff people put online is not only not the truth, but intentionally not the truth with political designs behind it. We're still, I'm sure in 10 years that's just gonna seem like, ah, of course people would do that. Of course people would try to control elections. Of course people would try to create chaos. Of course people would try to, you know, ferment stupid, ferment, you know, try to make political movements happen in different countries, but the road to get to that place, that's what I'm worried about. I'm worried about the in-between of now and that moment where people are like, oh yeah, whatever, it's just another video of a donkey fucking my mom while my brother eats her asshole and a fucking raven finds my mother. Fine out. You know what I mean? Like I don't wanna look at that shit, man. I don't wanna deal with that. You know, I don't wanna deal with like, what, think of stalking. Just think of stalking, dude. You're gonna get stalked by yourself. Somebody, you know what I mean? Like yourself fucking calling you and telling you to fuck off. You know, just someone using your technology like that or just think of the fucking mall, man, or going to buy shit. And it already knows you're coming in because you agreed to something, you weren't paying attention when you got that app and you walk in. And it's just versions of you wearing every item of clothing in the store. I don't know why I think that's sinister. It's just weird. I think in the future they're gonna have cameras. Well, they already do have cameras everywhere, but I mean, when you walk into a mall, it's gonna recognize your face and it's gonna track you everywhere. As granular as the data you could think of, they're probably gonna have it in the future. So they're gonna track you everywhere and see what you're looking at just from video and then have this profile of you. So yeah, that's a whole nother area where this stuff is gonna be applied. And then the next area of it is a form of weird kind of slavery because it's like, okay, I've grabbed the deep fake you, I've got the data set, it's a perfect data set, it's perfectly replicating you. So I'm gonna put you to work now in my fucking cubicle farm where you're gonna be making sales calls for me. It's that's the golem replicant version of us put to work in some global office setting, doing shit we don't wanna do that we might never even hear about, man. What about that? Have you thought about that digital enslavement? So a lot of people actually approached us with that idea, wanting to collaborate to build that out. Yeah, so there are people that are trying to make that happen right now. There are people who are trying to make like essentially, I get the phone call from the bot and saying I've won a cruise or whatever. They're trying to turn that into like deep fakes of people. So it's like Rogan calls you up. Yeah, but I mean, I don't think they might not necessarily marketize that, they might say, oh, we could have Duncan Trussell do a commercial, but we don't need you to actually be there kind of thing. But it's the same idea, I think. Wow, fuck. What else have we agreed to? I just keep thinking of every single terms of service that I agreed to, that I didn't read. Have you thought about this at all? Yeah, it's definitely like, it's gonna be so different in the future and maybe in the near future. It seems like it's just gonna go, but it's like the only thing that's gonna become valuable anymore is real interaction with people. That would be nice. Yeah, that would be nice. That to me is like the hope behind it all is suddenly live shows are gonna be very special and meeting a person in the flesh is gonna be special. But then come on, surely you've thought about robots. You know, you've thought about that, right? The potential of Android replicants, Blade Runner style replicants of people. I mean, if you can do the shit with video and you can do this with audio, all you gotta then do, I guess, is figure out a way to map the video to some, I don't know, mask, right? And now we've got a 3D version of a person. Right, it's like basically the premise of Westworld is not perfect. And you're right there, man. You're one of a triad of guys who are ushering in the techno apocalypse. What have you done, what are you doing, guys? You have to stop this work. You have to stop. What are you working on right now? If you can talk. Yeah, yeah. I've always wanted to start at my own company. And after this project, I got a lot of attention. And previously, a lot of our clients were financial institutions. And I sort of wanted to explore having, working outside of the financial industry and just having AI that could benefit us in different ways, like for examples in trains, you could take images of a train as it's going by. And AI could do that. And it could prevent a derailment. It could say, oh, you need to check this right now or else the train is gonna, yeah, so that could help save lives. And a lot of money for the train companies. So there's a lot of examples like that. Yeah, well, I heard about, God, I can't remember what it's called, some kind of blimp technology or some kind of crazy observation drone that they've developed as, it's using such hardcore technology that it can like zoom in to someone's, just zoom right into somebody, even from almost from like space or whatever. And then the AI can watch what's happening. And now you basically have some kind of like panopticon where an AI is observing and seeing patterns, recognizing the patterns and then use predictive technology to determine when shit's about to happen, train derails, derailments and such, right? Like theoretically, this could just be a, some kind of observation drone that's spinning. And then whoever wants their shit monitored by this technology could just sign up, right? Like your crops, for example, your area around your house. I can imagine the deciding they want these drones to do some behavioral analysis to make sure nobody's doing anything weird, like maybe an active shooter or like somebody dropping a bag somewhere and then running away or leaving a bag somewhere. Yeah, or spray painting or like, and then also, man, think of this aspect, just like, I don't know, I'm like doing a new ad campaign for whatever my brand is. And I bought a billboard somewhere, a thing near a sidewalk. I could actually get the data on how long people are looking at it. How are people interacting with it? Is how effective is that particular campaign? And I could buy into whatever this observation drone is and just ask for that specific GPS coordinate to be monitored and from that, gather some grotesque metric regarding how long people stare at my stupid billboard, right? Like that's what you could do. Some interesting stuff there too is you could predict who's coming by or track who's coming by. And you say, this person will be interested in your product and there's a lot of people buying for that ad space at like a digital billboard. There's an optimization thing going on as well where it's like, okay, this group of people walking by will likely convert with this sort of product and then we'll charge them this sort of price for this plot at this time space. Holy shit, that's crazy, man. It could even theoretically, oh, it gives a rainy day. It's a rainy day. So let's pop up our rainy day ad instead of our sunny day ad or something bad has happened. Flags are flying at half mask. Don't like a upbeat one. Let's do just to show our logo or some shit like that or like this kind of haircut is becoming fashionable. Okay, let's just shift all the haircuts of our AI models to match this or even, oh, fuck. What about the ones that just scan who's coming in and tries to make the thing that's advertising look a little bit more like them? You know, mirror them in some subtle way. And maybe with AR, it could be customized to the person itself. Right, you could ask for it, you mean. You mean, wow, man. You have really gotten involved in some bad ass technology. It's so cool. And that was actually never the intention. Like it was literally the simple idea of can we get Terrence McKenna on the JRE? That was literally it. And we didn't expect anything to happen. Terrence McKenna would be grinning ear to ear to know that that is what gave you guys the inspiration to do that. It's a beautiful thing, I guess. I mean, I suppose we just have to let go of all our attachments to the way the world used to be and sort of plunge into this strange new landscape. Sometimes I look back, if you don't mind my asking, how old are you? 26. Okay, see, I look back to the 80s. MTV was still fucking cool. People were leaving messages on answering machines. And there was no way someone's getting in touch with you if you're not home. You know, like you're just, you're roaming out in the world. You're not getting tracked or watched or monitored. And I think back to those days versus these days and the sort of exponential increase in complexity to say the least. And I think this landscape that we're in right now is unrecognizable. I think it's that world that I came out of is, that's a different world. That world's long gone. That was an empty, free world where you didn't have a online identity at all. You barely had an identity, you know what I mean? You were just watching a few channels and that's it. Yeah, I don't know. Happiness. What's that? Like, what are your thoughts on that for what it meant to be human in terms of their experience through life and how, like their quality of life? Yeah. I had a professor who is one of the smartest guys I know and he said this statement to be controversial, but there's some truth into it. He said that cities are a mistake. But the technology is not there yet where we could support the positive things from a city with the benefits of that village lifestyle. If you can have sort of the best of both worlds. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think you're, that's a smart guy. And I think you would be a bit of a fool to not admit that something that was crucial to human civilization, which was just basic human interaction in the flesh, is becoming something that's considered old fashioned. You know, just like hanging out with a baby or raising a baby, not sending the baby to daycare. One of the parents having time to be with a baby. These things are outdated, modalities. So if happiness, which it must, has some connection to basic human interaction. And not just that, but human interaction over time, right? Like it's like, we are learning how to communicate via texts, emoticons, whatever or the phone has to offer. But the other shit, like learning what it's just like hang out with your friends every day in the flesh and all the like nuance that goes into three dimensional human interactions. People are like getting a little rusty when it comes to how to do that, depending on how much they get out. And if they do get out, usually, what is the main way people are interacting these days? Transactionally at their jobs. The recreational moment hanging out in the flesh for fun thing is happening online. Fortnite, whatever, you know, it's happening online. So that's, I think, maybe why you go to a public place and sometimes you might get this sense of like, geez, people seem like awkward or something. You know, a little kind of like, they're not quite sure what to do with do because they're together in the flesh. So what do they do to not deal with the fact that they've grown rusty at making eye contact? They look at their fucking phone, right? They go into their phones while they're out in public because they're dealing with like an unknown or a thing they're not that great at versus a known thing, something more controllable. So, yeah, I don't know what that's doing for happiness. I don't know if it's necessarily, I don't know, man. I don't know, because I love it too. Right, that's an interesting thing that you mentioned. I didn't connect that with the people that go to their jobs. And it's not like a candid form of communication because in my old job, a lot of our clients were big corporations. So I would go into these big companies and talk to people and sort of observe that the dynamics in a big corporation. And sometimes it's not the most candid or definitely a different dynamic than maybe your friends or something. So if a large majority of your time is spent in that sort of environment, and then the rest of it is online, and I noticed even like when people are taking public commute or something, it's always on their phone. So there's almost zero time where we didn't have any of those distractions or any of those. It's almost like there's zero percentage of our time that's spent in the old way of doing things. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, we're losing that, that's gonna go away. And so I could see maybe there is some usefulness and just a signal jamming the whole fucking thing by like irreversible AI clone swarms of yourself flying around. So it's just like, fuck it, we can't use the technology anymore. It's imitated us into oblivion, so to speak. And then we get to be with people again, I guess. There's something nice about that, but I mean, what do you think happiness is? How do you define happiness? Oh man, I don't think I'm qualified to even try to answer that question. But I do listen to a lot of people that talk about it online. Yeah. I'm noticing at least for me, there are certain people that I think are good models. For example, it's funny because listening to the Geraldine podcast so much, it feels like a lot of the guests there are my friends because I've listened to them in conversation, it's almost like I'm there. And certain people, I think they have a good idea of having this sort of being a person where they build a community around them and they're giving to that community. So I think a really good example is Kevin Hart. He was describing about how he gives back in all the ways he does and how he's accumulated so much that it's more than he could ever consume for himself. And because of that, there's an overflow of positivity that is just everybody around him receives that as well. And I think that gives you exponentially more happiness than anything else I can imagine. You mean generosity becoming generous. Yeah, yeah, but not everybody can be a Kevin Hart because it's like he did something so right in a way that he was able to get that position. Well, I mean, I think be suspicious of anyone who says they have an answer for how to be happy. The definition is who the fuck even knows what it means. There could be a million definitions for happiness all together. You know, I have fallen in step with like a teacher called Chogim Churamparampashe and I'm really into sort of his concept of truth. You know, like happiness comes, happiness goes, sorrow comes, sorrow goes. These are changing, these change throughout the day. You might be happy now, you're not gonna be happy in a few hours, you're gonna be happy again, but the place is in between happiness. Those are very interesting because I think if you could find a way to just accept that those are happening too, then happiness almost becomes a secondary thought. We don't need to be happy anymore because we're here with what it is as it is. Also, happiness is a fucking like, goddamn, it's like paint by numbers, right? It's like this broad, huge category that forces you to sort of come, you know, turn your entire human experience into one button, you know? Like a I smiley face button, where it's like so many moments throughout the day, there's some happiness, there's some misery, there's some anxiety, there's some boredom, there's some confusion, there's some like weird shit, you don't even know what you would call it. You know what I mean? Some like fugue state, some deja vu, who knows? And then you come up to someone and you're like, are you having a good time? And all they can do is like, yeah, I'm happy, it's cool. But it's like, you know, it's like a really, you know, something's fucked up when emoticons become more expressive than just general human communication. You know, like, there's emoticons that show simultaneously feeling shy and happy or, you know, at least they combine various things, direct human communication has limited us to a pretty brutal binary, happy, sad. You know what I mean? I love not being hung up on whether I'm happy or not anymore. You know what I mean? That's a fun thing. The next time you find yourself in a real shit mood, instead of thinking to yourself, boy, I should change this. See what happens if you're just like, okay, I'm in a shit mood. You know, you know what I mean? Like where it's like, I'm not gonna try to get better. I'm not gonna try to do breath work. I'm not gonna try to like do anything. I'm just in a shit mood right now. And then for me, that's really been a pretty liberating experience and paradoxically, I think makes me way more happy. Anyway, this conversation with you has been fucking mind blowing, man. I'm so excited to imagine that people who have your brain are being inspired by Terrence McKenna. Do you find out there in your world, in your career path and the industry that you're in that Psyconauts abound, that Ford thinking philosophically minded, artistic people are everywhere out there? Yeah, there's definitely some of them. I mean, there's stereotypes, but there's definitely other people. I think you can find these groups of people and definitely in tech and the software and the AI. Is there a general sense that you get out there of a kind of like ambition, an unspoken desire to not just produce these technologies for a financial gain but to like guide humanity or to sort of create changes, intentional changes in the way we go about our day-to-day lives? I think that's definitely one of the more rare motivations. The motivation I've come across a lot is wanting to solve specific problems just because it's challenging. So it's like this sort of game that we fall into where we just stumble across this sort of technology and we get deeper and deeper into it and we're thinking, hey, can I push the limits this way? And then there's all these challenges that come with it and we're thinking of the level of how do I solve these specific challenges to make this algorithm do this specific thing? And I've come across that, that's the most common thing I've come across where people just love the challenge of solving these specific problems and they wanna be very good at it. I haven't come across that big motivation thing where they wanna change the world with AI. Typically, I think typically when I see those people, they're usually not the people that are making the algorithms. Here's my last question for you. When I was reading Nick Bostrom's book, Super Intelligence, have you read that book? I haven't, no. It's great, you would love it. It's dense, it was too dense for me. You will be able to cut through it like that. For me, it was like it's very technological at places, but basically he's mapping out if there's gonna be a super intelligence. Here's the pathways to that super intelligence. And one of the points he makes, which is a really good point, is that when the super intelligence emerges, whatever corporation has, however you wanna put it, summon the super intelligence, or I don't know, generated it or whatever it is, is going to have an exponential head start. No one, theoretically no one will be able to catch up with because the super intelligence start improving upon itself. And also there's no reason that any corporation who gains this type of power is going to announce that it did it. So we won't even know it's happened when it's happened. Have you contemplated this point that potentially in AI is already kind of running the show, but you still don't know it? I didn't consider it just because I didn't think it was possible yet. And I didn't read Nick Boschram's book, but I did read Life 3.0 by Tegmark. And he covers a lot of the similar topics. And I found it interesting when you were talking about creating a better version of people. When you were on the JR, you were saying, at Joe Rogan, that's 50 times better than Joe Rogan. Yeah, and that was one of the premises of the book where the small team created a super intelligence. And they're thinking, how do we take over the world now? And their idea was, let's start a media company. And with this media company, we could capture or captivate people, and it will make it like tailored to each person viewing it. And they go somewhat under the radar of controlling people's ideas, but in a subtle way, where they're just watching a movie or watching this sort of show. And so the way they would do it would be in a way where you wouldn't know it's happening. And eventually, they get so powerful because of the revenue they have, and because it's a media company, they would have news outlets. And they would have so much money that they would be influencing policy and government eventually. And when they did take over the world, it's almost like it's too late when you realize it. Yeah, yeah. Well, I'm sorry, this just made me think of something else. Do you have a few more moments? Of course. OK, so this is where this conversation goes into the occult, goes into mysticism. Because the Gnostic idea about Gnosticism, I feel like you sort of got Joe to say some shit about how he was like a slave. You know what I mean? Yeah. You know about Gnosticism? I don't, no. Well, it's like there's a great book by Jaron Lanier called The Dawn of the New Everything. And I don't know if he specifically mentions Gnosticism, but he mentions B.F. Skinner, and he mentions the manipulative algorithms that keep people glued to their phones. And B.F. Skinner being this behavior, you know B.F. Skinner? Well, for people who don't know, B.F. Skinner is he was a behavioral psychologist who was the guy who programmed pigeons using these things called Skinner boxes. And he, I believe, was the one who came up with the term operant conditioning, methods that you can use to make something that's alive and has like food motivation do what you want using food. And so he got really good at controlling pigeons, man. He got really good at controlling creatures. And his idea was if I can like, if I have control of every variable in a thing's environment, I can just about make it do anything I want, you know? And so this is like where you jump into more universal questions. The first thing, it's like, OK, we know this planet has life on it. So this planet has life on it. It implies probably there's life somewhere in other planets. If we find another place that for sure wasn't like somehow that it was an Earth-based life that made it to Mars and some solar explosion or whatever, if we find true alien life somewhere else, then you could say with 100% certainty, your certainty of life on other planets goes up. Way more in that case, right? And so now we've got life on a planet that's barely been around based on geological time. It's already hit the point technologically where it's replicating itself. It's already hitting the point technologically where it's like creating versions of itself and also hitting the point technologically where it's manipulating its own species, hacking their brains, so to speak, using algorithms that grab their attention. And now it's using AI to do that very same thing. So anyway, this is where you run into the whole simulation theory idea, which is like, you think this is the first time it's happened? You think this is the first time in all of time space that civilization did this shit? And then if it can be done, who's to say it isn't already being done on us right now? The thing we call planet Earth, the thing we call nature, the thing we call experience or sentience is just what it is to be glued to an environment produced by an advanced technology that has caught our attention and keeps us completely locked down like a cat chasing a laser pointer. You know what I mean? So have you ever thought about that, that in fact, you're just what y'all are doing, what you did with Rogan? It's just a kind of echo of a thing that keeps getting done over and over and over again. Whenever there's a specific type of civilization that forms, you're just echoing a cosmic predicament. Right, so one requirement to create a simulation would be to be able to program something as complex as a human. So that's definitely one of the steps forward. I mean, if you could program a human or something as complex as we know, then we know we're one step closer to being able to create a simulation. In that sense, I think we're closer to that. And one quick thing that was sort of funny, which on that clip, I did reference this sort of simulation, that was actually a true story. So I was actually at the comedy store on Thanksgiving weekend and some guy came up to Joe Rogan saying it was a simulation. Yeah, it was a little Easter egg for people that were there. Wow, holy fucking shit. Y'all are the best. I hope everybody out there in your field they're as cool as you are, man, because that means we have some good stuff in store for us and not just the creepy, demonic medical marijuana edible universe that my mind keeps prognosticating when I think about the implications of this technology. I've really enjoyed talking with you, man. I hope you'll let me use this for the podcast. I know we started off saying it was just gonna be a Skype call. Well, yeah, it's been amazing talking to you as well. It's not me. It's not me. Listen, I haven't existed for a long time. You're talking to just AI and DARPA.

Harry Krishna, God bless you. And get into jogging. It really does make you feel better. It's a hell of a lot better than Percocet. Hello, friends and family. And thank you for tuning into the Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour podcast. We are broadcasting from our new studio, located at the Los Angeles branch of Monsanto, which is letting us record this podcast now from their incredibly beautiful office complex, which is located underground in downtown Los Angeles. You guys, I'm not allowed to film any of this place. I wish I could. I wish you could see it. It's one of the most innovative, high-tech office buildings that exists in the world today. They don't have regular hallways that you walk down. Their hallways are fluid-filled canals. You see the executives of Monsanto are a species that is much older than human beings. And it is because of their mastery of genetics that we exist today. These beings, they're responsible for every great innovation that's happened throughout society. The way they describe it is that they have blown their life air into the sails of the destiny of humanity. And we are partially theirs. And it's not a slavery thing. They love us very much. And they want us to be happy. But some of these beings, they prefer to swim. It is the sexual fluid of the frightened that the shape-shifting Monsanto executives love to swim in when they've transformed into their lizard forms. It's lots of fun. A ferryman takes me to my studio. And I'm recording here now. From what they call the Chamber of Dreams, it's an incredible, beautiful room with stained glass windows all along the walls that show the history of Monsanto and our species and the way that in that dark primordial past when we are nothing more than hooting hunter-gatherers lost in a dangerous world, our merciful fathers came and transformed our primitive genetics into something we can now be proud of. Monsanto genetics, the genetics of humanity, and our sweet friends could have stopped there, but they didn't. Now they are altering the genetics of our boring old grains and vegetables. Yes, the fields of our future are going to be fields of freedom. And these freedom fields are filled with some of the most advanced, genetically modified fruits and vegetables that the world has ever seen. Designer vegetables created by our friends at Monsanto. Now a word from our sponsors. Hi, all. Welcome to Celebrity Corner. It's me, Natasha Leggero, from Chelsea Lately and Burning Love. When interviewers ask me what my favorite thing is about being a celebrity, I always tell them it's not the glamor, cash, or thrills, though I do love those things. It's the food. You heard me right. My favorite thing about being a highly paid comedic actor in Hollywood is the delicious food they feed me in between takes of the many hit shows I've been a part of. And the reason why is Monsanto. Monsanto is a farmer-friendly company that genetically modifies the vegetables and grains that feed the most beautiful people in the world, Hollywood actors. On every Hollywood set during lunch, dinner, breakfast, or snack time, you can be sure that all the famous beautiful actors are chomping on some of the delicious, genetically modified foods fabricated by the genius scientists at Monsanto. Hollywood actors like me just can't get enough of these delicious Monsanto products. We love the way it feels as our teeth grind and crush the food while our celebrity saliva mixes in with the pulp. We love swallowing the mass-tocated food and feeling the way it moves down our esophagus and into our stomachs. We love the way our stomachs produce acids that dissolve the food and push it to our bloodstreams. We love merging with genetically modified food at the quantum level. It is our way. Bottom line, the world is changing, and successful, beautiful people like me have surrendered to the flow. We have merged with the first fruits of the dawning age, a glorious age where the fundamental components of nutrition have been improved by the farmer-friendly scientist at Monsanto. So do the right thing and buy genetically modified foods from your favorite local delicatans and eateries. Be like Hollywood celebrities and eat Monsanto. It's the only choice. That was Natasha Legerro. You could check her out at natashalagerro.com. Today's guest is making his third appearance on the Ducket Trussell Family Hour podcast. This son of a bitch is about to have his own show following Conan O'Brien. His name's Pete Holmes. So everybody please blast this sweet man with your psychic tendrils. And after you listen to him here, why not go check him out on his own podcast? You made it weird. Which is available on iTunes. Please, now, close your eyes, squeeze those eyelids tight, grit your teeth, and spray of psychic snot deep into this man's glory hole. Let him feel it, guys. Welcome, Pete Holmes to the Ducket Trussell Family Hour podcast. All hail Monsanto. We bow down to our reptilian fathers. If you are struggling, be well worth it. Welcome upon you. Sp dwell your shame and glory to the blue. Welcome to you. It's the Ducket Trussell Family Hour. Ducket Trussell, Ducky, Ducky you. Why wasn't I rolling? It was the best way to start. You guys just missed the year's best gluten joke. Check your gluten at the door. Bitch! We're eating gluten free cookies because we learned that gluten is bad for you. Well, I learned that. Yeah, gluten is the... Just now. As far as food products go, it's the Satan of food. It's the Bin Laden of food products. Really? The Bin Laden of food products. I don't know. I eat this shit all the time. We trained it. I don't know. I don't want to get started on that. I am not the authority. Talk to Joe Rogan about that. We trained it. We trained gluten. You subversive son of a bitch. You didn't feel that, Colin. Can I ask you something? Do you like flying to your shows? Because if you do, stop the Bin Laden jokes. What do you mean? They'll fucking take your flight status away. It's the new form of banishment. What do you mean? Well, in the old days, if you upset the... Yeah, the order. The order. The order. They would either execute you or imprison you. But now they just make it so you can't fly. So you're saying, what about Joe Rogan? He talks about that. Sorry, everybody. I'm talking with my mouth open. Full. Open and full. What about Joe Rogan? He makes a lot of jokes like that, like 9-11 jokes and conspiracy jokes. You know, I'm just probably... Probably overreacting. ...way by like five trillion light years. But you know, the creepy thing... By the way, I guess I did an intro. This is Pete Holmes. Hi, everybody. Back on the Duckatrustle family hour. It's great to be in the family. The scary thing is just that they can do it, if they want to. Yeah, you know, it's funny, as much as I enjoy conspiracies and all that sort of stuff, I really kind of check out when people are like, they're building these camps and they're going to put all the Occupy Wall Street people in them. And I'm like, is that really...? It's the FEMA camps. Is that what it is? I guess I should talk to you about it. Well, yeah, that's a really wonderful conspiracy theory, man. And it's one of my faves. Really? Yeah, but basically the idea is there's like... Man, I can't be specific on a side note. I can't be specific about this, but I've been doing this show with Rogan. He's got this new show on Sci-Fi, which is called Joe Rogan Questions Everything. And it's just basically, you know, about conspiracies. And you get to be around... You get to be around a lot of the people who really believe some of this stuff. One thing I'm taking away from it is how absolutely intoxicating to some people these things are and how easily you can get drawn in. Well, it's funny that you say that because that's what I've been thinking about mostly. And it's less interesting than me to conspiracies is the idea of the human brain and like how we want to believe some things, how certain types of... I'll just speak for myself. I'm a I want to believe things guy. And so this is what's happened. I went to my chiropractor, and I don't want to be too disparaging to my chiropractor, but he's a Scientologist, and I think... What, got closer? Yeah, sorry. I got to get better minds. That's fine. He's a Scientologist? Yeah, no, he's a Scientologist, which I'm assuming is a Scientologist based on the literature in his waiting room and based on like some of his clientele. Now, I have no problem with that. There's no judgment or labeling there. But here's what I did learn about myself from this guy. I go in and he does this type of chiropractic where like he shows you, like lay on the table and bend your left knee and now raise your right arm. And now see how your right arm is strong and it'll push against it and you push against it and you see that you're strong. He's like, now put your knee down and I'm making this up by the way. This isn't the actual example. He's like, now straighten your knee and see how it goes weak and you do. You're like, oh my God. And he's like, that's because when you're walking, this knee bends, this arm has to compensate because that's how we balance when we're walking. So, okay, so what is that? We're at the beginning of kind of like a type of cult logic. And all cults, all of these people, fascinating, Joseph Smith, Elron Hubbard, these guys, I have actual real respect for anybody that can get a huge congregation of people to believe. And one of the things you do is you start with something true. And I honestly think that's what my chiropractor does. That's the key, yeah. You start with something intoxicating. People aren't, people are stupid, and I'm certainly stupid, but like a lot of people aren't that stupid. They need something to get them in the door. So this is kind of what I felt like was happening with my chiropractor. Now I could be wrong. This is my one subjective thing. He started with things that I was like, that's definitely true. When my left knee is bent, my right arm is strong. That's true. Then it gets, the first time I went, I said to him, I was like, that was like a magic show and I was the rabbit. It was one of the best experiences in my life. I was blown away. Yeah. He fucking blew me away, healed me of stuff like that. I was feeling that day like back pain, neck pain, headaches, went away. Real crazy shit. And I was like, you are amazing. I've had that happen with chiropractors, where the day of they fix. Amazing. Chronic problems. Chronic shit fixed right there. Now it comes back. Like it was a temporary fix. That's why you have to keep going. Yeah. But I was like really want, completely won over. Now, so okay. He's got a new disciple, right? Yeah. So this is like a little, a mini world of faith. And this is my new leader, my chiropractor, my magician chiropractor. Sure. Then I go again. And now he's doing like crazier stuff, weirder stuff, making weirder claims, just like the beginning of a cult. The Scientology thing is kind of unrelated maybe. You can read into it if you want. He's like, see when I pull your ear down, your penis goes into my mouth. I mean, sometimes I forget that you're such, like you're the most interesting guy I know. And I forget that you're hilarious. I know that's weird, but I think you'd rather be the most interesting person. And then I'm like, oh yeah, and Duncan's hilarious. But he is doing, he's kind of, once I was through the gate, I was like, this guy can do no wrong. And I kind of believe him on everything. But here's what I noticed. And this is me. This is my kind of failure. Was he was like, okay, I'm just going to use the same example because the point isn't, isn't it? He's like straight in your foot. And when you straighten your foot, see how your right arm goes weak. Yes. And then like he's like, and now I realize I lost track of what he was saying. And then I realized that like I could no longer, I realized I was participating. Meaning when I knew I was supposed to be stronger, I was acting that way. When I knew I was supposed to be weaker, I was acting that way. There you go. And then what I started to notice was when I was supposed to be stronger, he wasn't pushing as hard. This may just be with me. I'm not trying to drag him under the bus. But what I'm saying is I was like, oh, there are times when you go see how you're strong and I'm like, I don't push. He doesn't pull. But he goes, see how I can't pull you away. I'm like, you weren't, I didn't say that. A bigger man would be like, but you're not pulling. Right. You know what I mean? So that was just a little bit. But fuck that. Okay. What I mean is I don't want to throw him all away. I still go to him. I'm like, okay, some of the slide of hand stuff isn't really winning me over anymore. But the chiropractic adjustment and all that sort of stuff. But you wanted to please him. I did want to please him. I wanted it to be magic. You wanted him. It was more important to you. Yes. That you didn't get in a conflict situation with this guy and dispute what was happening than it was for the thing to be real. That's the sort of guy I am. I also want the magic of it to be real. I'm the kind of guy that wants to go into an unassuming chiropractic's office and I'm 34 years old, older than Jesus. I want to go in and I want to be introduced to something new. Now look at this. And believe it. Pete Holmes, you Pete Holmes, already in a small slight little way being warped into the paradigm of this guy that's not necessarily based on reality at all. And also you're not giving that guy any help by not disputing his shit. You're confirming ideas he has that might be completely wrong. You know what's weird though is I'm like, okay, this level of bullshit doesn't work on me. The pretend pulling doesn't work on me. But what terrifies me is there is a level of bullshit that would work on me. You just have to upgrade it. Or add acid to the mix. Seriously, add some nice fucking, add some LSD and Charles Manson to the mix. Yeah. Okay, let's talk about cults. That's what I'm talking about. This experience reminds me. Okay, so then I'm fascinated with the movie The Master. I love Paul Thomas Anderson. I'm wearing my There Will Be Blood t-shirt today. I love that movie. And this is what happened when I watched The Master. You've seen The Master? Oh, yes, I have. I was like, oh, I'm 100% more likely to become a Scientologist because I found the stuff that they did it so interesting. They're sitting across from each other, no blinking, answer these questions in a row. Like, let's get your subconscious talking instead of your ego. I'm going to insult you and you can't react. All that stuff just felt like improv games to me. Stuff that I already love, like little social experiments. So the movie, even though it clearly portrays L. Ron Hubbard, or the character in the film who's L. Ron Hubbard, as kind of like a Charlotte, as not kind of a charlatan, but as a guy who's making it up as he goes along, it ended up me being just a little bit more interested. I was like, what are people turning their backs on their families and society to join? Whether it's Jehovah's Witness, Christian scientists, Scientologists, there's something. What is the carrot on the stick that they're going after? So then I started reading this book called Inside Scientology. Love it. I've read it. Isn't it great? Great. Fucking blowing my dick off. I'm reading it. I wonder if you had the same experience, and I know I'm talking a lot, and I want to make this more of a dialogue. No, please. No, no, I love it. I love cult stuff, man. Me too. Here's my experience with that book, and then I want to hear yours. I was reading it, and I was like, at first I was just like, L. Ron Hubbard is the shit. He's transcended truth. It doesn't matter what's true anymore. He's like, I'm an adventurer and an inventor and explorer. People sounded like he had lived 10 lives. So his followers knew that he was lying, but he had transcended the burden of truth. It didn't matter anymore. It was like, did I really win a purple heart in war? No. And they know that, but he's the leader. You just get to the point where you don't even have to qualify things anymore. Well fuck, man. I mean, you want to talk about the cult. Here's the thing. This is where it's hilarious being in almost any society and really turning your nose up at cults. Yeah. Because what are we doing? You and I? America. I thought you meant you and I because there are parallels to us. No, look at fucking. Okay. So here you have, let's take it to, what are some similarities with L. Ron Hubbard and Charles Manson? Well, a couple of similarities are that L. Ron Hubbard didn't necessarily break any laws, but a lot of his followers did. They broke into senators' offices. Is that true? Oh yeah, there was espionage that they did. I know there's fraud. There was fraud. They would hunt people, stalk people. They would intimidate people. Right. So look at what Manson's followers did. They just, that got amped up times a zillion. And they just went and started stabbing people to death. Right. So you have these two situations. What do we have? A strong central leader and brainwashed followers. Undeniably charismatic. Larger-than-life motherfuckers. Now cut to Obama. Fucking shooting baskets. He's shooting fucking baskets. You look at that guy and you're like, man, that guy looks fun. God, I'd like to play basketball. I'd like to sit down with him just for five minutes and just smile in front of my sweet president, Barack Obama. Meanwhile, Guantanamo Bay, you've got people being force-fed, throwing their diarrhea. They're so desperate that all they can do now is throw their diarrhea at the guards. They've been transformed into animals. Many of them have not been put on trial. Many of them have no hope. So they're just trying to die. And we won't even let them die because we're shoving tubes into their fucking mouth. Now, let's imagine Charles Manson had kidnapped some people and was holding them in some area for years and years and years to the point where they're like, we're not going to eat anymore. He's like, no, you're going to eat, motherfucker. I'm going to make you eat. I'm going to make you stay alive because I prefer for you to be alive and suffering than dead and at peace. That's what we're doing. That's what our cult is currently doing. Simultaneously, you know, while Obama's shooting those fucking baskets, there are predator drone strikes happening where bombs are being dropped that are fucking killing kids. Now, it gets really foggy when you realize that now we have a triad between Hubbard and Manson and Obama and that all three of them are saying that these murders have some logic or reason behind them. Now we're in madness land where it's like, wait, you're saying that's the only solution, Obama? That's what you've come up with. Like, this is it really truly, truly the only way to fix these great, vast world problems is by incinerating innocent children with your high-tech fucking remote-controlled drones. You've got to be kidding me. But still, in the same way that Hubbard and Manson have followers who are like, yeah, it's true. God damn it, it's the only way to do it. Would you rather it be some other way? Would you rather us die? You know what I mean? It's the same fucking thing. So then you realize, oh, a cult is really just a mini society that bubbles up, a mini paradigm that bubbles up. Well, it's interesting the idea of the leader and wanting the leader to be right. We went into politics in which I can't speak to that. I don't know anything about anything, which is embarrassing. So you just talked about that and it made me very scared and uncomfortable. No, it's not scared. It's just that humans have a tendency to create what's called a consensus reality, which is a reality that everybody agrees on. So, you know, the majority of people, even now I think it's even foggy when it comes to war. Like when you ask people about why are we in Afghanistan? Nobody's, by this point, everyone's just like, ah. Right. Right. Yeah. And even if you have soldiers over there, they're like, ah. Right. Well, what is the answer? Is it because we're consenting to be in? Well, there's the, ah. Okay. Well, let's take it out of politics because I won't be able to join you on that conversation just because of my ignorance. Sure. But when we're talking about Charles Manson or L. Ron Hubbard, or I was going to bring us into it, anything, any symbol of like, you have a podcast and you have fans. And I was thinking about like, one of the things that L. Ron Hubbard did that was like a very mild form of brainwashing, which we also do as comedians, is any sort of commodity is changing people's vocabulary, which I thought was fascinating. If you remember that in the book, like they don't call it literature. They call it technology. Oh yeah. They don't call it, now this isn't politics. I don't consider this politics. They don't call it, when they drop bombs on kids, they don't say, hey, we got to drop some bombs on kids to kill a bad guy. Right. They call it a surgical strike. Exactly. But this is everything. This is a adultery, you know what I mean? Or a miscarriage. Yeah. You know, we put this language, and that's a way of washing your own brain. We're washing our own minds all the time. So I think it's interesting that like, I think about that. One of the reasons why maybe I like these guys is in their reinvention of themselves and in their magnetic quality, that I find that interesting. When you have like, when Marin calls his fans, what the fuckers or whatever it's like. Yeah. Or I call my fans weirdos. I'm like, oh, you're not a fan of the show. You're a weirdo. That's an interesting thing. Scientology, there's a parallel there. This isn't a book. This is technology. I don't go to therapy. I get audited. Yeah. You know what I mean? I'm not better than you. I'm clear. Or all these different... That's a way to get... A military time. I was thinking about that. You go into the military, the first thing you start doing, or one of the first things you start doing, is telling time differently. Yes. Your whole life, it's been eight o'clock, and now it's 0800. You know what I mean? Like, that's a way into people's brains. But the fact that these regular schmo guys that aren't necessarily any better than you or I, figure out this like bald spot, this vulnerability, this soft spot in the back of your head to lure people in and get them on board. And if you had someone like me who wants my chiropractor to have magical powers, now you got yourself a cult. Now you're in business. Yeah. And you also... Don't forget the other quality that cult leaders have, which is that I don't believe that a cult leader sits down and maps out this idea of here's how I'm going to manipulate groups of people. Right. When you look at Charles Manson, you listen to some of his amazing speeches before he really went... I don't know anything about him, really. Oh, man. You got to tell me. He's got some... Are you saying he had some carrot on stick, some good stuff? Fuck yeah, he did. Truth? Great stuff, man. Really? Great stuff. Tell me what. I mean, that's the tragedy. When you watch... There's a great documentary. It's on YouTube. It was shot in 1972. They just showed it at Senna Family. It's called... Just if you... YouTube, it's called Manson. It's really cool because right after these murders happened, which are these horrific, brutal, awful fucking things. So you see this has got his followers giving these speeches. They're holding guns. They're giving these crazy speeches. And 80% of what they're saying is just absolute horseshit and totally disturbing. But 20% of what they're saying, what Manson was teaching them, is fantastic. Right. Overcome your fear. And so one thing that he was doing is... They're all just getting blasted on acid together. And one thing that he was doing is he was getting everyone to fuck. So he was getting everyone to fuck in every single way to try to eradicate all of their sexual hangups by stripping away. Because one of the cult that we're in, one of the first things that it does is it implants into your mind a kind of sexual guilt. So people have all kinds of hangups and guilt when it comes to sex. And it's sad because one of the surefire sources of bliss and pleasure has been... Shadow has been cast over by fundamentalists or by authentic sexual perverts who have actually corrupted what is a really pure, beautiful, intimate experience. So he was trying to get people to have sex to try to get... See, right there. I think I said that on the show last time I did it. I'm one of those people. I'm happy to report that I've come a long way. I was actually just in therapy this morning. We were talking about how far I've come since college. In a good way. I don't mean just like in decadence and indulgence. But I mean, that's part of it. But there's been a lot of deprogramming. And a lot of that had to do with sex. I think I remember saying either to you on the air or off the air. I was like, I would benefit. I don't think I need it anymore. But I would benefit from a camp where people are just like free loving each other. Yes. Because I have that hang up. Everyone would. Everyone would. Yeah. Everyone would. Everyone would. And it's a... And look at what popped out of your mouth right following sex. You said decadence and indulgence. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now, we live in such a... I was thinking about ice cream. We live in such a filthy fucking tough society that decadence and indulgence are bad. Yeah. So this is a negative term. When you think, oh, I'm being decadent. There's a guilt attached to you or anything. I'm being indulgent. Right. There's a guilt attached to you. It's like you've turned the knob up too high. In our society, there's like five levels that you can turn the knob up to. And past that, you're probably breaking the law. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So sex camp and Manson, we're all... Manson was a sex camp, basically. Right. He just... The problem is that Manson... This is something they talk about in spirituality. When you have... For someone to become a guru, they have to die. Their personality has got to go away for good. Right. They have to... You know how tornadoes happen? Nope. It's fascinating. So you get like... I can't remember which is which, but you get really cold air up top and really warm air underneath cold air up top. And this creates this... This pushes the air in a way that creates this cyclone effect. And if conditions are perfect, then you will transform wind into a force of nature that can evaporate cities. Right. It's incredible if the conditions are right, what can happen. Right. In the same way, in a person, if the conditions are right, there can be a neurological happening that causes your personality to get evaporated. Right. In the same way those cities get evaporated and you just transform into infinity and now you are an actual guru. You're a tornado. You're an... Exactly. Yeah. And people who get around you will be permanently altered. Like Blanket Man. Blanket Man, exactly. Exactly. That guy, everyone, one thing everyone says is that guy, there wasn't a person there. Right. Everybody just says there wasn't a person there anymore. Yeah. It was something else. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And you know, I was talking to someone at the Ram Dass retreat and they were talking about a different, the saint that they met in India. And I can't remember her name now. But he said he encountered her, Ram Dass had encountered her and described it as coming in contact with a wild animal. It was like being around something that is a human body, but it's no longer in the human paradigm anymore. It's something else. Who knows what it is? Something else. So those people have obliterated their personalities and their egos and they're not in it for the fingering. They're not in it for getting their cocks and mouths and they're not in it for... Who knows what they're in it for? Right. The problem with these other people is they, I think they temporarily create that vortex effect. Other gurus. Like cult leaders. Yeah. What ends up happening is their ego gets carried into the game. Well, it's so funny that you fucking say that, man. So I'm reading Inside Scientology and you know I'm an open person. I love you and you're an open person. Love me too. But I also just like to think that I'm not a stupid person either and neither are you, of course. But I'm reading the book and all I'm thinking is great, cool, sounds interesting. You know how all these acid dropping hippies loved Dianetics, loved early Scientology, loved all that stuff. But then it took this weird turn and I'm happy that it did. Because up until that point I was concerned. I was like, oh, I'm going to do this. You know what I mean? Because then I was like, oh, and what you just said, I felt like Elron Hubbard's ego got in the way. When they said that it was a thought crime to say something disparaging about him or his writing. I was like, oh, we just, it's ruined. You just fucked, you shit in the punch bowl. Over. And it's over and I'm done. And forget about like the Scientology like creation story about satans and latching onto people and being in volcanoes and implants over billions of years. Suddenly it all just sounded like a guy swinging his dick around. Instead of a guy who at the beginning when I was like really kind of on board with at least I was like, is there a covert way I could get someone to audit me? Because this sounds like, I just want to be hypnotized. I want someone to like send me to a past life or something. Yes. That sounds interesting. Of course that's up my alley. But then I was happy and kind of relieved when I was like, oh, good, I don't have to, I don't have to be a Scientologist. I'll just do other things. Well, you, what you become when you get really close to the obliteration of your ego. Yes. Is you become, there's different terms for it, but you become a magician and you become someone who is still rearranging subjective blocks of reality for your own personal gain based on your tiny identification with the self. So this is like when you have Hubbard and Manson, you'll always see this inevitable power dynamic where they're still caught up in the power game. Right. Whereas when people get a little closer to the void, then that power game goes away and then they just, they don't care anymore. Right. They just don't care. Right. They're gone because they, but. And that's where you get those esoteric answers about like, I'm not teaching you anything. I'm not even here. All that sort of stuff. Or you go like, buy some books and, and join me at the sea. Join me on the sea where I'm going to teach you even more secrets or whatever. Well, you know, man, I was just, it's not like, it's not when I, the way I'm describing it sounds mysterious, but another way to put it is like, I was just on the air, on an airplane flying back to LA with this girl I've been seeing. And there's this little boy sitting in front of us. I know that boy. That'd be so weird. I know. I've seen him too. He comes to all of us. Like when you're on Iowa's, can you see the big black snake? This little kid, the snake. Yeah. Yeah. This kid, he looked at, I remember he was, he liked, was sitting in the seat and he's looking at us. And then he, he looks at, at my girlfriend and he says to her, you are beautiful. He was like from Dubai and he had this great little accent. And then like, he like reached back from behind the seat and was like holding her hand as we're flying. And then like, he was just the, all he was is his kid. He's just filled with, he's just a sweet little kid. Right. So that, that, that's what I'm talking about. That's it. That's the thing. That's another thing I've been saying lately, which is that kids are right. And we learn all these words and things. Like for example, I'm kind of working on this on stage right now. But when I was a kid, all I cared about when I went to the library, I got books on hypnosis, magic, the universe, aliens. That was it. And you know what? I was right. Here's what we start doing. I was just thinking about this today. This is all today. Play area. Like you're a kid. Grownups are looking for permission. Okay. We even are guilty of that. I want permission and I want a reason to sit down and talk to you. Yes. So we record it. And that's our involvement in what I'm saying. But it starts as a kid. Kids want to play all the time because kids see the color and kids see the air and kids aren't thinking later. They're completely present. That's why tiredness, exhaustion just hits them all at once because they're not rationing their energy. They're just like, I feel great now and I'm going to chase that beat. You know what I mean? And then we start doing something, which I'm not saying we shouldn't do, but we invent recess and we go, now it's recess and that's a time for you to play. And that's when you're silly. And we start putting the future on kids. Billy, be good now. Recess is at one o'clock. That's when you can play with the blocks and stuff. And that becomes playtime that builds in our brains. Okay. To do certain things to dance. This is me now to dance. I need to be at a wedding and I need to be drinking. Yeah. What the fuck? I went to my show last night. I had a show at Largo last night and they were blasting just the best music and I went in and just started fucking dancing. I was with a friend of mine and just dance and I can't do the worm, but I tried to do the worm. Because what the fuck? What's wrong with us? Why aren't we all trying to do the worm? What are you waiting for? You're waiting for a wedding. You're waiting for recess. You're waiting for someone to say it's playtime. The blocks come out now. But really, kids are right. Hold somebody's hand. Tell somebody they're beautiful. Go on an airplane and realize what's happening. Children are correct. We spend all this time building up this ego and this identity and the idea of time and space and responsibility and identity. When really, I think now as a 34 year old, I'm trying to get back as silly and cliche as that sounds inner child shit. I'm just trying to get back to the truth. I was driving here and I'm on the 405 or whatever and you know there's that big hill and you could put it in neutral and you'd still be going 65. I just opened my arms because that's what a kid would do. It's an amazing feeling when we can put ourselves in the present and be like, I know I'm ranting, but I'm so burdened about like, how much sleep am I going to get tonight? What do I have to do tomorrow? I'm always kind of aware of it. When really, if we could just be a kid and be like, I have energy to talk to you, Duncan, now I'm going to have fun with you now and not worry about what I have to do after this. Yeah. Yeah. You're talking about the, you know, one thing with kids is you can see them go into this beautiful trance state too when they're like playing. You know, you can like, when you start talking about, when you start pretending to be whatever the thing is, they immediately will go along with it and get so deeply into it because that's where they stay. Yes. And also to add to what you're saying, one thing I've noticed that I do is, so if I'm being particularly healthy, I've gotten addicted to jogging lately. So I'll like, wake up and I'll go running. I thought you were going to say opium for sure. I was like, here we go. I'm kind of down on opiates right now, but I have been jogging and so I'll be jogging and it's beautiful in the morning and the birds are singing and I'll be jogging. But in my mind, I'll be thinking, I haven't really started my day yet. You know, this is just me jogging before I get to work, riding, working on the podcast. Right. And then I'll come home and then I'll like, I've been trying after I jog because that's when all the endorphins are pumping and your highs like height on your own biochemistry. Right. Then I'll sit down and that's when I'll, I'll try to chant. So I'll start chanting buddy. Meditating after exercising is like fucking something, something, make your own analogy. It's the greatest. It's like pancakes on a pig. Yeah. Yeah. But then, then, so then like, I'll start chanting, but even then in my mind as I'm chanting as you go in and out of that state, my mind will be saying, okay, man, but you know, we got to get to work now because you've already, now you've spent two hours jogging and meditating. We really got to get down to business. Right. And then suddenly like the next thing you know, like, wow, I got to go eat. Now you're eating your mind is like, up, up, up. We got to eat quick and get down to business brother. And then it's breaking my heart. And then, and then finally like you, you sit down in this stupid fucking business thing that you're supposed to be doing. You, now you're alive. Yeah. Your mind's giving you permission because you're acting in a way that recesses over. Yeah. Now you're, now you're, now you're an adult. You're doing the day when people are like, I wasted, like someone will say something like, you know, it was so beautiful today. And I just laid on my couch and the breeze was coming through the curtains. And I sat there looking at the sun and listening to the birds. And I just wasted the day. You're like, what the fuck did you just say? Yeah. Like you talk about, and we just don't, again, we're just looking for permission. We had to be on vacation to do that. Fuck that Tuesday in LA. Do that shit. Cancel some stuff and turn off your phone. Exactly. And I, and man, so I'll tell you the other crazy side of all this, especially in our business, Pete, we're starting the cause. We will know in our, in our business, one thing that I've found across the board minus a few people is this amazing misery. Like, I, like, so, man, you know, you talk to people and they have had success that for some people is, if some people would think if I had that level of success, that was that much money coming in that much. That would be it. I'd be set. I would have no more trouble. And when you run into these people and they are beyond miserable, they have this afflit, they're afflicted. And so, so they get downtime because they've accomplished whatever the thing is they want to accomplish. They have downtime where they have days and days and days where they don't have to do anything. Days and days and days. Plenty of money in the bank. And yet they spend those days in a kind of pensive anxiety. Yes. Worried about what? You're not even sure. Are you watching rectify? No. It's a great, it's good. Everybody really loves it. I'm only two episodes in, so it's too early to say, but it's about a guy who is in prison, basically his entire adult life, and then he's released. That's all you really need to know. And he talks about getting out and he was meditating and stuff on the inside. No spoilers here. That's in the pilot. It's very big. He was clearly this guy who's trying to make the most of his time inside reading and meditating and trying to get out of death row, basically, in his mind. And then he got out and he was like, ever since I've been out, I've been feeling this anxiety of something coming. And I don't even know what it is. I don't have any responsibilities, but I've noticed that everybody is constantly worrying about a thing that's coming down the road. Whereas when I was in prison, and I'm paraphrasing, you should just watch the show. He was like, it was all about the time in between the seconds. It was just the moment. This guy was in, it's another cliche, but like the only time he was free was in prison. You know, he was there because he was so powerfully in the moment. Yeah. It was like Eckhart Tolle says, it's like, what time is it? It's now. If you ask a bird, what time is it? It's like, what the fuck are you talking about? Yeah. Why are you calculating the tilt of the earth and what point in the rotation we are? Sure. That doesn't exist. It's all an illusion. It's all fake. It's right now. But here we, here's, and this is, here's where the rub is. It's like, indeed. Yes. That's true, but that fucking bird ain't paying rent on its goddamn nest. Hey, believe me. We're two jerk-offs in a room on a weekday that don't have anywhere to be for a couple hours. Right. I get it. It's a luxurious and privileged position. And right now people are at work listening to this. And I understand that. Right. Well, no, man. I mean, this is, even like, the, the, the, the, this is something where in a, you know, there's a, I can't remember the name of the book. I think it's called the Harvard Psychedelic Club. I'm reading it. Okay. So, you know, I, if you got into the part where the, No, I just have it. I just caught myself kind of lying. I have it. It's a great book. Yeah. Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert, which is Ram Dass' name at the time. Yes. And I'm a little bit of an intellectuals or in this house, which I can never remember the name of all dropping acid, tripping out. And at one point somebody came back to the house cause they'd been away for a while and there's dishes in the sink. There's flies crawling on everything. Everything's filthy. Nobody's been cleaning. And it's, and this is kind of a symbol of like, okay, you're right. We need to let go and be in the moment. And we need to be like children and natural. But the big hippie question is who's going to do the dishes? Yeah. Who's going to, who's takes the garbage? Right, right. Where's the sassy woman that goes, you need to be present and play these bills right now. You know what I mean? Yeah. Cause they're going to turn out the power. So that's the, so, so again, so now here's where it gets interesting. You can, you can reverse that. You can reverse the loop or you can reverse the sense of where you're living. In other words, like, so now you can think, okay, well, work, work, I'm no longer living. Work. I'm going to get through it so that I can go back to the forest and go back to a meditative state. That really is life. Yet again, what have you done? You've taken this wholeness of time and you've cut up the pie. Right, right, right. You've just done it in another, in other words, what you're doing is you're creating a hierarchy of time where this moment is more important. And you're separating God from other places. This, this cat, I'm going to call him a cat, Rob Bell wrote this wonderful book that I think it enjoy is called what we talk about when we talk about God and he, and he's like, God is with us for us and ahead of us. Those are his big three things. And the with us thing was very fascinating. He was like, God isn't there when you invoke him or like stand around going like God showed up and saved the man. God's like his big thing is like God is here. I guess that would be called a little bit of pantheism, but he's just saying like this is God. We're like kind of inside of God. So to quote your boy, Ram Dass, one of my favorite things and be here now, which I know we kind of tease at the same time, you are the task. If you're, if you're sweeping, that's what's happening. And if you're filing a W, whatever thing for your boss, Troy, somebody's brain just melted some guy, my boss Troy, yeah. That's also what you're doing. God can be present in all of the things. If we slow down, he's there at the DMV. You know why God's present in all the things because we're God. That's the thing. Wherever you're at. Well, when you wake up to your own divinity, that sort of thing. Even when you don't, and that's the, even when you don't, yeah, that's right. It's like, if you're, if you're in the same way that you see the child, but start playing make believe and is like deeply engaged in the game. It's not like suddenly that's a fireman because he's playing one. Right. It's like he's still the child has become a fireman, temporal and the same way. This is the classic mystical idea. Even though we've become so deeply engrossed in our own personal games and we're not God in the sense that we're not omniscient. We haven't transformed into blanket man as you call it. We still are the thing. We're just in more in the trance state. And that it seems like the, the, we're hypnotized. We're hypnotized. We're asleep. We're asleep. It comes up every time, but we're Jason Bourne. We have amnesia and we need to realize we already know kung fu. Yes. That's that. That's exactly it. And that is fucking. I can't make that point enough. I love that point. It's awesome. Beautiful. Why is that? Why are those movies so resonating? It's more than just a guy kicking ass. You're kind of like, he's trying to figure out who he is. I'm going to stop. Well, but people that know us know that point. They resonate with us because that, that is the predicament that we're in or when you watch the show or the guys are riding all over his body. Right. You know, it's like, what's the name of that movie? Memento. Memento. Yes. Like there's, our ego is insisting that we're a thing and we're going, I've been told I'm Jason Bourne. That's what this passport says. What is that? That's how you feel when you wake up in the morning. I travel so much and Duncan, do you eat at a lot of restaurants? I know you do. That's a Glenn Gary, Glenn Ross reference. I know you travel a lot. So sometimes you wake up in the middle of the night and just briefly, I don't know if I'm in a hotel or if I'm in my house. And in that moment, I need to look around the room or to continue with the analogy, I need to look at the passport and go, Oh, I'm Jason Bourne. Like I need to remember my name. I need to remember where I am and go, Oh, this isn't hotel. I need to go in the card catalog of my brain and take out the hotel card, put in the one that says home. It's still just a space. It's still just a thing. It's still nothing. But I'm putting these labels on and I go, I'm Pete Holmes. That's what's so great about mushrooms is when you're on mushrooms, I haven't done in years. But like when you were a year, when you, when you're on them, I'm no longer Pete Holmes. That's the truth. I'm not. But Eckhart Tolle again is insisting the ego wants to stay in control. There's a power struggle and it's going, No, you're Pete Holmes. And therefore I'm going to make you worry about the future so that you'll continue to impose your ego and insist on remaining Pete Holmes. And I'm going to keep playing clips from your past, a little clip show, anxiety, stress, memories, regrets. So I can be like, remember when Pete Holmes did that, when Pete Holmes peed his pants or whatever it is. See, you're that guy and you will be that guy. But when we slow down and are just in the moment where nobody and that's a big threat to everything. Yeah, well, yeah, it is. Well, it's a it is a it's a real it's a you're talking about a complete transformation of the paradigm. And it's a it's a I think a lot of people don't want to do that. It's like, I don't listen to asshole. I'm enjoying playing the play in the game. Right. I don't feel like not playing right now. And if well, that's what Hicks says about the role. Sorry to interrupt, but the roller coaster, he's like, it's it's just a ride. The famous Bill Hicks thing. It's like, it's just a ride. It's a loud and persistent illusion. Yeah. But then the people who have a lot of money and have a lot of power and are fucking a lot of broads or fucking a lot of dudes, if you know, whichever, I don't give a shit. I'm just saying those people go shut up. And I'm paraphrasing Hicks here, but I'm just saying shut up. Stop saying this is a game because I or an illusion or a simulation because I'm rather enjoying it. And I'm in a hot tub right now. And then they get those people out of the way, whether it's Christ or Buddha or whatever, it's just like, can you beat it, please? Yeah. What the fuck you, you're not going to screw up my casino. You're not my casino. Exactly. This is my house. You know, this is something I've also been working out on stage, which is the idea that like we forget that we're on a planet. This is right up your alley. We're on a planet and we all forget it. And that's the beginning going back to the cult thinking that we all brainwash ourselves. I'm not on a planet. I'm at Duncan's house. In fact, that's not even level one. Level one is I'm in a chair. Level two is I'm in this room. I'm in your studio room. Level three is I'm in your house. Level four is I'm on your street. Five, I'm in Los Angeles. Six, I'm in California. Seven, I'm in the United States. Eight, now we get a little bit wider. I'm on a fucking rock. You know what I mean? You know what Timothy Leary calls it? A gravity well. He calls it a we're trapped in a gravity well. That's part of the bit. I say, we're people say they're afraid of flying. We're all flying. We're constantly flying. And why aren't we afraid? Because someone said gravity and I said, got it. Take the bit. Take the take the bit a step further and realize that not only are we like stuck on a on a on a on a planet, but we're literally being held down by a bend in the fabric of space and time. Right. It's a result of keeping us stuck to the mass of the fucking rock. The rock's not what's sticking is its mass is creating a compression in time and space gravity. Well, yeah, gravity. Well, we're fucking stuck in a goddamn gravity well. Crazy. That's no fun. We're like flies on a fucking fly trap. It's all it's all you go. It's not only in my Pete Holmes, but I'm Pete Holmes in this room, in this city, in this tent on this day at this time. All that stuff really. And I'm I'm actually getting to the age where I realize there are things I don't want to think about. It's not cute anymore. And I can freak myself out talking about what we're talking about right now to the point where it challenges me and makes me too uncomfortable that we're just floating in space. It's insane. Well, that's that, you know, what it is. All that stuff is the is the mind. And it's we both live in that place. I was just, you know, I had this fucking profound moment when I was out in this meditation retreat. Did I tell you about this meditation retreat? I've been yapping about it here. I went to this meditation retreat, got to meet Ramdas. Got did. Yeah, it was fucking incredible. But you dick. I'm right. I'm writing in a car to go to this house with this guy, Raghu Marcus, who was also a devotee of Neem Kareli Babin. He. He said this thing, these these people, man. Sounded like you just ordered an appetizer. I don't know what that meant. I like it sounded spicy. I don't know. Kareli Baba and a Raghu Marcus. It's definitely deep fried. They they these people, they all throw out though they in a very real yet casual way. Yes, they just throw hammers at your fucking it where where you're stuck. Yeah, but they do it in such a subtle and graceful way that it that somehow it like has more impact than somebody being like, hey, wake up to this. It's like the way they do it is like because they've all been in the same place. But you know, I'm we're riding. We're riding to go see Ramdas and like I'm rambling about. Neem Kareli Baba, you know, is he a what do you think? Raghu Marcus, do you think he's like a super evolved human and all human beings are going to be like this guy? And I'm going on and on calculating and and and and he and he's smiling. He's smiling. He's looking at me. He's like, I don't think about those things. He's like, I just try to work on myself so that I can be of service to the person next to me. And he did when I say it, it sounds fucking stuck. He said in the most sweet way. It's like, yeah, no, it doesn't sound bad. They've like they've like condensed this thing like our minds. Well, he's loving his neighbor. Literally, he's talking about his neighbor. And what we do is we shoot out our tendrils and we try to suck cover as much ground as possible, suck the nectar of wonder. From the wildest ideas that we can create. You know, from that, we get high. We'll get these moments of like, holy shit. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, fucking rock, gravity. Well, you're right. It's like a drug. I'm trying to get high and it's and it's beautiful. It's fine. And it's fun. It's fun. But what they've done or what the idea is that you begin to like start pulling those things back in and you realize that what's actually happening is I'm projecting onto the symbols of life, my own love. And this is kind of like there's a song. It's called Sankya philosophy, I believe it's in. It's a huge part of the Bhagavad Gita, a huge part of yoga systems. There's a book called the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali that talks about like the model that they have when you will love this. The model that they have is you have here's the model. The model is that you have an essence, an essential self. And this essential self is compared to a light, a sun. It's this thing which radiates beauty and love out into the world. And that's all it is, is this love radiator that projects love out into the world. So that's what you actually are. Then you have the mind and the way that the mind works is it takes the phenomena of the external world and it instantaneously duplicates it. So when you're looking at me right now, you're not really seeing me. You're seeing a neurological impression of me created by your mind. You're there's you're not seeing me. It's like I'm activating your optic nerve and your senses so that you've created a replicant of this thing in front of you. So that replicant can be compared to a slide that's being placed on top of a projector and the eternal light that you are is shining through the replicant that you've created. So really, when you see anything, all you're actually seeing is a reflection of your own self being shined through the like a dream almost. It's like a dream. How you're everyone in a dream. You literally are everyone and you're only seeing the beauty of yourself. So when you are you saying this is one of those mind melting things where it's pretty simple, basic stuff. I don't know why I was just afraid that my thought was too trivial or something. But like, how do I know blue looks like blue to you sort of thing? Exactly. But how do I know Duncan looks like you? Yeah, because we're all that's happening is our minds are catching reality. We're replicating. But it's a valid point. Well, you don't know what I know is blue is could be completely different. All you there's in that we don't we don't have the technology to tell that yet. But so so the idea behind all this is that when you when. So when you like when you get in the presence of unconditional love, which is when generally most people experience that through girlfriend or boyfriend or through pets or parents. Yeah, when you get in the presence of that, what you're really seeing is not the love that's coming from another person. The person doesn't control the love. Really, what you're seeing is a reflection of what you are. So when you see when you when you say I'm in love, what you're saying is I've become myself around you, because that really is all you are in that funny, often in breakups. All I'm going to say every breakup I've had, you go like, I can't be myself around them. Yes, you start acting this different way. And that's when you know, you're like, you need to get out. And that's often what I ask my friends who are in relationships. I say, do you feel more like yourself with them than away from them? Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. And wild and that's the melting that happens when you really are in love and you just melt, you just there's a roomy form. It's so great. It sounds so weird. Like, you know, when you were talking about the guys, like I just work on myself and then I try and help my neighbor. Look, I get that completely. And to be honest, to a certain extent, I'm not saying that I could do a lot more to help my neighbors. But like I worry sometimes about the narcissistic appeal. People that listen to my show know that I am aware of my own tendency towards self-obsession. I don't think you could file me wholly under self-obsessed, but I think we all I can't speak for other people. I'm going to say for me, it's natural. I feed myself, I bathe myself, I clothe myself, I shelter myself. And then it's just a natural extension for me to be like, and I entertain my own spiritual progress. Meditation is quiet time with yourself and it appeals to the creative, artistic, comedian guy who loves delving into himself, loves taking his own temperature, loves gazing at his own navel, see what I'm feeling right about it. And I tell other and then impose it on other people. So when I heard him say that in your story, I'm like, I wonder if we have to be OK with that, if we have to be like I like even what you were saying about your reflection of me and everything. Sometimes spirituality does have that sort of like let's go ahead and acknowledge that you are you and you're the hero in your movie. And it's that's OK or something. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, absolutely. It's the same thing as time. It's like instead of like thinking, OK, now this is now I'm on vacation. Things are good and and now I'm working and things are bad. Or now I'm working and things are good. And now instead of in the same way when you find yourself being a cunt, which is an inevitability and you find your ego acting up and you've thrown up your defensive tail feathers and you find yourself doing whatever the embarrassing like hissing bad version of you is. Yeah. Then then again, because now you've you you started working on becoming your true self, which is this radiant getting in touch with that eternal love field. Yeah, childlike going back to our thing. Absolutely childlike. Yeah, his children haven't they haven't built up. They don't know what recess is. You see a kid you're seeing the core of the gob stopper. It hasn't been covered up by the different layers of fear. And so in the same way, once you start, all right, I'm I'm going to become that thing. Since you're becoming that thing now when the shitty thing emerges and you yell at the fucking guard at LACMA, which I just did. And you like you like find yourself in a stupid argument with a bat with like just someone you run and run into on the street or whatever. Stupid. Yeah. Now you love that. Now you're like, OK, OK, this is happening. But I'm going to I'm going to as much as I can give unconditional positive regard to this part of myself as I am to all the other parts of myself, because otherwise I'm going to become phony. Right. Now I'm just going to try to build up. Well, that's so funny when when one of the questions Rob Bell, the guy who wrote that book was on my podcast, and I was talking to him a little bit about how can you not be a phony? The most repelling thing to me is a phony. That's why I had a hard time with my youth pastors and stuff, whose job it became to be nice and like everything. Yes. So I could make a painting of you. Let's say you're my youth pastor, Duncan, and I make a painting of you. And it is just garbage. It looks like I put the paintbrush up my ass and couldn't even see the canvas and just kind of swayed around a little bit. I go, this is you. And for some reason, the ambassador of truth that is a pastor, he's supposed to be the flagship flagship. I'll lead everybody on the way to truth, love, light, happiness, grace, peace, patience, kindness, gentleness, all that sort of stuff. Also became the guy who just likes every like, that's great, buddy. I love it. Cool. You liar. Yeah. You fucking tell me it sucks. You dirty lying piece of shit. Ask me if I put the brush up my ass and I'll respect you. I mean, like that that's why the Elron Hubbard thought thought crime. I can't have any. I can't be wrestling with truth or looking for God in any sort of arena that doesn't allow complete honesty, even you yelling at a guard, even inappropriate grotesque humanity where you quote unquote fail because that's what you did in that moment. You were you were mean. I made it. I do it every day. I say something that is regrettable or inappropriate or embarrassing or really what I'm saying is like, it's too telling to my true secret, horrible self somewhere deep down a child got the microphone and he went cooties and 69 and boogers over the supermarket PA. And I'm like, fuck, I've been trying to keep that guy in the cold storage. Yeah, man, you can't. Yeah. And you're because when you do, you're creating this awful fucking. This is why, like, you know, any time this is like the old version of celebrity was that, you know, there were it was possible to have scandals not that long ago, or if you got caught doing this thing or that thing, people would be like, oh, my God. Yeah. What? Yeah. He's a communist or whatever. Right. And and and still there's some people who try to maintain that bullshit public persona where you're like, right, the fuck. Well, it's like it's like Bill Maher. It is passed to like he's not married and he clearly gets hookers and stuff. You know, like where it's legal and he goes to like, you know, Jay Leno's fucking fisting sheep or who knows. It does seem like it kind of doesn't matter. Is that what you're saying? Like I'm saying, don't try to trick me into thinking that you're whoever the fuck you are. Right. Don't try to trick me into thinking you're not a goddamn monkey descendant, right? Because because we're all we're all dealing with MD then because when you run into people like, you know, Doug Stanhope, for example, on my favorite comics, when you run into people like that who have just managed to be fully themselves, right? And the self that they're being is not pretty a lot of the time. Right. In fact, a lot of it. And I mean, it's like a lot of the time, their self-destructive attitude, it's not even romantic. Right. You know what I mean? It's like it's it's bad. Well, that's where we get the exposed nerve of realness. Yeah. And you're talking to a guy who does a pretty good job. I'd like to say putting himself together. I'm not Stanhope. I'm not just letting my farts out in the car. Yeah. You know what I mean? But like, yeah, or like publicly, you know, just like being fully, completely open about this path that you've chosen and acknowledging that it's a self-destructive path, yet that's who he is, man. He's he is completely reflecting himself. And that what that does for everybody is it has such more of a healing effect than someone who is pretending to be all put together and perfect and great. Right. Because because when you see Stanhope or Louis C.K., then you're like, there's this sense of you've been forgiven. You're like, oh, right. These guys, by being open and honest about the shit that they're going through. Buddy, you're blowing my dick off as you always do. That's what I've been. That's again, what I was talking about in therapy is the idea of like, OK, so youth pastor, I love the painting. It looks great, buddy. You're my best friend. Jesus loves you. Let's moonwalk across the ice. Fake guy, fake Pete. There's that program still runs. It's easy to run. It's like spotlight on a Mac. It's just Apple space bar. It's right there. But I'm learning that it's more engaging, more intoxicating, more real and more magnetic to just be real. It's taken me 34 years and a lot of therapy. This is one of those $10,000 moments. I'm trying guessing how much I've spent on therapy. Probably a lot more than that. But like, I remember I was with a girl and I was in a situation where I thought it was a date and it wasn't a date. Like, the first thing that came up was that she had a boyfriend. And like, so I feel this shame. I'm a little embarrassed. Something was not what I thought it was. And I'm like, what is going on here? Like, why are you at dinner with me if you have a boyfriend? Is he OK with that? Yes. And so instead of being youth bastard and going like, that's great, I want to meet him. What's his name? Jean Koo. That's that's the pro. That's the pop up. It goes, would you like to run? Yeah, youthpastor.exe and I'm supposed to click OK. But instead, I was just like, he's OK with you being here. He shouldn't be. I'm a grown man with bad intentions. Yeah. Fuck that. And I am angry and this is upsetting to me. We can still have a nice meal, but that's ridiculous. And it was it. And I'm not talking about sexually appealing or romantically appealing. It made me humanely appealing. Yeah, those are the people flies to light or whatever, moths to light, flies love sugar that people are drawn to. That's some Jesus shit. That's some like, I know what this guy thinks about me. We don't have like biblical accounts of Jesus keeping it that real. But I'm sure he did. Fuck yeah, you do. Who did Jesus hang out with? And people always say this really puffed up thing or like, well, Jesus hung out with prostitutes and drunks because he wanted to heal them. No, Jesus hung out with prostitutes and drunks because they're honest. He went to the source. He went to where people were being real. Right. That's where he wanted to hang out with a politician. No, or fucking like rabbis all dressed up in weird, which is basically a politician at that time. That's not you want to be with you. You want to be with people? Somebody who's been broken down. Yeah. Right. Someone who's ego who's like cast aside their ego and is just being fully in the moment of whatever they do, because here's the thing. Either you're so powerful, you have nothing to lose, or you're so weak that you actually have the power of nothing to lose. So you can actually be yourself. Let's say I'm a prostitute and that makes you think of me in a certain way. That means at a meal, I can be honest and tell you that I don't like the painting. Because what are you going to do? Make me a prostitute? Yeah. You know what I mean? And I'm not putting down prostitutes. You know, I don't have hate or judgment or anything. I'm just saying in society's eyes, you can't take me down. I have nothing to lose, or if you're so powerful. Well, I have nothing to lose according to the stupid fucking paradigm that you're prancing around. I don't have anything that I value that you can take away. It's like, look at you, you know, all these people who fucking look down their nose at this thing or that thing. It's like, motherfucker, you're selling your life hours just like I'm selling my life, you know? And and so, yeah, I think that there's a, you know, again, though, that doesn't mean that you should like spiral down to try to. Again, if you if then if you hear this or you in fact, I would say you shouldn't spiral down. You should just wake up, Jason, born it to the reality that you don't. I don't have anything that you can take away. You know what I'm saying? The love I need is in me. Yeah, you can't take it. Right. It's not there for you to take. It's like you're saying it's that core of life. Be it. You can't even get it. I don't even know where it is. And to be it, you've got to. Here's the thing. This is another important thing that I've realized from like going to this retreat, because the thing that I would like to entertain is this idea of like, OK, well, I'm just going to be the light. No, it doesn't work like that. You they say it does their stories of enlightenment where a drop of water hits a puddle and someone wakes up to the unity of all things. But the reality is it's very similar to exercise. Like you don't just get to be the light. The yogic system is designed to with like pretty rigorous exercises that caught that like surgically removed chunks of your ego until you become the light. But it happens from a spiritual practice. It doesn't happen from right from like it's called a practice. It's a practice. You got to do it every day as much as you can or at least set the intention to do it every day. So you create the cognitive dissonance inside of you and it's not happening where you're like, shit, why am I not meditating? Or why are you thinking about the planet when really you should just be thinking about your neighbor? It goes back to that guy being like, I don't think about that. Yeah, it's just that moment. What are you doing in that moment? We need you to think. I know. Can I tell you something that that made me think of? Were you done with that particular? But I want to ask you a question before because before you keep getting philosophical, I've got to ask you about something. We go ahead. OK, this you'll like this one. OK, this will be the thing that I wanted to tell you. I'm going to keep it brief because Vikram Gandhi was on my podcast. He was in the movie Kumari. Did you see that? Yeah, I haven't seen it yet. I'm sure I've seen people tweeting at both of us that you should see it. I got mad about it. I haven't seen it yet, but I got really mad about what he was doing. And we can talk about that insanely unethical and just kind of like obvious. But go ahead. I should I should watch. You should watch it because I'm making the most idiotic judgment of all time. So that anyone ever could make. Because I don't think I would enjoy a movie that was just purely manipulative or mean spirit. So I think you might be I'm being a dumb dumb. Sorry, Gandhi. No, both. Ghandis. Yeah, there's many, many. I apologize to all the Ghandis. Yeah, yeah. This is the thing I was going to tell you, that guy being like trying to some of the better moments I've had. And I'm going to keep this brief because I did say this on my podcast already, but I wanted to tell you about it because I think you helped me get to this place. So I was, you know, I do TM, transcendental meditation. And the whole point of it was to like get to some other side shit was basically to stop doing drugs. Not that I've ever done a lot of drugs. There's my puritanical instinct. I want to declare everybody who knows me. You should know I don't do a lot of drugs. That's true. But who cares? I wanted to get to drug like places without doing drugs. That was my intention from the beginning. It's like fuck stress. I don't give a shit about stress. I just want to get to the other side. Let's Jim Morrison this. And and I'm happy to say that it started to work. So the reason what made me think of it was the guy that's like, I don't think about those trippy philosophical deep, deep. I'm on a planet. What the fuck? Look at the moon. Holy shit. I'm here. I'm in this room. So there you can go the other way and embrace the fact that I'm in this body. Like that I'm in this room. I'm in this body. I'm in this head. I'm in the spirit. If you want to keep going in and in instead of going out and out. And those that was one of the most it was the most transcendent moment of my life. And it was basic meditation. The reason I want to talk about it is two reasons. One, because I think you'll think it's interesting. And two, because it's actually pretty practical. I did study transcendental meditation. A lot of people know that costs about $1500. So a lot of people will be like, fuck that shit. So the great thing about it was that people can do something similar. All it was. And I got to be honest about this. And I think people often leave this shit out. I some days you just feeling it. Some days you just feel more present. You might be more rested. For some reason, you're just more connected. I'm talking about going down that hill and opening up my arms. Just because today is a more beautiful day. So if you try this and it doesn't work, believe me, I try it all the time and it doesn't work. But this day it worked. I had enough rest. I didn't have much to do that day. And I had like a good hour that I didn't have to do anything. And I just sat on my bed and instead of just doing my mantra, I was saying to myself, it was more of a Buddhist philosophy. Instead of trying to transcend and get away, I was more just listening very intently to everything that was happening. I was just telling myself if there was a mantra, I was just saying, be right here, be right here, be right here. Now, here's the thing that I'll be quick, just in case people have heard it before. I told you when I did the show last time that when I'm in my dreams and I'm lucid dreaming, I have this beautiful epiphany that I'm like, oh, so I'm Dream Pete. And I go, I'm inside Pete right now. My universe is being made by Pete. So I have this idea of the creator, which is me. And I go, he's creating his brain is creating this world. So if we were dreaming right now, I'd be like, Pete made this table. I'm inside of him. And also, I know that if I get too excited, if I fly around or something, Pete, capital P Pete God, Dream God, Pete, is his heart rate is going to accelerate. So I'm aware of a heart in a circulatory system of the thing that's creating my world. I go, I can't run around and grab boobies or look up skirts or fly because that'll make my creator's heart rate increase and he'll wake up. And that'll end all of this. So instead, what I do is I breathe, I take a moment and I calm the dreamer. So that's something that I have on my on a post-it note on my door that says, calm your dreamer. So it's the idea of going in the dream. I go, I breathe in and I breathe out. And I'm actually telling my body, my host body to also breathe in and breathe out and relax and don't wake up and let me stay in here. I'm going to play in here for a moment. So please relax and stay asleep because when you wake up, I stop to exist. So calm down. Okay. Right. This is, wow, that's part A and that works. So if we were in a dream right now, you know how dreams are. The perimeter of this might be foggy. Your face might be warping around. You might not look like you. There might not be as much color, that sort of thing. And when I do that, when I calm the dreaming guy and I breathe in and breathe out, I can kind of see him breathe in and breathe out like the room expands and contracts a little bit. And when he calms down, dreaming Pete, I mean host Pete calms down. Everything wakes up. So like this, the tablecloth on this table has a pattern to it. That might show up whereas before it was just blue. Now the pattern comes in. Yeah. One time I did it. I was looking at a cityscape and I calmed him down and I saw the highway that I couldn't see before and I could see headlights on the highway. Just dozens and dozens of cars, way more than I could ever imagine. Like if I burdened myself to sit and close my eyes and try to picture a city, just a beautiful, infinite, intricate, colorful, three dimensional, amazing city that just takes your breath away. And I see it because he calms down and that allows the world to come. Yep. That's part A. Here's part B. And this is where it gets really done. Contrastle Trippy family hour. Please. So I'm meditating and I'm just telling myself to be right here. And then I'm thinking about the idea of when I calm myself in my dreams, the world becomes more vivid. I told you that colors show up, cars show up, patterns show up. And then I have this thought that doesn't quite make sense when I say it. It's one of those thoughts, but made perfect sense when I was in the middle of this kind of trance, I thought, can I calm what's dreaming me? Yeah, you get that in that trippy. So I was like, whatever you want to call it, God, creator, my own essence. Can I calm it down? Can I put the needle on the record? Can I set the timer to zero and just be right here? And I did the same thing where I just breathe in and breathe out. And I did that and my eyes are closed and I'm doing it. And I'm like, calm your dreamer, try and have a waking appreciation for the world as if you were dreaming. This is what, this is what you helped me realize. Try and see this world as a simulation. If I told you that you were in, you were not in your house, we're not in California. We're in Boston in my parents' house and I put a helmet on you and it was making all, you re, think you're in this house. You'd be fascinated with everything, how amazingly intricate the simulation was. So I was like, can I do that here? Can I do that? Can I be like a dreamer while I'm awake? So I tried it and I'm just closed my eyes and breathing and I'm breathing. And then I was done. Uh, I don't time myself. I just felt done and I opened my eyes and the room looked, I had, I'd like to say this before I tell you how the room looked. I had no intention. This wasn't a do a to get B. Yeah. This was a do a just to do a and then B showed up and I opened my eyes and the room was the most vivid. It's my bedroom. I've seen it a billion times, but my sheets on the bed looked like a mountain range, all the folds and the wrinkles. Every fabric felt amazing. It was like I was holding my breath. I wasn't, I was actually breathing quite deeply, but it felt like that urgency of blood rushing to your head and color rushing to your eyes and light. It was, you can kind of get it in this room a little bit. Even just talking about it can wake up the reality, just, just discussing it right now, I can kind of feel a little bit, but I walked around like an alien, like an alien. And that's like another Duncan Trussell thing where I was like, I'm in this meat spaceship. Yeah. And maybe I was a spirit that elected to come to this planet. That's one of my favorite little fantasies that I entertain and, and for once I was, I bought the ticket to the show and the show was Pete walks around his bedroom and then he opens the door and he sees that there's five doors in his hallway and he laughs and he gets in the bathroom and the tile is colder than the wood and that makes him laugh and smile. And he sees light coming in and you kind of like, this sounds like a trip, doesn't it? It sounds like mushrooms. I looked at light and I said, there's vitamin D in this light. My skin gets information from this light. Everything is here because of this light. It doesn't quite make sense talking about it. Makes sense to me, man. But I walked around and I never wanted to leave that space. And ever since I got there, you can get there back there a little bit because you were there and I can certainly get back there from meditating. Here's a crazy idea. And it wasn't even that hard to do. Here's an idea. What if what we've done here, what if we, there actually is a heaven and we fucking took the brown acid. What do you mean? Human neurology. We were God on brown, you know, and what is brown as it? Oh, the bad acid. Don't go in the human bodies. You're in heaven. If you go in the human bodies, it can get really fucked up. Yeah. Don't go in the weird dissenters that were like, fuck you. Nobody tells me what to do. Yeah, man. I'm partying. So we fucking pop these human neurologies and now we're having these like insane shit trips, like when people eat the Torah or what are called delirians. And now we've like created this leaf. You just projected shit all over heaven. So we've just like basically like put on helmets smeared with diarrhea and we're looking into heaven through a lens covered in our own excrement. Yes. So when you, what you're talking about is like through meditation, you're kind of like cleansing that lens for a second. And suddenly you're looking out and all these things that used to seem so mundane. So silly, so stupid, boring, dull, gray, all of a sudden every little fucking particle, every, every little minutia of this world that we're in is fully satisfying, fully gratifying and is enough. Right. We don't need anything else. We don't need anything. We don't need money. We don't need a Roomba. Right. We just need this moment and we're fulfilled. Right. That's insane. And a lot of people can't accept that idea. You know why? Because it fucking mouth fucks capitalism. It fucks capitalism up. It really does. It's like, how the fuck are you going to sell somebody a goddamn Mitsubishi if they're completely in love with their pillowcase? Right. Or if they know they're okay already. Yeah. It's tough. Right. It's tough. It's a real tough sell. Yeah. So it's almost as though, if you want to get back to what we were talking about in the beginning, I had even conspiracies, it's almost as though there is a financial, there is a financial motivation to keep people, too many people sitting there and being like, I'm, I have everything I need right now. Right. Because goddamn, that doesn't work. Right. It really doesn't work. Right. It doesn't work to give somebody the perfect thing. We need to give them an iPhone and the knowledge that there's going to be another iPhone. You know what's cool about you, Pete, which is, um, uh, I really like, because, you know, I'm saying like, you run into all these fucking people and they like, they're having success and they're like, they just seem unhappy. You don't seem like that. And you're having some of the most, you're having like the big, is this your question? This is my question. You're having like the big, and I feel weird. Like it's, well, you have to end soon. I feel weird ending it on such a Monday and topic after you really did. Just blow my mind with like calming the dreamer. Isn't that great? Don't wake up this dude. Calm the dreamer. Don't wake the sleeping God. Something's dreaming you. You were a sleeping God. Don't wake it up, but, um, it's interesting because by calming the dreamer, you wake the dreamer, I guess. But yeah, um, so the, uh, the, the question, yeah, here's my question. I got the big ice cream Sunday. That's what happened. So you have, you, what are you going to be the host of your own show? Yes. What is this show? You know, it's funny, man. You, Dung and Trussell were like the only person for somebody. I'm not a superstitious person, but you, you walk a fine line between bragging about something, you know, when you get good news and you're like, well, I probably shouldn't tell old Billy. Yeah. You know what I mean? By the way, Timothy, you shouldn't tell people about your success. Cause it drives some people want to fucking strangle you. Right. You got to keep, you got to keep away from that. And honestly, I'm not aware of that. I know I must have haters and there's got to be some jealousy, but I'm, I'm blissfully unaware. Also, by the way, when I was talking about that common, the dreamer thing, I think it was Timothy Lyria, when he was dying, said that when he was in the hospital, he used to see like a bug crawling across the floor and it would make him cry. It felt a little bit like that. I bet he was like a hundred times calming his dreamer, like waking up to the beauty of an ant crawling around, which sounds so hippy, but fuck it, man. Fuck it. Fuck everybody. Yeah. If you're, if you're in the way, go fuck yourself. Oh, beautiful thing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fuck everybody. Everything's beautiful. Fuck them. I mean, I don't need permission to go to recess. If I want to talk about light being beautiful. Sure. And then talk about crucifying your enemies on their own spinal columns. You're allowed to do that. I don't know what I just said. Yeah. No, I loved it. So, um, okay. Okay. So yes, I'm hosting the show. The dream of dreams literally came true for me being Conan O'Brien has been a personal hero of mine for as long as I can remember really when I was in comedy and I did a show a number of a number of times to is the number that is a number of times. And, uh, and then I met with him and I met with his producer and they were talking about trying to find somebody to that had a similar sensibility that would be in that, uh, same tone, a natural progression. So you watch Conan for an hour. Who are you going to watch for a half an hour after? Cause one of the reasons Conan went to TBS was so that he could kind of, um, have, have, uh, more of a presence than just his show. Yeah. He wanted to make other shows. So he's making Deon Cole's show, the black box, and he's making my show, which we think we're just going to call the Pete Holmes show, to be honest. And it's a, it's like a Conan O'Brien, you're going to be at a desk. There's going to be, yeah, great question. I often get the desk question, uh, I'm open to anything. It's an adventure. It's not a, uh, it's not a stencil. It's not a formula necessarily that we're going to follow. I'd like to, uh, walk the line enough so people will identify it as a late night talk show once a week. It's four nights a week, half hour, four nights a week. Holy fuck. Yeah, I know. So you got to do monologues and stuff. Well, you see, it's funny. Can you do something for me? Sure. Introduce your show. Studio audience here. And imagine it's not me. You're looking at a studio audience. You're standing on that sweet, polished floor. Yeah. Pete Holmes show. You know how the floors are always shiny? It'll be a shiny floor. You're standing on the floor. You're wearing these clothes. I didn't know what the plug-in clothes are. I'll show you the pilot. You could, you can see this. So you're standing here. Let's hear the, I want to hear what the intro sounds like. What I say. Yeah. Oh my God. Hello, everybody. Welcome to the Pete Holmes show. And then they all cheer and I go, we're really, we're really doing it. This is a complete dream come true. Tonight, our guest is a Duncan Trussell is going to pop by. I'm so disappointed. I drove, I drove up from Harlem. I couldn't get tickets to Conan. Fucking bad night. This is an idiot Duncan. Yeah. No, they'll love it. Well, it's actually funny. One of the ideas is to have more friends on the show because it is. It's midnight. It's going to be like a clubhouse feels going to be like a playhouse feel. We're not a big dog in the fight, you know what I mean? So I'd like it to have, I'd like, if I can maintain some of the tone of podcasts like this and podcasts like my own, some of the I know it's very hard. And we're not going to force it, but I'd like to, I'd like to find the television version of this novel. You'd almost have to do a separate recording. Like you'd almost have to. No, I know. We can't have these conversations. Well, yeah. And but also like when you plop a comic down in front of a fucking audience, it's different there. Yeah. Cause they're they're instincts shift. But we already had segment idea. We almost did it for the pilot, which was like Pete and Duncan do X, Y or Z. We just didn't do it because we were like, I don't know how trippy we want to X to C. But Pete and Duncan, what was the idea? It was something I have different ideas for different segments, but certainly things with you, where we go and we get our auras read or not just to be silly, but like do some past life shit or like go do TM or like, it'll be funny. It'll certainly be funny by virtue of being us. It'll be funny. And if it's not funny, you don't, you don't air it. You don't air it or you put it online. But the idea that we won't necessarily be doing a monologue in I call it the public address, which, which is just meaning I'm going to come out and talk directly to the audience and the camera doing something that closely resembles my stand up. That'll be act one. Act two will be sketches, kind of like the Batman stuff that we've done and like the doctor videos that we've done with front page films. Cool. That'll be all throughout act two and also some like tape stuff with celebrities like Joel McHale, did the pilot Wayne Brady, like some really random hilarious dudes were on there. Kyrie Irving, who's a basketball player who I didn't know. We did this amazing thing where I taught him how to talk trash, just like, you know, field pieces when I'm playing myself. Sketches where I'm playing other people, other characters. And then the third act, which my producer is pretty bent on always having a guest. I'm open to it being either way. We have a long show and there's more sketch or we have a show where there's no sketch and there's two guests. I don't give a shit. Conan keeps telling me time and time again. He's like, get it on its feet. Then you'll know what the show. That's right. Yeah, I agree with Conan. Yeah. Why wouldn't you have no experience with anything when he talks? I'm just like, whatever you say, but that is something I was thinking about that is like, I really hope that they, because I can remember a long time ago when the Conan show started and you watch it and it's like, he was rusty. Like it's, it's a, well, that's his big thing. He was like, he didn't want to do a pilot. He didn't want to do a, we're doing a four or six week run. I'm not sure. I think it'll be four, maybe. Yeah. He was like, at the beginning, he was like, we're not doing a pitch. We're not doing a pilot. You put him on the air for a year because that's how long it takes. It should be. And I have faith in TBS and I have faith in Conan that they're going to give us a shot that they're going to let us. But they're starting with four weeks. Yes. Which some people are like, well, that means you're fucked. And I'm like, I don't think so. I think we're going to be fine. The pilot was one of the best experiences. I think no, it was the best experience. When you start taping, we're going to start taping, uh, remotes and stuff and sketches in August in a couple of months. Man, you should start, you should start putting up a show somewhere where you could just start practicing. I did it last night. It's at Largo once a month. See, you took my advice and reverse where I'm going out and doing like newer stand up and then I have a stand up and then we do a panel afterwards. And then we have a musical guest. It's very similar. So if you want to come, it's called Pete Holmes living in Largo. A sleep tattoo. Yeah. Just really throw a curveball at TBS. Shave your head and get a sleep tattoo. It's weird to say that because like doing this show, because there's no way and anyone could like, uh, they don't know everything that I'm about. There's no way they could be. So like when we're doing the show and we're talking about like, uh, mushrooms or I know they don't care. Like I'm going to be who I am and they, and that's who they're invested in. But it is weird that you have a mild awareness where you're like, I couldn't get a sleeve tattoo, not that I want to sleep tattoo, or I couldn't say this, or I kind of have to be a little bit more careful. Well, when the fuck are you ever going to get a sleeve tattoo? Or what do I have to say that I have to be careful about? That's what I'm realizing. But I'll tell you this show got picked up and then I, uh, tweeted that it got picked up and then I was like, what is my next tweet going to be? Cause all my tweets online, which is Pete Holmes with an S now, by the way. I'm not a Z. Uh, what do you mean? I, I got Pete Holmes instead of Pete Holmes with a Z. What the fuck am I following? No, you, it swapped out automatically. You didn't have to change it. Oh, it did. But if you tweet at me, you have to do with Pete Holmes with an S. And also I kind of cut you off when you're talking about your Largo show. When is the Largo show? It's once a month. It's called Pete Holmes living at Largo. You can go to Largo-LA.com to get tickets to that. Okay, cool. Uh, those are great. John C. Riley did the first one. We've had some amazing, uh, Sarah Watkins, this amazing musician that I was listening to and it was making me cry on the ride over. It was amazing. Like blue grass. You should get Father John Misty on there. Do you know that? I have him. Yeah. Oh, to do the show. Yeah. I'd love to get him. I'd love to get him. Uh, Lou Barlow. Okay. Well, you should, I should email these to the guy, uh, cause I don't book the music as, but I'd love both of those people. But, uh, I remember after the show got picked up. So the first tweet was like, Hey, the show got picked up. Oh my God. Like 500 favorites and all this sort of stuff. And then you're like, my next tweet was going to be something like stupid. Like even when I'm single, I'm only partially ready to mingle. And I, and I remember looking at that tweet and I was like, can I tweet this? Can I send this? Or are people going to be like, this is the guy they're giving a show? Yes. And that's why I was like, fuck that. Yes, it is send. Yeah. You know, man, that's the thing you're going to have to like actively beat back the calcification of the persona that you're creating on air. Well, that's what it's the Beatles, man. It's Radiohead. I'm sorry to, I'm sorry to make put myself with those greats, but it's like constantly never letting people nail you down completely and be like, you can't say I'm now a talk show host, Pete Holmes. I'm not going to be homogenized or pasteurized. I'm going to keep being the guy that I'm trying to be all the time. It's not just the act. It's every day. It's not just podcasts. I'm striving to evolve and be real and be more real and be funnier and be more funny, you know what I mean? So just cut to two years later. You passed me on the street. I'm homeless. I'm like, Pete, you got to eat knowledge. You got to eat. Look at the fuck was that? I don't know. Some bum. You're a fan fire now, man. I did you on my podcast. I got to change my fucking voice, man. I got to go to us. No, that is not. You think I came here to make you feel worse about yourself? I'm just kidding. I like my impression. I like the, I like that people are doing impressions of me immensely flatter. Sure. Can I look at my list and see if there's anything I really wanted to tell you? Presence, meditation, Scientology, simulation, pyramid. I bought a meditation pyramid. It's pretty cool. What the fuck is that? I just sometimes meditate underneath a pyramid. Here's the cool thing. You I got it. Wait, wait, wait, what? I got it on the Amazon. Well, you know, I love astral projection. It's like, it's like this big. What is that? Thirty, thirty two inches. You hang it. I hang it from the light above my bed and sometimes meditate underneath it. You go completely under it like a tent or just. No, no, no, it's it's just bars. It's just bars of metal. So you can see through it. In fact, spiders love making webs in it. You guys see why I love beat homes, don't you? This is this is like I'm not here to fuck around after people say meditating under a pyramid makes it better. I'm like, I have thirty dollars. I can get a pyramid. I don't give a shit. It's the one embarrassing thing in my place. I have to take it down when guests come over. I'm like, that would be stupid if I had a pyramid. And then the people it's like, Dr. Seuss, those who mine don't matter and those who matter don't mind. Some people are like, who cares? Get a pyramid. The reason I got it was because Robert Monroe, the, you know, kind of grandfather of what is it, astral projection. In his second book, Fire Journeys, it's right in the beginning. So he's writing more about how he was leaving his body voluntarily. And this will be briefed just in case people don't give a shit about this. Somebody, he went back to his old house and he was like, this is where it's first started happening. And if you remember, Robert Monroe started leaving his body without giving the order. So he'd just be sleeping and he'd wake up floating above his body and he'd be like, holy shit, I think I'm dying. Then he realized slowly over time that he could control it and he went on these incredible journeys, which he wrote in a book called Journeys out of the Body, which I highly recommend. Very interesting book. Second book is called Fire Journeys and he takes a friend back to his old house where he started leaving his body unintentionally without giving any sort of order. And the guy was like, look, your bedroom where you were sleeping and having these experiences, the roof is a perfect pyramid. It has the same dimensions as the pyramid of Giza and it's even covered in copper, which before the looters came into Cairo or wherever those pyramids are, they were capped with copper. So some sort of conduit metal, like a spiritual metal or whatever. So he was like, OK, maybe it's pyramid power, which is what they called it. Or maybe it's not. He didn't even buy into it, which even makes him even more badass. Because if it were me, I'd be like, that's obviously it. We've got to get pyramids. But I was like, that's it, man. I haven't even been trying to do that sort of thing because it still kind of terrifies me. But I was like, I'll sleep under one after a while. The first night I went to bed under it and it freaked me out. I had to take it down. Second night I fell asleep. What happened the first night? Nothing happened. But I was just like, is this a portal? Am I letting something in? I'm afraid I am single. I sleep alone, scared. Now I sleep under it every night and it doesn't it doesn't bother me. It doesn't make my dreams any more intense. But keep in mind, I'm the guy who lets his chiropractor convince him that he's weaker or stronger. I do feel like I'm like, oh, I like meditating under the. Let me just say that. I'm not going to say it's more effective or less effective. You like it. There's something deliberate. It's like a church. You're like, I'm going under the pyramid to meditate. Look, man, I love it. You know what I like when I meditate? I like to like candles. Yeah, there you go. I like to burn incense. It's a little ceremony. I like to create a space. And I'm under the pyramid. And you have a pyramid and I think that there's, I think you have. You should do that. I think that's very important. Who cares? I have no dependence and then I have $30 that I can throw away on a pyramid. And then, you know, if a girl, if I'm hanging out with a girl or something, the pyramid comes down. I should. I shouldn't. Not always. Not always. In fact, leave the pyramid up. You're fucking right. Leave that fucking thing up. You know why? Because it's recess. And also they'll love it. I know. Well, that's actually the truth is, is like, love me, love my pyramid or love me, love the fact that I'm the kind of guy who like you, Duncan. I learned this from you. I've learned a lot from you. It's completely true. I told you, you like saved my spiritual life a big way. I call you, brother, not lightly, not lightly. You're very important. And I told you the most requested return guests on the show. We will have to do. Although I'm going to tweet this episode like it was an episode of my show. Mine as well. I mean, like, I'm not going to release it. But I'm just going to like get people to listen to it. Thank you. I love it so much. I love talking to you so much. But that sort of thing where it's like, we can we can throw ropes into the dark abyss, the weird places and have the power to come back. And that's what keeps us from being lunatics. We can recreate in the crazy parts of the mind. It's our power to return that keeps us able to eat gluten free cookies and go to Starbucks without being like, it's an illusion. We're on a planet. Yeah. Well, we can play all the different roles. You know, that's the idea. We can have our own show, be friends with Conan O'Brien and God damn it. We can meditate under a pyramid. Who gives a shit? As you said, we're we're we're here. We're here for a finite time. We're in a meat spaceship. Yes. And we came to this planet. We came to this dimension. We only have a certain amount of time. So we're in a decaying meat spaceship. We're all aware that it goes away candles burning. Right. The candles burning, which is by the way, one of the reasons why I think we elect to come here, like you're looking at a pamphlet. We're in some eternal realm and you're like, do you want to go to earth? Apparently in the thought that we all die makes cake taste better. Also, yeah. And they're like, I want to taste better cake. By the way, if I'm sitting at a video arcade in the distant future, where there's super high tech neurological interfaces that allow me to experience entire lifetimes and moments. Yeah. And one of the games is like, you you don't come out of the game. And the other game is like, you there's a natural shut off. You'll come out of the game. Yes. Don't worry. I'm going to pick the one I can come out of, not the one that I'm stuck in forever. No one's going to do that game. You got to have an escape hatch in the fuck. It's like, I don't know. See death is this is an alarm. You know, it's a thing that just like it's time to like play more games later on down the road. Fuck it. Amen. And you tried to wrap this up 20 minutes ago.

It's me, Dee Trussell, and you're listening to the Dunk of Trussell Family Hour podcast. If you're new to the podcast, this podcast is being recorded on 50 acres of beautiful farmland in Omaha. That's where the DTFH collective lives. I'm just the mouthpiece for the collective. And I feel lucky that I've got this job. But certainly, if it were just me, we'd have not much. The podcast requires all kinds of things to function. For example, I have to have several psychoactive ointments rubbed into my perineum, my nipples, and my lower nape just so that I could do these openings. Without the ointments, I'm basically a slobbering mass of nothingness. I just collapse like one of those air mattresses, just kind of deflating down. So every morning, Frater Josiah wakes me up, and he rubs psychoactive lotions and ointments that have been extracted from forest toads, Monarch butterflies, Coranian beetles, dog mantises, and a little bit of fern undulates into my perineum and into my nape and into my nips. And then I slowly come to, I wake up, they pull me out of my sleeping vat, and then they place me in an electronic scooter, also known as a Badger scooter. They're fantastic if you listen to, if you watch Fox News, you've probably seen advertisements for them. And if you want to get a Badger scooter, just use offer code CARBS when you go to BadgersScooterOverdrive.com. These Badger scooters are incredible. They are the only scooter out there right now that can not only achieve speeds of up to 85 miles per hour, but they also have the ability to peg you as well as to via the pegging injects some pretty high grade ketamine into your body, which is just the best way if you're going to take your ketamine infusions to do it. A lot of people, they get intramuscular ketamine, but it's a needle. I'm afraid of needles. I prefer the old fashioned wheelchair pegging model of receiving my ketamine. Regardless, use offer code DUNKIN and you will get 10% off your first Badger scooter. Now, the new Badger scooter model, the Badger Chrome, also can achieve speeds up to 95 miles per hour. And each Badger scooter comes with a Nintendo switch. And they've got a special adapter that you can put the switch in. It's wonderful. I didn't mean to do an advertisement up front, but definitely check them out if you're looking to get great ketamine infusions while you shoot around your compound in your super fast Badger e-chair. Also, by the way, they're weaponized now. So you don't have to have that option. But my Badger has two, you heard me, two assault rifles, which are mounted on either side. I don't use them except for hunting. But I think you know what I'm saying. Anyway, we have got a fantastic podcast for you today. Ashley Matthews is here with us today. You probably know her as Riley Reed, an adult film star. I think she's got to be the top of the charts, like the top adult film star working today. And I've been a fan for a while, but that is not the only reason that I invited her on the show. The reason I invited her on the show is because a few years ago, I was lucky enough to meet her at a boat party at Comic-Con. And we had a great conversation. And then she followed me on Twitter, which is like, oh, shit, that's cool. That's whoa, cool. And then I sent her a DM and asked if she would come on the show. And I was amazed when she said yes, from cooking to eating dogs to atheism, we covered all in this episode of the DTFH with Ashley Matthews. We're going to jump right into it. But first, some quick business. Friends, being the mouthpiece of a spiritual collective in Omaha is not quite as easy as it sounds. For example, every full moon, half moon, and sister moon, I have to pleasure my many husbands and wives. And if I fail to do this on the regular, then I will be placed on the altar of sacrifice, which is why I'm so excited about today's sponsor, Blue Chew. Blue Chew brings you the first chewable with the same FDA-approved active ingredients as Viagra and Cialis. Blue Chew is prescribed online by licensed physicians, so you don't have to go to the doctor's office or wait in line at the pharmacy. And it ships right to your door in a discreet package. For me, that discreet package is very important, because if brother Carlos were to discover that I was using Blue Chew to enhance my sexual performance during our love-making rituals, then I would be placed on the altar of sacrifice as the elder's decree. So I need Blue Chew. I've tried Blue Chew. I love Blue Chew. I've tried many others. Many other of this brand of particular magical medicine and Blue Chew does the trick. I would not recommend this to you if I hadn't taken that terrible leap of faith to try it out. I've chewed it up. I've swallowed it. And I've experimented with it. And sweet friends, praise God, it works. I used to have to swipe these things from my urologist's office when he wasn't looking, the sample packs. I don't have to do that anymore, because of Blue Chew. Right now, we've got a special deal for our listeners.

Welcome to the DTFH, Ashley Matthews. It's the Duncan Trussell film. Ashley, welcome to the DTFH. Hi. Thank you so much for doing this. It's so cool that you're giving me any of your time. You got to be really busy, huh? A little busy, but thank you. I appreciate you also sharing your time. So thank you. Thank you. We were just having a great discussion regarding prior to recording, which often happens at the podcast, unfortunately, where we are just starting to talk a little bit about the occult magic Alistair Crowley, who you have, I guess you haven't heard of much. No, but I'm very curious to learn more about him. Well, maybe that's a different podcast where I get to teach you about Crowley. But I am curious if you have, and I don't mean to like, it's the worst when someone asks you to put yourself in a box, especially when it comes to sort of spirituality or do you have a particular, like when you think about your standing in the universe, do you have a, like sometimes I think, am I a Buddhist? I think I am. Am I a Satanist? I don't know. I know some pretty cool Satanists. You don't have to be like, I don't know. But do you ever like ponder to yourself, what the heck am I? Yeah, there are times. I don't know if you know Sam Harris. I really love Sam Harris. And so I think in my more recent years, I've started to adapt myself or call myself an atheist a bit more. I know a lot of people are really into this concept of us being like in a simulation, which I don't know if I'm totally in that idea. And I don't know about the whole higher power thing. And I don't know about the bang theory, the big bang theory or anything. But yeah, I kind of think, I forget who it was, but like I kind of just think we're all like a frequency to some extent. And I think there's like 14 frequencies. And we're just one of them. And when we die, we become a new frequency. Are you talking about Tim Leary's circuits of consciousness model? Maybe. I don't really know. It's something like that. It's like Tim Leary. He was the great Tim Leary. Yeah. And he had some model of consciousness, which is this idea that humans evolve through these levels of consciousness, that one of the levels can't even happen until you're in zero gravity. Like it's sort of the way locusts are just fucked up grasshoppers. Like when grasshoppers overpopulate, they mutate. So Tim Leary was saying that humans, when they go into space, are going to mutate in a specific way that's going to evolve us to like whatever the next thing is we're going to be. Interesting. Yeah. So circuits of consciousness, atheism, which of all the things right now to say that you are, that is not in fashion. When people, it used to be, like atheism went through like a cool period. And now if you're an atheist, people are like, oh, really? An atheist? They get beat up all day long, not literally. But do you ever get that from people? Like, do you ever get judged for your lack of belief? Yeah, definitely. Because I think also most people are into saying that they're spiritual to some extent. And I don't even know if they know what that means. They just believe in like mother nature-esque. But I don't like I have it like in my Twitter bio, atheist, porn star, animal lover type of a thing. And so many of the comments on Twitter will be like, oh, why are you atheists? Like, blah, blah, like attacking me and whatnot. But nonetheless, it hasn't been like a grotesque experience for me. Right. People seem to be pretty, I don't know, maybe people just look past it or. Sure. I mean, you know, who knows? Either way, that's the, I'm really into this philosopher named Robert Anton Wilson and his advice, which is maintain agnosticism. The reality is you can't know. We don't know. I mean, you know. It's true. We have no fucking clue. No clue. So why am I going to believe in something that I don't even know if exists or not? That's right. Yeah. I mean, and also there's so many like Buddhists, you could be a Buddhist atheist, no problem. You could be a Jewish atheist. It doesn't keep you out of a few clubs. Some clubs you're not allowed to be in unless you believe in a higher power. But I'm not an atheist. When I was a kid, I was, but then I just, I can't, I don't know. I just don't seem to be able to like, make sense of the whole thing enough to be like, well, this is just an accident. No, I mean, I certainly know there's people smarter than me, you know? Yeah. I think it's just hard to like grasp the idea of something. And when there are just so many of them, it's kind of like, I don't know, just be a good person. And that's it. Yeah. You know, it's really a noise atheist. And I agree with it. This annoyance is people who say, well, how can you be a good person if you don't believe in God? Well, that is stupid. It's so dumb. Cause God doesn't keep you from being, you should just be a good person. I love like mankind and humans and like, like real life interaction. So I want to just enjoy my present moments. So that's kind of like me, it's just like, be present in what's right now. Don't live for your death. I like, there's like this one, Alan Watts, life is a journey or something like that, like little lecture. And he's like, talks about how so many people live to, for their afterlife and nobody's living for their current life. Yeah. Yeah. I think about that all the time. Like, you know, should I be transported to the realm of the gods? How long before I'm miserable again? You know, it's like a millennia, a few hours. Like eventually you're gonna be complaining, right? And eventually it's just not gonna seem that special to you. So this is, I think is, you know, one of the great dreams is that, you know, upon extinction of the physical body, you get transported to some paradise realm where you're happy forever. Yeah, but I feel like that's just an idea for mankind to just relax on the fact that death is coming. So why, everyone's scared of death. So you have to think of some sort of like way to ease the pain instead of just accepting that death is just death and who the fuck knows. Are you, you're not scared of death? Not really. I'm only scared of pain. I don't want to experience pain while dying, but everything dies. So we just have to accept it. Right. I also, I think I'm grateful for the life that I lived, so I'm not afraid of death because I'm happy. Right. Yeah. Well, I mean, I'm afraid of death. Like I went through a few months ago, a really obnoxious phase of being like, I'm not afraid of death. And then I thought, well, somebody's trying to kill me. Well, that's it. You're afraid of pain. No, I'm afraid of death. Really? Like for sure, if someone came and said, listen, I can kill you or like punch you in the face. It's punch me in the face. I guess that's a dumb example. My point is, yeah, the pain is- Nobody wants pain. I don't want any pain. But also like if there was a moment where something was trying to kill me, I would be terrified, not of the pain of the death of the die. I'd be scared of what happens to my baby or my wife or all these thoughts, you know, would come through my mind. But I don't, I'm not neurotically afraid of death. I used to be neurotically afraid of death. I know a lot of people are neurotically afraid of death and it's kind of sad. Yeah. They just like are so obsessed with the possibility of dying and it's like you're not living right now. Right. Now that's a powerful choice for a person to make though, isn't it? Like to decide you're gonna start living means that you kind of have to go off the map, right? Yeah. Like you went off the map. You went way off the map. Maybe. I think so. I think your profession, one would say, is spectacularly off the map. There's not, you can't tell anyone your job without there being a pause, a moment of, except fellow adult film actors. So it's off the map in the sense there's not a lot of, you know, if like I want to be this or that, I can probably find a precedent for it. Like volumes and volumes and volumes of the troubles of being a psychologist, which you studied in school. You know, volumes and volumes and volumes on the troubles of being a healthcare worker or even accountant, whatever. But you're in a pretty tiny club, you know, relative to other businesses out there. Meaning that you are off the map as far as I could tell. Your experiences are, I would say, non-standard. You know? I agree. You've got this glimpse into a specific bubble of like what it's like to be free at that level, sexually. But then also what it's like to be constantly, like it's kind of like an outsider's job. Yeah, it is, I agree with you. Yeah, but that's a decision to live. And a lot of people would say that ain't a decision to live. That's a decision to die. You know, that's, so for a lot of people, I think it's really quite difficult to go off the map. You know? It is. I mean, I also didn't really consciously know what I was doing when I, you know, got off the map. I kind of just was enjoying myself. And it wasn't until years later that I realized what the world actually perceives as this and the way that I've now, I've made my kid the weird kid at school kind of on accident. I didn't mean to become the outcast. It kind of just happened. Now I'm like living with it and seeing it. And to some extent, I think I've more recently kind of brought myself a little bit out of being that awkward outcast, but I still am the weird girl at school. Right, the outsider. Yeah. I mean, this is a mythologized figure. It's in so many things that experience. And it's on paper. It looks great. But then also, I think a great deal of loneliness goes along with that archetype. Like some kind of like mystical loneliness. Yeah, 100%. And from looking at your interviews and your YouTube channel, that's something that you kind of bring up just honest and honest like announcement of this. And I don't know when that video was. I didn't look at the date. More recently, I did some YouTube videos a while ago. And then kind of in the more recent years and months, especially, I've been wanting to claim this humanity of myself and be like, I am more than Riley Reed, the porn star. And I'm also Ashley Matthews. So there is no real separation of self, but there is because the character that I have allowed to be perceived is only the one Riley. So now I'm trying to be like, well, this other person sees and talks and experiences and says more words than just daddy, you know? Yeah. That's got to get so frustrating. Yeah. Because I was thinking, I guess in some distant way, porn and podcasting have a kind of similarity in the sense that they both, well, not all forms of podcasting, but the kind I do, generally involves a willingness to be pretty vulnerable about what's going on in your life and really laying it all out there, knowing sometimes that the stuff you say is not going to be well-received or it's going to make you seem cowardly or whatever, like a weirdo or whatever. Your cool friends may make fun of you for being overly, I don't know, confessional or something like that. And with porn, you're completely in this vault. It's a naturally vulnerable situation to be having sex. It is vulnerable as vulnerable can be. You're not wearing clothes. If you're doing a good job, you're in the moment and you're experiencing these crazy things. But the difference is when people know me for my life, for who I am, but people know you as this character you play. And so I could see how that would begin to feel really weird. Because people probably have an expectation of you to be more of that. They think that's who you are. Is it? No, it's not. Which is also one thing I was really excited about doing your podcast. We were like, we're going to kind of dodge the porn aspect kind of altogether because it gives me the opportunity to answer things and speak about myself in ways that are beyond that. Which I think that a lot of times I am catering to this identity that I've created. So it's been hard to sometimes step out of it. Yeah, I could see that. I was watching some interviews you were doing and thinking, oh, she's in character right now. And they're asking you questions that they would ask. Why the porn star? Yeah, and you're being broadly the porn star for them. And I'm interested in this. I'm interested in specifically why this separation happens in porn, in particular between the person and then the person in front of the camera. But first, I'm going to go euthanize my chihuahua. I'll be right back. This episode of the DTFH is brought to you by Fields. My friends, I am a CBD expert by now. And Fields is the best CBD out there. You just put some drops of this sweet amber-colored nectar under your tongue, and it is amazing. I've got sleeping problems. I have insomnia. It's tough out here on my commune in Omaha. We are surrounded by three different wolf packs who are all fighting and fighting us as well, not to mention the spirit from the graveyard that keeps tormenting me in my dreams. CBD, it helps me sleep. It's an anti-inflammatory. Whenever I'm sore from my many rituals of love making and from the Orgy Festival and from the whatever the thing is that Ted does to me in the Sheds, CBD helps. And I'm a big fan of Fields. There are many different types of CBD out there, and they're not all the same. I've tried probably all of them. Some of them taste like somebody scraped them off of a cat's ass. It's just a horrific tasting. Fields, it's like something out of dune. You've got to read dune to understand the reference. This is the spice melange. This stuff is good. It's magical. And it works. This is the other thing I love about Fields. The people running the company are really passionate about CBD. I got on the phone with them. We talked for a while. They understand the health benefits of this magical stuff that only recently has become legal so that we actually get to have it. I used to have to smuggle this stuff to my mom when she had cancer. But now you can have it delivered right to your door. Think about that. Things aren't quite as bad as they might seem, friends. It really works. I've got insomnia. It works for my insomnia. It works for a variety of things. I have friends who swear by this stuff for me personally. I love Fields. I slurp it down at night, like a little, like a bat sucking on a stalactite. I just like putting this stuff into my mouth. It tastes amazing. And also, if you're new to CBD, they've got actual human support. They've got a CBD hotline that will help you with dosages and whatever questions you might have. And I highly recommend them if you've been wondering about CBD or if you're dealing with insomnia, if you want something after you work out. Fields is the way to go for sure.

If you don't want to say the void, the void wept Fields into our particular dimension and it is wonderful stuff, give him a shot. Thank you, Fields. We're back. Yes. Okay, cool. Yeah, see, this is like, you know, any actor deals with this, I think. Oh, I'm sure. Yeah, yeah. Any kind of like character, I think do, I'm sure even comedians and stuff, they're like forced into this, you're the funny guy. Why, like, why are you serious at this moment? You're supposed to be the funny guy. Well, right. Oh, right. Yeah, that's an amazing thing to watch. Disappointment gradually dawn on someone's face who's meeting you offstage as they realize you're just like kind of serious and like maybe a little boring. Like, where are the jokes, man? Yeah. What's going on here? Yeah. It's like, I guess people are like, where's Riley? Who is this person? Yeah, it was weird. Like I went to AVN, which is like an adult convention. And because recently I've been putting out all of these YouTube videos, I had such a large amount of people come up to me who were like, well, like your videos like really touched me and like when you're talking about being depressed and I wasn't prepared to be Ashley in those moments. I was prepared to be Riley, the sex goddess, you know? So it threw me off. And when the first guy mentioned it, I almost started crying because I wasn't prepared or ready to hear that. And I eventually got used to it because so many people were like positively influenced, but it was a weird adjustment also for me because it's not what I'm used to. Right. Yeah. When I was watching your, the YouTube, I don't know what you'd call it. It's like a podcast. Oh yeah, YouTube podcast, I don't know. It's a podcast. Yeah. And yeah, I was really struck by how you were just like, just saying, oh yeah, yeah, you know, lonely. You were being so vulnerable and completely not the person from your shows. And I was seeing and I, oh, awesome. This is like, this is you, like this is a new branch on whatever the particular tree of your art is here. Do you ever consider like the possibility that you're probably going to just start acting in regular films? I mean, I don't know if I am desired in regular films, but I do expect that at some point my porn career will end and by choice, I think that, I think I'm kind of like on my way out actually. Oh yeah. Yeah. You got it. Yeah, that's such a bizarre profession. It's like modeling too, I guess. You at some point, you just, that's it. You're out. That's not fair and kind of weird, but for you, it's like also a personal choice. It's weird how it like starts to take a toll on like your sexuality and like just the energy you want to like put into those things. And like, I'm not as like aroused as I used to be. And like, I've like, I guess all in some, in some cases you think that you've become more deeper into like dirty fetishes and I've kind of been quite the opposite and become more vanilla and more vanilla and more traditional and normal and monogamous. And so I kind of want to like, I think I'm like, oh, I'm not really so interested in being this slutty version of myself that existed prior. Isn't that wild? It's so weird. Yeah, that's circle. You do this strange circle. I think that's one of the effects porn has on a lot of us is like you go through a cycle of like trying to find the most outrageous blasphemous stuff you could find. And then it sort of circles back around. You're like, just missionary position. Just wear all your clothes. Don't take them off. People holding each other and watching. Then you, then yeah, eventually it goes all the way back around. It's like a new kink is to be monogamous and a kind of nice intimate connected relationship. That's my new fetish is just dry humping. Don't even penetrate me. Yeah. Well, I could see that. I mean, eventually you've got to find something that is new, I guess. And if you've been doing that all the time, I get it. It's gonna be, it's so wild. And I said, we weren't gonna talk about that. And I meant it. It's okay. I knew we would like. No, but we're not, we're talking about sexuality. We're not really necessarily talking about the traditional porn things. Right. But even all that aside for a moment, one thing I, the first question I prepared for you was actually, what's your go-to recipe? Like if you're cooking for somebody. Ooh. I love to cook. So I'm glad you asked. I think my go-to recipe is like a roast chicken. So I get like, I go to this market called Cookbook. It's like in Highland Park. I love it. And I'll get like maybe. Can I stop you there for one second? Okay, let's talk about Cookbook. The one. Do you love Cookbook? Are you freaking kidding me? It's the best ever. Yes. I go to the one in Echo Park and it's tiny, which is a. They're both tiny. Oh, so you have to do the thing where you can't, like you can't even open the freezer without disturbing the person next to you. Yeah, it's a whole thing. It's a, it's a nightmare in there, but it's like some French market. Their produce is amazing, literally. I've compared the produce like side-by-side to Whole Foods because everyone thought Whole Foods was so amazing and everything. And it's like the sweet potatoes from Whole Foods are trash compared to the sweet potatoes at Cookbook. You have sweet potato opinions? Yes. Holy shit. I mean it, cause I'm just, you know. Dude, when I, when I turn my phone on, I'll show you, I have the craziest food list. I'm such a foodie and a food snob. People wouldn't even expect it. Okay, let's get to the sweet potatoes in a second. Let's talk about this roast chicken. So that's where you get it from is Cookbook. Yeah, that's where I'll get all my produce and things. And if I want other meats, I'll go to McCalls, which I don't know if you've been to McCalls butchers. I know, I've heard about McCalls from people, from other, from foodies. I have not taken the leap into McCalls. It's amazing. Well, you, yeah, I've heard that, I've heard it's incredible. Yeah, but so from making my roast chicken, I did quit drinking alcohol, but I will like drown my chicken in like white wine. And then I do like, I like rip all, like I dig into the skin of it. So it's like, you know, you're wearing it like a puppet. And I put like onions and lemons and oranges and beets and garlic and fresh rosemary. And they're all like fresh vegetables and herbs. And it's all salt and pepper. And I grind my own pepper, like, so I don't use the pepper grinder. I like use like the old spice. I don't know what they are called. I know what you're talking about. But like the old grandma bowls and- Wait, you use a mortar and pestle for your pepper? Yes, yes. Grandma bowls. I don't know, cause only grandma's use them. Or hipsters, oh yeah, there you go. Which is hipsters and grandma's? Yeah, the best. So you, you're like, this is so awesome. So you're like, you, how long does that take? I would go nuts. Not very long. And the chicken thing. Anytime I find my hand in a chicken's ass, which has happened a few times, like when I'm cooking, I always feel bad. It's like, oh my God. Yeah, look at my hand and like the carcass of this creature. I eat meat, by the way. I'm not doing something. I think I have no problem. Like when I do it, I'm like, oh yeah, I could kill a chicken. Like that's what I think. I'm like, yeah, I'm like a hunter lady. I could, I could kill it and skin it and rip off its feathers and chop off its head. Like no problem. I gotta get there. Cause I'm the worst kind of carnivore, a guilty carnivore. That's, it is kind of an all, but it's like, you know, I was thinking, if I were being murdered by a serial killer and the serial killer while murdering me was expressing regret, that would be way worse than if- Yeah, but it's the serial killer murdering you because he needs to live and survive. And it brings him like, you know, like we need the proteins and the vitamins. And like, if the serial killer is gonna kill you to eat you because he's, you know, at least there's some sort of like benefit coming out of it. I mean, I do agree. Like I don't want the animals to be tortured. I don't want them to like be in the like the little tiny cages and not be like, I would love to be able to grow that or I guess like raise them myself so that I know that they were like healthy. And then some people think I'm crazy cause I'm like, yeah, I would eat my pet chicken. Like I would eat my dog if dogs were edible because my dog has the best diet. I feed him the best and he's full of love. So that energy would be great and amazing. And maybe I'm a sicko because I would eat the animals I raise but at the same time I feel like then you know that they have sweet, good energy and good food and everything. I wouldn't eat my poodle if someone paid me to. I don't care if I was starving to death. And I'm not saying from some like humane perspective, I'm saying, cause if that idea that the energy of a being gets in your body, if I ate my poodle, I would just start screaming. I would just be like, not in pain but just random high shrill yips all day long. But do you believe that this is this idea that when you eat a thing, its energy goes into you. Do you believe that this is something I've heard? I think if you allow it, it could. I think if, but that's also maybe just you doing some weird on psychedelic self or you know, weird consciousness on yourself where you, if you think that animal had a bad life and you're eating it, then you're just going to feel that negativity inside you. So I think so. I often don't really like think about that stuff but I also think like I go to like good markets where my food is good. And most of the time like the restaurants I go to, I think are good restaurants that also like, like one time I got into an argument with my friend where I was like, no, this food is like, their eggs are organic. And she's like, no, they are not. And I was like, I will call them right now. And I called them and like their eggs were organic. I was like, I know I could taste it. Like you could feel the difference in the flavor of things. Yeah, I'm, yeah, I agree with that for sure. You can definitely tell the difference between something that was raised in the human way and not that being said, if someone did a scientific experiment, I'd probably be proven completely wrong. But I don't know at the same time, because like I said, I, I, I definitely can taste a difference between like though I can't eat whole foods, eggs anymore. I get nauseous and I get sick. Like there's times where I've tried where I was like, I don't have time to go to cookbook. They're, they closed. I'm going to go get some eggs from Whole Foods. And I've gotten sick from it. And not because I was like, Oh, these are Whole Foods eggs. I was like, oh, I need eggs. I'm getting eggs. And then I eat them. And I was like, oh, why don't I feel good? Right. And I was like, oh, maybe it's because they're Whole Foods eggs. Holy shit. I wouldn't be surprised. Yeah. I mean, you're shopping at like one of the greatest places ever. So, and I know all their stuff is local. And now we're doing like a cookbook commercial basically. It's like a telephone for cookbook. Well, I mean, if you're actually love something and passionate about it, I don't mind doing free advertising because cookbook is amazing. So they should go to it. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. But this is something I'm curious about. So you drown the chicken in white wine. You put in. Lots of butter. I use bacon grease as well. Cause I save all my bacon grease. And then you put some bacon grease in there. And you just like rub so much salt and pepper all over it and inside of it and in between the meat and the skin. So there's just like, and you put like, I squeeze lemon juice and orange juice and I'll put the orange skins and the lemon skins like inside between the skin and the meat. Yeah. And then just throughout it. And then like rosemary that's chopped up and cut inside, outside and just in between the like, I don't know, the pan thing that I use. Yeah. I know what you're talking about. One of, is it a glass? Wait, is it a glass pan? I use a porcelain one. Porcelain pan. Yeah. And then how, what do you eat that into? I cook it for an hour and a half, but you do 30 minutes each time and you rotate it. What do you mean 30 minutes each? So like you do 30 minutes, you flip it another 30 minutes, then flip it and then the last 30 minutes after flipping it again. Where did you learn this? I just basically taught myself this recipe. So, but when was it, when did you start? Like when? I think it was like just after one Thanksgiving, I was like, I love Thanksgiving turkey. Can I do basically the same kind of recipe on a chicken? Right. And so, and then I would just do like some kind of basic vegetables or whatever. And then slowly I was like, I want to do more and like add the lemons and the oranges and all these and I'll like slice up potatoes and I'll put in like Brussels sprouts. And so I just kind of put all kinds of veggies and stuff in there and we'll roast it and it's so good. What kind of oven are you working with? It's like a regular oven. So you haven't gone there? Like my friend, he's a, he got in, he got the bug and he's a, he's becoming like this really good chef. He had me over to his house for breakfast the other day and he makes this. That's interesting to invite your friend for breakfast. We were going to, it was the Tibetan New Year. And so we were going to this like Tibetan New Year thing and that was happening in the morning. Oh, that's fun. So that's why normally, yeah, I know that is interesting. Yeah, who goes to their friends for breakfast? It's really surprisingly intimate to be over there and like having coffee and like, it was really nice, but he taught me how to like a way of cooking bacon. How do you cook this bacon? You bake it. Oh, I've heard of this. Yeah, bake it. It's 400 degrees, 20 minutes, put it on a cookie sheet with aluminum foil, butter seems to be the crucial ingredient to everything. I didn't know you use butter for bacon. Well, a little bit on the pan and then it makes it. Now, I think I'm fucking up there. I don't, with cooking, I do. Are you not a cook? I'm wanting, I want to be and my mom was a really great cook and my dad was a really great cook. And I enjoy, to me, like I have these synthesizers and it reminds me of cooking a little bit. Cause when you're cooking, you get into this flow state. Yeah. You know, and it's really wonderful. I love it. I mean, I can't do that. I can't play with synthesizers. All those chords are crazy looking kind of give some stresses me out, honestly. Does it really? I'm so OCD and like organized, I'm like, ah. Try being stoned out of your mind with those chords. Trying to figure out what's happening. I think I would hang myself with them. You would hang yourself with CV cables. That's what they're called. I'm light enough. I think I could. I'm sure it's been done before. I mean, no doubt. Cause people who get in, once you go this far, just forget it. It's over for you. When I go to perfect circuit, perfect circuit is where I buy my synthesizers. That's my cookbook. And you go in there feeling ashamed. Like because it's an addiction and there's no, you don't need that. You don't need any. I don't need that. This is completely unnecessary. I'm not a musician. I just like doing it and you know what I mean? Like I just like it and everyone in there is like feeling the same way. But then also you go in there and you look around. It's all middle-aged dudes. It's like one of the, like when you get to be 45, you're either going to get tools and saws and start making furniture, or you're going to get into modular synthesizers. One, that's the, that's like my grandfather. He like, he made birds out of driftwood. Oh. Yeah. It was, and I loved he had a saws and sandpaper in the garage. It was cool. But this is the same thing. It's like you pour money into this and you make music with it. And then I'll play it for my wife. Oh. And no, she's just like, oh. You know, she's sweet about it. But I see behind the sweetness is like, you know, we're going to have to send the kid to school eventually. Right? Like, yeah. You're going to have to sell them. Never. We don't say that. You know what? I think that you're going to, you would eat your dog fine. Okay. But don't ever suggest that I will sell my modular synthesizer. Hey, but let's talk about creation, you know, because you're an artist. And I think like an artist sort of pours themselves into whatever happens to be, you know, cooking, certainly being one of the great art forms. Do you, do you have any other way that you create? Do you, outside of your work, do you have any other creative endeavor that you pour yourself into? Well, I'm quite the workaholic. So I find myself not often enough taking time away from that. But I did just buy a home that I'm renovating and, oh yes, I'm very excited. But I'm like basically renovating it. And if you want to see my home, it's kind of like a Pinterest mood board. So I'm like very like, I don't know. I love aesthetics. So I think that like when I was younger, I used to dream of like being an architect or like an interior designer. And that definitely comes off through my home. So I think with my new place, that's kind of been like the fun creative where I'm like demo this wall and put like a 12 foot window there and kind of like things like that. So it's been really, that's kind of been one of my funny, expressive creative things to do. And every time I go to the house and see things like slowly happening, I always actually want to cry when I'm there. And I like, and I'll like pat the walls of the house and I'm like, how are you doing house? I like talk to it like a crazy person, but it makes me just so happy. So I've been really enjoying that. Whoa, cool. So you're not even living in the house yet? No, no, not yet. Not until I think late April. Whoa, that's torture. It kind of is, but at the same time, I've been like videoing the whole thing. So I'll do like a whole vlog about it, like the before and after, but it is torture to extend. I go there quite often to just check up on like the status and I always get a little disappointed when I haven't seen much of a drastic change, but I just went in the other day and saw they finally demoed like four of the walls for big windows. And I'm like demoed, demoed, you're in so deep, you're abbreviating demolished. Listen, you're gone. I'm basically a construction worker now. You are. No, you're gone with the wind. I've seen people get sucked into that and it never ends. I know people who are constantly, constantly having this part of their house. Well, I'm redoing the whole house at one time. So like, I think, and then I'm also like very much so when things are done, it's done because I don't like to sit on projects. Like I hate when things aren't complete and that's actually like Alzheimer's prevention is completing tasks from start to finish. I'm doomed. Oh my God. Are you saying there's a correlation between not finishing shit and getting Alzheimer's? That's what they were saying that at least it's like a prevention. So I did that's 23 and me DNA test, which very scaringly, sadly told me that I carry two traits for Alzheimer's. And so that's like, I'm very, I'm like basically 70% likely to get Alzheimer's, which I was like, oh my God. And I'm like, I know like Seth Rogen does all these like Alzheimer's like prevention, like what is it called when you raise money? Charities. Yeah. And so I like, I've done some of that stuff and like supported his causes and I would like tweet like, please I want to remember all the dicks I've sucked. Like, can you, can you please help donate to this charity? And so I've done some research on it and it's like apparently Mediterranean food is really good for Alzheimer's prevention. Yeah. You're never going to remember that by the way. I don't remember. You don't like, we don't remember it. First of all, that's a big wish. And I don't mean just like dicks. I'm talking about like any pleasurable thing is like, we don't remember. It just as a matter of this is, I mean, if you really want to freak yourself out, do you ever like analyze how your memories are kind of wobbly, you know? Oh yeah. It's very interesting and weird. Yeah. And they're warped because they're all like within ourselves and someone can tell you some sort of little tidbits of information that was their perspective. And now your whole memory has been adjusted and now it's flawed. Yeah. Like you got a bug in your operating system. You got dinged by somebody. So you said you wanted to start off doing maybe interior design, but then you studied psychology in school. Bachelor's degree? No, I wish. No degree. No degree. No degree. So you went to college for that? Yeah. How long? How long did you go? Not very long, just a couple of semesters. Did you feel bored or was it just? No, I totaled my car and lost transportation. So that's why I started in the adult industry because I come from like a lower income class family. And so like the car I had was a gift from a family member and then I totaled it and was like, oh, I need money. And so one thing led to another and I started doing an adult and then I never went back. Right. So I think that maybe one day I will, but at the time, just currently I haven't. Why'd you pick psychology? Mental illness runs in my family. So schizophrenia and bipolar. So I have got multiple schizophrenic uncles. So I was kind of like, I know sometimes I worry. I'm like, because it happened for them around like 27 is when like the clock exploded or whatever, however the saying goes. But anyways, I- The talk clock exploded. I don't know. The talking clock exploded when they're 20. The talking clock exploded in their brain and then it just went all wild. Yeah. Now that is, that, you know, as someone, you know, I get depressed. I know that I'm always mental illness adjacent and sometimes I go over the line and that is a legitimate thing that really frightens me is like, not just if it's in your family, but just if you've got a brain. There is- Oh, I worry that one day I'm gonna go schizo and my fucking noggins are gonna get all crazy. You're fine. I hope so, but like they were fine and married and had children and then 27, I mean, I'm 28 now, so maybe past that time, but- You're over the line for that exploding clock. Hopefully, hopefully. But I talked to the walls of my house. Who doesn't? I say thank you to hotel rooms. It's okay to do that. The Lord is above a bunch of crazies. No, see, this is the atheist in you. You feel guilty because you're talking to the walls of your house. I feel fine talking to the walls of my house. I still talk to the walls. I don't feel guilty. Yeah, they would miss you if you didn't. Animism, I like it, you know, I mean, even if the material universe is a screen that we're projecting our identity on, it's still our identity being like landing on your house or landing on this or landing on that. Very lonely situation to get into if you're the main projector and everything else is a screen, but that being said, if that's the situation, then why not like talk to your house? And then the problem is from that, you can get to the point of like, well, okay, and then why not talk to the planet? And then if you're gonna talk to the planet, well, then why not talk to the universe? And if you're talking to the universe, you're praying. And if you're praying, are you still an atheist? See, I got you. Are you praying though? I am, I'm praying that you'll accept Christ into your life. That's why I had you on this show. I was in the whole thing was in trap. Derek, Derek, come out, bring the Bible. We're gonna convert you. Oh, you wish. No, I don't. No, I don't. I don't, I don't, no, I don't, I think that that, but I do pray and I love it. I mean, just as an experiment, you know, it's like, why not? What's the worst thing that happens? You're muttering to yourself. So what? So do you like pray to a God or do you pray to like the universe? Oh, I pray to God. Just as a term, just cause it's like, look, I understand it doesn't sound cool to say God. And it's an embarrassing, it's like. Well, to an atheist, yeah, to other people, it's cool. Yeah, to other people, it's could be cool, but then also there's a sense of like, really? You think that? I mean, really? Come on. I went, I go to these Ram Dass retreats in Hawaii where they're this teach, you know, Ram Dass, who that is. I feel like it's not like the yoga guy. Yeah. Yeah. Pals with Tim Leary. One went into scientific materialism, psychedelic land. The other went into like having a guru and teaching and becoming like a new age, a leader in the, I guess you would call it the spirituality movement, new age movement. Amazing, amazing, amazing human. But what was so beautiful about these retreats is that he would have these like Zen Roshis who were his friends for life. And like a Zen Roshi, talk to a Zen Roshi about God and see what they think. They might be polite with you, but you know, for them, they're more on your camp, which is like, let's hang out in the moment. If there's a God great, and if there's, you know, some divine intelligence out there, fantastic. But right now there's this. Yeah. And isn't this enough? Yeah, that's where I'm at. Yeah, yeah. It's a present. Yeah, it's the best. And it's a beautiful way to be. And then, but Ram Dass, it was in the Bhakti yoga, which is the yoga of love. And so he would say, this is my fantasy. You know, it's a fantasy. I remember I did a podcast with him and Roshi Joan Halifax. And after he said, this is my fantasy, referring to his idea of there being a divine presence, an eternal perpetual, sentient love energy that you can communicate with. This is my fantasy. Roshi Joan Halifax goes, finally, finally you admit it. It's a fantasy. And that's what I loved about these retreats. Cause both of these sides were brought together and they get to, you know, hang out, you know, because it's a fun thing. Either one is a wonderful way to be. I just like, you know, I love the, I'll tell you how I can't be an atheist. And maybe you can make me an atheist. It would be, because, you know, in some ways it's a bit of a relief. I mean, it takes a lot of cognitive load off of your mind to not have to imagine that you're intrinsically dipped into some kind of super intelligence that goes on and on and on forever. And you're one small, infinitesimally fragmental portion of this thing that's like all around you. I don't know. That's a lot to think about. It's like a lot of math, a lot of numbers on the board, man. So, but here's why I have a problem. Not why I can't get it out of my head. It's like, surely in the universe, there's other life. Right. Now that's a big surely. I know it's not, we don't know for sure. Oh, we don't know. But if I had to put money for Vegas and I had to bet, I'm betting there's life out there somewhere. And then if there's life out there, then I'm gonna bet there's like a hierarchy of intelligence. There's gonna be dumbasses in some distant galaxy, probably a planet of just pure dumbasses, just dumb, ridiculous, dumb grunting idiots that like eat dirt and like piss on each other as a religion or something, who the fuck knows? But then probably there's gonna be a sentience out there that's a million times more intelligent than us and a million times more intelligent than us and a million times more intelligent than that. And at some point that becomes, as far as I'm concerned, God. And that to me is the thing that I pray to or think about or try to connect with. And so how, if you can- So do you think that thing is like your creator? Do you, do you pray to just some higher intelligent being? Or do you pray to something that you think is who made all of mankind? Because also who created that thing? How did that thing come to be? Turtles all the way down, Ashley, turtles all the way down. You ever heard that before? No, what is that? So some, there was a story about when they were figuring out that the earth was going around the sun. The earth wasn't the center of the universe. That used to be a controversial opinion. And I'm trying to recall exactly who this person was. There's a great book called, it's like a brief history of everything anyway. If I remember it, I'll tell you after the podcast, but as the story goes, there's an astronomer talking about how the earth is floating in space. And a woman was completely appalled by this and said, no, the earth sits on the back of a turtle to which the astronomer said, well, what's the turtle standing on? And her response was turtles all the way down. So yeah, it's a fair question. And at some point, as far as I'm concerned, I don't really care. Actually, you know, there's a really good, one of my favorite stories in Buddhism, I'm gonna super abbreviate this. I think I'm making this a little bit about me more than about you, so I apologize. There's a story in Buddhism where Buddha visits the God, Brahma, the realm of the gods, the creator God. And to ask how can we ease the suffering of humanity? And the creator God, he appears wherever the creator God's hanging out, some palace or whatever God's hanging out in. And the creator God's like, you don't have an appointment, basically. Like, what are you doing here? Just show up, get out of here. All the other gods are sitting around watching this happen. And so the creator God comes to Buddha, like the next day meditating and says, listen, I'm sorry that I did that where I kicked you out, but here's the problem. These other gods, they think I'm the creator God, but I've just been here longer. I don't know where I come from. And I don't want them to know because it's gonna freak them out. And so I'm afraid that I can't help you with the problem of how to alleviate human suffering. You're gonna have to figure that out. And that is when Buddha knew he was fucked. Is what's worse than that? When God shows up, it's like, look, I don't know, man. I don't think I can help you with this one. Oh, what a mess. So yeah, I like, you know, who knows, I don't know. It's just more along the lines of like, but I appreciate the question. It's a good question. I don't know. I don't know that it matters. Like if it's an eternal never ending Russian doll of ever increasing levels of some sentience, great. I'll take it, whatever it may be. That being said, if it's nothingness, I'll take that too. I mean, I'm not gonna be extraordinarily disappointed if I die and blank out. What do you think happens when you die? I think that, I just imagine it's just dark and we cease to exist and that's kind of the end. And maybe there's some sort of like re-incarnation to the energy, but obviously there is no memory of it because we don't have any sense of it or anything like that. So I don't know, I just honestly just picture darkness and I was like, you just cease to exist and that's it. Yeah. Well, it's unfathomable. Who knows? Darkness, non-darkness. Yeah, I don't wanna picture this like, holy amazing afterlife. I don't picture a hell either. I don't know really what, I mean, obviously none of us know, but- What if you had to pick? What if I had to pick? Yeah, like if like the simulator came to you and was like, listen, we're gonna do an update. You can choose how we update the system. It's either gonna be perpetual darkness for eternity when sentient beings perish or we're gonna create a never-ending eternal cycle of birth and death. Nah, I think I'd rather the darkness. Woo! That's hardcore, that's so hardcore. I feel like- You're gonna turn off the TV? Yeah, I feel like it's exhausting. Life is exhausting. And so I would rather not continue this repetitive state of making bad choices and living a difficult life and seeing all the suffering and, you know, if Earth was this heavenly pleasant experience then possibly, but I feel like you can't guarantee, like I'm even terrified to have a child because I can't guarantee that they won't have a life without suffering or at least even the most minimal amount of it. So I don't know if I even wanna give myself that opportunity. I think that just do it once and then it's done. Right, I mean, that's the thing. That's what's so funny is like for an atheist, death is heaven, eternal darkness. Yeah, oh my God, I didn't even know I'm the ultimate atheist. Yeah, but equally, it's an equal fantasy, isn't it? Because like for an atheist, because like really like sometimes I contemplate like, yeah, like, wow, if it is like just, you know, the lights go down, then- It just sounds peaceful. And you like, it's the ultimate, when you win, that's a big win. Because all like whatever you did in this particular incarnation gets just, it's gone. Whatever, all your guilt, all of your debts, both like physical and psychological, all of it just- Yeah, all of your pain and your happiness is just- Gone. You can't sit in your own self anymore, which I think would be pleasant. Yeah, I mean, this is what we, that's the thing is it's so funny out the human mind, no matter what, attempts to connect to some post-death reality that is pleasant. Yeah, and what's more pleasant than complete annihilation. Yeah. Whoa, that would be amazing. That's the- But the thing is like based on my calculations here, which are completely ridiculous calculations, I would say, I don't know that we're gonna get that lucky, Ashley, I think this thing keeps going. And I think it keeps going, and not even like the way people think. Like these New Ages, they tell this story, it's a pretty story that you die, and well, it's not just New Ages. If you study near-death experiences, there's a universal phenomena where people who are dead, clinically, experience similar things regardless of culture, and that's pretty fascinating, because you would think that the mind would project something that would be culturally influenced to some degree, but it's always the same kind of story being that you have what's called a life review, meaning that you experience the sum total of all the pain or joy that you put into the world in one moment, you feel how you made other people feel. You're gonna feel like a million orgasms, a billion orgasms, but also anybody that you've hurt, you're gonna feel their pain. Anyone that you've loved, that's loved you, that you're gonna feel their love, it's called the life review. And then the New Ages take it one step further, where you pick your next incarnation. Yeah, based on what there is to learn. So it's sort of like, you're trying to evolve over time. Oh, that kind of, I've done acid in one of my, or at least two of my kind of more, I guess I would say bad acid trips, and it was the second one kind of picked up where I left off in this other one, was kind of like that where I was a number, and my number kind of started here, and it was like a small number that went around, like my entire body, and it was like, obviously over a million. And so I had basically, in this acid trip, lived my life so many millions and trillions and zillions of times, but I kept making mistakes in every life, and I kept having to relive it. And I was like, I basically saw God, which was me, I am God, and I am like the creator of my life, and I make all of these poor choices, and so I relive again until eventually I stop making bad choices. Yeah. Until I become the perfect human. Or, or, yeah. Or don't. Or don't, I mean that, you just- But the thing is that you're never aware of the things that you fucked up on until you die, and then you're like, okay, let's try again, you're not gonna be aware of any of it, so let's see if you can fix it this time. That's part of the game. It's like some kind of brutal combination of like Groundhog's Day meets Amnesia or something. Yeah. And yeah, and that's cause like the game wouldn't be quite as enjoyable if you remembered what happened before, not to mention like, think of like the- Well, then you'd be cheating. You'd be cheating, and also you'd still be pissed at people from like the 1400s. Like you'd be holding grudges against people during the plague and shit. It would be a mess. It's a lot to deal with. But yeah, I like that model of consciousness, and it is like, death is kind of like a filter. It filters out everything, but this like very basic quantum momentum, that's called your karma, and your sentience. Like your acid trip was essentially the way that in Buddhism, death gets described in a very similar fashion, which is why what we're in is considered, have you ever heard this before? We're in samsara, is what it's called, the wheel of suffering, which is the never ending eternal series of births and deaths. A human incarnation is not guaranteed sometimes, and it's all based on your momentum when you die. So like if you're, which is why it's considered really important to get happy and not happy, that's a dumb way to put it, but like it's considered like, all of life is preparation for this moment, because if you die freaked out, then that freaked out energy goes into your next incarnation. And so our freaked out energy right now, whatever your hangups are, whatever your repetitive patterns are, gives you a glimpse into what you've been struggling with for eternity. No, interesting. Yeah, it's a cool model, whether it's true or not, who knows, but it sort of puts a new light when like the same thing, I don't know if you have that happen to you or the same bullshit keeps happening over and over again, but in different forms. So when it happens, you're like, oh, there's that thing. It keeps happening. I bet it's been happening for millennia to me. This time, I'm gonna get it right. You know, whatever that means, you know? It could also just be confirmation bias. Four, listen to me, fucking Carl Shagan over here. I get it, I love it though. My dear friends do that to me all day long and I love it. I deserve to be shot down. I think that's the great thing about discussions is to ponder different, not that I believe in my own concept, but you know. Well, Sam Harris, you know, you're a devotee of Sam Harris and he's not gonna put up with that shit. I've read his books. You wouldn't do that. He meditates like seven hours a day or something and ice cold water. That guy's hardcore, but he doesn't suffer theism, you know, very much or any of that stuff. But I guess the real question would be like, why do you have to believe in it or not believe in it for it to be useful? You know, like this is a model of like a way to sort of place a specific color over your reality. Temporarily. That's what I do. I mean, it's like, oh, today I'm gonna live like I have incarnated an embarrassing number of times and keep fucking up over and over and over again. But this day, this day of all the incarnations, this is gonna be the day I don't do the same thing over. And I think that brings us back to kind of what we were talking about in the beginning, which is going off the map. You know, whenever you got in a car accident, I didn't know that was a thing that rocketed you into your wild life. How crazy is that? Talk about like mind-bending strangeness. You think if you hadn't been hit by that car, you wouldn't have gotten into the adult film business? No, I would not. I would have kept going to school because I had a mode of transportation. Youth, and you would have just. Yeah, because I loved school. I loved learning. I was like, and I did really good in high school. I took like college courses in high school. I was like a super smart girl. I still think I'm smart. You're smart. Yeah, I did really good in school. And then in college, I loved going to classes in college. I enjoyed it. And I just totaled my car. And I didn't want to do like city transportation because it would take a ridiculously amount of time. So I was like, oh, I'm just gonna get some quick cash. Wow. How many lives have been changed because of city transportation? Or just lack of income as well. I mean, that was like the huge part of it and no support from like my real family, so. No support in the sense they're like, well, we just don't have the cash. We can't. From my mom's side. My dad's side could have helped me, but I think a part of his whole concept was he didn't want to, I guess, handicap me, which I totally understand. He didn't want to enable me to become a codependent type of a person. So like, from a very young age, I got a job and had to buy my own toothpaste and things like that and take care of myself. What? Yeah. You had to buy your own toothpaste. Yeah, my parents made me take care of myself, which at the time, and even still, I'm very appreciative of it because it taught me to work really hard and everything. And so now, but at that point, my dad wouldn't even get me college book money or anything like that. I remember needing like $80 for college books and he wouldn't help me. And my grandma ended up helping me, but my grandma was like, you have to pay me back. So I like paid her back and everything. So. That's old school. Yeah, they were not helpful. And to some degree, my grandma was, but like I said, I had to pay her back, which taught me though, to be good with my money and things like that and to pay people back and not to borrow money and to like kind of just like, you fucking hustle to make your ends meet. Yeah, this is something from reading interviews with you and that I've gathered is that you're incredibly hardworking and that you have this survivor attitude towards existence. It makes sense that you're a workaholic. You have, did you say you have multiple assistants? I have three assistants. Whole leading. They're basically like workers, but yeah. What do you mean workers? I mean, like they like work for me and like they like do computer things for me. They like help me update my websites. They check my emails. They like fill my shop orders, kind of like things like that. Whoa. So you've got to, you've got a- I'm a team, basically in the home. Yeah. And I'm looking to hire another one, honestly. I'm like, I need more help because we can't seem to get everything done. Well, you can't, I mean, I know what you mean. I need, like I'm at that point now where it's like, if you don't expand, you're screwed. You're doomed. You've got to ask for help. You've got to have people doing that shit for you. I mean, we have a nanny and that's still, I mean, that's barely anything. Yeah, I feel you. We need more than that. Like you need to like have lots of, wow, but that's a lot. So you've got people on the books. You have an accountant? Yes. Wow. So you're like, yeah, okay, I get it. You're just, you're a business person. I am. So a lot of, I've known a lot of comics that were like that too. Like one side of them is the creative side. One side of them is the steely, hardcore business person, making really smart business decisions. So if that's who you are, why would you come on this podcast? I don't know, I really like to do podcasts. And like I said, I think this is an ability for me to like humanize myself. So it's a part of like allowing people to see an opportunity of me that may have not been presented otherwise. Cause I also, I have so much going on. I don't have time to do like my own podcasts necessarily. I do like my YouTube videos where I answer fan questions, but like I haven't, I want to do podcasts at some point, but I haven't made the time for it and whatnot. So when I have the opportunity to come to other peoples, I'm like, yes, I will do it. I think it's great to like allow people to hear me talking. Cause I do more than just dirty talk. I can actually communicate. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, it's a, I mean, in some ways it's like an incredibly limiting profession that way. Yeah, it is. Yeah, it, I mean, what are you going to do? Like who wants that? Like really, like if you're watching porn, when you, when you're looking at like the, like the options for types of porn to look at, I don't even know if there is a talking option. Is that even in there? Like I want to, I want to hear people just talking for a long time before they hook up. That's what everyone loves. It's the best as you're relaxing in to watch porn, 10 minutes of good, strong dialogue. Well, no, I get it. And this, you've, number one, you got to do a podcast. There's ways that you could do it. People listening, I'm sure I'll reach out. You know, there's, it's a whole thing. There's producers who will do all the work for you. There's, you could- I'm such a control freak, I couldn't. Okay, yeah. That's a part of my problem. Yeah, this is part of my problem too. You know, with, with this podcast in the old days, I used to edit it. I used to take, you know, it would be my, it was all in an all week job. It's been all week editing it, all week. And I saw in your YouTube video, you're like, I edited this. Yeah, and it took me like eight hours to edit a five minute video. It's crazy. Yeah, and that's the price you pay for not wanting to pass it on to somebody else. But I know that feeling because it's a joy to edit. Like, I think people don't understand how narcotic that is to sit there rewinding. Yes, I do love it though. What are you using premiere? No, right now I just literally use iMovie. I haven't even tried to do any of the more extreme. I have the premiere, but I haven't tried to even teach myself how to do it yet. Watch out, you'll become an editor. You're like, if you're a control freak, it's the ultimate job for an, it's like that's, control freaks love editing. Yeah. But it's hard to let go. You just have to, I have someone who edits now, my Aaron, he's amazing, my sound guy, but that took deep conversations with my wife and her realizing like, you don't have time. I mean, there's too much other shit going on for you to sit and edit something. Learning how to do that is really hard though. Really, do you yell at your assistants? No. You're kind to your assistants? I'm very kind to them. Listen friends, here's a chance for you to work for a very successful adult film star who's killing it right now. You're doing so good. Thank you. And you're, and it's really, I think your impulse to make sure people understand that you're playing that character and that there's way more there is super smart. And my friend Conor Habib comes on, he's an adult film star. And I think we did five podcasts before we even talked about porn because he's deeply philosophical and you are too. And I think it's, I have a feeling it must be part of being in that business because it's such a, it's weirdly such a spiritual thing like sex is deep, you're dealing with all kinds of energies and all kinds of crazy, crazy moments. So my friend Conor said, don't trust a guru if they haven't had sex with at least a thousand people. Because there's some depth of human psychology that you all understand that us normies probably don't quite get. Like there's something you know that we- I feel like it's like, maybe it's just like you kind of learn to just love mankind in general. When you're like, especially I think a part of it is not that you're forced but like having sex with people that you don't want to necessarily naturally or you naturally would never imagine you and that person fornicating. So like now you're put in a position where you're both being paid to have sex with each other so you have them, sex with them. And you don't want it to be a horrible painful, terrible experience. So you kind of like learn to love that person in whatever manner that you can. So I think it's taught me this like really freeing ability to just love everyone basically. Wow. Yeah. That's so beautiful. It is. It's very romantic. It really is. That by the way is Bakhti Yoga. It's like learning how to love what's in front of you for real love, not like a big smile but like actually love. Yeah, just genuinely care about them. Yeah. Wow. That's cool. It's so cool. It's like, you know, it's in everything. That's what I feel like I'm getting out of our conversation is just this quality of humaneness, this ability to connect with the walls of your house. Yeah. Someone you're being paid to hump. I could never do that. I could never, if I was with you. You train yourself as kind of a part of it. Aside from the, how? How do you do that? How do you do that? I don't mean like the sex thing. I mean like how do you do that when you're having a rough day and you find yourself? It's not about you. How do you make it not about you? It's just like, it's about everybody else and it's about the rest of the world. It's like you're stepping out of yourself because it's just not about you. Yeah, I don't know. It's about pleasuring others. And when you allow that satisfaction to occur, then it brings you satisfaction. Then you're kind of in a better place. Selflessness. Yes. It's painful to serve yourself. It hurts. Yeah. Like if you get too self-fixated, it's the worst. Yeah. It's not just with sex, it like runs the gamut. Yeah. Anytime I find myself doing anything that isn't just for me, everything lightens up almost instantly. Yeah. It's like the cure-all for most things. Wow. Well, I'm going to try. You're doing porn now. No, I'm not going to do porn. You didn't know that I was converting you into porn. Trust me, they're beating down my door all day long people in the adult film industry. Like Duncan, you would be, everybody wants a 45 year old bearded dude who weighs 100 pounds. 179 pounds to be in porn. Please, if you're out there listening, I'm not going to do it. I refuse, it's not my calling, but I respect people who do. But no, I don't mean just porn. I mean, in this thing that you're saying, I always forget, you know, it's like, I always get compressed into my identity. And I always forget when I'm feeling bummed out, you know, on any given day, I'll be like, all right, maybe I need to listen to this kind of music. You know, I'll listen to Black Mouth Super Rainbow and it gets stoned. That'll make me feel better. And then that doesn't work. Or I'll go to the gym. That'll make me feel better. That doesn't work. Or whatever, I'll play some music by myself. That doesn't work. But then the moment I'm like, I'm going to make dinner for my wife or go to the playground with a boy. Or all of a sudden everything lights up again. It's like, oh, right, just don't be selfish. Yeah. It's not about you. Yeah. I want to tell you something. The second, this, so when my dad was dying, I call my friend, Raghu Marcus, who runs the Love Server Member Foundation, it was Ram Dass' foundation. And I said to him, I'm like, I don't want him to suffer. I don't know what to do. He's like in pain. I don't know what to do. I don't know. And the first thing he said to me was take yourself out of it. Take yourself out of it. He's literally just said what you said to me. It's not about you. This is about him. Let this process happen as it's happening. You are putting yourself in it way too much. So what are, here's a question we can end on. What are some tricks to take yourself out of it? How do we do it? What's the tactic? How do you treat it? You said it's training. How do you do it? What's the training? I think it's just putting yourself in those uncomfortable positions or just putting yourself out there. I mean, I don't have a husband or children, but I use my dog as a way to release. So like if I'm feeling down and sad, I'll make sure I spend more time with him and that I'm making him happy and playing with him and gratifying him because then I can see and feel his everlasting love. And I'm like, it helps me to be less in myself and everything. And then, I mean, I don't really know. It's just kind of like you just putting yourself in these situations and where you just, it's just practicing the selflessness. It's practicing like trying to not allow your pain to project pain upon others because attitude is contagious. And if you are feeling negatively and you're around other people, it can make them also feel negative. And then there's just a bunch of negativity. So if you can try to like, you know, put it where it's focusing on making these other people happy or like you see that they're having a good time instead of coming and like bringing them down, you try to just mask that for a moment. And I feel like usually it works with like, you don't, you realize the pain that you were feeling was kind of what's the word I want to use. It's just so, it was unnecessary. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Beautiful. Hare Krishna. Thank you so much. I really, really appreciate your time. And wow, that was deep. That's deep. Take yourself out of it. It's not about you. Yeah, it's hard. It's fucking hard. It's not easy to do. We all struggle. I'm not perfect. I can't always remove myself out of it. But a lot of the times you just have to, at least if it's like your work environment and things like that, you just kind of force it and then you just learn how to deal with it better. Learn how to take yourself out of it. Whether you're in porn, whether you've got a family, whatever it is, what are we doing? We're stuck in these meat bodies and we're all fixated on it. Why would we do that to ourselves? Gotta expand. You're amazing. Thank you so much for your time. Thank you. You're so knowledgeable and well-educated. I hope to learn more from you. Are you kidding? I'm after talking to you. I'm gonna go eat my dog, take my altar down. I'm an atheist now. I'm done. Then I'm gonna go shoot porn. Yes. Thank you so much for your time. Where can people find you?

Okay, so yesterday Graham Hancock tweeted this awesome link to a story. I'll just read it to you. This is on phys.org. Photos show evidence of life on Mars, Ohio entomologist claims. Scientists scrambled to determine whether there is life on Mars. Ohio University professor William Romaseh's research shows that we already have the evidence, courtesy of photographs from various Mars rovers. Dr. Romaseh, who specializes in arbo virology and general met slash medical entomology. What's medical entomology? That's weird. Are there like vets for insects? Like, can you bring a injured cricket to an entomologist and he'll put a cast on it? He spent several years studying photographs from the red planet that are available on the internet. He found numerous examples of insect-like forms structured similarly to bees, as well as reptile-like forms, both as fossils and living creatures. He presented his findings Tuesday at the National Meeting of the Entomological Society of America in St. Louis, Missouri. There has been and still is life on Mars, Rosimer said, noting that the images appear to show both fossilized and living creatures. There is apparent diversity among the Martian insect-like fauna, which displays many features similar to Terran insects, wing flexion, agile gliding flight, wings. Anyway, you can look this up and look at these bugs and decide for yourself. The cynics out there, the skeptics, they're lighting this poor guy up. He's getting just beat down because all the images are blurry. But if you ask me, there are definitely insects on Mars. And I've known that for a long time actually because I have deep connections in the inner space community. Regardless, I got excited. I reached out to Professor Rosimer and he wrote back right away. It was late at night. He told me to call him. I called him. He did that thing that scientists do where he said that I had the wrong number. He sounded pretty drunk. We talked for a while and he finally broke down and said, listen, you want, you want to hear something crazy? I'm like, you better believe I do. He's like, well, we not only have proof that there's bees on Mars, but these bees are musical bees and they've used some kind of satellite technology to pick up the sounds of these bees, which I'm going to play for you right now. Hope this doesn't get me ebstained. Sometimes it feels like you may never infect anybody. You're just another drum alone. Never gonna bond. Never gonna spawn. Never gonna lay eggs in the chest of someone's mama. Don't you worry, one day you'll be our queen. So while you're incubating, don't be afraid to dream. You're gonna spawn one day. But for now it's time to incubate. Enjoy your rest inside the chest of the thing that you invest. But I believe in you. You are more than just love under me. You're gonna be a queen. All you gotta do is dream. So don't forget, even the most powerful queen. Start it off as just some eggs in someone's chest. And just remember, you will hear your host scream. All you gotta do is dream. You will bring glory to the hive. Wow, that is really inspirational. You know, it is easy to sometimes look at the temporary conditions of your life and maybe look at the temporary conditions of your friend's life and get the feeling that you're never gonna get your big shot. But if you really think about it, then you'll realize that judging your insides by someone's outsides is a recipe for doom. And I think that's what this song teaches us, is that it's better to burst out of someone's insides into their outsides. And the motivation to do that is not gonna come from jealousy or anxiety or fear, but it's gonna come from knowing that if you believe in yourself and you have faith that the universe is holding you, embracing you in its beautiful chest, then you will begin to experience the kind of gratitude and joy just to be alive that I think will produce the ambition and inspiration that any hatchling needs to have the courage to explode in glory out of the chest of their hosts. So I love that song and I love the Martian Bugs. What a beautiful podcast we have for you today. If you're interested in yoga, if you're interested in Tantra, then this is the episode for you.

Still working on the relaunch, but it's coming. Okay, let's get this show on the road. Now, without further ado, we present to you by We I Mean Me, a podcast that has everything a person might want in a podcast. You want to learn about a sex cult? Here you go. You want to question the fundamental nature of everything you know? Well, we've got that too. Today's guest is the co-founder of Samarasah Yoga Studio in Echo Park. She has done extensive training in yoga, both her and her brother are mystical beings. So if you're in Echo Park, you definitely, definitely should at least check it out. Susan has an upcoming course at Samarasah called Yoga, Sex and Death, which is starting up mid-December. You can even go to a Q&A session, which is on December 15th at 10am. All right, let's do this. Everyone, please welcome to the Ducatressel family, our podcast, Susan Marufo. So here we are. Here we are at your yoga studio, Samarasah. Yes. And the first question I have for you is something that I think a lot of people wonder about when they come in here, which is, and I'll take a picture of this. What is the, what is the symbol there? What does that mean? Okay, well, it's the all seeing eye, watching wherever you go. Okay, so when we started with the brand design, I had this idea, an image for a logo, which was, so there's a figure in the Hindu tradition called the Shiva. And Shiva, I don't have a statue of Shiva in here, but there is one in the front. Big one. Yeah. And he's got a symbol right here in his third eye, and it's called a tripundra. And I wanted, what does that mean tripundra? It's, it's just this, it's just the symbol that he's got right here. That's what they call it. And I wanted a variation of that symbol for Samarasah. Like I wanted a modern take on it. So our branding agency just played with it. And she came up with, our artistic director came up with this, the logo that you see, the eye. When you walk in, you know, you see this eye. The all seeing eye, which is very, for a lot of people, that's like an evil symbol. They look at it as the, it's on the dollar bill. It represents, I don't know what, private jets. Well, this includes private jets and goes beyond private jets, because it's like, basically, it sees everything. It's like the Ajna chakra, which is the mental command center, the source of intuitive seeing. So everything that you could see with the eyes closed, maybe if, if you will. So your third eye. Yeah, third eye. It's your third eye. That's the third eye. And so we just took different variations of this third eye and put it into some cool looking images. I wanted to mix the eyes with triangles, because the triangles symbolize an upward facing triangle is the symbol for the masculine masculine energies and a downward facing triangle is a symbol for feminine feminine energy. So this room has an upward facing triangle with the eye in the middle. This is like the masculine. And in that room, Sundari, it's downward facing triangle, the feminine. Wow. So this is the story behind all this. But when you were thinking about that, was that a branding agency decision, or were you using some kind of metaphysical sense of like, Oh, I need to balance masculine and feminine. Oh, right. Yeah, no, that was all from my practice, my philosophy, my, my yoga training. So I'm a, I'm a yoga teacher, and a meditation teacher. And I had been living in Tantric community for many, many years. What was the name of that community? Okay, it's called a gamma. A gamma. Yes, A G A M A. So the reason I have this reaction is because it has been me too, like crazy. Where's the founder? It's located in Copangan in Thailand. Okay. An island in Thailand called Copangan in South Thailand. This is from Baba's? No, no, no, no, no, no connection. No, no connection. I mean, there's a connection in the way that our communities would sometimes they were like, a little bit incestuous. I hate to use that word. Sure. Given the conversation, but we, a lot of people that were to gamma left to gamma to go to Prem Baba because Prem Baba seemed like the pure community in Prem Baba was also Tantra. He is Tantra. But he doesn't brand himself as a Tantra teacher. He doesn't call himself a Tantric teacher. He talks about Tantra in a different way than what most of the Western world looks at as Tantra. Can we, okay, very quickly, can we jump back to a gamma? Yes. And I want to talk about how you ended up on an island, a Thai island in a Tantra community. What were the steps? Well, how do you, how does that happen? That sounds crazy, in fact. I, so I was married and I was living a pretty normal Western life. I worked in advertising. I was a brand manager. I had a beautiful husband, all the things, you know, check, check, check, all the things I had. Where were you? I was in Dallas, Texas, which is like, in and of itself, that was rough. I just always felt like a fish out of water, you know, like round peg square hole, like going to this advertising job. I didn't give a fuck. What advertising? It just seemed like on the outside, that's how things should look for me. You know, that's how my whole life was. It was like, I want to have this cool job. Advertising is cool. You work hard. You play hard. There's a lot of fucking boozy. I mean, we just, I parted really hard. I was basically killing myself for a good 15 years. I started early. Like booze. Yeah. Coke. Yeah. Just all the drugs. Yeah. Did you go to college for advertising? I got a bachelor's degree in communication and then I got a master's degree in communication. Wow. Yeah. Okay. Wow. This is nuts. So you're, you're like a hardcore advertising agent in Dallas, parting hard. That's when you got married. Yeah. And how long were you married? Well, we were together for 11 years. We were married for eight, seven of them. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So please, I can't wait to hear the link. So then I was living this life that didn't feel totally authentic, but I couldn't really put my finger on what, why I was so unhappy. I just knew that shit's going in a direction that could get really sticky for me because I was, man, just running myself into the ground. Like I have this thing inside of me that is so hardcore, that's so, like just so strong. I did, like call it, call it passion, call it just a lot of shockty or energy. Yeah. And back then I just had no idea what to do with it. And I felt very isolated and alone. I didn't feel connected. But I didn't know that was the thing. I didn't know that that's what was going on with me. So anyway, you didn't know, you wait, you didn't know you didn't feel connected. You just thought empty or something. Yeah. I wouldn't have put it that way. I wouldn't have said I don't feel connected because I had this husband that was like amazing and super sweet and I have a good family and I had all the things. So I felt like, well, I guess this is connection. You know, it's like, if you just do one thing all the time, you don't know, you don't experience that thing because you're not, you don't have perspective. You're not outside of it. Once you get outside of it, then it's like, oh, shit. Yeah. That is not connection. Okay. I know what you're talking about. So like this sometime, like the, this is why I think like getting out of the country is so good. Yes. Because you get out of the country and suddenly you realize like, holy shit. Like I am, I, I'm even more insignificant than I imagined I was. This is the game people are, the game is being run in a slightly different way everywhere. And then you do see the wildness of the culture that you come from and the good things and the bad things. It definitely gives you perspective. So, but when you're in it, you can't, there's just no way to really get that bird's eye view of the, whatever the dance is that you're doing. Totally. I get you. Yeah. Okay. Travel. And you know what it's occurring to me right now as you're talking is not even external travel, just external travel where you go to another place, but like this inner travel too, like doing inner work and getting pushing yourself a little bit emotionally or just exploring internally, like that kind of travel to get some perspective is also really valuable. But time travel, time travel, go into the future a few years and then look back and you'll always be like, what the fuck was I doing? Oh my God, I was wearing rave pants. I wore rave pants. I was wearing giant baggy rave. What the fuck are you getting that happen to me? It's crazy, but the time travel helps because you, you, you get out of it, you know, and you see, oh my God. Now, wow, how easy it is to get pulled into some kind of odd cycle and get really caught up into thinking that this is all there is and all that matters and who I am. It's so easy. Totally. And I didn't know, um, when I, when I left, I had no reference for the way that I, for what, okay, let me see how I can say this. So an authentic life for me looked totally different than what it was in my twenties, but I had nobody modeling that life for me. Right. When I was in my twenties. Sure. So I didn't know what it could look like. I just knew that this shit wasn't working. Right. And I was like, I don't know. All I know is that this isn't working. I'm just going to throw myself out into the world and see, see if there's something else that feels better than this. Right. And so I just left. I just left the States. I left my marriage and I quit my job and what? Yeah. And I went and I moved to Spain. What, like, what the, so how did that happen? You're just one day you're like, fuck this. I'm out. I mean, it was, it was not, it was like a slow decay. And I remember having a conversation with my husband at the time when I said to him, look, I know for sure if I stay, it's divorce because I've utilized every single tool I have at my capacity to stay in, in this. And I, I can't, I can't, but at least if I go, there's an unknown variable. And maybe that'll give me something to be able to make some peace with myself and in this marriage. And so that's a shot. We got a shot if I go. And he understood and he was like, okay, I get it. So then I left and I just went on this massive exploration and I started getting really, I moved to Spain first and I started getting really deep into my own practice, yoga practice. And I was, were you doing yoga before you went to Spain? But it was like, for sure I was. And I had some amazing insights that occurred during that time. But I was also like, at the same time, just drinking myself into like a stupor. Yeah. Any chance I could get. So it kind of balanced out the effects of yoga. I wasn't able to like fly. Right. Because it was keeping me pretty neutral. I guess my practice, which was better than nothing, you know, in your practice at the time was just going to a yoga studio, right? Just the, you know, health yoga, right? But some spiritual stuff attached. Okay. So you go to Spain and then did you rent an apartment in Spain? Wow. Yeah, I rented a pistol. I call it a little flat. I made some friends. I was teaching English. It was very low key. It wasn't stressful like advertising. I was teaching English to these little Spanish kids. And it was like the best year of my life. It's like the year of awakening. I was having all these experiences. What did your parents think? So my parents are very conservative. Right. They're from El Paso, Texas. And they were like, what the fuck are you doing? Okay. You're losing your mind. Everybody was like, Oh, everybody was so concerned about my marriage. You're gonna lose the perfect man. You're gonna lose the perfect guy. And it's like, does anybody see me? You know, like my soul is like dying here. And everyone's concerned about you're going to lose a man. You know, it was really interesting. They probably thought you're having a nervous breakdown. Oh, they for sure did. But it's interesting to see how we have all grown because of this whole journey that I left and kind of went off on this deep dive internally. And the whole family went with me and they could have chosen to not but they have they've really met me and our relationships have just gotten much deeper and richer. I feel it's like now we just know each other. Whereas before I didn't know who I was, right? So I couldn't how could I show who I was to anybody else? Right. And so it would felt so inauthentic. And that's what I was running from is just myself being inauthentic with everyone. It was just fucking gross, you know, feeling like my parents don't know me. My husband doesn't know me. And that just felt that's why I felt alone and isolated. Sure. Because I didn't know how to show myself to anybody because I didn't know who I was. And now it's just honest. Now it's much more honest. I think my parents are like, what are you doing with with your life? But they also see that I'm much happier. And they also see that I'm interested in them as people. And we're just closer. Here's a fun fact. Apparently flight attendants have higher any job, but they did a study of flight attendants have a higher rate of depression, because they have to act happy all the time. And they can't express themselves authentically. But any when they get stuck in like day after day after any public service job that demands a happy attitude, causes this imposter syndrome at the most extreme level. And it really fucks with people's heads. So yeah, that's that's a real dark place to get into. What are you? Are you like a stepford wife? Are you some kind of automaton? Are you just what are you in there? So Spain, that's such a good way to put it imposter syndrome. Yeah, that's what that's what it felt like. It's called short term is the liar short. You're a fucking liar. Yeah, you're being paid to lie basically. Well, right. And you know, the thing when I look back, like you were talking about time travel, when I look back, it's like, it did feel like this isn't authentic, but it was the best I could do. You know, so it was honest. It was honest at the time in that way, because it's all I knew to do. Sure. And now, after being on this path, like we were talking about like the shadow and just letting that's why I feel so strongly about just letting it be fucking okay. Whatever comes, it's the naturalness of energy moving through the collective energy moving through just this individual body. And like, how can I be with it? How can I experience it fully and just and let it let it go without needing to hold it down to constrict it to. Yeah. Yeah. So that's like the whole I think that's knowing that part of my background and my history might might be helpful when people hear what I'm teaching. Okay. So Spain, should we go back? Spain. So I'm in Spain, and I'm like getting into my practice. But the crucial thing was that I was practicing by myself. I was doing my own like home practice. I was practicing like four hours a day. And it was like for the first time in my life, like, holy shit. I remember I would just cry. It was energy, just energy, moving. And water, tears would just come out of my face and so much emotion just would come every day because I had stopped drinking and stopped numbing. And it was all in there wanting to just come out and be felt and move through. And so even though like if somebody had seen me from the outside, crying, crying, it would have looked so intense and serious, but it was just so light. It was amazing. I was like experiencing things. That time was like so powerful. I remember riding the bus to work every morning and looking out at the city of Sevilla. I was living in Sevilla and just feeling, I would look at a flower and just cry, cry, cry, because let me turn this. I just felt, that's funny, right? And I felt like when, like so clear inside, like there was just a total, there was only a physical body outline, there was nothing on the inside. Does that make sense? So like there was nothing internally to stick to anything externally. So nothing, everything that came just passed through me. It felt like it was just moving through me. There was no trigger. There was nothing to catch. You're a mirror. Yeah. Not even a mirror. It didn't even feel like a mirror, like I'm reflecting anything back. It just felt like there's nothing there. There's nothing there. Like I feel like it felt like if somebody had come up to me and hurt me or said something to me, it would have been, it just would have been okay. Like it just, because there was nothing, no pain inside of me to catch their pain. Right. So it's like you pulled up all the fishing nets. There's that, like, you know, some people are just like a spider web of potential anger, like so many different things. It's like a dense web that almost any phenomena is going to trigger some form of, it's going to trigger a reaction. And the reaction is whatever the thing is that they do, some version of hissing or barking or screaming at the world. And then if that web goes away, then it's, I know, I know, I think I understand what you're talking about. It's just there's not, there's nothing for anything to catch. And since you can't get caught, what are you anymore? You know, it underlines what you're saying is how people define themselves, not by their physical form, but by the shit that upsets them, they're defined by where they get caught, they're defined by their traps, internal snares, which is pretty depressing, if you think. So those went away from four hours of yoga a day. I mean, for me, that's just one, that's an aeration of yoga. But let me just, only because sometimes people that I get meet like you, they deaf, because they've practiced for so long, they do take it for granted almost that they were, to you, that doesn't sound as, to me, that is the most hardcore thing. To get an apartment in Spain, leave my life behind, and then start sitting or doing, what were you doing like hatha yoga? Yeah, I was doing hatha yoga, I was doing meditation, and I was doing like mind mapping, where I would write thoughts down on paper and then make the connections. It's basically meditation on paper where I could see how the pattern of a thought, what does that look like? It just looks like I'm writing stream of consciousness, journaling, without censoring at all. And then going back to look at it, because it's thought on paper, so it's grounded. Ego is so fast, manas, mind just moves so quickly. But when you put it down on paper and really give yourself the opportunity, which is a practice in and of itself, you like, I noticed how much I wanted to censor, and not really put it all down there. Yeah, what, that's it. You know, I have that all the time, where I'll be writing, and then I'll have a thing, oh God, you can't, you can't say that out loud. Right. And you look at that, I'm like, wait, who am I performing for right now? Like, there's no one here, but me, I'm writing into a thing that is certainly not sentient, at least I pray my journals, I have some, I pray my journals can't read, because they're going to be so fucking bored. But I got a boy here again. Oh my God, he's mind mapping. Oh, God, really? You're so funny. That's a funny thought. It's annoying. But yeah, so the censoring mechanism that kicks in, that's kind of what it's teaching you, is that the idea, is it showing you where you self-censor? Yeah, well, that's the first, that's the first part. That's the first part of the journey. And then once you get past the censoring, which comes and goes, it's not like you're ever really past it, right? But you notice it, you keep going, you write, and then you start to see all the shit that comes out, or all the stuff that comes out, all the mind stuff that comes out, and you start to see connections of like, oh, so I see the inner workings of the mind and how this thought will inevitably lead to this thought. And then this thought, here comes the spiral downward from this thought, you just kind of go back and trace mind, which people can do in meditation. You know, you can sit in meditation and do this, right? Sure. But it just helps me, for some reason, for me, writing things down is very beneficial, not necessarily for everyone, but for me, it's like a total path. That's amazing. So only because I get the sitting practice, of course, and I get the yoga, of course. But I never thought of journaling as a spiritual practice, but I could see how it is for sure. Oh my gosh, for sure. There's so many things. So, you know, let me just go back and speak to what you said, Duncan, about like, when you were talking about censoring, and you're like, who am I trying to perform for? It's this idea, it's the idea that we have of ourselves, this idealized image that we have of ourselves that we're trying to protect. Right. You know, I don't want to see myself beyond like, I like thinking of myself as this kind of person who's kind and loving and right. And so I don't want to write on this whacked out shit down that I think about, actually, these thoughts that come. Yeah. That's why what you do is so interesting. And that's why I love your energy here, because I feel like you've tapped into that, like this, God, there's just space to say yes, whatever. Yeah. And that's where creativity comes. That's divine. Yeah, I know. Yes, I think so. And all is in it. Yes. It's certainly feels good to allow yourself to speak unspeakable things. If the motivation isn't harmed. Right. You know, that's, that's the motivation. The intent is, you don't want to say shit to people that's just designed and upset them. But yeah, in the comedy world right now, intention is sort of getting ignored. And just the things people are saying or being like harshly judged. And people aren't looking like there's comedians who there's comedians who could say a completely non offensive joke. And it offends the shit out of people just because the comedian is like angry or, you know, really upset. And then there's comedians who could say the most offensive shit you ever in your life, but there's love behind it. And it just seems hilarious. In fact, the love seems to be the, as long as it's love that the offense is like, as long as behind the offense mask is love, oh my God, it's the best ever. But if you have offense and then behind it is anger, it's really repugnant. It's like really repulsive to see that because you just like, why are you hitting me, man? I came here to see a comedy show not to get brutalized by your anger and your fun. But if it's love, and then it's, then it's whatever. It's usually pretty funny. I mean, it's like, you know, when people like put a video of their kid rapping or whatever and saying horrific things, but the kid just seems sweet, you know, like that there's a difference. Well, this conversation I'm very interested in. And I was talking to a guy who's involved in comedy. And so it's juicy that you're here and we're having this conversation because how it's, I think it gets tricky when we are interpreting somebody else's intention, right? How can you know somebody else's intention? I mean, I think that you can know this doesn't feel good for me. Whatever that person on stage is doing, it doesn't feel good for me. But, but how do I know I just think it's a slippery slope when we, when like starting to say this person is angry and this person isn't, and they're saying the same thing, you know, they're using the same words. It's like, I know what you're saying. Who are we to say, right? A lot of the times though, what ends up happening is this, a lot of times I've noticed a comedian who is trying to be edgy out of some kind of branding or something like that, but doesn't really give a shit about what they're talking about. They've just gone through Twitter or whatever and found, here are the words that are upsetting people right now. Here, I've, by the way, I've tried this shit before. You get so lazy with your writing that you just go for the most obvious, you know, thing because you want to seem like I'm like, Carl and man, or I'm like, right, I'm on the cutting edge. Right. And, but it's lazy because you are not the edge. You're at someone else's edge. That's not your fucking edge. Your edge is probably telling a story about some crazy thing that happened to you that you're afraid anyone could ever know. Right. That's edgy. Got it. You know, so, so, and usually you can identify that and the way you can identify it is people aren't laughing. It's not that funny. If just people just generally feel like, Oh boy, there we go again. Because, you know, the audience just wants to laugh. And then, and then sometimes you'll see comedians say the most, this is how you really know that you're bombing your ass off. And I'm proud to say I've bombed a billion times, but this, I've never said this, which is, listen, I know you're trying not to laugh right now. It's like, no, no one in a comedy club is trying not to laugh. No one. No one's or they'll be like, you're looking around like, can I laugh at this? No, they're not. They're not looking around. They're looking at you and you're bombing. Your joke didn't work. You know what I mean? That's, that's the reality. And, and, you know, the thing is, like, I just think comedians need to be allowed to some degree to throw those shit Molotov cocktails into the audience so they can fully grok why it doesn't work. Right. And if, and sometimes it's dismaying when you hear a comedian confusing their lack of skillful writing with some kind of, some kind of judgment from the PC crowd, which by the way, the PC crowd exists and it's, it's, it's really destructive, I think that's like, but as a comedian, I just, and the way I've been taught is always blame yourself. If you're bombing, blame yourself. It's almost always your fault. 90% of the time, 95% of the time you weren't able to ride that wave. And that's your fault. And that may or may not be true, but it certainly isn't powering. It's not going to, you might feel worse driving home. Anyway, I did not want to talk about comedy here. I'm just very, I'm very curious. I mean, I'm asking you about it. Thank you for asking. And I appreciate you interviewing me. Listen, and I would love to talk about myself, but I do want to get back into the, and I understand why we took a natural jump into that, because we're talking about self censoring. We're talking about the, the authenticity. We're talking about the shadow and that completely meets where like comedy is right now, how to express the shadow, authentically. And, but, and I get, is that Tantra? Does Tantra have something to do with that? That's like an aspect of Tantra, because we didn't quite get to how you ended up in a Tantra community. We got to you crying in flowers on the bus. And that's where we diverted a little bit, but I want to get into the, this community that you got into and how that happened. Okay, so after about a year of this time in Spain, I felt like I was still married, by the way, and we were trying to make it work. Just a big question mark. Can we do this? And my ex-husband actually was like, you should go get a teacher training certificate, like do a teacher training program. And so I started researching schools online. And I just found this school online. I was like, that's the one. I just felt it. I'm like this. It's like very gut stuff for me. So I went, and I had never, I didn't know anybody who had ever done a class at this school. I had, I just felt it. And I went and I just did a 500 hour teacher training program, which was three months, a little over three months. And it was total immersion. I didn't know actually that it was, or if I had read it was Tantric, I don't even know that I knew what the fuck that meant. Right. You know, I was just like, whatever. I, the reason I went was because I knew they were studying a text that I wanted to study, which was the Bhagavad Gita. And I was like, this is the one I want to go to. So I went and I immersed myself. Now, I slowly started to realize things were going down at that school. And like what? Like the founder, Swami, was sleeping with women in my teacher training program. And what was your first hint that was happening? One of the girls in my teacher training program told me I'm sleeping Okay. And did she say that in a like, in a sense of like, no big deal. I like it. Or did she, was she like complaining? I'm going to just, sorry, we're going to cut to a quick commercial. Now this, so where were you when she confided in you? Or was it a confidence at all? Well, at first it was, yeah, it wasn't confidence at first. She wouldn't say who her lover was, but she was like, Oh, I'm having problems with my lover and bubble. And eventually she just told me it's Swami. And I'm like, Oh, what's happening here? And then I started looking around. And I was like, eyes open to holy shit. Okay, I see, I see what's happening now. So yeah, he would have sex with a lot of the women. Did they all think of themselves as his girlfriend? This one in particular that was in my training was telling him he needed to choose her and that she wanted to be the girlfriend. And yeah, there was a lot of drama. This is crazy to be thinking about this stuff right now. Is this place considered a cult? I mean, it depends on who you ask. I think it could have been taken on for sure. I mean, for sure, some people call it a cult. For me, I always felt like I was a little bit on the periphery. I knew enough. Listen, I'm not going to lie. This was like right up my alley. This is what I went to do. Okay. And right up your alley in the sense that it was so hardcore, you're like, Oh, shit, this is like jumping into another place. Like this isn't just some basic, simple equinox yoga class. This this is like real like this is heavy duty, real crazy shit. This guru guy is having sex. And were other people having sex with each other? Was that a yeah, but that for me came later, like not even not just the sex. So the yoga was also wild for me. It was very esoteric. I mean, okay, it was like, Oh my God, this, this is what I was thirsty for. And these are my people like all of these, it was all it was. Do you mean like that? Like just help me understand. Because my my experience with yoga has been as basic as you can get. I go from time to time when my karma is good enough that I somehow get the ambition up to go and do basic yoga. I'll just do sun salutations, you know, downward dog, warrior's pose, bricks all over. I'll have to use like all kinds of bricks and hate it because the teachers are always coming up to me and like, Listen, you're not bending, right? It's like, no, shit. I'm a fucking ball. I'm fucking straight. Don't you say my muscles have been tight for seven years? So this is my experience with yoga. So when you say esoteric yoga, what does that even look like? Well, it means that it wasn't this mainstream stuff that was based in philosophy. So what it looked like practically in the concrete world is like we were really working with energy. It wasn't so much about the physical body. It was a lot of mind stuff. We're moving energy with our minds. Okay. And we're working with chakras. Okay. And we're working with the etheric or energy body. Gotcha. And so you put your body in a specific posture or shape. And then that particular posture resonates with a specific universal energy. And so you're focusing on the corresponding energy at the level of the microcosm, meaning the level of the physical body. So is this like the utterance of the specific mantras that go with the chakras and the visualization of the Sanskrit, the Sanskrit, um, you know, the, the bija mantras. Yes. Yeah. Is that what that? Is that how you do the resonance or whatever? How do you do that? You can. That's one way. There's so many different techniques. There's so much stuff out there, Duncan. It's like, what happens when you do it? Like let's take the heart chakra. How do you know that you have tuned into that energy? You, you tune in and you do that, you tune in. So like, for example, there's a specific, we'll, we'll just take it, we'll take a concrete example of a posture, which is Bujangasana. We'll call it, um, cobra where you're laying on the, on the ground on your belly at first. And then you put your hands underneath your shoulders and you just lift the chest up like this. So this is a chest opener. You hear a lot of people in LA and these yoga classes talk about backbends and chest openers, right? Okay. So this kind of yoga isn't so concerned with like the physical posture and getting this crazy like whacked out thing going on physical level. It's just more about closing the eyes, focusing your attention at the level of the heart and tuning in there. This is it. Concentrating, focusing the mind here. Eventually, the longer you can stay, you might, I don't want to project an experience onto anybody, right? But the idea is that you start to tune into the universal feeling of unconditional love. Like that's what you're doing. You're trying to get into resonance with by the law of correspondence. Yes. So by, so like you are the microcosm of the macrocosm, right? Yeah. The universe is here as within is without. Okay. So all of the universe is here. So in this particular practice, we're focusing on how to consciously work with the universe at this level of the microcosm to, to, um, call in any kind of universal energy we want to experience. So, uh, you know, like dynamism, charisma, confidence, willpower, all that would be at the level of money Buddha chakra. And so if I put myself in specific postures that are resonating here and I'm focusing here, the naval center, this is like long enough. I mean, the idea there is that we hold postures for a long time. Like how long? Well, in the beginning, you start at like three minutes by the end of my training, 10 minutes, like in the, in my certification, we had to hold headstand for 10 minutes. You know, headstand is the crown Sahajwara chakra. So that's all about sublimation of energy, moving, moving energy from the lower chakras up to experience different levels of consciousness, to experience what it feels like the qualities at the level of Anahata chakra. Like what does that, what does that feel like to, to be in that space, to be in that reality? What does it feel like at the level of money Buddha chakra, like inhabiting this like dynamism, charismatic kind of quality of energy? What does it feel like to put all of my energy here? And so the physical practice was one of the ways that we did that. But we also did it through love making, through practicing moving energy up, like the grosser, heavier energies at the level of that's called love making in this. Well, sex. Oh, you went sex. Yeah. Gotcha. I wasn't sure if you were doing like we called it love making. Right. So wait, so, right. Okay. So as part of this training, at some point, they're like, and also we're all going to have sex. That's gonna happen. Well, it's more like you nobody. Yeah. I mean, you could get approached by somebody who's like, Hey, do you want to practice this together? Okay, I see. The pickup was like, Hey, let's do an Anahata meditation together. And it's like, got it. Wow. Yeah, that's crazy. That's wild. Yeah. But but in Tantra, I mean, this is the thing like, you always hear when people are talking about Tantra, they'll teachers will be like, it's not just about sex. But and it's always frustrating, because the teacher has to deal with like Western idiots, like, you guys were fucking and it's like, you see you have because in the West, we're all freaked out. And you have to like, yes, we are also tuning in with the universal vibration of compassion. But okay, if you want to talk about that. But understandably so, because that's what like a lot of teachers now they sell their workshops with this word Tantra, right? Because yeah, people because they're going along with this idea, they're riding that wave. Yeah, of Tantra equals sexuality and it sells because sex sells. Yeah. So by saying Tantra, it's like saying, yeah, I mean, a lot of people in the West do think they equate Tantra with sexuality. I don't even use the word Tantra anymore. I don't say Tantra. I'm not. I just and also because I don't know what the fuck Tantra is, but it is on the website. It is in your bio. Yeah, Tantra. Yeah. Yeah. It's out there. I mean, I know what you're saying. I get it. I think it's a very confusing word. And anytime any teacher I've listened to has gotten into it, there's a huge disclaimer attached to it, which is like that's just one little it's to me, isn't it more along the lines of like, it's everything, we're going to take the scope of it all being a human the whole circuit board or the whole control panel of identity, the entire thing can be utilized as a teaching, right? That's the idea. Yes. All of it. And so just meaning like, yeah, sex, but also eating, but also shitting, but also pissing, also running, also everything. It's all in there. Nothing is left out. It's totally inclusive. And it's shocking for people in the West because the entire country was founded on principles that were related to the body being abhorrent and the world itself being kind of a mistake, not a mistake, but like this world is not much compared to heaven. Yes. It's an obstacle on the spiritual path, you know, like this world, this material world is an obstacle to reach God or to know God. It's like something that will tempt you, you know, and I've still got that in me. Yeah. I mean, I get it. I totally get it. You didn't have that in you when you realized that was going to be the scope of your study was going to include things that in the West, in Western culture, or sometimes considered blasphemous, especially when done under the auspices of some kind of religious training or some kind of like spiritual training. I think it takes an extreme amount of discernment to go to a community like that and not get lost. I think discernment is the key. And I feel like I, by the grace of God, I feel like some discernment was there for me. And I knew I was there to practice confronting all of these ideas and beliefs about the world and about the things that should be denied and repressed. And at the same time, wanting to explore and go into all of it. And just to see how that felt for myself, just to experiment. So I went there to experiment, experiment, but I want to go back and say, I feel like the reason that I have a, I, it's not totally healed yet, this wound around Tantra, because when I got there to that school, there was a lot of classical Tantra that we were learning. Like classical Tantra doesn't mention a lot about sex and sexuality in the, in the scriptures. It's just not there. And so it was, we were doing, we were studying classical Tantra, but also all this sexual stuff, which is called Neo Tantra, Neo Tantra. But we weren't really told that nobody was saying, this is Neo Tantra. And this is classical Tantra. It all just got lumped in together as like Tantra. So I thought all of it was just Tantra. And then I learned later, like, Oh, well, hold the fuck up. This actually isn't in the scriptures. It's not in the traditional texts. And here I was, and here I've been teaching this. And I feel hoodwinked a little bit, like a little manipulated. Yeah, I mean, I just felt like I want to know what I'm, as best I can, what I'm trying, I'm transmitting to other people. And I felt like, God, I've been like saying something, I didn't know it was true. And yeah, hoodwinked is a good, it's a good word. Hoodwink, hoodwink, just this, you know, charismatic, manipulative teacher was trying to produce a, like, rationalization for what maybe was just like sex addiction or something. You see, I saw it. I mean, I looked around and was like, Okay, these people just want to call this spirituality. Everybody just wants to get fucked and be, you know, like, to fuck around and have sex. It's like, just call it what it is. Just let's, let's just say that we want to have sex and explore. And why do we need to make it about like some hide behind the spiritual front, a spiritual mask, it didn't. Can I answer that? Yes. Why? Because it's fucking cool. It's like, you know, like, it makes me think of people who go looking for Sasquatch. They can't just go hiking. You know what I mean? Like, they've got to like, there has to be a medical agreement. Yeah. Yeah. It's not, it's some big deal. It's good. Makes, and I've gone squatching. And it is cool. Right. When you go and you think, Oh my God, there could be a big foot. And then they'll be like, look, a branch on the path. He left it for us. You're like, Holy shit, this is amazing. It's amazing. So I do get it. I do understand why, like, you know, adding some mystical quality to it. Yes, seductive. It's fun. And there's healing in it. You know, Neotantra, all the things that I did, I explored a lot sexually. And there was a lot of healing in it for me. So I'm all for it. Did you tell your husband this was happening? Okay. So when I was still with him, I was not sexually exploring with other people because we were monogamous. And at this time, and it was like, not a, not a thing for me. I was like, pretty much closed down to any of that. And then we got, then we separated. And then it was like, okay, well, now it's time. Right. It's on. Right. And, and after that, I really started to experiment with different ways of relating. Sure. That we're very healing and that I'm all for it. Like if it, if it feels good and it's working for you, do it. Yeah. Let's just call it Neotantra. Like just call it, call it that, you know, and it just feels more accurate. Right. That's all. So you're saying make a distinction between classical Tantra and this, this other version of it. And then it's fine. Just don't say it's the same thing. Yeah. And other, yeah, it's like, which it seems to be one of, um, you know, I'm listening to, like I mentioned earlier, this Ajahn Chah audio book and it's Theravadan Buddhism. It's very, I don't know if you'd call it conservative, but it's a very like, this is how it, the Buddha said to do it in these scriptures. This is how we do it. Don't add anything to it. Don't add a fucking thing. Stop. Before you even get close to adding anything. Stop. You're not going to add anything to it, which I find that to be really frustrating because it's like, no, humans are creative. We get to evolve stuff. Right. But also I see how pragmatic that is. And it's an understanding of a form that emerges of the charismatic person who wants to add their font or whatever to the Dharma. And it's shit gets really wobbly. If that, you better really know this is what it is. Yes. And, or otherwise you can it's bad karma. Yes. Well, to me, that's very tantric because you better really know before you start playing in all of this fun stuff because that's why they call it like riding the tiger, because it's so easy to get lost. It's like the razor's edge. And I feel from my own personal experience, there's a certain place to get to first if we're talking about like if we're speaking in these terms, like there's a certain place to get to first before you start practicing these things so that you can anchor in some experience of oneness or of truth, reality, capital R. And this Nick turn will say things like, you know, it's like, learn the scales, then do jazz, but don't just go, don't call like your lack of, he doesn't say this, I'm adding to it, but don't call your lack of musical understanding jazz. It's like the great jazz musicians, they were so familiar with the basics and respected the basics like deeply respected and studied them for a long time. And then their improvisations were commentary on the basics is beautiful. But yeah, nobody wants to do that because it's like, fuck, your hands hurt, it's seemingly boring, even though it's not. And it takes a long time. You don't just get, there's a wonderful path, but it is a long path to get to that point, I would imagine. I mean, certainly it's that way. When I, when I first started stand up, I was trying to be some kind of, so embarrassing, like I was pretending to be some kind of outsider, a tour, some sort of like thing. And I remember getting off stage at the comedy store, and Eleanor is a comedian there, but at the time it was a waitress, I don't sure she'd started stand up then, but she'd been at the store for long enough to have seen the best, greatest comedians. And I get off stage, and she looks at me and she goes, I don't know if that was, but it wasn't comedy. Eleanor, that's it. Now that's a true teacher, by the way, just just to put the sword in the thing. Yes, no big deal. I'm just going to tell you, I don't know what that was, but it wasn't comedy, and I'm going to walk away. I'm going to save you a couple of years here, maybe a couple of years of flailing by getting right to the point. And to me, it's like that, what we're talking about here, it reminds me of that, which is like, okay, neo-tantra, or is it even that? Or are you just, or is some of it it and some of it not, which is usually the case, right? Usually it's like, there are aspects of some real thing mixed in with the charismatic teacher's confusion and attachment, and that's where everybody gets all messed up. I think the point is to ask the question of yourself, and be as honest as you can. What am I doing here? And what is this about? And what is this? Is it tantra? Is it neo-tantra? Why do I care? And I think tantra, as you were talking, it's like, what comes to me is the ripening. It's a natural path. It's the path of naturalness. There's a ripening that happens that can't be forced. It can't be ambitioned your way through, or you can't pretend your way through it. It's the natural unfolding. It's the ripening. That's what I feel like, like tantra is. How frustrating that is for people. For me. Right. I mean, I was just telling you. It's so frustrating. We think like, okay, I want this thing. So what I'm going to do to get it is work double hard. And I'm going to run faster. I'm going to wake up earlier. I'm going to fucking, I'm just going to like, just think of all the words used to describe it. The grind. What do they say? Put your nose to the grindstone? Nose to the grindstone. Is that what they say? The grindstone. How awful would that be? Like, but you'd shred your nose. Or they say, what are all the words? All the words are like, in comedy, it's like, hit the bricks. But all the words involve violence, self-aggression. It's really, I think it definitely frustrates the identity to get to a thing where it's like, no, it really doesn't matter. You're, whatever the thing, it's not about the way you think shit gets done. So how do you do it then? If it's the ripening, how do you facilitate that? If it isn't all this stuff we've been taught, if it isn't sweating bullets and like really going for it and eye the tiger in your way, running the stairs, doing the thing, what is it? I mean, it's a good question. I've been, I've been asking you the past two weeks, like how do you handle this? And I mean, I know, like I've experienced it in my own life, and I have theories and concepts that are not only mental, that have been integrated and embodied, but it's not, it hasn't stabilized to where it's just always like that. You know, like, for me, I see it as there takes a certain amount of personal will to show up. Okay, sure. Show up. Yeah. And then let it go. And then let it go. So it's like using personal will for the benefit of all beings. Like you got to show up so that the universal will can move through and I will be done. Right. You know, so I feel like there's, there's like, I used to teach at this place called Kripalu on the east coast and they have this methodology that's like three steps of yoga. Step one is you do yoga. Like you, it's a willful thing. Right. Stage two or step two is you do yoga and yoga does you. So it's the meeting of the two. You use personal will, but also there's the surrender, the like opening up, but you got to show up. Right. You got to get yourself there. You got to take yourself to the legend jump. Right. And that takes a fucking lot of will. Yes. And then you jump. Yeah. And that's stage three, which is the free fall yoga does you. You're just being done. Wow. And I think that done by what? Done by what do you want to call it? I mean, I call it, I call it God. I, I've made peace with that word. It took me a while, but I've made peace with that word. And I feel like God is moving through this body and yeah, nothing there. Just that you're just some sort of mechanism, some sort of like aspect of a thing. You don't, there isn't much there. I've heard, you know, descriptions of like neem curly baba and people like that. It's like, yeah, there's just nobody's there. Right. What's the, I can't remember his name, very famous saint. The description was he was a corpse that the universe spoke through. You get around it and it's off putting. Certainly it must be off putting to have that start happening. And, and, and I get the jump part because you, you would have to just at some point give up whatever the game was you were so engaged in, but isn't that just another game? Now I'm a mouthpiece for the universe. Like, isn't it, isn't that just also, isn't it possible to get tricked into thinking that you're that when you're just not that either? Yeah. How do you know the difference? I mean, I don't know that you, I don't know about that, but I know that for me, the whole thing is just about asking the question. All right. That's the whole thing. And it's, it's actually a path of yoga called self inquiry or dhyana yoga, J N A N A. And it's, it's just about asking, resting in the question. Don't know mind. Tripped out. It trips me out when I start, when I like really get into this whole vibe of like self inquiry, because it's really opening to the possibility. It's just questioning everything you think that nothing that you think is true. Yeah, that's pretty crazy. Isn't it? But yeah, right? Yes, I do. Yes. But not, but not like just hearing my words and, and having somebody be like, Oh yeah, she's telling me nothing I think is true. And so I'm just not going to believe any of my thoughts. Like that's a mental, that's a very mental process. I'm talking about self inquiry, which is you got to go in and have that direct experience yourself. That's the realization. That's self realization. You sit in the question. Nobody can tell you anything if you try to get it from somebody else. It's not the thing like you were saying. It's not an up here. It's an internal undoing of everything you've been taught, all these conditionings and concepts and everything you've been taught. So self inquiry is kind of like my where I rest now when, when teaching because it's like teaching. What does that even mean, right? But I, it's just about directing people back to the inside. It's not about giving them something more to like hold on to for their mind to salivate over and be like, Oh, another thing to put in my pocket and like, or beat myself up with. Yeah, I'm not doing right or whatever reinforce ego. It's about just undoing undoing and going inside and sitting in the question and not get so into what is the answer. And I'm not saying it's an easy thing. Because I mean, I'm here in this real world situation trying to figure it out. I've heard Zen teachers talk about this as uncertainty that one of the, the human experience is uncertain. Just they can't be certain because of the nature of being in the bardo of becoming that we're in right now. How can anything be certain? There is no possibility of certainty. You just don't have that luxury and you trick yourself into thinking you do it. So is that, is that the question? Is that being in the question? Is that just allowing your death part? Yeah, that's the death part of there's nothing to hold on to uncertainty. The groundless Tibetan Buddhism would call it the groundless. Like there's just nothing to fucking hold on to. And it feels like death because ego has nothing to hold. Yeah, except it's delusion. Except it's delusion. But then yeah, some I'm sorry to cut you off. Sometimes I think of it as you're falling out of an airplane. But then while you're falling out of an airplane, you're trying to have like a nice dinner with someone you have a table that's falling with you and plates and you're drinking wine. But you're trying to imagine that you're not plummeting through space into oblivion. So it's this very good. It's like the mind wants to imagine you're at a dinner party. The reality as well, you are at a dinner party, but the dinner dinner party has got pushed out of a plane when you're born. And it's plummeting towards oblivion. So yes, this is a very uncertain, this is a very potentially terrifying situation if you really were to fully look at it as it is. Sorry. I would even have a different perspective on this. Should I go down this? Yes. Because you're sitting in a plane having dinner. And then the mind says, this plane is going down and I'm going to die and it's going to be awful and all that stuff. And I would say, is it true? How do you know? Because other than what you're thinking and believing, the reality is that you're sitting there having dinner. Without the story of what's going to happen. Or this image of all this stuff that hasn't happened yet. Who knows? Who knows? Could be a simulator. I mean, exactly. Could be a dream. Exactly. Who knows? So I'm just asking the question. That's cool. Is it true? It's inquiry. I mean, and it just leaves you, it leaves you with nothing, but it leaves you. That's crazy. With nothing, but I guess reality. No story, no imagination. You're just there on the plane having dinner. Wow. Trip out. That is really intense. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. I love it. It brings you right back. And then, which is you're already here anyway, but it pulls you back in. That's cool. Yeah. See, because you're able to go there. You felt that and you dropped into it. And that's not everyone can do that. I talk about this stuff to a lot of people on different groups and they come to workshops and I do the self-inquiry stuff. And it's very confronting for egos, you know? And I get it. I mean, I don't demonize ego. I'm all for it. And I'm like, yeah. Tontra, right? You can have an ego. It's just on play. I mean, ego is great if you're enjoying it. Yeah. Have fun. It's pleasurable. It's also pleasure. It's not this all bad. No. It's just like. Poor ego. All the things. Okay. Well, I don't know if I, we got off track a little bit. No, we got on track. I mean, there really isn't, this isn't, you know, no, we're completely on track because I think that we've hit this like beautiful place of acknowledging the uncertainty. Is it uncertain? Question the uncertainty. And then somewhere in there, you start getting underneath all these layers of paint. And then somewhere in there, this, for me, it's always been like a new possibility emerges or a new renewal, a kind of, and this is why I do understand in Christianity what they call being born again, or that you must die to this world to come to know me, or all of those various ways and all the religions of saying, if you really want this, all you have to do is give up everything and you hear that no problem. Anytime I've heard that, I'm like, Oh, sure, I'll give up everything for realization. And then within moments, right? What the fuck am I talking about? Right? What am I going to give up my, my, my car, my house, my job, my identity as a comic, my podcast, every, am I going to do that? Do I really want, no, you're not, of course not. Your beliefs, your beliefs, like your political beliefs, right? Like all the, even the spiritual beliefs. I mean, the whole game is you got to drop even the spiritual practice at some point, like a good teacher, a good practice means that at some point you won't need it anymore. That is, can you talk about that a little bit more? Because I don't think that gets said enough. And I'd love to hear your take on that. Yeah. I, because there's not a lot of money in that. Sorry. You know what I mean? Yeah, I know. You're like, what do you, what do you, you're running a yoga studio, you know, if the ideas you're going to like get people where they're supposed to be in the like, okay, you're done. Right. Or even like me as a teacher before I opened a yoga center, it's like, my job isn't to be, I don't feel it doesn't feel authentic to me to be like, I know the way. And let me tell you the way, although that creeps in for sure. Sometimes I'm not going to lie. See, and I'm like, huh, that's there. But the idea is that I, it's like, you got to go inside. This isn't dependent upon me. I feel like a good teacher doesn't make a student using this language because it just feels easy. Um, like a student doesn't need me to give them an answer because I don't know. Like it's all about going inside and, and sitting in, in that sitting in the inquiry and sitting in the realization place. Yeah. Well, most people do. I mean, it's uncomfortable. It is unbearable. I can't, my, my son is bringing me into that place all the time now. And it's a mother, not mother fuck to him, but like, I, I, I can't, you know, my wife, she's in her heart. I'm a mind person. I'm always up in my head. I've retreated into my head. I have a wonderful suite at the top of the skyscraper of meat. That is my identity. And it's a beautiful place. Lots of great books. Bhagavad Gita is there. All my favorite Ram Dass lectures are there. Plenty of graphs, maps, flow charts, lots of quantification mechanisms, but damned if there's a feeling that you get when you go down in your heart. And Jesus God, that feeling is so beautiful and so powerful, but I don't like, what are you going to do? You're going to cry on the bus at flowers. You're going to like, you know, you can't, I don't want to. It's really terrifying to me to be there. And my child brings me there. I'm so grateful to even get a little taste of it, but I run, I run right back into my head up the three flights of stairs or how many flights of stairs are between my heart and my head. The elevator broke a few years ago. So at least we get in shape and we're running right over our heart. But the, the, the, you know what I mean? I, it's unbearable. So I get why people like, no, I don't think so, which I think would be another challenge is running a yoga studio is if you want to give the real thing to people, the reaction they're going to have is, thank you. Goodbye. I'll see you. That's not a class for me. I don't want to feel my heart. So how do you do that? How do you deal with that? I feel like I have been in that practice of understanding. I feel like my guru. And I just mean the karma right now is about me learning how to do that. And because I got here to LA and just getting over myself, getting over my stories about what people can handle and can't handle and they're open or they're closed. I felt like everybody's closed here and these people don't know and I want to be, and really it's getting clean here and here. It's getting clear here and here. Like who's being closed in the moment that I'm saying somebody else is being closed? Me. Oh shit. Right. It's just a projection of my mind. And, and when I sit and like do the work of inquiry, it's like, oh, I see it. I see it. And then I feel lighter and I feel clearer and I open up a little bit more. And there's nothing blocking me from that other person anymore. The story that was there isn't there anymore. But it's a constant thing for me. Like I do it and I feel clear and I feel open and there's nothing in between us. And like you were saying then the universe starts to meet because that's the yes. That's the yes. That's me making a decision to say yes is to do my work and get rid of these stories that are really blocking me from clear seeing. Yeah. And then I, and then I can meet people really meet a person without my story about them. And then things start to expand. And then it contracts again. And then it's like rent. And then it's like you got to pay the, you know, pay the teachers and we got it with, and we're figure and it's like, what am I doing wrong? What am I doing wrong? That's the story in my mind that I work with. Like I'm doing something wrong as if I was responsible in the first place. Right. Come on. Yeah. But that's the, the, the stories of my ego. And so that's what I've been doing. That's my practice of just like, I'm questioning, I question, I do the work. I'm a Byron Katie. Have you heard of a woman named Byron Katie? Yeah. Okay. So she is a teacher of mine. And I go to like, I, I, the work that she teaches, it's a system of self inquiry, and it has been so powerful for me. So when I say I'm doing the work of self inquiry these days, that's what it means. I'm doing Byron Katie, the work. My mom was in some, in something called Diamond Heart, which is a lot of self inquiry stuff and Diamond Heart, like from the Buddhist tradition. No, it's called, it was some kind of Sufi. I never, I, you know, when your mom's doing whatever they're doing right now. No. You know what I mean? Yeah. Like, I don't want to, I'm not gonna get it. Your mom could be hanging out with Jesus. Your mom could be hanging out with Vishnu. And you would be like, I don't think I'm gonna, I'm interested in that because you know, you like it. So, but I do know that it was a system of, it reminds me, it actually reminds me of what you're talking about. It was a system of diving into the depth of your projection, conceptual framework and all that, and freeing yourself, liberating yourself to some degree from that weight of that project. Because it sucks. It sucks to be projected upon. Right. I know that. I know when I'm around someone and there's some expectation or they don't like you, or they're projecting on you a way you used to be. I mean, but even that, Duncan, it's like, how do you know? It's like, how do you know? I can feel it. Well, that's the mind. Oh, shit. Don't take that away from me. It's all I have left. I mean, it's just worth asking the question because we think we know. And I mean, it's all about just being willing to, yoga for me is about detaching from your thoughts ultimately at the end of the day. It's like not attaching to what you're thinking and believing to experience what's underneath and all around. You know, earlier I said, were you in a cult? And then I, you know, but was that a cult? But then, and so what's funny about cult is they have this cult deprogramming thing where they come and get you, and then they deprogram you. They're like, no, the guy was not capable of turning into a rainbow. He was just drugging everybody and you were drugged for three months straight. Your parents aren't from the devil and they keep you until you finally snap back into the, you know, reality tunnel of modern day life. But what's weird about certain cults is they're deprogramming you from the reality of modern day life, which is also a cult. And so, you know, so then you begin to realize like, oh, fuck, like what you're talking about is essentially blasphemy. You're talking about blaspheming main, what default reality in the sense of we're going to take everything you think about the way the world is and take it away from you. You don't get it anymore. Oh, okay. But then I would say what I, what I say is I'm not trying to take anything away from you. Like I'm not here to take your story away from you. I'm not. I'm not. Okay. Because that's yours to have. It's like for me, I had this ex boyfriend that was such a pain in the ass and I felt so victimized by him and I was so hurt and wounded and it was very real for me. On some level, I knew this is a story I'm making up, right? But that wasn't what I was experiencing. It felt like I was a victim of this person. He is an asshole and I was a victim. And I felt it. So if somebody came along to me and was like, just drop that. And I had friends that were like, just drop it. And it felt so cruel because it's like, how about I drop you, motherfucker? Yeah, drop kick you. I mean, but it's like, if I could, I would. Right. If I could, I'm like, uh, so I'm, I'm aware that it's not a kind thing to just come in and tell someone, oh, just drop your story. Like I'm, I'm here to take your story away from you. I'm here to invite an inquiry for you to undo the story from the inside out yourself. Like I, I don't feel like it's a kind thing to do to just be like, Hey, drop your story. Cause what's the reality of that? I mean, how many people, I mean, doesn't, at least for me, it didn't happen like that. Some stories I can work through quickly and some they just stay. So whatever. Well, I like what you're saying is, is exciting because I have started to become hyper aware of my, a few stories that I've got that in the past. I'm like, no, this is, this is it, man. You don't understand. One of them is alcoholic father with PTSD, all the addresses I've lived at. And like, I would tell people when I was really like wanting to make sure people understood how rough I'd, I really like tell that story, like serious around the campfire, telling the ghost story that you're when you really want to freak people out. And I've been catching all of that, that react, the way I'm acting it out, the way I'm really like into it, the way it works as a great excuse for being a dick, the way it like all this, and it's fucking it up. So now I'm having more difficulty doing it or cancer survivors, another one, all of it, you know, all of it, you start realizing like, oh, I'm just so sick of it. It's like an old teddy bear or something. It's like an old stinky toy thing. I'm like, I'm, I don't want to do it anymore. I'm not saying it didn't happen to me. Right. It's just that extra, let me gather around and listen to my horror. I want to tell you what I've seen. You know, I feel emotional like right now when you're talking, I'm just feeling, I'm getting emotional because I, I, I feel like also there's a kindness and a compassion to that it happened, that stuff, your story in like having some kindness and some compassion for yourself in, in needing that story. Oh yeah. You know, and like, because it's not done until it's done, not to pretend. And like, I think you're, you have good awareness that you see, you see that you're using the story and that you, you know, there's like a, like a sucking on the story a little bit and like, and, and like a big hug around that, you know, because it's very human. It's so human. Yeah. Yeah. I'm, yeah, I know. I mean, you know, I don't, I know it may seem like I'm being self-effaced. I'm saying the story is heavy. Yeah. It's, it's like a bit, it's like a, it's like carrying around a backpack full of like Shreemukh Band of Atoms or something. I don't want anymore. I don't want to, it's like, oh, it's a heavy thing to carry. And it's like, at some point, if you really look deep, yeah, this is in the Bhagavad Gita. This is one of the verses that I like is it's talking about the soul. It cannot be cut, cannot be withered by the wind. It was never born. It will never die. All of that, you know, I love that. It can't really be touched in the way, you know, the soul is not traumatized. That is a, might be an offensive statement to some people. The soul sits beneath the trauma and it, and this is like really, really crazily edgy. That's what the Bhagavad Gita is putting out there. It's like, well, this thing that you are truly, it's not really going to be touched by this world. And that's very frustrating. It's so radical, right? Like to say that is so radical and especially I feel like right now in these times. And so I, I feel like it was a gift that I had that last relationship where I felt so wounded and victimized because it's made me aware. I think if I didn't have it, I'd be like bypassing like a motherfucker. You know what I mean? Like with all the soul can't be touched. I'm not traumatized. Like you're not your trauma, you know, all of that, which happens. But it has helped me remember that as far as it feels real to me, the trauma, it's real. I mean, and so like, I do want to put that bypassing thing, I want to say it because it's important to, to talk about it and not just say, I hope nobody hears that the soul rests underneath and it can't be touched and trauma just isn't a thing that exists at the soul level. And think that like, I'm sitting here saying, dismissing someone's years of being brutalized. Totally. It to me that yeah, I know it's not to negate you would be negating that thing, which is resting in the soul. And to be doing that is or is ridiculous and it's a delusion really. It's just you need like you need a mama to hold the baby. You know, the baby deserves to be held. This is a baby. The baby deserves to be loved. The baby deserves when it's crying for someone to come and hold the baby and kiss the baby and love the baby. But it's like, if we become all baby and no soul, then we become motherless children. And this is a very, very difficult situation to be in. Who says that? Sometimes I feel like a motherless child. I can't remember some poet, I think, but like that's, that it, you know, that is real. That's the, when I'm all in that shit, I'm a motherless child. I have no one to help me. No one is there. Even people in my life, you can't, you don't know what this is. You couldn't help. And they couldn't help. They could try. Right. But wow, when you find that mother or whatever you want to call it, the soul, and you realize you are being held, you're being held forever. Now you can fall asleep. I'm just crying. You know, you have such a good way. I got to tell you, can I just say this? I'm just going to say it. I didn't know. So I had been living in Asia for a really long time. Yeah. I was so out of like pop culture. I didn't know what the fuck's going on with entertainment industry really. And, and I came and we opened up this place and David came on board and it was amazing. And he's like, we got to get Duncan Tressel on in here. That's cool. And I was like, okay, I don't know. I don't know because I had been living under a rock, obviously. And I was like, I don't know. Like in Asia, you're not familiar with obscure podcasters. The obscure podcaster mailing didn't make it out there. I mean, it's funny because people were like, you don't know Duncan Tressel. I'm like, I don't know anybody. I have not been living here. So anyway, so and, and then I was asking David, tell me about him. He's like, well, he's a comedian. He's, and I just thought, I don't, how does, if you put yourself in my place, I'm living in India, Asia, I'm living this whole other existence. I get to LA and I'm thinking, here it comes, the LA stuff of like, I'm going to have to sell out and not do all the things. And, and I was resistant. I was thinking, well, this isn't showbiz. Like this is mindfulness meditation. And David was like, just give it a, give it a chance. And I mean, I've told you this, but the more and also I'm paying attention. I'm paying attention who crosses my path. And I'm also very curious. And so the more I got to know you, it's like, I, I was like, what the first time that you started talking with David about Buddhism and the path I was blown away, because the way that you speak about these things is like you have integrated these teachings. Like it's not like you're speaking from just a headspace. It's like you've lived it and you're embodying them. The, the way that you speak about it to somebody else is the measure of how much you've internalized it yourself. And you can, you can communicate it so well. And I thought, whoa, and deep things. I've seen some very, very miraculous parrots. You know, you're like, holy fuck it. Shit, that parrot's a genius. Wow, that parrot, that parrot, that parrot is amazing. And I do, and again, this sounds self-effacing and I appreciate what you're saying. But I'm in the only reason I say it is because I have, I'm, I'm one of my, I have, I've been having this wonderful teacher on named Mitch Horowitz and he teaches Western esotericism. He's awesome. But he calls himself a seeker on the path. This is what I am for sure. Yeah. And, and, and, and meaning, in the other thing that popped into my head when you were saying that is, Oh boy, I'm glad you're friends with Aaron, because you just, just talked to her about how well I've integrated any of this shit. Because it's like, but I can talk about it. And I do, and part of me is aware of it and, and, and, and I do live in it. But boy, I am so wobbly and so like up and down with it in the most extreme way that like, and when I hang out with someone who has a practice, it comes out more. When I'm around comedians, I'm funnier. Right. You know what I mean? So you pull something out, which is wonderful. And I like it where I'm like, wow, a motherless child. That's the soul is the mother. Hold it. Well, that's cool. Who the fuck said that? I'll have to remember that. Have you written any books? I want to read one. But you know what I mean? That that I find that to be more of a relate. That's why it's good to hang out with people like you and to have a community of spiritual seekers and why this in all the religions, this gets recommended over like, you know, fall into good company. And that's all you need. And then something else comes into the room where you get to enjoy it. And you also don't get to own it. And that's, you know, well, that's it. You know, but that's what I mean about you. It's like, I don't feel like you're up here trying to say, I have the answer. You're a genuine seeker. And that is the place that you speak from. And that's what resonates with every, because I am too. I don't know who anybody that says they actually really know what the fuck is going on. That's a red flag. Watch out. They're going to try to have sex with you. Guaranteed. They are a matter of time. Not the meditation. There should be like a new tender for that. A tantric tender and not the meditation. I think it existed at a gamma. I think we had something like that. I can't remember. What was it called? It was an actual look. Yeah, I mean, I don't want to say it out. Is a gamma still in existence? Oh my God, it was so controversial. And actually, I went, I went through this whole thing of like, Oh, I don't want to say a gamma. I don't want anyone to know I came from that school. It was a huge deal. It was a huge deal. They're still operating, but I don't think it's going to go. I mean, people are like writing rape culture, spray painting, somebody tried to burn down one of the halls. I mean, it's just like, wow. So it was it was bad, bad, bad, bad, like deep. It was a cult. It was a sex cult, classic Thailand sex cult, just a basic classic sex cult. And the problem with cults, I think, and where it's really sad. And this is why I think the if you want to get some really fucked up karma, be a goddamn charlatan and start revising scripture that has been evolving for thousands of years to fit your selfish desires. And then and then because then what ends up happening is the reason your cult worked is because there was something real there. There was realness to it. There was I meet people all the time, raising a fundamentalist Christian family, brutalized by a fundamentalist Christianity, shamed by Jesus. Their version of Jesus was a shaming, monstrous entity that hated everything they wanted to do as a kid. And it's so sad because then they lose Jesus. They lose the possibility of the Christ consciousness, the compassion. And it's so sad because they're so angry at the bullshit version of Jesus that got rammed in down their throat that they just they can't even and I get it. They can't look at a Bible without having an anxiety attack. Yeah, I get it. But it's sad because you lose the thing and all cults, Jim Jones, you name any fucking cult, no matter how fucked up it was, guaranteed if it was like powerful, there's a thread in there. There's something in there that's real that got distorted by the the whoever the cult leader was. And that's a that to me that is a sin. If there ever was a sin, it's doing that to be virtual crimes. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, but you said it yourself. This whole thing is a cult. I mean, are are the way that we live? I mean, the collective society, the mind group, the mind think it's it's a cult. It's a cult. So to me, this word cult, when people say cult, I'm like, yeah, but culture, culture. I mean, our culture, I mean, yeah, we're told all these stories. We're just so immersed in it. It guides our lives. We don't stop to question. We all have buy in. And if we don't buy in like this, then what's wrong with you and you're fucked up? I mean, it's it's all, it's all to me, varying degrees of the same thing, which is just the buy in, you're just buying into it. So I don't yeah, I don't have such a thing. Like, yeah, it was a cult. It was just we chose to go there to transgress some things. And then in the this era, looking back now, like the after me to and man, that activated some wounds on personal trans personal level. But looking back at these things now, it's like, how did that any of that fly? But at the time, it was a different story. At the time, it was like, let me get in here. I want to like push my boundaries. I want to, I want to explore. I want to transgress and close systems. All you need is a close system. Like, yeah, you know, the comedy store goes through phases. And there was a sadistic phase at the comedy store at one point where comedians were like doing the most horrific things to each other, like really bad. Really? Oh my god. Like what? Just psychological abuse, like really like dark shit, you know, pranks, but deep, deep, deep, hardcore pranks. And it was in a weird way. We did all understand that through this way that we are all fucking with each other at that time, we were learning a lot about ourselves. Right. And but we're also going too far. And you were just seeing like just this, you know, it was it was crazy was the end of it was like the end of the era of Mitzi Shore and just anytime a kingdom is, you know, any, you know, when the, what is it? What's the Arthurian saying? It's like something like the land is the king, the land is the when the queen is sick, the land is sick. So it's like, but anyway, comedies are certainly a cult, by the way. But when you have closed systems, um, yeah, within these strange cultures appear, because there isn't the outside world to get in and be like, what the fuck are you doing? Right? So shit can go haywire fast. Okay, that's a closed system. Yeah, closed system. When you're insulated from the, you know, when you're a bubble in a bubble, that yeah, that's why we look at these things. We like, how did it get to look at this, the prison experiment, you know, look at what happened there when people were given these different roles, how very quickly shit just went crazy or the, you know, just give, put 20 people in a room for six years and see what happens if they don't have any access to the outside world. No one to talk to, no one to tell them this is right or wrong. Just food that comes in through a door and then see at the end of the 20 years, they will have developed their own religion, probably their own spirituality. They'll be of some deaths. He'll be some weird leader. Maybe they'll be communists. Who knows. But you know what I'm saying? Could be Lord of the Flies, could be, you know, paradise. But when you get that close off the Petrie dish, yeah. I mean, but that is, there's something about that that I'm very drawn to. Yeah. Right. Are you, I mean, I, I feel like most of society would be like, that's dangerous and it's a cult and stay away and it's not healthy, but there is, and I get it. I can get there. And also I'm going to be honest about, there's something so fascinating to me about that, right? Sure. That you can just close it up, close the circuit up. Yeah. Outside world's not getting involved. That's right. Let's fucking do this. Like let's go in and see what happens when we're disoriented. It's like getting disoriented. That's right. And the assumption people have that this fucking world that they're in right now isn't tiny. You know what I mean? It's like, when you really look at your life, it's like, how, how far do you really travel outside your normal path? Are you sure there's a world out there? Are you positive you're not in a like small area, small radius? And that's the other thing I love is these things you're talking about. It's like, they're all these trapdoors in the reality tunnel of consensus reality, as it's called. And the trapdoors lead to these, I don't know, vacuums, the monasteries, the mystery schools. Who knows what the fuck? I know they're out there for sure. I know that as above so below. I know because I just know it. I know that thing that you were in was a tiny, tiny, tiny, probably a fragment off of one of them. But like, there's big, big ones, big ones, and you don't get in. You just don't get in unless they want you in. And they won't let you go in because I imagine because they don't want to hurt you. You're not ready. You need to just, this is like the, you know, the thing you put the egg in to hatch it. What's that called? This is the, this is where eggs are hatched. There's other rooms of the, there's other parts of the hive. We just don't get to go into them. And the ones, like the one you're talking about when it, when the main hive hears about them like, what the fuck? Burn the chamber! That's not supposed to happen! Not understanding, oh no, these are everywhere, these chambers, and they must exist. They must, this is why all these teachers, they vanish for years and years. Where do they go? Where did Jesus go? Where did the boy, they say the Buddha went into the forest. What happened really? All this, the, the Crowley talks about this, all the stories, what do they have in common? Someone vanishes. They go away. Where did they go? Where did they go? So then should they, would you say that they shouldn't, is it, does it take us back to the question of they should not be existing these things, these communities, right? I mean, try to stop them. It's such a tricky thing to talk about right now. I mean, when I think, because clearly this man was accused of rape, like, oh yeah, you know, horrible, horrible, seemingly, probably, but I mean, but by, by this, what you're saying, it's like, this was meant to be, right? This, this is part of the, this is part of the lila. This is part of the play. Like this is a thing that's happening. And, and yeah, I know what you're saying. It's there until we got to come in and, and until just the natural unfolding says you can't be there anymore. I look at these, you know, I love these, sometimes a fish video will pop up. The fish are just swimming along and this thing jumps out of the sand. I don't know what they are. They're weird sand fish, horrible looking things. And they just eat the fish. The fish was just going, it was just, it was just swimming. And then suddenly it was like under the sand getting eaten. Trapped or spiders, they exist too. Now for a trapped or spider, that awful fish, it's like, well, that's just what it is. But I mean, what I'm saying is they're traps. That sounds like a trap and it sucked. And I, you know, I, we have to figure out a way in the world to deal with evil, right? Like, how do we deal with evil in the world? And one trick that people use as well, it was part of my path. It taught me a lot. And that's great, as long as you're the one saying it. Right. And that's what you were telling me too. Right. If you're the one saying it's great, right, it was part of your path. Right. But sometimes like I've heard teachers, right, you're not one of them, but I have heard teachers do this thing about like, we just have to accept that when you see a child, right, he's going through the most horrific thing a child could go through, right, some astral lobby, they signed up for make me not have skin for the only three months of my life. I fucking hate that. Yeah. Because I think it's, I just don't believe it works like that. And I think it's okay to be like, no, I like what you're saying. Don't know seems fucked up. I'm going to say fucked up. I'm going to say if someone's burning down halls of a Thai community center for yoga and spring rape culture on the wall, where there's that's bad. It was a bad place. I'm just going to say it. Fuck it. You're allowed to just fuck that place. Didn't do anybody any good. Just made bad reputation for people who are in the other rabbit holes, maybe, or the other places that are actually trying to like utilize tantric teachings in a society where that shit is blasphemous to wake people up and they're doing it with an authentic heart. I don't know if they're out there. I'm assuming they are. And I would understand why they have to work in secrecy because they can't not be secret, because if they are not secret, then people who don't need to be there get in there. And then those people go crazy. And then they have to deal with it. I get the idea of like, oh, we stay in the background. That's not our jam to be out there. So I understand. I'm just assuming. I'm rambling on and on about something that maybe doesn't exist. I have no fucking clue. I'm pretty sure it does. But when you hear about those little parts that fail, it's like, yeah, it was like somebody got to someone fucked up, man. But also, I know, as having been victimized in the past, it's easier for me to like try to repaint the story in a way that it wasn't quite as bad. Or it was like, you know what I mean, with parents, we do that, right? To think, yeah, maybe one of your parents was a fucking narcissist, right? You know what I mean? Maybe you were actually completely brutalized for your childhood by someone who couldn't get out of their head. You know, it's okay to, but that's the shit. I don't want to write my journal. We are, by the way, I'm going on and on. I feel like we got to this beautiful point that you made about 15 minutes ago. And then I rambled. I'm sorry. I'm into it. The uncertainty. I love it so much. And having the guts to not know. Oh my God. Hot. Having the guts to not know. That's it, really. This is what you teach here? Is this part of your teaching? Yeah. I mean, yeah, for sure. I, you know, I get it. You are a teacher. Like you, you will say to me, you know, these things that are very nice, but you are the real, this is real, like what you're doing. It's very powerful. And it really does like cut right to the to me, like the the heart of the matter, no pun intended, which is like, God damn it, I don't want to go down there. I don't want to do, I don't want to do that level of work. Sometimes I feel like what you, that's it. Just having the guts to not know and say, I don't know. And I'm, sometimes I don't have the guts to do that. And sometimes I do. And that's just it. It's just going on like that day by day. Sometimes I do. Sometimes I don't. And then we'll see what comes externally from all of that. People in your yoga classes cry, I bet you. That's a common thing, huh? That is so fun. It is a thing. And it's like, we used to joke that I had this resonance. It's like, what did you do to that person in that class? Like, because they just would cry. But on, I like, I, this is, this isn't false humility. I even wonder if I should say it aloud or not. But I don't feel like it's me when I get up there to teach. It really feels like I'm just kind of tripping out on what shows up and I like it. It feels amazing for me. And I'm touched by it. I, right? Like, so, yeah, something amazing happens. But I do have to say it is this, a very big piece that I feel strongly about in teaching. And I ask all the teachers here to do it is a consecration before they teach, which is basically offering the fruits of the practice of the class up. So that it's not about them and their personal will or what they want to get out of the class or them being a good teacher. It's just, you show up to let whatever needs to come through you, come through you. Yeah. And in this way, it's also like a karma thing. Like, if you're open, it'll burn clean. You know, it's not about like taking on karma from people and thinking you're responsible for what happens there. Like you are responsible. The teacher, Susan is responsible. It's like, it's not about me. And when there's a strong consecration, it ideally is just that it burns itself clean. And there's no one there to take anything. And I think that's where the crying might come from. I don't know. I did, you know, this whenever I get around certain teachers, you just start crying. You really don't even know what you don't have to know. Right. Yeah. But it does like, and it'd be your mind wants to come up with like, Oh, that's why I was tearing up. Right. But it's like, no, I don't even know if that's what it was. It was just something about like, you know, it's I heard someone, maybe you could elaborate on this. We don't have a few more minutes. But someone was telling me like tears are like, don't hold back tears. Because it's a talk. It's literally toxicity. It's an energetic flow trying to come out of you. Is there some yogic? Well, I mean, I don't know about we could go in a few different directions there. But I mean, just energetically, it's it's just energy moving when there's when there's emotion. You breathe some, some energy into spaces in the physical body, it's all really all related physical body, energy body, emotional body, mental body, spiritual body, yoga would say it's all connected. So if you are feeling something like the physical body can trigger something in the emotional body, then then then the energy body, because behind every emotion is an energy. Right. And with me here. Yes. So if energy starts moving, emotions start moving, like we're as before, there's some blocked energy here, then I start to breathe prana into that space, energy gets there, then emotions stuck emotion starts to move. And then it just is coming. It's just coming like this. It's like no story. It's just sensation. It's just feeling its energy, let it come. And for some people, crying is crying is, is how energy moves. For me, I'm just tears, I'll just be taught like today. I mean, just tears will come, I'll be talking to somebody and I just noticed tears start falling down my face. It's just what I conceptualize it as now is energy. Like when I was in Spain and I was practicing four hours a day, I was crying and crying and crying. And I don't even think about it now. I don't even think, Oh my God, I'm crying, like all that stuff was gone in like the first year. I just, to me, it's just like energy is flowing. I make love, just tears, like crying, you know, crying and it might freak somebody out who's not used to all this, but it's like, to me, it's just energy flowing. I sweat, right. I sweat tears. Wow, this is, this is such a wonderful conversation. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you for letting me do sits here. I love this place. The five year is so good. Echo Park is so lucky to have you. And can you just let people who maybe are in the LA area want to like come here? Can you tell them what the deal is? I know you've got some class coming up. Yeah. So I am teaching a six week long course called yoga, sex and death. And it's a, it's a pretty intense deep dive. We go, we go deep in the philosophy of yoga, but also into like psycho spiritual work. We, we get into the story psychologically, the whole narratives, mother, father, sister, brother. And then we, we practice letting go in yoga, in how that relates to sexuality and also this uncertainty of death. And so when we get to the death part three, this part three part where we're actually looking at the, what happens according to the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, what happens when you die. So it, it can be confronting these things like sexuality and death can be confronting for people. So I just like to put it out there from the beginning. Like this is for sure, a course that will bring up some resistance sometimes. So just know that. And it's a course that can be confronting, but it's for those who, who really want, it's like the path of the warrior, I call it. Dave, it's always like, why do you, you're not selling this to people when you talk about it like that was a sale. Okay. That's just like, holy shit. Any time you're like, yeah, this is why I love magic books. Cause they all start with like, don't read this or you're going to go nuts. Oh, like understand if you read this, your eyes will melt. Like, and you're like, holy shit, I'm buying this book. Well, that's what I say. I'm like, well, then my people will find this, like the people that really want it will be the people that are meant to be there. I feel like I just want to be, say it like it is from the beginning and the people that want it will find it. Yes. So I'm just going to keep doing that. Yeah. So yoga, sex and death starts January 15th. And I mean, we have yoga on the daily schedule, Pilates on the daily schedule, mindfulness meditation on the daily schedule. We just want to create community, like a space for people to come. And I feel strongly about feeling safe so that they, they can go inside of themselves. Like this isn't a place where it's like, this is how you do it and dogma. And it's like, let's just work it out together. Let's be in community. Let's have these conversations. Let's just figure it like, let's just be together and be in this experiment to find what is in here, to find, to remember, you know, to remember what's inside. You heard it, friends.

I wish I was in Costa Rica with you. Yeah. I, you know, ordinarily, I would say, oh, it's probably, you know, be there now and all that kind of stuff. But I think being here now is pretty cool. I mean, it's unspeakably beautiful here. Yeah. And it's, I saw your view. The people are kind. They have this thing Puravita, which is just a way of being, the people are gentle and kind of kind. There's a community here around the Blue Spirit Retreat Center, which is where I'm playing a week with Krishna Das, his guitar player. I'm getting to be my musical, you know, person that I get to be. I'm in a beautiful house. And I wrote to a dear friend of mine, I said, if you're depressed, in this place, it's your own damn fault. Oh, isn't that the worst? To me, that was always the sort of the, what was so sinister about LA is that, you know, inevitably, especially if you're coming to LA to like, do stand up or like actor and you're going through the pain your dues as it's called, you are going to have bad days and to like be faced with a reality that you are in the most beautiful place you've ever seen, blue skies, beautiful. It's like the weather is perfect, but it's not doing anything to assuage the whatever your particular problem is. I mean, that's where LA becomes like very dystopian is that it's sort of dystopian. Yeah, that's right. Well, you know, it all comes back to us, you and I have talked about many times and I'm wearing my t-shirt today, the six realms, my book Awakening from the Daydream. So, you know, there's, we've talked about it before, and probably it's not a good thing to focus on now, but just in passing, there are six realms in the Buddhist way of looking at it. There are descriptions really of psychological ecosystems that you project onto the situation, but they also are coming from the seemingly outside. Yeah. So, it's an inside-outside kind of deal. And in the god realms, you know, what you call Debaloka, everything's kind of nice and easy and set up, but they didn't notice impermanence yet. So, it's like watching somebody on a canoe trip, you know, and it's a beautiful day and the birds are chirping and they don't see that they're approaching a rapids. Right. So, there's no awareness of the rapids, which let's call that old age sickness and death, which is what I've been thinking about almost nonstop. You have. You know, it's, and I was going to write a tune called the old age sickness and death blues. What do you think? I love it. Yeah. Yeah. But here you don't think about that. You go, oh, it's so nice. I'll go for a swim. I'll go for a walk. What are you so uptight about? Just chant some mantras, chill out. You know, but it's a temporary and illusory experience, not because of itself, but because of our bringing to a desire to sustain it in an unrealistic way. Right. Yeah, that's always, it's a bummer, right? That's the, that's sort of the driving away from Disneyland feeling. Do you remember that when you were a kid? Did you ever have that? I did. I know. That's a really good one. Driving away from Disneyland. You're clutching your little souvenir, your garbage snow globe, staring desperately back. You fantasized about getting off their rides and living in the haunted mansion, and suddenly you're out, man. It's over. You're not going back there for a long time, and you experience the heart like real heartbreak kids experience like legitimate heartbreak because of their inability to sort of accept the impermanence of those like heightened moments when you go on a vacation or a cool trip. And as you, and I have met our hearts and minds about this so many times, it's an essential conversation. And for all of our friends out there who are like contemplating a kind of spiritual dimension to life, if it does not include old age sickness and death and the notion of suffering being woven into the fabric of our relative existence, it's not Buddhism. Right. It might be something else. Right. But that's like, and it's not that you're depressed and like negative. Oh, life sucks. You know, it's not that at all. It's just what is it actually, what's the arc of our life is. It is clearly something to bring into present awareness that the situation that you find so delicious right now, whether it's a bowl of gelato or a beautiful lake or is impermanent, just the nature of it is impermanent. I think one thing to consider is that as far as we're aware, compared to any other time in recorded history, there is this strange possibility that what we currently call the human realm could shift and turn into a god realm that, you know, that it could go from being human realm to god realm. And this is the dream of the transhumanist. And this is the, not just a dream. This is sort of, if you look at all the threads of evolution in the various fields that could transform humanity into something completely different, you see that along with the possibility we're all very well, well, we know, the scary one, nuclear war, climate disaster, apocalypse, that, you know, Terrence McKinney used to say, it's like there's a race right now, a neck and neck race between these two possibilities. But no matter what, human realm, if you look at, whether you're looking at the metaphysics of most world religions that involve the apocalypse, so the eschatological perspective points towards a dramatic massive radical shift, including in Buddhism, maybe on different timescales, but similar versions of abrupt change at some point. Or if you look at it from the perspective of life extension therapy, that we all just became essentially lab rats for what will inevitably be a technology that doesn't just help us with viruses, but probably grows our hair back, cures cancer, they're already working on it, thus extending the human lifespan statistically. It's called Taoism, by the way. This idea has, you know, elixir of life, you know, immortality. The Fountain of Youth, with the mixed in with this, there is, so you could, if you wanted to, as a human, knowing you're going to die, you're going to get old, everyone around you is changing in front of you, your grandparents, you know how they're doing, or if they're even alive, you know it's there, but you can, if you want to, entertain something that's a little bit more than the elixir of life, that is like, you can look at research papers, human life extension therapy, I'm just throwing out there, we have to admit, within the buddhist concept of reality, there was no mRNA vaccine, there was no AI, there was no internet, there was, there was none of the things we have now to show a path forward that could potentially fly in the face of old age, disease, and death, blues, and I think that's interesting, it just, this stuff wasn't around. Well, just keep in mind that God realms, for example, can last for eons, you could have that formula could, you stabilize the causes and conditions of it, it's even beyond the level of this temporal physical world, and you're in a bliss state for eons, and then you know, you know what they say then, after that karma wears out, because it is a karma, it is propelled by causes and conditions at some point, Gampopa says your armpit begins to sweat, and a little bit of a BO thing happens, and you go, uh-oh, and then you, that karma crashes, that level of kind of absorption, meditative absorption tends to crash, because it's not sustained by any kind of regular disciplined, you know, exercise that's going on, it's just been given, and you crash, you go right to the hell realms, isn't that funny? I always think of like 1929, you know, those people jumping out of those windows, you could have just moved into your grandma's house in the Bronx, you didn't have to jump out of a window. Yeah, or you could have like gotten a life insurance policy, and figured out a better way to like, support your family, that was, you know, there's ways to, if you're gonna, if you're gonna end your life, there's probably better ways to do it than jumping out a window, also jumping out a window, come on, there's like, I think back then you could just go to the drug store, and get a jar of morphine, what are they thinking man, God, and I know what you mean though, it's like you're watching the, you're watching like, it's, you know, it's not raining men, it's raining gods, it's raining jealous gods, it's, you're watching them fall out, they kill themselves, because they would much rather be like, not have a body anymore, than experience, probably the just normal reality of most people who don't know what it's like. Or compassion. Yeah. The awesome, devastating power of compassion. Yeah. The destructive power of compassion. Yeah. Yeah. Atremendous thank you to the glorious herbalists over at herbstomp.com.

I feel it's all mapped out, and I hear you, and of course, as you well know, I'm a techie, and I was reading the Singularity, you know, Kurt Wilde's book. Kurt Wilde's book, The Singularity is Near, one of my faves. Yeah, while I was in Bhutan looking at the temples, same convergence, you know, thinking well with these two things, do anything with each other, and I would have to say that from my perspective, limited perspective, these things have come and gone for eons, including probably whole civilization, high-tech civilizations, if I had to guess, say, because the principle underlying it is what is sustaining what, and is there a perpetual motion machine of some kind that you can plug into your very limited and greedy little self-oriented sense of what bliss could be. So I just want to go on the record of saying, since I'm very interested in talking more with students these days about what I would call a tantric perspective, a Vajrayana perspective in Buddhism, which is that the real problem with most of how we frame out bliss in a spiritual context is there's still somebody holding it, so it's limited in scope, and I would say if there was an understanding of the insubstantiality of the experiencer, the bliss would be at a level you couldn't even, ego can't hold it, can't contain it, so it'd be radically blissful, but it's also empty. So we talk about in tantra, the union of bliss and emptiness. I love that combo, right, union of bliss and emptiness, because the empty people say, oh, don't get too happy here, you know what I mean? And then the spiritual bliss people, they go like, oh, don't worry about all that other stuff. This, we can transcend it, we can go above it. But the idea of bringing those two principles together and no real substantial permanent entity has to take on the athletic super event of holding that shit together, which you just fire that person. If only that's the reality we live in. See, that's the world I want to be in. I want to be in the reality where the Olympics has got like a bliss holding challenge, like who can maintain simultaneously holding on to their identity and experiencing transcendent bliss. Oh, I'm in the right place for that. There's plenty of people here who are doing that. I mean, I'm not going to point, there's so many tribes doing the spiritual exploration in the West now that everybody's represented, every tradition's represented. And some of them will talk about bliss and union and oneness as something that is experienceable without totally surrendering your concept of who would experience it. Yeah, the cake can eat it too thing. I mean, it's the, and I get that, I think that's very exciting. I mean, I, this is the, I love the stories of Krishna and I especially love the breakdown of the mythology into a way of talking about the encounter with bliss while maintaining identity and the, this sort of dualistic path towards complete dissolution in a different way, falling in love to the point of non-beingness is pretty awesome. I mean, I love it. And, but then also mixed into there, it's fun to throw the aggregate Buddhist stuff in like, well, what are we talking about when we're talking about a Hanaman? What are we talking about when we're talking about a Krishna? Is it, does it got parts? Like if you disassemble, does it have atoms? Is it, and, and, but also interestingly enough, within the breakdown of the relationship seems to be an admission of interdependence in the sense that like when you're chanting, sorry, Krishna, you're chanting Dorada, Radha, Krishna's lover. And that, and that that with no one to fall in love with you, it doesn't matter anymore. You need the bifurcation of your creation and the imposed amnesia to successfully execute that love affair. You can't Krishna. I think that's, that's where the tantric perspective as I, you know, have learned about it comes into play because you're not just trying to annihilate duality because duality is what allows for union. There's no such thing as union if there's no diversity. So you're holding both truths. It's called the two truths. We've talked about this a million times, absolutely, and the relative truth. And the third truth is the inseparability of those two. Now, if somebody says, um, what, you know, um, you can repeat that there's some unconditional fabric, you know, that is not based on an individual journey. And then there's some individual journey going on. You don't need to negate either one. So we say not one or not two, we negate both of them, each of them. To avoid getting conceptual about it, to avoid making too much of a big deal about it. I think that unless you are like between the ages of zero and two, you maybe three, maybe five, I don't know, but unless you're like a very like enlightened four or five year old, or just a normal baby, that we've, you've become like so entranced and so convinced of the material stuff that the sort of the, you know, earth plane shit, you know, and that that a lot of I think it might be easy to confuse bliss. You start experiencing when you realize that that's not all that's going on here with, is there a difference between that bliss and the bliss of emptiness, the, the, the place where blissfulness and emptiness meet. I'm talking about the relief, the waking up from a bad dream, the, oh wow, this is incredible. The little glimpses you start getting of it where you're like, oh, what? Wow. Wow. Holy shit. And then within that, then when you start realizing that it's, maybe there's actually ways to tune into that. And it doesn't take as long because it doesn't take once a year that potentially there's a way to start tuning into that all the time that I see how you would get imbalanced in the other way. Who the fuck wants to, you know what I mean? That's right. Sure. That's right. Like, do you remember when you found out you could come? I remember exactly. And, and, and the point is, you're going to be jerking off a lot. That was a layup drill. You know what I mean? Like, when you find out, I have to admit that is what, that is exactly what happened. That's what happened. Professor Drussell, yeah, that's good. Thank you. To continue my lecture on the coming. So yeah, but what I'm saying, you know, like, oh my god, it's like built in to the early part of a human life. It's amazing. Like, you can do this thing that produces some of the most extreme feelings of pleasure you've ever had in your life. Add to it, depending on what your family's like. It's taboo. Maybe you're not supposed to do this. Is this off limits? Oh my god. Then like now you have access to this sort of incredible heightened super experience that you didn't have before. Well, I mean, the whole family should celebrate. Right? Because it's also like, by the way, grandma, that's how you're going to get great grandchildren. That's, it's good news, you know? It shouldn't be bad news. It shouldn't be bad news. But it just depends on the culture where you're at or whatever, you know, and now you have the conversation, whatever it should be shameful. But what I mean is like, I think that there is another version of that that is possible in adulthood too. But except sadly, we don't get there from rubbing our genitals. It's more of some kind of, maybe from rubbing our genitals, I don't know, but it's more of a, I'm saying this other thing that the various tribes or aspects of the spiritual community have all stumbled upon is like, what? There's this? What is this? And then once that happens, suddenly you get Buddhism, you get Islam, you get all the world religions, there are various ways of talking about, hey, there's another thing going on here. And it's incredible. And you don't even need it. You don't need it, genitals. You don't even need a body. But, but aside from that, yeah, I think, you know, when you said relief, just, and I feel like partly my job is just to hang out and talk about anything. But partly my job is to sort of, every once in a while, bring it back to the Buddhist framework, since that's kind of my card, you know, and stuff like that. Yeah. You know, and it is, it is a powerful framework not to inflict on people as a kind of clinical schematic diagnosis of something that's ineffable. But this is a way of progressing. So the idea that the relief you mentioned earlier stuck out in my mind of like, you're in a knot, you're twisted into a knot, and you recognize that at some point in life, you go, you know, what the hell, man, I'm sitting here in Costa Rica looking out at the ocean, and I'm feeling anxious about whatever, you know, and you go, what, what is that knot? And you become curious about the knot, and I'm seeing K and OT. Yeah. And the Hinayana, the very basic discipline of developing recognition of the knot, and also a sense of gentleness about experiencing it, and maybe even curiosity about it. And then seeing that the knot is not really made of anything solid, which it's not, the knot is not solid. Yeah. And you have a relief that is called, you know, satori or, you know, or a kind of, it's the stage of the arhat, you are liberated from that personal knot for, for however, you know, however deeply it goes. But it has not yet occurred that there are sitting right next to other knotted beings. And in standing as far as limitless space is concerned, you look at the squirrel, you know, on your property, just trying to get a nut from one place to another. You look at the woodpecker, you know, just banging his head into the wall to get it warm. You look at your kids getting frustrated. You look at, you know, your society, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And then you give birth to another level of practice, really, of discipline, which is including the naughtiness of others in a really creative way. That's called the Mayana teachings, right, the big teachings. Now, that's a very intentional path. It's beautiful. It is so intentional, though, you have to remember a lot of stuff and you have to kind of carefully look at your habits and how they obstruct compassion and communication every day in so many ways. And you have to be willing to work with that. And they say, if you practice Mayana, you know, rigorously, that in three Kalpas, three eons of lifetimes, you would achieve liberation. Wow. Three eons. It's a long time of being a great bodhisattva. Yeah. Now, what's the difference? And this is a perspective that I was drawn to in my exploration of Buddhism and other spiritual traditions in the Vajrayana tradition that emanated from India and from the yogis in India, the Mahasiddhas in India, not, not, you know, monastic people that came late way later. And these yogis achieve some kind of wakeful energy that's completely beyond negotiation, navigation, modulation, calibration. It's just like somebody who's, you know, not formulating, not conditioning their experience along those kind of plus and minus grid. And they pass that tradition through some very interesting, and we're going to start talking about this at Dharmamun, the lineage tree, teacher to teacher to teacher to teacher. That is only this tradition is only human transmission. Yeah, at this point, you need a human being to to get the gist of this. But they say, I'm just again, passing along, that you could, if you are just applied those that method and that perspective, you could achieve that same kind of yogic freedom that those great progenitors, those Siddhas had in this very lifetime. Right. In other words, before you go, you know, on your way to the beach, my chest feels weird. And then dealing over before that, you could recognize and even stabilize a kind of clear, lucid, luminous, fluid state of being It's the new year, friends. I don't know what your goals are, but maybe you want to manage your budget better, save money. And if you want to do this one incredible tool, you can use as rocket money. I used them before they supported my podcast, Rocket Money, formerly known as True Bill is a personal finance app that finds and cancels your unwanted subscriptions, monitors your spending and helps you lower your bills all in one place. Now, this is not in what they want me to read. So my apologies, Rocket Money, if this is off the tracks too much, but I'm somebody who in the old days enjoyed going on the internet, high as a kite, late at night, and I would subscribe to anything, any apps, whatever, I would just subscribe to it because I wanted the highest version of the app. And then of course, the next day, I would completely forget that I had subscribed to that app. I would forget that I had subscribed to that Amazon channel. I would forget all of the weird monthly subscriptions that I had managed to rack up. But I kind of knew they were out there. I just want to go through the trouble, the trouble of untangling my weird connections, the shit I never needed in the first place. This is why I love Rocket Money. Rocket Money will quickly and easily identify your subscriptions for you. So you could stop paying for the ones you don't want. They make cancelling subscriptions as easy as a click of a button. You simply find the subscription you don't want and press cancel. And Rocket Money will cancel it for you. No more long hold times with customer service or tedious emailing back and forth. They're going to get you out. They're going to liberate you. Over three million people have used Rocket Money, saving the average person up to $720 a year. Stop throwing your money away, cancel unwanted subscriptions, and manage your expenses the easy way. By going to rocketmoney.com slash Duncan, that's rocketmoney.com slash Duncan. Rocketmoney.com slash Duncan. Thanks, Rocket Money. You could recognize and even stabilize a kind of clear, lucid, luminous, fluid state of being. Yeah. Which would contain the two lower Yanis. It would contain the natural compassion for all beings. It would contain the level of discipline that keeps it from becoming a Godro. It's very tight. So that's the journey. I'm just passing that along. Honestly, I'm really, I treat Buddhism like classical music, Duncan. There's a lot of people treating it like jazz and you got to come up with your own sod and this and that. To me, it's like you go back and learn what Bach did and how composition works. Okay, then you could become Prokofiev. Then you can become Schoenberg. So I like working with people who are willing to at least learn the formal path and then figure out which tool is good for you. I mean, honestly, most people are going to benefit immensely from mindfulness meditation practice, which is pure Hanayana practice, just recognizing the thoughts, come back to the breath. I've seen so many people benefit from that. Yeah. Actually, K.D. two days ago gave a little bit of a lecture and he said, and he was really talking about shamatha, even though he's talking from his tradition, coming back, coming back. He said, so you can at some point become a little less reactive so that when your turtle dies, you don't jump out the window. And I laughed for two days. I wrote him a text in the middle of the night. I said, he didn't even remember he said that. So when your turtle dies, you don't jump out the window. Right. Well, I mean, this, what's it to me? It's really an interesting sort of, it's an interesting thing that's existing in society, in the world, with the tsunami of information and desire and all the various corporations who have like honed methodologies to keep you fixated on your body, on the medicine that you might need, on things to heal your aches and pains, on getting that fucking car, which for sure is going to repair your relationship with your wife, definitely. And the, you know what, I mean, like all the tricks that they're constantly blasting out at us. You see how, oh, well, as a totality, our species is sitting under the Bodhi tree. It might not seem like that, but we're, you know, here we are all in a state of meditation in some way, shape, or form, fixated, focused, concentrated on all kinds of stuff. So there we are. And Mara has, has appeared to us. The appearance looks different for everybody. Like for some of us, Mara looks like the next step in your career for some people. It looks like, I don't know, abs or, you know, threesomes or better ecstasy or fame or whatever. But here it's happening right now. Here's the encounter in real time with a sum total of all of us. There's the fear of global collapse, nuclear war, death. There's the daughters of Mara, the potential to like it powerful and use your intellect to control and gain and, and then, um, mixed into that simultaneously, we're all experiencing this sense of like, and this is what I experience anytime I brush shoulders with the clear, luminous, beautiful, empty reality is, why the fuck do I deserve this? This, uh, you know what I mean? Like this can't be, it can't be this easy. You can't just drop into that space, right? Like that requires flogging of oneself. That requires, and some conditions it does. Yeah, they literally ask for that. Um, so I'm saying with the tantric practice in particular, you know, if you've ever thought about the three temptations of Buddha and wondered about the third one, I think that one can come up, right? Like that sense of, of, wait a minute, holy shit, I'm as happy right now sitting in my chair, in my studio meditating in like a shed as I was when I was walking with my mom on the beach, holding her hand, but there's no mom, no beach. There's no external cause of this that I can identify. Give me a fucking break. It can't be real. I don't believe it. This is, I don't deserve it. So there's a name, there's a name for that actually that, um, I don't remember the Tibetan word for it, but it's called the thief thought. That's how it's translated. Thief thought. It's like a thief that comes in and just goes, wow, I left the door open and they took it. They took my basic goodness. Wow. Yeah. So that's, and it's really not even, you know, there's obviously karmic things that come up, depression or anger or all the clashes, firing, jealousy, pride, all that stuff. But there's just something in it that's just like a little Pac-Man that comes in and bites and bites and do that inability to really rest the mind in, in what you're talking about. Yeah. In the aliyah, that's what they call in the Buddha, in the Mahayana, it's called rest in the mind, the aliyah in all consciousness and in the ground consciousness. Just rest your mind. Yeah. Yeah. And the thief goes na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na. It's very nasal. Yeah. You don't, you don't, it's, it's, you don't deserve it. You don't deserve it. Why? You, even think about it, like really, I mean, like, if you look at the conditioning of a lifetime of living in capitalism that all of us have, you know, have you ever like, like gone to a Starbucks and you forget to, like, you're standing there and they've given you your, your coffee or whatever, or you're standing there and they're like, it's $15. And then you're like, oh, right. Oh yeah, right. You pay for things here. You got to pay for it. You know, like, if you want to go to Disneyland to get the heartbreak experience of leaving Disneyland, you got to go through a series of gates, tickets, you want to get on your airplane, you got to have tickets, you want to go anywhere, cool, there's tickets, there's a cost, a fee, you know what I mean? So the idea that in the midst of all of this, there is actually a way to drop into that place you're talking about, the aliyah, the fundamental, the ground or whatever, minus paying for tickets, minus getting famous, minus being the, like, whatever it is that you fantasize, it sounds, at first, probably incredible. And then if you experience a little bit weirdly, it's like, wait, do I want this? I was kind of getting off on the, on the, on the. Well, and there's, here's the fair comment, Duncan. There's not as much drama there. And so there's a little bit of a kind of like, couldn't we whip, you know, something up, hopefully with a sequel? You know, you don't want to create a drama these days, like, you know, like avatars, it's beautiful, it's perfect, it's done. No, we better leave it open for a sequel. So we want to create some kind of drama that can create a sequel and keep, it's basically actually, again, my humble opinion only, a kind of laziness of mind that goes, I want to leave a book holder there, you don't close the book and go, nice, good. I had a beautiful dinner with these people, I'm saying goodnight now, I'm walking out the door, it's a letting go piece is, is, for whatever reason, our discipline, a lot of the discipline is about how to release, how to let go of fixation, whether it's for good or bad, doesn't, it occupies us. Right? Yeah, yeah. It's the sense of occupation, busyness, having a job, having a task, having a, you know, something to do, someone to be. Yeah, the hamster wheel. It's the, it's this, it's, I'm just, it's, it's a, again, like, I don't know, maybe I'm not saying it, I just find there to be something so groundbreaking, fundamentally revolutionary about what you're talking about, in the sense that what could be more disruptive to society as we know it, then the possibility that everyone simultaneously begins to experience the joy they thought they would experience when they got the car, went on vacation, had the threesome, got the promotion, won the lottery. If everyone suddenly realized, wait, you know, it's actually, you can just do that. Like you don't have to like, go, you don't have to jump through any hoops that somebody trying to sell you should set up. Well, there's a technical, there's a technical name for that, though. What? It's called the 60s. Come on, before he's still fucking miserable. We just got the video. They didn't have phones back then. No, that was the rap is tune in, turn on and drop out, it's like that was exactly the rap. What you're saying right now is just you don't need all that stuff to sustain the sense of well-being. A little LSD might help you see that more clearly. We'll figure out the rest of this stuff as we go, but let's not get uptight about it. It's a cycle of kind of pushing the gas and then easing back on it. But the discipline is what I think most people would rather edit out of the whole thing. Yeah, me for sure. And the exertion that it takes to untether ourselves. So it's a deep thing, Duncan, your way, you know, your way into, you know, expostulating, exposing the fundamental logic of where people's nickers get into a twist. You're way in there. And now you're also living your own personal life as a kind of, you know, illustrated, you know, Marvel comic book version of the same thing, where your superhero and your earthly dunkiness are trying to align. That's funny. Well, I mean, or just sort of like, you know, you, yeah, or kind of it's, I think that it is a funny, it's funny. I think there's something very funny about it. And that appeals to me a lot in the sense that what is funnier than all of a sudden at a, I don't know, a water park with your kids looking around. And for one second, instead of seeing everyone around you as different people that you don't know, having like this weird spontaneous love for them, like they were your kids, like I've, every one of these have been my children at some point. And then all of a sudden the water park, you're just surrounded by like you're, you get that glimpse of these glimpses. Like my God, I love it. I love everyone here. I love all these fucking people pissing their margaritas into the pool my kids swimming in. You know what I mean? You like, you see, you see, you see through the, the, the, you see through the old bodies, you see through the like sad bodies, you see through it all. And then for one second, you get this, oh my God, I love all of them. I knew, I know you. You look through and you think, my God, what did I do to you in some life? Well, I bet I was a pretty shitty dad. Someone comes shoving by you or something and gives you a mean look and you're like, I bet I was a riot. When I was your dad, it must have been horrible and whatever incarnation. Well, so let's call that experience the archetype, the hero, the primordial Duncan, you know, just for lack of giving it a better term. And the regional Duncan, who is now, you know, with children and a family and a bank account and a car. Did you, by the way, just buy Erin a new car? Hell no. Okay. You mentioned that earlier. I thought maybe. Okay. I'm just kidding. I didn't be doing that. I have to like that. No, I did not. What we did have a spectacular Christmas. I think you misunderstood. I know what you said. No, I was just playing with you there. Oh, because we did get the kids one of those cool little remote control cars they can drive around the yard, which is one of the funniest things I've ever seen in my life. I love it so much. But the regional Duncan has the job if you, you know, mission impossible or if you choose to accept it to align that heavenly Duncan, that archival, you know, pure hearted, pure perception, uh, spontaneously arising Duncan with the regional Duncan who's, you know, who locked his keys in the car while the kids are in it, you know, and then goes, okay, where's your bliss now? It can vanish like that. You know, so that I feel is a much more, I'm more interested when people talk about that than, than the pure realms or something like that. Okay. Well, let's talk about that though, because this is what I think this is aligning the, you know, the alignment that this is why I think getting a glimpse of that space and I think what's great about getting that glimpse via meditation or some spiritual practice versus the way I have caught glimpses of it in the past through generally LSD or some eco dissolving psychedelic is that there could be, depending on what level of psychonaut you are, some sense of doubt when you get it through medicine. There's a sense of like this, what this is, I added something here. It's dependent on this particular. There could be doubt and debt. And debt, sure. You got to buy the drugs, man. It's expensive. Well, and also who knows if you might need more of it to, to make sure that you can clear the doubt away. That's it. You're always clearing. Let me just see if this was real. Yeah, there's the loop. So, you know, in those moments where you get glimpses of it, and you know, I've had them at the Ram Dass retreat, where you aren't on any drugs and you're feeling like you're high as a kite, being around Ram Dass, you get this weird, glowy, like contact high just from his energy or, or through like a more sustained practice over time, you start seeing it again and again. And the reason I think that this is very useful is because once you've gotten a glimpse of that place and what it is, and maybe what it could be, then when you lock your kids in the car, which I didn't do, if you, anyone out there thinks David is alluding to something I said, I have not locked my kids in my car yet, and I'm proud of it. Definitely locked my keys in the car. But the point is, if you can get like a glimpse of the thing, what that might be, then suddenly even in those moments, you can, when you're feeling the knot, the anxiety, the pain, you can find it in there somehow. That's the other piece of it. It's like, holy shit, it's wrapped up in this moment too. There it is, a familiar, a familiarity with something that for me, and I think it shows up for a lot of people, we associate with our childhoods. That was what, that's, that's what it was like to be a kid. And then when your turtle dies, you don't have to jump out the window. You don't have to jump out the window. That's called equanimity. It's not that you're not sad. Yeah. It's okay to be sad, but you don't have to jump out the window when your turtle dies. Yeah, you don't have to jump out the window when your turtle dies, and your turtle probably was, like, wanted to jump out the window, because who wants to be a domesticated turtle? What a nightmare. Finally, you got your slow ass. Come on, we all are domesticated turtles. It's a perfect analogy already. The shell, the whole thing. Yeah, I, you know, that was the other side. I mean, you know, as I'm like doing like an analysis of this water park on one level, I'm like seeing like, Jesus, is this what we've all, we're all at a water park, man. It used to be America, and now it's some synthetic version of what we thought was freedom and democracy. Look at this. It's all, we're all on waterslides. Some cliche bullshit thought like that. That's one level of it for sure. On another level of it, holy shit, my kids are having so much fun. On another level of it, oh my God, all these parents are miserable. They brought their kids to a water park. The kids are enjoying themselves, but if you're going to be a good parent at a water park, you are not having a good time. You got to keep your eye on your kids, man, depending on their age. They'll fucking, you know, they'll drown. They'll get, they get stepped on. You got to, but then you realize, oh my God, that's love. All these parents love their kids so much, they took them here. And then the next level for me is, and then you realize, oh my God, like we're all having this universal experience of love that is so overpowering. We're standing up to our knees in chemical piss, watching our children have a great time. I mean, it's, you know what I mean? Well, you know, it's right in the Dharma Moon chant, experience joy in the happiness of others. It doesn't say be miserable as a guardian so others can be happy. Experience joy actually as in the vehicles, the happiness of others, and that's empathy. And it's part of our makeup. There's no doubt in my mind about it. That's, that's why being a parent is so cool in a way. If you're, if you're not a total, you know, it hasn't become a traumatic experience too much. You go, you see your kid happy and you're never going to be as happy as that. Yeah. Nothing could ever make you as happy as that. I want to thank Athletic Greens for supporting this episode of the DTFH and tell you that I did it. I tried. I got a bunch of vitamins and whole foods and I tried doing the thing where you, where you distribute them out and you look at the fucking label in the morning when your eyes are kind of blurry because you're old and you can't read the exact dosage, but you kind of remember how much of the fish oil you're supposed to take, how much of the whatever the fuck. And then you end up with a pile of pills in your hands and then you try to choke them all back because you don't want to take individual pills and then you choke in front of your kids and then you slurp water, you've traumatized your kids.

Thank you, Athletic Greens. You see your kid happy and you're never going to be as happy as that. Yeah, that's it. Nothing could ever make you as happy as that. Then for me, this is where I can start working with the meta-practice. I never got the meta thing. Weird relationship with parents. When you start doing that, think of your mother. It's like, how about not? How about we don't think about my mom right now? In the sense, I had a relationship that got better over time, but with my kids, okay, I got that. I feel that. I know what you're talking about. Then shifting that compassion for them over to everything else, you can do it. That is a capacity. Then that's, to me, that is where, isn't that the mechanism for joining these two things that you're talking about? Isn't that the glue? Compassion? Isn't that the sort of- But then, as you said, then it's about extending. You've tasted it. You smell it, now expanding it so that you've, as you said, you see everybody in the park as if they were some form of family in that way. Even if it's your troublesome uncle or your junkie cousin or whoever you see them as, you still feel that connection. But that takes a tremendous leap of something. I don't think you can fake that. You can aim at it and go like, there's, I see the logic of this and I want to cultivate the strength to be able to do that, but I don't think just being like, you know, a little smiley face and- Oh no. You can intellectually, you can definitely look around and be like, oh, we all breathe the same fucking air, I guess. But I'm saying, I guess we all deserve the same basic atoms in us, but, or you could even be like, I know these people must feel pain, but you're, you're feeling numb or, you know, you can, but you can't, I think they're, you, you can know what this is. It's how you feel on ecstasy. You take MDMA and you can experience complete love for every single person around you that you've never met in your life, but that goes away and then you fucking want to kill yourself. You want to jump out the window with your turtle two days later. I'm, I'm saying there, this, there is within this experience of human life, the possibility to suddenly find yourself in what I think I would call on one level a very lonely place to like have that glimpse of you look around and you're like, shit, we've all got amnesia. We've forgotten that we're the same family. We forgot all the, like these are, I know every single one of you. I know you. I love you. I, I, I'm connected to you that you can have glimpses of that that aren't intellectual and little glimpses of it. What, what do you call that place? That's a strange place to look around the world and see all of us clustered around people we know separated from those we don't stranger, not stranger, part of my tribe, not part of my tribe and watching that, you know, that's what we're used to. But when you shift into this other reality, man, what is that place, David, where it's all your kids, your, your, your hairy, old, happy, sad, confused kids. It's making, it's making me sad right now to think about it all the times. And this is where I mean, I guess framing natural tendency to frame the developing the discipline. So you have some kind of equanimity. So you don't get thrown way up high and way down low by every passing emotion, but without negating or without repressing any of it at the same time. So with awareness and equanimity, and then developing openness and compassion and a sense of, you know, change between oneself and others, that is a zone in which you experience your habitual patterns 10 times more strongly than sitting alone in a room. Now you're in the playground, you're at Disneyland and reality and people and beings are just right in your face all day long every day. And then to develop, you know, some kind of ongoing feeling of intention to aim for the higher ground of your, what you know is the higher ground, not what somebody else tells you, aim for the higher ground. And then to be able to experience, and this is where I really kind of wanted to take, take part of this conversation, the edge, because there's an edge there, you're calling it loneliness. I'll agree with that, it's lonely, but there's also an edge of like, what are you working with right now as a practitioner, as a seasoned practitioner, as somebody who's serious about this. And, you know, you might have all the logic or all the whatever, and you might be a very senior practitioner, you might even be a Rinpoche, for example. And I'll give you an example, Mingyur Rinpoche has this great book in which he was completely open about having been a Tulkoo in an Incarnate Lama and having panic attacks. And this is somebody who was with the Silver Spoon, he's in the monastery, he's a made man in the mafia sense of it, everybody's gonna get him, get him whatever he needs. And in the middle of the night, he sneaks out in the middle of the night, and goes on an away trip for three and a half years where nobody knows who he is or where he is. Yeah, that's edgy. Yeah. So we have our own version of that where we're not, you know, where we're keeping some sharpness, you know, to our path. That is not self-destructive, it's not harsh to ourselves, but it keeps the kind of precision of where forward is, you know, where up is. And, you know, we need support in keeping that edge. Sangha, you know, good friends who are not just like, you know, colluding with each other. We need teachers along the way who are like, you know, accomplished. And we need some kind of method and some kind of teachings, whatever floats your boat, you know, comically. And so that's the three jewels, right, the Buddha, the Dharma, the Sangha. I think without that, or some version of that, we'll get stuck in one of those places, we'll get stuck in the harsh self-approval assessment that you mentioned earlier. We'll get stuck in a gooey kind of wishful thinking kind of spirituality. We'll get stuck in feeling like we're seeing something profound, but we're isolated in that perception. Loneliness, the wrong kind of loneliness, you know. Right. So it's beautiful. I mean, I guess the long story short is I advocate for whoever's out there to find your community, to talk and practice together. I think I have found that to be a tremendous gift in this life. You look at the gifts people give you, people have given me money, people have given me guitars, people have given me this, that and the other thing. But that kind of Sangha, like what we have, what you and I have, this is to me is the greatest gift. Yeah. I mean, I don't see how you, you know, I think it's, I think what's really wonderful, and I can only speak for Buddhism and maybe a little bit for Christianity, but I never went as deep into Christianity as I have with Buddhism, is that you sort of realize like, you know, the instruction manuals that they have for it are very accurate. Like it's not a, the sort of steps or the points or that infinite lists, you start seeing, oh yeah, I get why that's there. I understand why there's an emphasis on community or why you need to have somebody who's been doing it longer than you, or more effectively than you to run stuff by like, what the fuck is this? What is that? Because there's stuff with that, you know, you have to like, the difference between intellectually recognizing that we all share a common ancestor, and you know, as a secular person might, and I think there's something really beautiful about that, like Carl Sagan's ability, the pale blue dot, that's all of us. That's us. He's tuning in on that lonely part of it, or when people go into space and see planet Earth, it's blissful, but there's some sadness there. There's a sense of like, damn, it doesn't have to be just like this, does it? Damn, it doesn't have to be like this. And so I think it's good to have people where you could like say, what is that? What is the name for that moment where you realized that it's one thing to have amnesia and not know you have amnesia? It's an entirely different thing to like, start getting your memories back, but still have amnesia. You know what I mean? Like, if you just have fucking amnesia, and you're just like, this is me and this and that, but if you start like really like realizing, wait, there's some other thing I can almost remember, but not quite. And then you have these memories. I don't know any other thing to compare them to the memories. You start having these memories of like, oh, that's what I am. Maybe in, you know, I guess the, for my psychonauts listening, it's the DMT experience, that moment of breakthrough, post terror, or terror mixed in with deep familiarity of this incredible insane zone that you've gone into. There's familiarity there. I know this place. This, I've been here a million times. That's what I'm talking about, a sense of remembering a home that you is more home than any home you ever lived in. You know, that's, that is what I'm trying to get at there. And that's a really, you need people who have maybe couldn't have had that experience to sort of help you. I Well, they point it. That's the pointing out the pointing. You're right. And then because it is familiar already, because it's the ground of being arguably, and you know, it should feel familiar when it's pointed out kind of, but you also have it pointed out that our ability to obfuscate it to, to get all caught up in all kinds of trivialities and clay activity is profoundly developed. Like it's like looking at, you know, those bodybuilders in, you know, and you go, you don't have to do that to get in shape. But samsara is like that. It's like, why do you build up those muscles like that much? You're in good health. You're in good shape. So samsara is like that. We build up incredible muscles of protective defensive layers that are, you know, not really that healthy. Is it? Well, but this is where I guess where I've hit my like, I don't know if this is exactly meant by it, but this is where I've hit my edge here. This is where I've like hit my place of like, is it a fucking mistake? Like, you know, here you have this like fundamental ground of reality, a place untouched by it cannot be cut by a sword withered by the wind. It does not grow old. It was never born. It will not come into being will not cease to be primordial, timeless, all the descriptions of it, whatever archaic or non archaic way you want to describe it. If you know what I'm talking about, why the fuck as part of that is this all going down? Is the like, Jesus Christ, I need to like, maybe I should start taking a hair growth medicine or extend my dick or tighten my butthole or get my nipples polished or whatever. By the way, I just, I did all that and I feel great. Thank you for sharing. You know, I believe that one, the why question, which is sort of flipping around where you are, that Buddha did not address just historically speaking. He was, you know, he would say like, basically, I'm an auto mechanic, you know, you know, I'm a doctor, you know, so, but the why I had an earlier thought than that, that's my condition thought. My earlier thought was when you started talking about it right at the beginning, I thought of you in the playground with your boys, you know, and, and they're playing hide and seek and you're watching. Yeah. Because I watched my granddaughter Izzy play hide and seek. She just went to a park. She found some totally new people that she didn't know before that she's five. And by the in 10 minutes, they're all running all over this park. We can keep an eye on them, that we're the parents, so grandparents. So we just want them, as you said, we can't just like play our own game of hide and seek at that point, we're holding the court for their hide and seek. And they're having their ecstatic. And they're terrified that they're going to be found and they want to be found. And they, you know, it's a game. Right. It's a self, you know, fulfilling game. And it is, is it just part of the play, the lila of this system that we're in that we that there's a hide and seek quality to it. Because when you work with people, you go, Oh, you they know, they must know that they're being terribly defensive and paranoid right now, they must know that, or they must know that their anger is being disguised as sort of rational argument with and with all the logic intact. They must know that they're overeating, and that they weigh 100 pounds too much. They must know that there's other guitar players in the world who could bury them alive, you know, with one stroke of the flat pick, you know, so hide and seek. So I feel lately that there is some kind of lila or game that's being enacted. And which isn't to say that you can be frivolous about how you but you could have a sense of humor. You could sure that would be a good a good step on a spiritual journey to have a deep sense of empathy and a deep sense of play and humor. And I would say my gurus definitely had that. Right. No doubt about it. Like they were like, you know, enjoying the lila, not not cursing the darkness, you know. Ah, yeah. Right. Yeah, I've seen, you know, I think I've mentioned this before at a podcast the time I got to see the Dalai Lama and his translator and like that was my first glimpse of that ever in watching the playfulness and their interaction. And like, you can't like you can't fake it. Like the way they were acting, you're not they're not faking being happy. It's like definitely I didn't have kids back then, but it's very similar to watching like, not in a sense they're immature, but in watching kids play or brothers or there's this like, they're like so playful within. And of course, they're also getting asked some of the most serious questions by like people who are dying that month, you know, so it's like not within it is also recognition of the suffering and a seriousness to a sudden like snapping to this like very intense seriousness stillness. It's amazing to see it. I mean, this is again, it goes back to your community thing. You need like it's nice to be to see it in the flesh and not just on paper, you know, to see, see what it looks like in an action more than just. And it's challenging. Any, any time you put a group of people together to run something, to organize something, government, you know, Congress, you know, you, you will have, I tell the people at Dharma Moon, you know, we have a lot of courses that are going on. People come in and they study and they practice. But I say, if you work at Dharma Moon, like which there's about 20 people who are like, you know, doing different jobs, I said, that's the advanced course right there. Yeah. You know, think about you with your team, you know, how, how gritty that gets because there's no equivocation that will cover a failed execution. You know, somebody says, oh, it's just empty, you know, like you go, okay, it's might be empty, but so is me firing you. It's my fucking bank account you're talking about. You're empty my bank account. Duncan, how's your, how's your world going like that? Are you up to any new creative projects that are cooking? Yeah, thanks for asking. Yeah, I'm actually, yeah, I'm working on some stuff right now that I'm pretty excited about. I don't want to, you know, I'm superstitious about yapping about like that. Yeah, good. I didn't mean what, you don't have to say it. Yeah, but I got some stuff cooking. How about yours? Well, you know, it's right now, I laid an egg, which you know how that is as a creative person, you lay an egg, and then you want to go off and lay another egg, but you have to sit on that egg to make sure it hatches. And then if it hatches, then you have to take care of the little baby that comes out of it. And then that's kind of my current situation at the tender age of, I'll be 75 in February. So that's like kind of a, you know, moving into what some people would think of as, you know, why don't you give it a break already, you know, and so forth. I'm moving into a more manifesting kind of stage, but manifesting not so much for my own portfolio, but like what could I create that would benefit forward and also share, you know, what I think is valuable and what I learned with the next generation is very important to me right now. So that took the form of Dharma Moon, which you know all about, and you've been a very wonderful supporter and helper with creating that, DharmaMoon.com. And it takes the shape of training people and also gathering a team. Like, you know, it's like building teams is a really, playing a team sport is really sophisticated. You know, you can become a great tennis player, like John McEnor or something like that. You don't have to necessarily develop the skills of interpersonal skills so much, you know, but teams are like, whoa, one person says one little thing and then you know, so my my egg is like electric right now. And it's also full of potential and growth. And it's also takes a lot of my kind of using my best resources to hold it together. And what we have is, you know, two big programs coming up. One is Ethan, Nick Tern, you know, you know, Ethan, my son is very, very, you know, evolved Buddhist teacher has, we had a year-long Buddhist studies course that just finished and was like a couple hundred people taking a year-long Buddhist training course. That's brilliant. Well, if anybody's interested in that, he has, we finished that one, and we're starting another one this this coming January 23rd. And there's an info session on January 10th for that. And then there's, you can just go to darnmoon.com and just register for it. If you want, you can register for parts of it. All the information is there. We'll put a link up on your podcast. And then right behind that, we have our traditional mindfulness meditation 100-hour teacher training program, which starts on March 3rd. And we have an info session with you. You've been a, you know, yeah, what can we, how can we tell people how, how generous and kind you've been in terms of helping to get the word out about that. I got David on speed, Darly. You're kidding, it's the best. Anytime I want to like run one of my half-cocked ideas about something, you're my first to call. It's incredible. I love it. It's nice to be part of it. And it's an incredible, I love what you're, I can't imagine how complex running that kind of thing must be or helping that thing like that run, but I've definitely. Part of my training with Trump, remember too, is how to run something like this. It was a different kind of teacher that way. It wasn't just like how you go off in a cave. And it's like how you work in, in, in society. And so he gave a lot of teachings that I'm using every day to, to work through these things. But we have this sort of core program, which is the 100-hour Mindfulness Meditation Teacher Training Program. Many Dunkeits have taken it. I mean, there's, there's quite, yeah, there's quite a cross talk there. And if you're interested in that, Duncan and myself are going to do an info session on January 19th, which is Thursday, January 19th. And that's 6 p.m. Eastern time. And that will be in the chat, in the trail too. And if you forgot everything, I just said go to darmamoon.com and you'll see those two programs coming out.

Greetings to you, oh beautiful time travelers drifting like pollen on the winds of change. Come build a temporary sonic kingdom within the pounding, blasting waves of my seemingly lesbian raspy voices that showers upon you in golden waves of sound. It is my desire to heal you, hold you like an adult baby, comb your hair, tattoo your little arms and send you back down the river on your ship, freshly tarred, reflored, repainted, refurbished and covered in a new coat of beautiful, phosphorescent paint made from the bioluminescence accretions of inner dimensional dolphin men who we captured in our dream nets and skinned. Friends, we have a glorious podcast for you today with the stars of one of the funny shows on TV right now. Another period, Ricky Lindholm and Natasha Leggero are here.

Ladies and gentlemen of the court, I do not need to remind you that we live in an age of doing it yourself. No longer do we need to go through some corrupt middle man or woman who is pretending to be a high priest of web design. You don't need to go to some pseudo web designer anymore if you want to get your business going or if you want to refurbish the ancient website that you've been humiliating yourself with on a daily basis as you scratch your chin and wonder, how come no one's contacting me anymore about my orgasmic baby delivery service that guarantees a dolphin visit for every baby delivery? Well, the answer is simple. Your website sucks. It looks like it was created by somebody whose eyes got pecked out by crows where they were tied to crucifixes on a cursed field of broken lava glass. It doesn't look good friends. Your website is a sad embarrassment. Your friends look at it and they cringe. Your mother looks at it and she falls down and goes into the fetal position praying that she could go back in time and stop your father from coming into her sweet, beautiful vagina. Yes, your old ancient website is a travesty. It's the thing causing the earthquakes. It's the thing causing the outbreaks of norovirus at the Winter Olympics and you must fix it. The way to do it is not to go down to the website district and risk getting shanked by an Adderall addict.

Ricky Lindholm is a member of a hilarious comedy duo Garfunkel and Oates and Natasha Legerro is a brilliant comedian and dear, dear friend of mine who both of them are on a really, really funny fucking show on Comedy Central called another period, which you should definitely check out. It is super funny and it was really cool for these two folks to take time out of their insanely busy schedules to sit down in my podcast studio and have the conversation that you're about to hear. So why not find them online, give them some digital love and for God's sake, give another period a shot if you haven't checked it out yet. Now everybody, welcome to the Duncan Trussell family, our podcast, Ricky Lindholm and Natasha Legerro. It's the Duncan Trussell family. Natasha. Ricky. Thank you so much for showing up and being on the show. Thanks for having me. It's great to be here. Are you sure you're recording? I'm definitely. Yes. I'm recording Natasha. I wanted to talk to you guys about something that I just found out over the last couple of days and the more I think about the more it has been really freaking me out. It is a federal offense in the United States to heat your hot tub above 104 degrees. Is that real? Yeah. Do you have a Googled hot tub deaths? Cause I have. No. At what shows up? Oh, you don't want to know. A lot of drunk, uh, hill people. Well, hill people. Well, I'm trying to be nice, but like, you know, people who like get drunk in the hot tub. Not my problem. Not my problem. Every loss for the lowest common denominator though. Right. But still that particular law. Wait. So you're saying that the, the machine won't go up past 104. I do not have the choice to commit suicide by hot tub. I can't put it up to boiling if I wanted to, which should be my right. Yeah. Cause it's not like anyone would check. No, it's not. First of all, there, as far as I know, there's no hot tub patrol. There's no people going around checking to make sure people's hot tubs are not too high. But the, the fact that the federal government has made the decision. You think there's like some sort of conspiracy behind it? I don't think there's a conspiracy. It's right in the, it's in, it's in plain view, which is someone probably went to Congress, lobbied for it. It was a whole thing. Someone dedicated six years of their life to getting that law put into place. Do you think it has a name? Like, you know, they give names. Like, is it like Jerry's law? I was just going to say it's like Nancy's melting law. But the thing is 104 is a good temperature. It may be for you. No, I'm pregnant. I can only go into 97. You can only do 97. Yeah. I carry my thermometer around with me. Do you really? Yes. Well, wait, wait, you're going in that many different hot tubs? Well, you know, I'm committed to hot tubbing and I'm pregnant and I has to stay in the tepid zone. So, you know, that's crazy that they have, I hope the baby's okay. That's amazing. You're going to have the coolest baby ever. Your baby's already been on Jimmy Kimmel. Your baby is, mom is on a, I did a hustler photo shoot today. Did you really? Me and the baby. Are you kidding? No. No Vaginas. Just launch her it. You did not? You did. I did. Did you really? Yeah, but it's not naked. They don't make comedians get naked. What was the lead up to that? Can you like, who made the call? Did they call your agents? They were like, well, she'd do an interview and I was like sure, is there a photo shoot and they're like, Will she do one? And I was like, if I can wear clothes. Wow. That is bad ass. That is so cool. You're such an outlaw, Natasha. That's so great. Thanks. But what? I'm sorry for your hot tub situation. It really riles me up. But since when do you care about the federal government? Just turn it up. It's no, it's just the principle of the thing. It's that what kind of world do we live in where the government is trying to control the temperature of our baths? It's just dark. It's like even in like 1984, not that they were like, I don't know that there are hot tubs in 1984, but or were you seeing 80s movies? Well, I mean, no, I mean, the book in the book, 1980. Oh, in the book. I was like, have you seen any movie in the 80s? There's always a blonde topless girl in a hot tub. That was my dream. Well, I'll tell you, interestingly enough, this hot tub law, because once I found out it's a lie, researched it, it 1979 is when it between 1979 and 1980, it became implemented. Yes. So that was the beginning of the end in Japan. Hot tubs go up to 118 degrees. Really? Yes. They're more responsible or they're just OK with dumb people dying. It's like, if you're not aware, it's just, you know, if you're going to drink and go into your hot tub and get so hammered because I was reading like, oh, what is it? What what am I in danger of here? Because I'm not saying I'm going to do it because I don't want to get in trouble, but I may have bribed somebody to come over and hack my hot tub. So it goes over. That's good. Yeah. But it is a little weird that we have a law for hot tubs, and yet you can have automatic weapons or whatever. Like you are mentally insane. There's no gun law. It's that's that's where it gets weird. Like they're scared of people dying in hot tubs, but not, you know, in school shootings. Well, here's the thing. I'll tell you, when I found out about the 104 degree law on my hot tub, that's when I began to think we definitely need guns because if the government is willing to take away our right to heat our hot tubs, then eventually we're going to have to take to the streets and probably we're going to need weapons to defend ourselves. I love that you think we could beat the government in a war. Well, don't we have like tons of nuclear weapons? I don't think we'd win that. I don't think the government's going to nuke itself. I don't know. I mean, you're right. But my guess would be that there wouldn't be a nuclear strike. I mean, we do have to worry about things like Apache helicopters and drones and drones and things like that, which is fucking terrifying. But but everything does come full circle. Like I feel like we could go back to a time like I watched gangs of New York last night. Have you guys ever seen that? It's great. So basically just the idea that they were just like these gangs roaming around New York in the 1800s who would like fight to put out fires and they would kill each other. Yes. You know, you know, maybe we'll be back to a place like that. Oh, I hope that doesn't happen. I mean, to get there to require something amazing, like an economic collapse, some kind of true war. We'd have to have to have how on earth would that happen? I don't know. I mean, the stock market's booming right now. But I don't want to get now. How much you guys love Trump? I but, you know, I don't know. Like I'm more of, I guess you're more in line with like government, some government regulation is OK. What do you mean? I am. Yeah. If you're for gun control, then yeah, so you feel most people are from for gun control, you're just from the South. That's true. You are for no gun control. Well, no, I'm not for no. I'm not. I'm not like, but I'm like, what about if someone's already committed about shooting? Can they still? I think that we need to make it really tough for people. Like I think there needs to be a vetting process that's more sophisticated than whatever the one is we're using. I think making it's the gun show thing probably makes sense. I think there's lots of stricter measure. So I'm not against pure. Do you know how to use a gun? Well, it's not that hard. Maybe that's a problem. We need to make it more complex to use guns. Like you have to do like basic trigonometry or something. That's solve a lot of problems. You have to type in the capital of whatever state you're in. And if you don't know it, you can't shoot anyone. That's a great idea. Yeah. You have to name the last five presidents or something. It's like a slight IQ test. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I wonder what the actual IQ is of these people who are doing the mass shootings. I mean, is it related? What do you think it's related to? Why do you think Ricky people do these awful extreme acts of violence? I have no idea because they have access to guns, I guess. I don't know. I don't get it. I have a crazy philosophy that I probably shouldn't even say. What? Please do. Please do. Well, I read this article that I think it's Tylenol creates lack of empathy. If you take it too much. And I just wonder sometimes what some of the antidepressants are doing. They could be dulling some of our, you know, if they could dull empathy, then you wouldn't really care as much like what you're doing to hurt people. And I remember that Vegas shooter. He had gotten on some kind of crazy, you know, anti-depressant that was like a brand or like a newer one that hadn't, there's not much known about it. I forgot what it was called. Yeah. But it was like, and then the shootings, I mean, this is emotions like you should not say this in public. He's like, it's not proven. But I did read this article about how Tylenol can create a lack of empathy. And then I kept searching and they, and then I did see a scientist online who was like, I don't, it was like in the New Yorker. He was like, I don't see why that couldn't, you know, translate, correlate to other antidepressants. Cause think about it. It dulls your pain. Yeah. So why couldn't it dull things inside? Is anyone like studied their brains to see if there's something. But not all mass shooters are on pink. I think we do know though. I mean, I think the, what, what's the one that all the conspiracy theorists think didn't happen? Um, the, the, where the kid went into the elementary school and shot up. Oh, uh, yeah. Oh geez. I can't believe I can't remember the name Sandy Hook. Yeah. The one sad thing is there's been so many mass shootings that it's now worth like, shit, I can't remember all of them. There was one today. Yeah. I saw that in a school in Kentucky. Yeah. I saw that. Yeah. But it's, it's the antidepressants probably. I don't know. It's just a guess that, that that would help cause you're like, how could you stand outside of your hotel room and just blast a bunch of people and be able to do that? That's a great question. And that was what I wanted to ask you guys is just as an acting exercise, if you had to put yourself into a role of a mass shooter, describe for you personally what you think it would take to get to the point where you were that crazy that you were climbing up on a tower, getting ready to blast a bunch of people. There would have to be like the most insane, unqualified president. Okay. I don't know. Natasha, no, you definitely need to stay away from guns. Sounds like you really thought about this. I don't know. What would it take for you? Um, well, I mean, I think it would take, well, I think it's really good to put yourself in the shoes of the worst. Like we, we want to understand why somebody would do that, because we understand why somebody would do that. Then maybe there's ways to look at the world and just see what's fucked up about it and then maybe fix that. But it's, it's really crazy to try to do that. So yeah, I've thought about it. I think it would take, I think to do that, you're almost in some kind of waking dream it feels like, like you don't, like you're insane. You're, well, yeah, like you're insane, but in a specific kind of, you've got to be numb number. You have to be so angry. You've gone numb. Right. Like you are something or you can't catch a break. Like it's got to, they've got to be piling up these like, yeah, these, these losses or something. And people think it's a normal thing to do now. That's happened so much that people are like, I don't know how to get out my rage. Well, this happens a lot. I'll just be part of that mass shooting. Yeah. Like I'll just kill a bunch of people. I guess it has to be like a, some kind of disconnect from reality. Like, you know, for example, like when a president like Obama orders drone strikes and they accidentally kill 20 people, he has to be able to live the rest of his life rationalizing the fact that he killed 20 people by ordering a drone strike or by being part of the system that did the drone strike. And then that kind of trickles down to us because we pay taxes and our taxes have just killed count, countless innocent people all over the planet. If you live in the United States, you have like in a time, like imagine like a, sometimes I think about like this, like imagine like a child sacrifice was happening and let's say in Vegas, right? Like a child sacrifice every month happened in Vegas and it happened like at the Luxor because it's like a black. It happened right before the carrot top show at the Luxor. They bring the opening act, but the way it works is there's a dagger hanging from a string and everybody in the United States has to press a button. And if, and by pressing that button, when enough people have pressed it, the dagger is released and it kills the kid. So everyone has culpability in the tiniest, tiniest way, which is what it's like living in the United States anyway, because we're all constantly killing people because we have endless wars overseas. You know, we are all little tiny miniature mass shooters because we fund a thing that does mass shootings, but we're not like we're funding it because we have to, we're being forced to pay taxes. It's not like free will. Well, no, I mean, but you could like, I guarantee if like we've created this ridiculous example of the Luxor dagger drop that there would be people who would say, I don't care if the government is telling us we have to press the button, I'm not going to kill a little kid. Yet here we all know that we're constantly slaughtering people, not constantly, but we do slaughter people overseas all the time. And yet we still do it. So I think as a whole, the sum total, the shadow of the population of the United States is a mass shooter because the United States as an entity is doing mass shootings every day. So maybe that's what a mass shooter is like. They just don't really think they're responsible for killing the people. Somehow they've wriggled out of the responsibility or something. Well, let's not care. What? They must not care. They're not thinking about people's families. They're definitely not. I don't know. Right. Or they're getting off on it. Well, because there's definitely people who kill themselves instead. So why, why, why not do that if nothing's working out? Yeah. Why, why, why go into a school? I mean, I'm sure some of it is revenge, revenge for sure. Yeah. You're just trying to decimate people's lives. You're so angry. You want to leave gaping craters and people's existence. It's just fucking nuts. Yeah. And you know what's crazy? What do you guys think about this? Here's something really scary. The someone that I interviewed this guy from Singularity University. What is that? It's like it's in San Francisco. It's like Ray Kurzweil is associated with it. And basically it's on it's some it's somehow connected to NASA. It's like in the NASA park or wherever NASA is in San Francisco. But it's a group of people who are studying the ways that technology can be used to solve the big problems or what's called the upstream problem. So it's global warming, dirty water. Like if we can figure out a way to clean water, then we can wipe out like a huge swath of diseases. So that's one of the big problems is how can we create really low cost, super efficient water filters to get to places where people don't have access to clean water, a lot of stuff like that. But then also trying to figure out what's going to fucking happen when computers become exponentially faster. That big question mark, which we don't know. This guy interviewed said the problem is people are going to get increasing access to deadly technologies that make a fucking assault rifle look like chopsticks. People are going to be able to engineer Ebola. People are going to be able to like in someone else in their garage. So like like and you can you can infect like your enemy. You could you could make some you could genetically whip up smallpox theoretically in your garage with some kind of as of yet uninvited matter simulator and then go into a football stadium and start a smallpox outbreak. So that's where it gets really creepy, which is the mass shootings are just the very beginning of some of the great problems that are coming, which is that all you need is one lunatic and futuristic technology. And instead of it being a mass shooting, which is already horrific, it turns into like an entire city being decimated. I mean, that is how I feel about Trump. Like he does seem like a lunatic in his garage, like carelessly like willing to fire bombs at places. It just feels like he is. I mean, he hasn't, but it feels like he's willing to do places. You think you will. I mean, that that's sort of the that's where it gets really interesting, isn't it? That's like where we we we've like got gone into the realm of pure absurdity, which is we have a, you know, like you read in history about the Mad Kings like Nero. Oh, yeah, we've got one. Yeah, we now have a Mad King. Yeah. Yeah. And that's really. And it's weird when people pretend we don't know that people pretend like, no, no, no, there's checks and balances. This isn't it's like, no, this is not OK. Right. Because he is like, you know, servicing the Republican agenda, but also, you know, tweeting things out that are just like, what? It's weird. My brain actually doesn't even have room to contemplate the stuff you're talking about, like this, you know, Ebola outbreaks and things, because I'm always I have so many. I'm so like overridden with anxiety just about the Trump administration that I can't seem. I can't even take on robots yet. OK. My brain just goes, no, like I get it. No, we can still talk about it. But but I I people are like, well, what we really need to be scared of. And I'm like, I can't. I don't like it's like when people when that headline came up that said we had aliens and everyone was like, whatever, what's going on with health care? Trump. I know Trump really like no one. You're right. Swallowed us whole. Like nobody cares about anything else. What? What? I mean, they said we had aliens. Nobody cared. Nobody cared. Crazy. I haven't Googled it once. Well, this is the. Have you like none of us have looked at it. I looked at it. Yeah, I looked at it and it's really interesting. Do we have aliens? Well, let's get the aliens in a second. Wait, I have one more question. Sure. Do you think that mass shootings have to do with technology? I think they and like the time we're living in. I mean, they don't really. I don't I don't know. I think it does because I think mental instability plus access is is the problem that access to the web. There's more access. If they have access to smallpox, they'll use smallpox, whatever they have the access to. That's why when they take away guns in Australia, people stop shooting people because they have no access and they just have to, you know, deal with their mental instability on their own. I think it's a lot of I think it's just a lot of these people. I mean, this sounds like such a hippie, dippy thing to say. But I think a lot of these people aren't being touched enough. They're not being loved enough. They're like they're like starved for love. And so they're they've just withered down because they're not getting like they're not getting love. And so they're all fucked up. A lot of people are just huddled in their homes. Yeah, it's like if no one's touched you for a year, you shouldn't be allowed to have a gun. You know, that's a bad combo. Like before you get a gun, we should have some kind of cuddling chambers. You have to go and get cuddled professionally for like a certain amount of time until you're weeping and your heart is opening and you're apologizing and thanking the mother for allowing you to exist. And then you can have your gun now have your gun. Yeah, you have to do mushrooms and then be on this podcast. Yes. And then if you still want a gun, we'll think about it. If you still want a gun, we'll think about it. But yeah, it is a lot of it is just a like people are getting so out of touch with each other. People don't have communities. You know, I just read that they think that, you know, we're always trying to figure out how do people why do people live to be like 90 or 100? What is the secret to old age? And they always interview old people. And it's weird because like some of them will be like, I never drank once. But some of them are like whiskey and French fries every day. And you and you just don't know. But what they're they're saying is it potentially it could be community that helps people live for a very long time and network of true friends and people that you really trust and love. And think of how many people out there just don't have that. They're just completely disconnected. And what happens when you don't have that? I've seen it in my parents is like my mom, especially like she and her husband distrust people and, you know, it just becomes about them against like doctors and neighbors and lawyers and like they just kind of don't trust anything. That's right. And then that makes you kind of sick. I think that's it. Maybe that's the problem is people have a complete lack of trust that we live in a benevolent universe. And so if you don't believe that you're in a benevolent universe, if you think the universe is either like, what's the word for it? Ambiguous or what's the word? There's a better word neutral. Yeah. Or if you think the universe is malicious, indifferent, indifferent. That's what I was looking for. Or if you think it's a malicious universe, then you might actually want to lash out at the universe itself to fight back. But there's so much evidence that it's indifferent or malicious that I understand my people would think that I do. Like it's it's almost rational to believe the universe is indifferent. Well, yeah, but at the same time, it's like, who would want to live that way? The I've heard this terrible example, which is like, so basically the concept is like, well, if you're going to say the universe is benevolent, well, you're assigning some kind of personality to it. If you're going to assign the personality to it, what personality are we dealing with? So so they the people say God is God can. OK, so when God is described in Christianity, God is described as God. What are the three qualities of God? Omnipotent, all all powerful. Maybe it's two qualities. God is powerful, all knowing, all seeing. Is it something like that? I think it's omnipotent. Or is that all the same? Oh, yeah, all knowing, which is, I guess, omnipotent. Yeah. And then all powerful omnipotent omnipotent and all powerful. So omniscient omnipotent and omniscient omniscient and all powerful. So is that so is that all all powerful is the same as omniscient? No, omniscient is all knowing omnipotent is all powerful. OK, that's OK. Omnipotent omnipotent. That's it. So these two things, the question is, you can't have a morally ethical being that is these two things. It can only be one or the other because because otherwise what about that the example that is given is the squirrel after a forest fire, baby squirrel after a forest fire has been burnt really badly, but hasn't died yet, laying in the middle of the forest and slowly expiring in the most painful way ever. And then this omniscient omnipotent God, you say to this thing, well, you know, this is happening. And yet, why did you why are you not doing anything about it? And so within that, we end up with some kind of sociopathic thing that either enjoys the squirrel dying or is in, I don't know, it's a fucking asshole. Basically, I had someone I was at a party on Saturday night and someone made me understand religion for the first time. It was it was I didn't a friend of mine used to be Mormon. And I was asking him about, you know, growing up Mormon. And he was saying and I was and I asked him about all the sort of inconsistencies, like the plates and Joseph Smith didn't tell anyone and all these things. And he was like, no, that's what the religion is. And I'm like, what do you mean? He goes, they tell you that if it was obvious, then you wouldn't have to have faith. So the fact that there are so many inconsistencies are the thing that makes you have to believe. And I didn't know I didn't know that. And I was like, they're like, so so any sort of inconsistency in the Bible, they go, yeah, that's the test for you. So if you still believe that, then you're religious. Have you ever heard that? It sounds like something a con artist would be. Isn't that amazing? It made me understand it, though. I was like, oh, that's like you understood why the people. Yeah, get duped or why. Yeah, why they're OK with all the inconsistencies and manmade things about religion. Because if that's what the test is. But Mormonism is like a pretty crazy religion as like Scientology is. Like I feel like Judaism is a little more about like, let's debate all of these different ideas. What about circumcision? What about it? And Judaism, what about cutting off the tip of a baby's dick and then like sucking it for a second? And what about the sexism part of it? I'm not sticking up for it. I'm just saying that some religions are a little more open to intellectual debate. But that thing where like you clip off the very tip of a baby's. You suck it. Yeah, there's like they like suckle it first. Yeah, they suck it, right? I think so, right? Or they lick it or something. Yeah, but every American, so many American men are circumcised. You're probably circumcised. Yeah, I'm circumcised. I'm not like I'm not an anti circumcision person. Those people are fucking intense. And just the fact that I said this on the podcast guarantees a few tweets from people being like, wait, so you want a child to be cut when it's a when it's a baby. But I'm just saying my brother's one. He wrote a rap about it. Did he really? Yeah. Are you joking? No. How does it go? Do you remember? I remember one line. It was is your brother circumcised. Yeah, he's mad about it. He's mad about getting circumcised skin back. Something like you cut my trunk, give me back my junk. I don't know. I've only seen him perform it once. But he. Oh, my God. But he you can find it online. Nickname circumcision. But he was going through a phase where he would, you know, say it to people. So he's I've heard him do it live to a few a few people. Well, I mean, to get back to it's a big I mean, I don't know what it feels like. I don't know. I guess it's a big deal. It's a big issue. But my point is until I get into circumcision, it's just to like point out that in Judaism, we I'm sure that's not the only probably something that made sense a long time ago, I guess. I mean, it is weird to think that a long time ago, someone was like talking to a pregnant woman and was like, listen, we haven't done this yet. Your baby's going to be first. Yeah. Are you willing to let us cut your baby's dick? And I'm going to suck it for like a second. Do they definitely suck it? Well, let's take a look right now. Yeah. Let me just look this up for a second. Let's find out circumcision. Wait, Duncan, is it OK if the sound went out in one of my. Yeah, it's my headphones. I'll fix it. No, I don't care. I just wanted to make sure it was OK. Circumcision Judaism. Yeah, some I always think about the person who went first trying contact lenses because someone put glass in their eye. Somebody said, OK, I'll I'll I'll do that. I don't know who is that brave. OK, what is oral suction circumcision and where does it come from? So let's see. After the mole, the oil. OK, what is oral? OK, what is oral circumcision? Where does it come from? Let's see, because you were probably not circumcised in like a rich, a Jewish ritual, you were probably circumcised. My dad bit off the tip of my dick. He was I wasn't intended. I've had sex with one person who had an uncircumcised penis, and it was it was it was hard to maneuver. Oh, I was definitely preferred the circumcised one. OK, so here we go. The tradition of Mets, Metsitsa, but pa goes back to biblical times, but has created a modern day dilemma for a religiously observant mankind. New York City officials linked the practice to 70 cases of infant herpes since 2000, of whom two died in the latest development, the city will stop requiring moals who use oral suction to have parents sign consent forms, which many hadn't complied with anyway. So yeah, so there there you go. Orals get herpes. Yeah, you can get herpes if the if the if whoever's doing it has herpes. But wouldn't you be so pissed if you had to go in? Like if you're like 13 and you realize you have herpes and you're like, I've never even had sex. And you got to explain that to everybody. That's extremely rare, Duncan. Well, I mean, it's not you get herpes from your moll. It's not that 17 cases since 2000 is probably, I'll tell you this, 17. I guarantee 17 is probably higher, a higher number than the people have died in hot tub accidents and they can't regulate that shit. I guarantee it. Also, I like that they use the term oral suction because they don't want to say blow job. Yeah. How many people die in hot tub accidents? It can't be that many. I mean, how many people outside of Florida? I know they're all like a very specific. I'll tell you what it was. It was some Illuminani fucking trust fund kid. It was probably like some 17 year old Rockefeller who was at a party drinking very expensive wine from his parents. Wine cellar had the hot tub up to like 108 and died. And then his reptilian father called the president. It was like, we have to stop this. And that's what happened, guaranteed. I disagree. I think it was it feels like a mom. I feel like some someone's baby went on spring break. Yes. And got, you know, some girl like some like 17 year old girl and like melted in a hot tub and her mom was like took all her mom friends and she's like, we're going to take to the streets. Let's start a petition. Stop this. And we're going all the way. I fucking hate it, man. I think that woman. I think you should be careful how long you stay in a 109 hot tub, Duncan. If I die, you should set a timer. If I die in a hot tub and everyone listening, number one, because after I die in the hot tub, they can play this. I am not embarrassed. Oh, people of the earth. I have passed on to the other side via hot tub death. And I want you to know I couldn't think of a better way to die than in a hot tub passing out in a sweet, bubbling hot tub, not going back to being born. Thank you, Ricky. You're going right back to the womb. Yes, it's going back to the womb. And I will I would take an elegant death and elegant. We should do that instead of lethal injection, like give the prisoner the option to drink himself to death in a hot tub. It's way more compassionate. Yeah, if it's so dangerous. But yeah, to get back to this idea of the of religion and the the inconsistencies in it, I think that the problem is more with the literal interpretation of these scriptures than it is with this. The fact that the religion itself is is is fucked up, right, especially as a woman, because we're not really included. Like, we're, you know, I know, whores and moms or whatever, but we're not really people. When I was in Israel, they still like the most, you know, the most what do you call that? What's the opposite of conservative, like the most forward, progressive, progressive synagogue still had the separation. And like the men were like on one side, and they were just this is like in Tel Aviv, and they're just like having a good old time, clapping, all the decorations are on their side. And then there's like there's like a whole kind of, you know, a divider. Oh, yeah, I could look up through and all that. There's like women just sitting there hunched over with their books. Yeah. And the men are like dancing and having a party. Yeah. And and well, too, too, and to explain to why this is the most progressive one, it's not that in to be super religious there. So most people are like they celebrate Shabbat, but they're not like going to synagogue all the time. But yeah, I was kind of shocked. And actually, after halfway through, I was like, I'm going to go wait outside because it was like the men were having. And the leader was over there. Like everything want to be in the boring section. No, but I'm just saying boring enough. Don't put me in the boring section of the boring church. But but religion to a woman even now is kind of insane. Like it still doesn't, you know, we don't have the same rights. Well, in the most fundamental forms of every religion, we're kind of left out. And even Buddhism, you know, there's a book you might like, Ricky. You know, you'd like it too. But because what you were talking about religion, there's a book called A Cave in the Snow about this woman who I can't remember what she was finally allowed to be this thing in Buddhism that women weren't allowed to be. And but even in Buddhism, this misogyny is in Buddhism, where they know that. Yeah, where they say, well, Buddhism has many different forms. And I can't remember the particular form, but there it's basically like women weren't allowed to be trained in certain ways. And I think there in some parts of it, there might even be the idea that women can't get enlightened so that women can achieve realization and all the rationalization that goes along with that, which is like, well, you know, you've chose this incarnation, you didn't want to achieve realization in this incarnation. But the reality of it is, is that men I think want to control women because women are incredibly powerful. And if you can control powerful things, then you become powerful yourself. And if you look way back to like theoretical goddess religions, then it's a completely different ball of acts the way that kind of tribe works and the way those kinds of people work. Don't you think we're getting back to that, though, now with all the sexual harassment? I mean, in religion has evolved from the most basic forms. It is, you know, I wonder about that getting back to like some kind of Earth mother religion or something. And really, I think one of the dangers and I think maybe it's just necessary. I mean, because we're kind of this whole gender fluidity concept is like pointing to the idea of like within every person as they masculine side and effeminate side. And some people are balanced more on one side than the other, regardless of their biological gender or whatever. And so but what can happen is we could witness, I don't know, actually, now I think about it. You guys know about Kali, Kali, no. So this is Shiva's wife. And you will see this picture over and over again in Hindu religion and Hinduism. Shiva's asleep. And Kali is this terrifying looking goddess with her tongue hanging out. She's wearing a garland of heads that have been decapitated and the heads are the gods like she's basically been destroying all the old ways and this ferocious thing that if you don't know much about it, then you could think, oh, that's an evil being. But really what it represents is kind of what's happening right now, which is the Kali energy just lopping the fucking heads off of these powerful men and wearing them essentially. Like and you're seeing this energy. What I was going to say is like, well, my experience with femininity is that when a woman is holding me or loving me, there's like some energy that I think comes out of women that can't come out of men, it's maternal, it's like the way we can have babies. I don't think we can produce and maybe I'm wrong about it. I read this thing that said the masculine testosterone energy is dynamic and the feminine energy is magnetic. And so right. And so there is that that push pull of it that you can feel and everyone has pieces of both, but it's probably that magnetic thing that you're feeling that like calling you in. Yeah, yeah, it's not really an output. It's it's it's like it's taking you in. Yes, it's it's it's like this incredible thing. And that's, you know, I don't think men are necessarily taught to, you know, tap into that. Everybody's got it. You know, it's not really encouraged. Like I think women are more encouraged to tap into their magnetic side. And men are more encouraged to tap into their dynamic side. You don't think you conquer. You don't think it's a fundamental genetic difference because because it might be. I don't know. I think it might. I think it's something just implicit in being a woman is like within is like this crazy dynamic where on one side you have this the maternal giving sweet thing. And then on the other side, you have this fucking crazy Kali energy, which is why, you know, you're in the woods and God forbid, you see a baby bear because you're dead. Yeah. The mother bear doesn't care that you are in like, you know, it's a really crazy thing because I don't know of much cuter than a fucking baby bear. And you see, and this is a harbinger of death because a mother bear will just kill you around her children. So with women, you get these two sides and it's so paradoxical, which is the sweet maternal, beautiful giving, like you're saying, magnetic drawing in. And then the other side is like kind of what we're beginning to see right now, which is fucking terrifying, which is this fiery thing that has been. You're scared, aren't you? I think that if you're for sure. And I mean, I don't know if. Yeah, I think I don't know. Not for specific things, just in general. Well, I think it's pretty like. I think all of us are starting to really think about like. Going through those catalog of memories being like, oh, well, not just the catalog of like your own personal memories, but the catalog of the historic memories and like what you're saying with women being separated from men and told to be quiet and told to dress a certain way. And what you know, what we're seeing right now is just the very tip of the iceberg and that we kind of can't even imagine what was happening in, say, the sixties, the fifties, the forties prior to the existence of the Internet. We really can't imagine. And then, you know, this thing they're finding out about epigenetic memories. Do you know about this? This is where it gets really fucking spooky. They did this experiment where they exposed mice to the smell of, like, I don't know, like roses while they were shocking them. And then their children, they exposed to the smell of roses and they had a stress reaction just to the smell, indicating that there are some kind of blood memory. Yeah, yeah, epigenetic marker. Why wasn't I following that? I'm sorry. Wait, sorry, what? So so they gave mice a stimulus. It wasn't roses. I can't remember what it was. Something sweet and shocked them. And shocked them. OK. So anytime they smell this, they had a stress reaction and then their children, they just exposed them to the smell and they had the same stress. Oh, the mice, the mice children. For some reason, I thought you meant regular children. No, the mice babies, the mice babies. Yeah, yeah, I was so how why could that be? Well, because that's the concept of epigenetics, which apparently was an idea that was thrown out for a long time, which is how the fuck are you? How are your how's your DNA recording like dangers in the environment? Where is that? But apparently there's some kind of genetic marker for these things. So if right now we're just kind of witnessing this thing where women have been being like raped, assaulted, the whole spectrum of like being overpowered and just just a shit ton of ways, then that implies that there's not just the sum total anger, the gestalt of all the anger of half the species. But it also implies that if there's epigenetic markers, possibly women could have something in them that is an anger that's been brewing. Well, also if you think about the in the Louie C. Careticle, I think there's like five women and they all have the same response. They all froze like in the woman on the phone, the woman in front of all of them. And I'm like, that feels like waiting for danger. It feels and people just hang up the phone. It was like, no, something they all had the same response. And like that feels intrinsic. It feels like it feels like, you know, a possum freezing and waiting for danger to pass because, you know, you can't overpower it. It feels like deeper than hanging. Doesn't it? It doesn't matter more than if it happened to a man, they would be like, oh, well, are we going to fuck now? That is the darkest thing that I have heard in a long, really? Yes. That is really, really sad and really, really creepy. Because you didn't realize that that's that would be the reaction. But it is a cell. It is like a intrinsic self protective mechanism when you're, you know, if you saw, if you're standing next to a baby bear, you see a mama bear, what do you do? You freeze and you hope they don't kill you. Yeah, I think there's something to that where the woman frozen. It's just not, it's not as simple as hanging up a phone or, oh my God, room, right? But that might be epigenetic. Oh, because it's like some kind of like, because like theoretically in ancient times, when a guy was trying to fuck you, if you resisted, he might kill you. Yeah, you don't want to humiliate the bear. You know what I mean? It's not just like poking the bear. You don't want to humiliate big Mr. Man. You're like, oh, just freeze. Like when the Mongol horde is riding into your village, if you fight back, you're, you're, you're definitely going to die. But maybe if you freeze up and let yourself get raped by Mongols, you might stand a chance to survive. And then this gets transmitted genetically. Oh God, that is so creepy and dark and horrible. And so funny. I just figured everyone thought that when they read the article. I really thought that was just like, oh, interesting. I never once thought that there might be some built in genetic mechanism that makes women freeze up when they feel sexually oppressed or like they're about to get assaulted in that way. Survival, OK, because they know they can't win that physical fight. What do you, I have a question for you guys about, about this thing, which is because what, what about? And again, like I agree with Natasha and I were talking about this, this concept of like, well, right now men like us saying anything is like kind of a tricky thing because we're all it's like dawning on us that it's like, fuck. I really don't. For one, I didn't. And this is hopefully I speak for more than just me. I went to liberal arts college. To be honest, I, I was a very sad thing to say, but I haven't really spent an inordinate amount of time contemplating what it's like to be a woman. I just, I haven't. I didn't, I never really like, and that's a terrible thing to say. It's very normal. I just never like really was like, fuck, I wonder what, I mean, I spent like little bits and moments like thinking like, what would it be like to like walk down the street and for like to always feel like, like, dudes were looking at me like they wanted to fuck me or something. Well, the weird thing is if everyone had contemplated what it felt like to be the other person deeply, there would be no sexism or racism because there would just be complete empathy. Right. If you, if you really sat there, if you were a policeman in the South and you contemplated what it felt like to be a black person driving and being scared to be pulled over or scared of for your life, if you really sat in that person's feelings, it would, it wouldn't happen. You know, it's like that, that true empathy, like. Well, OK, so now that, that being said, how do you guys think Aziz Ansari is feeling right now? I don't know, probably not great. Yeah. Yeah. And like the thing I keep thinking about that situation with him and where the place where I keep, the thing I keep wondering about is like, what is the appropriate amount of like humiliation that guy is supposed to experience? And, and, you know, where in this thing that's happening right now where people are being like exposed in this massive way? Where is the mech? What would you guys see as like a mechanism of forgiveness where somebody. Who was it was doing what Aziz was doing? And honestly, man, I keep thinking about it. And like I try to like think of him and I know like a lot of people are pissed at him. I keep thinking like that guy doesn't seem to me like he's like really nefarious in that kind of way. Like maybe he's like a little snobby or something, but he doesn't strike me as like somebody who really is like like a fucking Weinstein. You know, some, you know, yeah. So, so that's why I just keep thinking is like for cases like that, what, what, where do we find it? Is it appropriate to even put out on the table? What is the mechanism for forgiveness for these people so they don't have to walk through the rest of their life as though someone is manacold as fucking albatross to their neck. I don't think it's it's nothing you can, I don't know. I mean, we don't have it, right? We can't decide. It's hard to predict. I don't believe that people are conflating all of these things. Like, yeah, you'll get one or two crazy people on every issue who will. It's all the same or whatever. But I don't think most rational people are like, they don't think Ray is Bill Cosby. Same. No, like no one actually saying that that President Bush kept saying he kept grabbing girls butt saying, what's, you know, who my favorite magician is, David Coppa feel. Oh, God. Yeah, people don't. Like, I mean, I don't think people think that's the same as like, you know, Cosby, Kevin Spacey cruising around. Yeah, Bill Cosby is a better Bill Cosby. He might be the worst one really talking about that. Like he's literally drugging people. And then at least like with Harvey Weinstein, people seem like they some of them were conscious. Like they were given a choice to turn him down sometimes. Yeah, I guess. Can you imagine? I mean, I mean, the most amazing thing is that his wife stood by a side. Right. That's like fascinating to me. Yeah, in those cases, it's like the whole question of forgiveness becomes maybe a little irrelevant because that's a life destroying moment for so many people. And it's like, and I guess it maybe it isn't any of our decision to forgive somebody who hasn't directly assaulted us. But when it comes to like somebody like, you know, a public figure like Aziz, who's been called out in this way is to put it lightly, probably like a little embarrassed right now. But honestly, more than likely, maybe like potentially a little suicidal. And I mean, I don't know for sure. I don't know him. I wouldn't think so. Well, I don't know. I don't we just don't know. That's the point. You know, it's hard to contemplate what it feels like to be humiliated like that on a national level. And I think it's important to try to put your mind in their situation, too. I think that that can help. Yeah. Don't you think ultimately it's up to the person? Who? Whoever is being humiliated? Don't they? I mean, time passes and the new cycle, you know, Trump does 9000 more awful things. And, you know, we don't care about aliens. So it's like, why would we care about, you know, this kind of stuff for for that long? I don't know. Well, like Louis C.K., for example, like kind of already over that. But but people still like, you know, people still bring him up. People I just wonder about. I don't know. He hangs out at the comedy cellar. He's still hanging out there. I heard he was there. Yeah. Is he doing comedy? No, I just heard he was like hanging out. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, I think we're still in the moment. I think time will tell what the mechanism of forgiveness is and how this affects things or, I don't know, I think, I don't know. But another problem we have now with everything, but with this in particular, is everyone has a voice. So it's like everyone has something to say. So every time the court of public opinion comes forward and is like, this is the new idea. You know, this is how we think now. You know, we should really not conflate these two and, you know, we should give this a person a break and then, you know, there's like another article that's like, here's why, you know. Yeah. Yeah, I know. I just think men are going to probably stop fucking 20 year olds. Well, sorry, Duncan. He's like, I don't think we need to go that far. That's not me to his to his face. He's like, huh? What does that happen? What about 20 some things? I'm just saying, like, I do see that like most people who are in their 20s, like women who are in their 20s, I would say the ones I've talked to 100 percent of them agree that, you know, every story, I don't know, it's hard to explain. But like, I do feel like a definite difference in the way someone who's 40 looks at these stories and someone who's 20. But it's interesting because doesn't it make you wonder if they're right? Because every generation kind of seems to get smarter than the last about civil rights and, you know, every, I know, I'm curious. Well, I mean, it definitely seems like there's an age break, though. Well, I know. So I think there's no 50 year old men who think Aziz did anything wrong. Well, this is this is the same with like with racism. I mean, if you look at like your grandparents and you consider some of the shit they may have done and said and thought was completely normal, people who were alive during segregation and thought that was normal, then you do see the way things are shifting and how quickly they're shifting. And maybe it goes back to the technological issue we were talking about earlier, which is that these realizations or these like leaps and evolution when it comes to thinking about these things are being sped up by the ability to communicate in the Internet and we're not having maybe the usual amount of time for the pot to slowly start boiling. It's boiling instantaneously. And this is the same as fashion. Like, you know, nothing can stay in style because it's right. I mean, that's just a, you know, superficial idea of or a superficial version of what you're saying. But it's like, yeah, nothing can stay in, you know, even like words. People come up with new words and then it's like already over because it's like moving so fast. Right. Yeah. And this is this is actually one of the things that singularity university that they were talking about, what is what's going to happen in the future? And one of the things they're saying is what happens when we have all this surveillance footage and all these records that normally the records just didn't even exist and people have committed crimes that at the time when they were committing them weren't crimes. So that's interesting. Yeah. Like, what do we do there? You know, I mean, don't you kind of have to go with what's legal at the time? Yeah, but I mean, again, if we go to like what's happening right now, like the disease thing in particular, what we're looking at is potentially going to eventually could be legislated eventually where it's like, well, if there's the in I don't know how the fuck you would legislate it, but we're looking at a thing where I mean, just to go back, I think I was telling you about this. I want to you could put together a montage of like 80s movies like porkies or look at the way dating happens in 80s movies. And if someone did or it's all it's all what we would call sexual assault. Now, like the guy comes home with a girl, he starts trying to kiss her. She's like, no, get it. No, I don't want to. And he's like forcing himself on her. And this is in so many different like can't movies. I think there's one where Bill Murray is doing it. And when you look at that now, if that was fucking footage of someone doing that now and that hit the internet, that person would be ruined. Yeah. And yet this was the way in movies, it was considered like just a jolly way to end the night is to push your date down on the couch and try to kiss her while she tried to like squirm out from under you. So when you look at that and you see, you hear the story of what Aziz did now is like fucking, I guess, like eating fetuses in front of people or like, you know, it's like a rancid horrible thing. And that's what Aziz did is just like a scene in a dating movie in the 80s. Have you seen Catherine Deneuve came forward, you know, the famous French actress and she's like, it's just the art of seduction. You know, she's like very like pro disease. But then I was also reading in this article, they were saying that at the time when they legalized women's suffrage, a lot like the majority of women were against it. Oh, wow. So it's like the idea that like what you're saying, I think is happening. We're we're evolving and changing, but we can't keep up because of technology. Yeah. And like you can't change the rules without telling people. That's, you know, that's that's also part of it because it's not like all of a sudden, you know, it's it's illegal to misread nonverbal cues. Yeah. Yeah. You can't really go to jail to, you know, it's that's not provable. Retroactive consent, basically. It's like if you it's can you withdraw consent after you've given consent, even if you gave grudging consent, can you withdraw consent? And if that's the case, then, oh, my God, what are we going to do to handle that? But you're saying you had sex and then like the next day you're like, you know what, I didn't consent. Right. You had consensual sex. That sounds very confusing. Well, it is. But I think that like when you look like assuming like Aziz was being honest in the text message he sent the next day, or he's like, I didn't see it like that. And she's like, of course. Yeah, I mean, I'm sure that's not part of his evil plan. Yeah, he wasn't like when that was happening. He wasn't thinking to himself, OK, she definitely doesn't want to have sex with me, but I'm going to keep pushing myself on her until she pretends that she wants to have sex with me and then she's going to have sex with me. In his head, he was like, I think she likes me, but she's being coy, maybe, or something like that. And so if we have the situation where post that event, somebody can say, hey, no, no, no, I didn't want that to happen. Even though I was like allowing it to happen, then you're running into problems, which is like, I don't think we're in danger of that. I mean, people can, but it's just like, isn't that what they can't put Cosby in jail and 55 people are like, he drugged me. Like it's I'm not worried about legal consequences. Like maybe maybe public opinion consequences, legal consequences. It feels like that's what I mean. Public opinion consequences. That is a it's a form of like maybe it'll be what you're saying that people are going to have to start like signing legal documents before they have sex or. I mean, which is just just just think of. I think it's kind of hot. What's your paper work? I know like I heard Justin Bieber has that. He has people sign a consent form before he has sex with them because he's so famous. He's so and I'm sure he's got so many, you know, I mean, I know people way less famous than him, where women have tried to like sue them for money from having sex and, you know, what's your favorite romance movie, you guys? God, I don't know. I like the English patient, right? That's fucking a great, beautiful, torrid. So you're saying she's got to get out her tax ID before like they he carries her up the sand dunes. I'm just thinking exactly, exactly. I'm thinking of like all those hot romance scenes where like who is that? Fines, Ray Fines, Ray fucking Fines, hot, sexy, beautiful, Ray fucking Fines. All those scenes where suddenly like Ray Fines is like about to like just grab and all the passion and the passion pouring out of both of them. But right before that, he's like, hold on, hold on. I just need you to put your thumb print into my iPhone so that we can you can consent. That'd be a funny SNL sketch. Yeah, English patient, modern day. Yeah, modern. Yeah. So we but also it's not that sexy to like have to go on an app to meet someone. But that's just where we're at. You know, it's like everything about dating right now is not sexy. Yeah. Yeah, well, I mean, it just it just depends. But I know that if you're finding people through tender or rye, then it can be really fucked up like that. Are you do you? Are you do you use Raya? I feel like I've seen you on there. I was I thought I spotted you. Oh my god, if you guys match, that would be so awkward. But that thing is to me interesting and so so fucked up because and creepy all the day. This is like Raya's like kind of like a fancy Tinder. You've got Instagram followers. You can like do that. But it's like because like if I use tender, it's really embarrassing because like I you know what I did once is I switched my gender on Tinder to see what would happen because I was curious about what like guy profiles look like. And within like six minutes, some dude from the comedy store, some comic tweeted like I just saw Duncan Trussell on Tinder as a woman. See a woman. Yeah, and it was just it was embarrassing. So they're not supposed to do that. So I see. So Raya is a little more culled. Well, you can't do a screen grab on Raya. Right. They'll kick you off there. Well, you can do one and then you get the warning. And if you do two, they kick you out. So you did a screen grab. I did just because I saw my friend on there. I was like, oh, hey. And then it was like warning bull, you know, one more time you're done. And I was like, oh, I didn't I didn't know. What about that song, though, that they make you pick? Oh, that's kind of embarrassing. Fuck that. What's your song, Duncan? Hold on. Let me think. Let me think. Ubustank. No, it's I can't remember now. It's not chanting. It's not chanting. I feel like I don't watch any of my friends' profiles out of like courtesy. It feels like you're watching someone change clothes. It's so humiliating. Dating profiles are humiliating. And I just like whenever I see someone I know, I'm just like, nope. And I don't I don't know their songs. I don't I just feels it feels invasive. Have you been on any Raya dates? Yeah. Any any good ones? Yeah, my first online date ever. Yeah, Natasha was there. We were in the writers room. It was season two. My first online day ever was Raya and I ended up dating that guy for over a year. Wow. Yeah. So it worked. Yeah, I've met some nice people. Oddly. That's great. But I also, you know, I'm you've also had some bad ones. Yeah, but I'm like age appropriate. You know, I think that's where some people get into trouble. And I, you know, I'm pretty selective, I guess. I know men in their 40s who won't do online dating because they don't want. They only want to date 20 year olds and they don't want. They don't want to date someone who's the same age as them. But I mean, that's just like, but you take away all of the, I'm not talking about you, by the way. No, I'm not talking about you. I'm not talking about you. I'm not just dating. No, I know you're not. I totally know you're not. I'm not talking about you. I'm just saying it's just taken away a lot of the, you know, like, what if you did find someone who's 38 or 42 or, you know, and you like totally connect with them? But if you're like already making, I think the Internet makes it easier to make all these restrictions that like aren't really real, you know, like, you know, you could go to a bar, you know, a party and meet someone who's like so awesome, it doesn't have to be like 98% about their age. Right. And I feel like the internet kind of reduces it. Yeah, I know. In a negative way. Yeah, it kind of, yes, it can do that for sure. Yeah, tell us about your worst riot date. I haven't had a, I've talked to some people on Riot, but then like I start talking to them and then instead of like trying to initiate a date, I just start feeling weird about it or something. And I'm like, well, I don't know. And what do I say? Like, should we go get a drink or something? And then it just feels weird. And so I haven't really done it yet. That's how I felt when I was looking for a surrogate. Oh, right. Oh, yeah. I was like interviewing people to carry my child because I didn't want to do it. I like meeting people in the old fashioned way. You know, like driving around at like 3 a.m. downtown. I don't really have the energy to meet people. Oh, wait, remember, remember in this in Sunset Strip in the 70s, people would always talk about this was like before Lyft, which is also weird that we do that, but like people would always talk about like cruising down Sunset Strip and picking up people and going to parties. Like that was like a legit thing to do on the weekend. That doesn't sound more romantic to me. It sounds more fun. Yeah, it sounds fun. Well, I'm not just cruising down this back and forth all night long. That's hot. I guess your chaos. But I'm not I don't I'm not stigmatizing dating apps because like, you know, a couple of people that I've dated I've met just from the internet completely like through Twitter or something like that, but not through the dating app. But I think there is something incredibly magical about meeting somebody in the real world, in your social circles, that you don't even know that you just don't even know. And then like you're walking down the street a few days later and you think about them like they just pop into your head. That is nice. That's the best. That's the best. That's the ultimate way to meet people. And that can still happen. It still should happen. You know, I think we're going to start like rebelling again. There's got to be some kind of anti-tech revolution. The last two people I dated I met in person. I didn't meet online. Oh, you did. Where'd you eat them? I met one at work and one at a party. See, that's what to me, that's way better than because also a lot of people, they're holed up in their house unabomber style. So unless some potential lover accidentally walks through their house because they think it's the wrong place, they're not going to meet anyone anywhere. So that's the other problem is people are so isolated, they need these dating apps, I guess. But yeah, it's a very odd time. But I'm sorry if we do get to a place where you have to put a fingerprint in before you have sex. God, I hope so. For a second, it sounded like you were OK with that kind of. No, I'm not. I'm just saying it's not that far off from what it seems like. We're probably two years away from that, maybe. Well, I think before that happens, it's good, hopefully that guys are really considering what I just had Bert Kreischer on. And he was talking about how when he was a kid, there was some like in high school, there was some girl he was trying to hook up with and how he was so forceful with her. And like every day he was like, come on, let's just have sex. Come on, let's just do it. And he's like, I thought that's what you were supposed to do. That's how you do it. And so that doesn't make a woman feel good. And I think that ultimately it's just good to open up the conversation about how to treat women. Yeah. And so it's good for women in that sense, you know, and to make men, you know, just think about how they act. I mean, it's just that instead of the consent form, you can, when you're with a woman, just say, hey, do you mind if I kiss you? You could do that. I mean, it's not quite like English patient level, passion or anything like that. But if you're wondering about it, then you could theoretically just and just record the whole thing like if you can't tell. Yeah. Like if you can't tell, just ask. And if they're like, you know, no, then don't. I feel like women give signals. We magnetize it, you know? Yeah. Yeah. Like, I don't know. It shouldn't. I mean, when I think about it, as I work, it's it hasn't necessarily been mysterious, though, like there has been a time I could think of where I've asked, I said, can I kiss you? And they're like, no. And it's just like, oh, oh, I'm sorry. That's cool. Yeah. I'm going to go drink by myself. Yeah. Try to forget about this and start over tomorrow. But, you know, it's cool. It wasn't like after that, like we were like it ruined anything. It was just like, oh, shit, I completely was confused about what was happening here. And that's OK. I was I could handle it. But yeah, so I think maybe that's where it's going. Just people need to be more like capable of reading cues or something like that. No idea. I'm very excited and curious, though. I feel like it's going in a positive direction, even though there's obviously going to be bumps in the road, it feels like things are going to get a little better. Yeah, I hope so. But one one last question here. I don't know what you're it's five eleven. Are we cool for a little bit longer? We've been doing this for two hours. Well, not for two hours. No, we got here at four. Four. OK, good, good, good. I'm good. OK, great. So here's a question I have for you guys, because you really don't like Trump. You really don't like Trump. Here's something that I've been thinking about when we really don't like somebody. That means they probably suck, but it also means there's probably parts of them in us that we don't want to admit. So if you were forced to name something, what's something in Trump that you think is in you that you wish you could change? I mean, I feel like he has. A will to win, but I don't know that I want to change that. Or, you know, his ambition seems like he's just like. It's undeniable. And I feel like he is kind of a winner. Right. He figures out how to win. Right. You know, he definitely does it by like name calling and like negative things. But I think his his ambition is is pretty like out of control. So you do you feel like there's some of that in you out of control ambition? Well, there has been. I don't know if it's out of control. No, I wouldn't say that I would like try to like hurt my enemies. But I do recognize that quality. Well, you're a hard worker. I mean, you you as he says he. Yeah. Is he I'm sure. And well, he is a lot of vacations. I'm trying. I'm literally right here trying to think of anything. Trump and I have in common. And I I just can't think we both have bodies. I can't think of anything else. You both love your families. Does he? I think he I think he's into his family. I mean, I think that's how a lot of Republicans justify things. Because they're like, I'm doing it for my family. We're getting the money, you know, like whenever they get money and they get the taxes cut so they can become even like bigger billionaires. Yes, somehow they think it's for like their family. Right. Which is weird because it's like what about, you know, what about other people's children? What about like funding for the communities? Well, there's some verse in the Bible where Jesus is saying like even like and it's not really fair to wolves or I can't remember. Maybe he says snakes, but he's like loving your family. Even snakes love their family. Even like he was like trying to use like the evil animals, which really aren't evil, but he's trying to use the evil animals to say, like, who gives a fuck about your love of your family? It doesn't mean anything. It's the love of everyone that's the that would be the incredible, miraculous shift to make. So you're right. He does love his fucking family. Guaranteed he loves his family. I thought of something we have in common. What? OK, so he does have a thing where everyone will say no to him, whatever. And in his mind, he goes, you'll fucking see. I've had that since I was like 12. Just people who are like, you can't do that. I'm like, mm-hmm, you'll see. What's an example of that when you were 12? Just got anything. Just you can't graduate from high school. Right. Like, you know, I was like, I want to be an actress. I want to leave this town. I want to I lived in a town of a thousand people. I was like, I want to move to Hollywood and take on the world. People like, well, that doesn't seem and I'm just like, mm-hmm. And in my mind, I just wouldn't say anything and I just be like, you'll see. Where did that come from in you? Where did you get that from? I don't know. Maybe my dad, he's an entrepreneur, kind of spirit. OK, so maybe him. But I just always I always had that in to a degree that I think has helped me and to a degree that's for that I probably don't like, where maybe everyone was right about a certain thing. And in my mind, I'm like, mm-mm, you're wrong to myself. Yeah, I'm jealous of one of Trump's qualities. What? Well, like how he trolled the woman's march. Like everyone, everyone like marched against him. Most of the signs were like, fuck you, Trump. Yeah. And then he tweeted out, thank you so much for all the women who march. What a great day to march. Feminism, female job employment has never been higher. Thank you. And it's like he has this like uncanny ability to spin things into like it was good for him. I know. And it seems like he believes it. Well, I mean, it's like you'd never have a problem. Well, what is it? You took everything as a compliment. I wish I took every tweet as a compliment. Yeah, that's what it is. Oh, thank you. He takes everything as a compliment. You ugly, talentless bitch. I'd be like, actually, you know, I mean, he's clearly like trolling. But at the same time, he is like, he's not hurt by it. What do you think is the worst thing about him? I think he's a sociopath. But what are the what in particular do you think is the worst? Like outside of like maybe he's a sociopath. I mean, like something he's doing that that is the worst of all the things he's doing, like, for example, I don't think he cares about human life. He just doesn't care about like people dying or people. I don't think so. Do you? I mean, I can't be alone in this. I'm amazed at some of the decisions he makes. Like I just read that he has put a 35 percent tariff on parts used for solar panels from overseas, so he's actually fucking up clean, clean energy. Yeah. So it's like every time there's something to decide, he picks the thing that's going to hurt the most people, in my opinion. Yeah, but that is also like the Republican agenda. When you look at it from, you know, continue fracking to cut all the funding for the poor people, like, you know, to clean air, it seems like everything about that agenda is negative. Like he also for his like three kids or however many kids he has. Well, but I wonder why do you think he is like that? Why are with that's the Republican Party. If that's the agenda of the Republican Party. Why? Like why? Maybe they're mentally ill. Well, I mean, there's got to be a reason beyond that, right? I think they think that government shouldn't be involved, that people should pull themselves up by their bootstraps, even though they haven't been able to realize that some people aren't born with any boots. And I think that they just have this like skewed version of things where it's like every man for themselves, you know. I wonder how they feel about the hot tub law. Well, I know Rand Paul, Ron Paul would be against it. The Libertarians would be against it. But I think you're right. They do have this like pull yourself up by your bootstraps. Which in a way, like I feel like, OK, like let's say if I look at millennials or like a 20 year old who's like, you know, sends a budding comedian. They send me their first tape and they're like, can you help me get on Conan? I saw you to Conan and I'm just like, this is the first thing you've ever done. You know, like I'm like, I worked for 20 years and went to like all these crappy open mics. Like maybe they think something like that. Like I'm working so hard. So can you, you know, why should I help you when I've been working for all? And I'm making it possible for you to like have a quicker career. Maybe it won't take as long as it took me. Like so maybe it's an idea like that or they but it's just not fair. Well, yeah. And also the idea makes sense. Yeah, sure. But it also ends up favoring the wealthy. Like it ends at the decisions always end up favoring the super rich. And it's it's obvious what it is. It's an oligarchy. And it's the inevitable result of it's just the same thing that happens over and over again throughout time, which is the fucking king gets all the stuff. And then the peasants don't get the stuff. It's just an upgraded version of it. And I saw Bill Maher had this analogy that I was like, oh, that is so perfect. He was talking about he's like, if there's a pizza party, there's a hundred people and a hundred slices. The first guy comes up, takes 99 slices and turns around to the next guy and says, that guy's trying to take your slice. And he's like, you guys split it all fight over it. Doesn't it feel true that feels like that's the system. And then everyone gets mad at each other and they're fighting over this small piece of nothing when they should have a bigger, they should have a real piece of pizza. What are you a fucking communist? The moment you start saying things like that, they accuse you of communism because you're just stating the obvious thing. Like I thought of it in terms of bananas on an island like if we all washed up on an island and one of us had all the bananas and was rash was saying, like, well, you know, I went and I picked all these bananas and maybe they did. But still you would say to that person, well, yeah, but we're all hungry. Don't you want to share with us? And the person would be like would share with us. And if the person didn't, we'd take the bananas because we're all hungry. And there's more of us than you. And and a burning man, which is a gifting, a sharing economy, when you have stuff, you realize that like no one has to take it from you. You just naturally want to give it away because it feels good and it like feels good to give a bunch of strawberries to dusty people who are really hungry in the afternoon just feels good, better than eating the fucking strawberries. But we're sick from capitalism. Like there's no reason why Steve Jobs needs to be hiding or, you know, whoever's in charge of Apple now, hiding all of their money overseas and Tim Cook, like, you know, just like they're in the news every single week for like some awful thing. And it's just like, you know, from making it, making it so our phones take longer to load so that they just came out and admitted that, that they were doing that so people would like, you know, buy new phones. That article I sent you yesterday that 84% of the wealth is in the top 1%. Like something's off with that. Like, I don't think people, communism works, but that's off. What do we do, Ricky? What do we do, though? What's your plan? Like, how do we get that? I think we up the minimum wage. We, you know, make people have their businesses here or we don't give them tax cuts. The corporations who have all their shit overseas. So people are getting tax cuts for having their corporations overseas. Well, I mean, they still get tax cuts if they have all their factories overseas. The minimum wage thing I want to talk to you about because the really creepy thing is, OK, so if we up the minimum wage to a certain amount, then that amount, the moment it exceeds the amount of money it would take to automate your workforce and to take care of your robots, then all that's going to happen is businesses are going to have a market pressure to automate their workforce. That's not true because, you know, I saw the thing about CEOs where I'm going to make up these numbers because I don't remember them exactly, but it was like a CEO in the 80s made like a million dollars. And then they realized that they were the CEO, so it could give themselves their own salary. Yeah, they just figured it out. And then they're just like, I make a hundred million dollars. It went up by like a hundred times. They didn't go to two million dollars. And then they're like, oh, wait, so you've got a company, Ricky, and you don't give your people an $80,000 Christmas bonus, right? Oh, and that's legal. OK. I'm not going to why I'm not going to. Why would I do that either? There are why should we give the janitor health insurance? I need a hundred million dollars. Right. Like these companies have the money. I dated a billionaire once and all he did, his dad was a billionaire. I would see him up in the middle of the night. He was checking his dad's ranking on the Fortune 500. Like, but it's like that's important to people. Right. And it's weird. But that's the. But again, like it's still like it if I'm running a business and I am someone who's interested in where I rank in the Fortune 500 and I've managed to like get myself into the thinking that human beings are just kind of like inefficient, meaty robots that I'm using to run shit. And who gives a fuck about them early? I don't care. They can do their own thing. It's not my fault they're working for me. They can quit anytime they want. Who gives a fuck? It's it's not my problem, man. Start your own business like I started mine. I don't have to take care of you. And suddenly it's like maybe that's why religion was good. It made people like care about their fellow man. Like people are less religious now, too. But keep going. Well, yeah. I mean, maybe that is it. And maybe we're just missing it. And some people say that the problem is that we've become so disconnected. From a shared mystical story that we have basically the industrial revolution has made some people think of other people as machines instead of like carriers of souls. And so the problem again, Ricky, though, is is unless you're going to say you can't automate your workforce, if you're telling me, OK, well, I have to pay my workers $22 an hour. And it cost me $21 an hour to take care of a hamburger making machine or a self-checkout line or all the things that I could do to automate. Then I'm going to automate if I'm if I don't give a shit about people. I mean, that's a pretty dark point of view, though. Well, it's what's happening. I mean, that's the reality. The reality is some people are saying that in the next 20 years, we are going to see something like 38 percent unemployment because of automation. So and this is what Carl, one of the things that's when people storm and take all the bananas, that's that's when it gets real. Well, this is and this is actually what I think should be part of the conversation is. What it is in someone's self interest to share some of the wealth because, you know, they'll raid the castle. Well, this is where we come to the end of the Roman Empire, right? Where they're like putting like shows on for people and like trying to like just distract people from the banana problem. So so, yeah, so this is the thing. So I do this is universal basic income, right? We start sending people checks for a thousand dollars every week or something just to keep them from setting us on fire. Do you think that's the answer? I don't know. We need to figure out how much is enough to live on. That's the thing, because I was going to propose. What about if really rich people, you know, because everyone wants their names in the news? Like, OK, I'm in charge of bringing back all arts programs to public schools. I'm going to fund this. I don't have this. But like I'm going to take, you know, two hundred million or ten million. I don't know what it would cost to like maybe even just for my city. And then it can be like the Natasha Legerro arts program. And then I can get like, you know, because everyone wants accolades. And I could like give up some of my income. But then I'm like, well, why don't I do that now? I'm sure I have a lot more money than some people. Why don't you do it now? Because I don't think I have enough money. But that's the thing. Maybe maybe Tim Cook doesn't think he has enough money. Yeah, I yeah, I think that it's it's definitely. We need to like pare down or something. I mean, and of course, I mean, I have enough money to live, but it's like you always think that you're going. It's like a problem. Maybe we need some kind of gifting simulator that you can like give rich people that releases the same chemicals in your bloodstream that you get when you give things to people because it's one of the best feelings ever. And maybe wealthy people have just gotten don't even understand what that's like. But what is wealthy like you're a wealthy person compared to like many, many people. I mean, I don't know about that. But I know what you're saying. I mean, this is like one of the one. I there's this Ramdas lecture that I heard or radio program. You say radio calls and someone's asking, what do we do with our money? What is the idea? What what what are what is a spiritual person supposed to do with their money? And you hear this. And I maybe I just projected it, but you hear this hitch in Ramdas's response because he's got a ton of dough, you know what I mean? And or at the time, maybe he had more money than other people. And you hear this momentary pause because he's thinking about it. But he said you should only keep the bare minimums to sustain yourself and give the rest away. The bare minimum to sustain yourself. And if he does go to Hawaii six times a year, he lives in Hawaii, but the house in Hawaii is actually that's not his house. It's it's donated to the foundation for him to live in. But regardless, this concept of only what you need for the bare minimum, if everybody was doing that, then we would be in a utopia. What's the bare minimum? Then, you know, we're human beings. It'll never work. Like some human, you're at how to game that system. Like I want to order whatever I want on Amazon. Well, I mean, this is the this is the problem. I mean, I in I think that what people should be doing. I want Hermes wallpaper. I do, too. I mean, we all do. But you know what? I want more than that. I want a group of beautiful, not literally physically beautiful, but sweet friends who are going to take care of each other, regardless of what the fuck the government is doing for us. And I think they also say we're not the problem. This is not like the didn't the new tax cuts. I could be remembering this wrong again, because I have the worst memory. I think the DeVos family got like an extra two billion dollars or two hundred million dollars, some crazy amount of money just from this cut. And like, why? Yeah. But don't you think the problem is trickle down? The problem is what I think the problem is what you just said, because I know I'm guilty of it. The problem is saying I'm not the problem. Right. The problem is not taking personal responsibility and just like what you just said to me, Natasha, is true. I do have some probably more money than a bunch of people. And and what if I said no more stakes? The bare minimum is gruel. You can start eating oatmeal. I'm well, you know, I think that that by itself sounds fucking rotten. But I think that when you pair it with just a simple invitation, and I think it's super important these days, is people need to find to people need to start communities and people within those communities. There needs to be open honesty and communication. And there needs to be like the one a group of people I'm associated with. One thing that we have said to each other is none of us are ever going to be homeless. And so because we know we have enough money together to take care of each other. And if somebody gets into trouble, we can take care of them. This used to be what the family was supposed to do, but this is like a bigger family. You should become Jewish. That's how the Jews think. Well, and it's served them well, hasn't it? And and I think so. One thing people can do is forget about the fucking government. Forget about Trump. Forget about the taxes and the tax cuts and the whatever the fuck. And just think, do I have a group of people around me that's going to take care of me if things get bad? And if I don't, why don't I? Why am I trying to make that group of people a bunch of fascists and fucking suits who are getting paid off by the goddamn cigarette companies in the prison industrial complex and the military industrial complex? That's going to be my tribe. No, you should have a group of good people around you that's going to. It doesn't matter. You're you're going to be taken care of, I think. I feel like I have that. I don't know. You never asked me what my least favorite thing about Trump is. What's your least favorite thing about Trump? I feel like he's farted on the world and we can't get away from it. It's just like the cloud permeated. Like, I'm getting new I'm getting new alerts on like every one of my devices at all times about things he said and did. And I can't like escape and it's like right. I think it's it's like a poison. It's it's it's he's like the ultimate narcissist. And he's like, I'm not that interested, but I can't. It's like Taylor Swift notifications. Like I can't get away. I'll show you how to turn those off on your phone if you want the Trump stuff. But it's starting to happen on my computer now to turn them off, even on the computer. Yeah, I did the Google on my phone. And I'll tell you, when I turn those notifications off, my world became a much more peaceful place. What about when I go to Twitter? Well, that's just don't do Twitter. You're going to have to avoid the Twitter news updates or just like, don't scroll through. I mean, you do have at least some control of that. And I don't think it's any accident at all. And we look at the fetishistic obsession people have with the United States government right now. It's really sick, because every time you get focused on the government, you believe that much more that we need the current system for things to work. Because who gives a fuck? This is just when you really consider how many senators and Congress people and representatives and there are out there, how many are there? Do you know the total number of senators? Like it's how many is it? There's like 240. What is guessing? Is it one for every state or is it? Oh, wait, senators. Is it two for every state and then Congress is 200 people or something? I don't know. Well, the question you told me there was five thousand. I would be like, you should look it up because we sound really stupid. What's a mad? Well, I mean, shit. People know that I definitely stupid people know this information. But but it's like, well, this is one of the reasons we couldn't get guns if we didn't know this. So I guess we can't get guns. But let's say there's six hundred. Let's say there's four hundred of them. There's four hundred of them. It's just four hundred old bags out there, and some of them are good, but a lot of them are just paid off. And we're letting this group of four hundred fucking people tell us how hot we can heat our fucking hot tub. This is insanity, man. It's insanity, you know, so maybe part of the thing for people to do is to begin to turn their eyes away from the government and turn their eyes into their community and start thinking more about that, like forming bonds that are going to last when the fucking missiles hit, you know, Duncan, so bleak. God, it's so or but what about, you know, shouldn't there be someone coming up for the liberals to run against Trump, who's not over 80? I don't know. I don't like you don't put any and you don't invest anything in that. No, I my my I don't. It's not that I'm like in going to write any manifestos or anything like that. But I do think that there is something to be said for as much as possible, shaking off the saddle of the oppression of our of any system like our the United States government so that it's not like in our brains and and spend more time forming very strong, cohesive bonds with the community. But and then let's see what happens. I mean, isn't there room for both? I mean, it's a personal question. Am I overly obsessed with the machinations of the United States government? I was going to say yes. And then I couldn't name how many congresspeople we have. So clearly I'm not. Well, I mean, it's it's for many of us, me included. It's a collision of lack of information about the way the system itself works, mixed in with a lot of superstition about like some kind of like actual nefarious direction that some party or group is taking, which implies a kind of at least like focused, rational intent when it might just be a bureaucracy that is completely inefficient and chaotic. And because of that, the it's lost its soul. There's no I mean, it's always going to be a bunch of old white men trying to like wrangle us, don't you think? Yeah, and that's how it's always been like I'm watching a documentary on, you know, the House of Windsor in England. And it's always they were like they were like all German and they had a German last name and it was just a bunch of like Nazi related people, like ruling, ruling England. And then they all got together after Hitler and were like, we should change our name. Let's be the house and they kept like pitching names and they're like, well, let's just name it after the castle or the House of Windsor now. And then all the English people are like, oh, and now think of how the British people worship their royalty. It's just like, what? It's everything's confusing. And I think that, you know, we're not at least we don't have like a royal royal system in place, but we kind of do kind of do. But I want you guys to tell us because you're both I think you're in your own what you are kind of your activists, like you're out, you're at least online. You're expressing your opinions to everyone. And like, and I think the really weird thing, because at least there's something my grandmother said to me when she's like, I look in the mirror, I see a 93 year old, but inside I feel like I'm 12. And so a lot of us still feel like children. And the idea that that that we're at, we're moving into the place where we're actually supposed to, some of us are supposed to be leaders. The question is, what do we do? There's a lot of people look up to you and and both both are all of us here. And I think many of us are like really weirded out by what's happening. What is something people listening can do to help? What do you what do you guys do? What can we do more than getting stressed out about the fact that we've got this insane person as our Mad King? I mean, the only things that I can think of that have changed for me. I started donating a lot more money and doing more volunteer work because it's kind of the only thing that makes me feel better. But it's I still feel powerless. I feel like just kind of overwhelmed. What volunteer work do you do? I do project to Angel Food and I'll like go and make food there. And I just volunteered in a prison for a day for this project called Defy, which is like it sounded fascinating. Yeah, it was really it was really cool. It was these guys who do like a six month business training program and they have like their graduation day and they bring people who are entrepreneurs of some sort. Most people were like, you know, I'm just sort of a television entrepreneur, but most people had real businesses that that went and volunteered with me. But these guys pitch you their businesses and the prisoners do the prisoners. Yeah, they take it's, you know, it's like the transition between we're like sort of the transition between going selling yourself to the real world. We were like the trick because you have to do it in front of people, not just other inmates, it's other, you know, they were called EITs, entrepreneurs and training. They did not call them inmates EITs and they pitch you their ideas and they brag about themselves and they like you teach, they teach you like, you know, to like it's all and it was all like all this emotional connection. There was a whole thing about, you know, forgiveness and shame. And yeah, it was crazy. You start the day, honestly, you start, I like I could cry think about you start the day and it's probably 60 EITs and 60 volunteers and you stand across from each other and you look each other in the eye. And the EIT says to you, they repeat this mantra. They were like, I agree to be vulnerable. I agree. It's I mean, I could cry. They're like, they are just like, I agree to let my guard down. I agree to let go of my shame. I agree because a lot of people have shame about what they've done. And these are people who are getting out. Yeah. And these are and they have to like at some point, you know, forgive themselves in order to move forward. You know, you have to have self-esteem to get out in the world and pitch yourself and be like, yeah, I have all these strikes against me. You hear things about like people who are in prison and they get out and it's just like they actually preferred the prison lifestyle because no opportunity to do anything. But it was it was amazing. There was a thing like in those kind of things kind of make me feel better. There was a thing called step to the line where there was just like a line of tape and the EITs are on one side and volunteers and you step forward if something's true about you. And this woman was like, I had a parent who was incarcerated and it was like 60 percent of those people step forward and no one on my side. And it was like, I got a college education. All of us, you know, there was like a couple, a couple, you know, one or two, there'd be an exception. But it was like I didn't complete high school. It was like 60 percent of them step forward. It was it was such a such a record that play it for Republicans. Oh, my God, it was so you feel so grateful. And you just feel like, holy shit, I didn't know how surrounded by love I was and like how many opportunities I had just by having parents who in their mind, like not even nonverbally expected that I would be an educated, functional member of society instead of in their mind, expecting me to follow in their footsteps somehow. And like that's the problem. It's like if you watch any show where people are getting molested, it's like 90 percent of the time they were molested or like anyone intervention. It always came back to like a molestation. Like I think almost every episode that I have ever watched. And it's like if we could just, you know, have more empathy because it's like people don't all come where you don't all start on the same base. Yeah. And this is about like forgiving them. So you just how do you not end up in jail? Yeah. At some point you have like one guy, the first time he was arrested, he was seven. You're like, OK, what did it set? Like that guy had no chance to not end up in this position. But except now he's like, he's got to move forward. He's got to I did it myself. They should be able to do it. You just got to pull yourselves up from your bootstraps. I don't care. I had hardships. Right. And it's just like that is just a false reality. I don't care. I'm just like them. I watch my daddy burn my mom's eyes out with a cigar. It's like, yeah, you're right. This is this is these people are like many of these people are like born into hell. And then because of that, they they're everything they touch catches on fire. And it sucks. And it seems like liberals are able to understand that and wrap their minds around that difference and some people aren't. You think it's it's Republicans aren't capable of. I just think sometimes people they're just not empathetic, maybe. I don't know. Like how could you not? How how could you want to strip a city or a country or a state or whatever of like poor kids getting better lunches or like you don't want to have lunch? It's really it's just really hard to wrap your mind around that to think like, well, I just don't think that it's not my problem. Right. It's very hard for for people who lean more liberal to understand how that's not all of our problems. But we all OK. So and because this first second is going to sound like I'm calling you out. So let me call myself out first. I am fully aware that I'm just going to throw out something that really riles me up. There is a really big problem in Los Angeles with stray dogs. And these stray dogs are being slaughtered in these fucking shelters. Right now, there's like the cutest sweeties who are going to be euthanized for nothing in these shelters. And you know what I'm doing about it? Nothing, it fucking bothers me. It really does. It makes me fucking. But if you were given a bill where you had to pick, could I do something about it or not? You would pick to do something about it. Yeah, but I'm saying that's put relegating control to the government. What I'm saying is if you're upset about lunches, you could very easily donate to something, do something, go and really make some active move. I don't do that. I don't do it either. I don't do it at all. And I think and I don't think that makes me evil. I think it's just there's some kind of switch that's turned off. And most of us, when I hear you say this thing about prisons, when did you when was the first time you started volunteering? The first time I was, I think, 21. Not for the prisons. No, no, no, no, no. I started volunteering in orphanages in Mexico and into. Oh, yeah. Wouldn't you just like have to hold babies? Mm hmm. Yeah. You go down and you just like hold children with AIDS. Yeah. Well, yeah. That was they don't get held. I didn't do it. I went to an AIDS orphanage in Africa. Yeah, it's like this thing where you can actually make it like because nothing feels like you make a difference. But when you go to these orphanages, like there'll be like three people taking care of 60 kids and so the kids don't get that personal love. They don't get like people's eyes lighting up when they show off or they they don't get held enough. They don't get, you know what I mean? They don't get their picture taken enough. They don't get pushed on the swing enough. They don't. So it's like it's not imagine you're not you're not fixing anything, but you're helping like a little. You feel like you help a little. How old were you when I started? Yeah, 21, 21. And do you remember maybe, maybe 24, maybe around? I don't remember around that age. I want to know what led up to the decision to do that for the first time. Like what pushed you over the edge and it going out to volunteer? It was this girl, Bitsy, who's still one of my friends. She she came over to my house and she was talking to my roommate about it. And I was like, what is that? That sounds good to me. And she's like, oh, I'm going next weekend. I was like, I wanted I want to do that. And I started doing that with her. Well, what's really good about Project Angel Food with me and she like she's just. Yeah, I have to say one thing about Ricky is she has a lot of follow through. And I think that's why, you know, we have a TV show because like I love coming up with ideas, like I can't tell you the amount of times I've almost volunteered. Like I went through a six week course that you told me to do, Duncan, where you help people with hospice, like in hospice. And then when it got down to like the blood test after my six classes that took a month and a half, I had to I didn't want to drive downtown for the blood test. Right. And then I just never did it. But I clearly like like it's that follow through, you know, like and I see people online doing things. I'm like, oh, I want to do that. I want to work with children. I mean, I have obviously done some stuff, but certainly not enough. I'm not that great. Like I just do it sometimes. Like I feel like I don't do enough. I feel like I don't give enough. It's not like it's not constant. I'm not that great. You know, every once in a while I go to Africa to a little baby. No, I was already in Africa. I was already in Africa. No, no, no, no, I was already. It's weird because so here's I'm not like a volunteer leader. But if someone says, hey, do you want to come to this thing? I say yes, pretty much. But I don't think of it. I don't I'm not like actively looking and like I'm like, I want to be I want to go and be in the shelter. It's like if someone came over to you tomorrow and said, hey, tomorrow I'm going to the shelter that you'd be like, OK, like it's just it's just the people in my community have led me to this. Like Jeff Ulrich, the guy from Ear Wolf texted me. He goes, I think you should do this prison thing. And I was like, OK, like it's been other people maybe we could all start like helping each other to to go do it. You know, like in the same way that like if Trump weren't elected, I don't think we'd be having like the women's movement that we're having because I think people are so enraged by him. And like the fact that he said, like you can just grab women by the pussy. I mean, I was 100 percent my life on the line. There's no way someone who says that can be the president. And like it's still happened. And it's just so appalling. I think it like all these cumulative things like everyone's just so annoyed and mad and pained that like we're able to have this movement now, which I feel like if Hillary Clinton were our president, we wouldn't be feeling the same way. And so maybe together we can all try to like just even do it with with friends to try to like find things like you said, like school lunches or right, you know, the arts programs. I mean, yeah, this is now it's you've definitely set off a cascade inside of me because I'm just thinking, oh, you know what I'm going to do? I'm just going to figure out some something I can do for like the dog problem in L.A. It's not hard to do. I could tomorrow I can. What would you do? You just do it for a day, like go and help out in an event. Well, you got to figure like the question of the question is what's the most efficient thing you can do? And sometimes the most efficient thing to do is to give money because they've got they just need money to pay the people who are already there. But sometimes I know I can already think of a thing I could do. I'm not going to say it because I might not fucking do it. Say it, then you will. Yeah, don't say adopt another one. No, I'm not adopting more dogs. But I mean, it would be very easy for me to on the podcast every episode to find a dog and a shelter and like announce that this dog should get adopted. Do it once. See how you feel. What are you going to do, Natasha? I'm going to support you with that dog thing. What does that mean? Support me. What are you going to do? You know what you need to do is you need to get friends who do volunteer work and then have them text you about it. Some people are good at that. I'm not a volunteer leader. I need someone else to point me. They'll be like show up on Saturday for this bus and we're going to go hold babies. I'll be like, oh, I'll go to the bus. But I don't think you need you need a leader of friends like that. What can I oh, but here's a blockage I have about it is I don't want to. It makes me. Sorry, go ahead. No, no, we just we met through a volunteer trip. We became friends through a volunteer trip. What? Oh, that's true. I did do something. What did you do? She does. Oh, my God. I'm remembering this now. What did you do? We went to Africa to help cure malaria. Yeah, what? I saw Natasha. I was supposed to go with Kate and it was like this comedians clear like help with malaria, not cure, but help with malaria. And I ran and I cured it. I dropped out and I saw Natasha in audition and I was like, I'm going to Senegal and like four days and she and Kate just dropped out and she's like, I could do that. And I was like, OK, and I texted them. I said, can Natasha go in Kate's place? And they were like, absolutely. Yeah. And so she went and got all her shots and we went to Senegal. I got like $900 worth of anti-Tuberculosis shots all up in Delmar. Yeah. But the point is, is that I wouldn't have thought of that. I just need like, I think a lot of us need encouragement and community to help. Moshe gives people turkeys on Thanksgiving. He brings them turkeys. I got it. I got to say this. When you said the Natasha Leggero was it fun for the arts? What did you call it? The thing you said? Oh, yeah, that I could give. But I don't have $10 million was the name of it. The Natasha Leggero Arts Fund. I don't know. That is I just doesn't have a great ring to it. It really does. That has a great ring to it. And you know what? I bet you could do something like that right now. You're thinking a million dollars. You don't need a million dollars. I bet you could start something. How do I do it? Don't ask me. I feel like Ebenezer Scrooge after I have Ricky for an hour. I'm going to go volunteer and kill myself. I just can't decide which I swear it's not that deep. It's really I'm not that helpful. It's only occasionally. That's what all of you guys say. It's always like, no, no, it's really not much. Meanwhile, it's like I'm just thinking about like passing people on the street who've asked me for money and I don't have any change. Well, I think you have to do like an organized situation too. And then when I think of what needs it the most, I would think like children and the environment. Those are like the two things that without like the future people and without like clean air and water, it's like we kind of don't have much. Well, I feel inspired. I'm going to figure out something to do. Thank you. I'm going to figure out something too. I will report back report back. I want to know and I'll announce it on the podcast. And if you don't do anything, I'll publicly shame you on the podcast. So very quickly, can you talk a little bit about another period that's coming up? I know that this is like about what season are you in? Three, three in the first episode. We have a women's March and we wrote the episode in September of 2016. Wow. So I had this like crazy experience where we were speaking of Trump. We wrote the whole season, almost the whole season, and we were like, OK, there's going to be a female president and like Guy Branham in our writer's room. He's really smart. He's like, we should be thinking of what the backlash of a female president is going to be. So we were like, you know, our show is a little satirical. So we were really like, you know, mining all of those things. And then all of a sudden he got elected. And so like Comedy Central gave us more time and we finished the sea. We had to kind of rework a lot of stuff. So holy shit, that's crazy. I'm sure a lot of people had that experience, but we've got. Yeah, there's a there's a women's March in the first one. It's a good show. It takes place this season in 1904. It's like if a family of the Kardashians moved into Downton Abbey. Yes, but so much of it is still relevant. Like, you know, there an article just came out like never in history has there been a time where the wealth gap is largest as like the gilded age where our show takes place and now. So we just like come full circle. A hundred years later, the entire century, things were more fair than they are now. And then yeah, well, it's because they didn't have income tax. So people had billions of dollars, you know, until they introduced income tax in 1913. And now people have just figured out legally how to not get out of that. Yeah, they had income tax and antitrust laws. And then women got the vote and things got more fair until now. When how did you guys come up with a show? When was what was the inception of it? When you went to Newport after we got back from Africa. I do a lot of volunteer work. And so Ricky and I went to Africa to cure malaria. All over the paper. Thank you. And so we did that. And then when we were there, it was actually a pretty harrowing experience. And so we were the only women and we would just like talk all night. And like, you know, we were kind of like, you know, it was it was it was very hot. It was very hot. There wasn't food. Like it was like rough. That's where you came up with the idea for another period. Well, no, but we came up with the idea that we wanted to create a show. See, now look at that. You took yourself out of your comfort zone. You put yourself into a sacred place. And God came to you, even though I know you're an atheist now. And you that's trouble. I'm just kidding. God came to you and gave you this show like you or this show bubbled up inside of you because you went into a zone that you normally wouldn't go into. And I do think you're right. I think it's really important to go into these zones. Yeah. But can I say one more thing about volunteering, too? Yes. Because now you made me feel bad. But I also think I also think it's very important to like as much as possible in your personal life to try to like spread joy. Right. And I think that that's something you can't really forget about. Right. You know, like, I don't think it's just about like, you know, feeding all of the unemployed people you can. I mean, obviously, that's important, too. How do you spread joy? How do you what? What does that look like? People, the benefit of the doubt and situations you try to greet people with. I mean, I just remembered, you know, like everyone's talking about that woman from what's her name from three billboards. Fran. Oh, yeah. Frances McDormand. Yeah. I met her once in New York. I was volunteering or I was, yeah, I was a volunteer. I was a volunteer at the Worcester Group, a theater company. And she was so rude to me and she made me feel like such shit. And I was like a budding act, you know, like she could have just like smiled. And I would, it would have meant like so much to me. Yes. And like she was just like, just like a bitch. And maybe I'm sure I have done the same to people. But it's just like just that idea that like, you know, you hold power to like make people feel like shit or make them feel empowered and welcome. Yes. And I think that just little things. That's beautiful. I'm sorry I brought her into this. It's OK. She's just funny because everyone thinks she's so cool. But I'm sure she is cool. Well, at the time she wasn't and look at what happened, it left a mark on you for a very long time. She's not going to win an Oscar. Well, maybe. So it's just a combination. But I love that, too. Because it's really easy to like just start thinking about these grand things like I'm going to try to help the dogs and in LA or I'm going to help solve malaria when meanwhile you you could just as easily you're passing people every day on the street that you could at least generate a little bit of love for. And maybe who knows like who knows the effect that's going to have. So I think it's a combination of both, right? Yes. And also you should watch our TV show, another period. That will help us a lot. On Tuesdays, following Drunk History, a show that you're on this season as well. That's right. Yeah. So they can get they can watch another they can watch Drunk History and then they can watch another period. You guys are the best. Thank you so much. This is an inspiring conversation. I really was. Thank you so much for spending this much time with me. I really appreciate it. Another period. I'll be watching you guys watch it. Save the dogs, cure malaria and follow these people on Twitter so that we can we can get your volunteer accounts. Hare Krishna, thank you. That was Natasha Legerro and Ricky Lindholm.

It is I, Duncan Trussell, and you are listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour Podcast. This episode is a good one, friends. This is a true blazer, and I'm really excited to put it up. We've got Sharon Salzburg here with us today, and Sharon Salzburg is one of the most, I don't know, renowned, as a weird word to put in front of Buddhist teachings because Buddhism is so much about non-ego-related vocabulary, I guess, or not attaching medallions to people, but as an unenlightened person in this world. I would give Sharon Salzburg multiple trophies because she is such an incredible teacher, and so down to earth, and has such a very simple, yet incredibly powerful surgical approach to getting people unstuck and dealing with just the day-to-day issues that all of us inevitably come into contact with, and that's what most of the really great teachers are good at. People who can levitate fruit, or teleport, or walk through walls, or they're not people who have some kind of extrasensory abilities, they're not people who have the stigmata, they're not people who can do magical acts. Usually my experience has been that these people are the most down to earth and have dealt with the very things that all of us are dealing with, but have been taught how to approach them from different angles that many of us haven't thought of, and their ability to articulate that approach in a very simple, yet very usable way is what makes them teachers, and Sharon Salzburg, she's at the top of the charts, she blew my mind in this podcast, and it's really, I can't wait for you guys to hear it. I get really blown away by Buddhism, and by Buddhist teachers, because when they're teaching you, what you're experiencing is not just something happening in language, but you're experiencing this strange ball of healing energy that is emerging from the past and has been transmitted from teacher to student, to teacher to student, to teacher, they call it the disciplic transmission, is one word for it, and whenever you get to come into contact with these beings, whether it's through a conversation, if you're lucky enough to have one with them, or through their writings, or through people who have met them, then you always get this, I can't explain it, but you always get this little magical burst of transcendent energy that they inject into you, and they use language as kind of the box that they store the energy in, as the capsule, or the membrane that surrounds the energy, but the words always become irrelevant compared to the effect that the energy has on you, and in Buddhism, this is the dharma, the dharmic transmission, I guess is what they call it, I'm sure they have a lot of, I'm not going to, I always pretend like I know the names for this stuff, but I'm sure there's a name that they have for it, it's the very same thing that happens when you come across someone who really loves you, and you get that feeling of being loved for a second, it wakes you up to the realization that the universe isn't such a rough and tumble, dreadful, wretched, muddy, old place where everyone's just trying to get an extra punch in before the grim reaper drags them down into hell, you realize that in fact, in the universe, there are parts of the universe, human beings, these compassionate spokes, and a whole different set of gears that runs a whole different kind of universe than the one that you might be accustomed to if you're somebody who tends to get lost and self-hate or hatred of others, or if you're someone who tends to feel despair or like you just can't do this shit anymore, and even if you could do this shit anymore, it's a kind of pointless endeavor anyway, because the whole goddamn thing is just a giant mound of festering pointlessness, and human beings are the flies flying around it and dining on the hopelessness as though there were a delicious steak dinner, when in fact, it's just a kind of existential shit that we're all buzzing around on, and that's one universe you can get stuck in, and these teachers out there, like Sharon Salzburg, they're people who can sort of pull your head out of the toilet bowl, so to speak, and allow you at least momentarily to experience a universe that isn't one where you are soaking in shit water, and that's a very powerful and incredible thing that these people do, and I think that it's a beautiful and wonderful part of the universe, as beautiful and wonderful as sunsets, sunrises, as beautiful and wonderful as the smell of flowers, as beautiful and wonderful as rivers running through mountains, it's the very same kind of, you know what I was looking for there, natural beauty, that's what these people put out, they're human beings who have become possessed with a kind of natural beauty that comes through their teachings, and whenever you get to catch a little taste of it, whenever you get to catch that smell of it, you get the same feeling that you get when you are out in the woods and everything's quiet, except for the wind blowing through the trees and the sound of the birds singing, and this sort of soaring expansiveness and hopefulness fills up your heart, and it feels like this terrible heaviness that you've been carrying around with you is lifted off momentarily, and in that moment of experiencing that kind of spiritual zero gravity state that these people allow you to or teach you to feel or open up for you, you regain the hope that you might have lost if you've been slogging through the muddy fields of delusion, which are so easy to slot to find yourself stuck in, maybe hope's the wrong word for it, maybe what they do is they show you who you really are, which is you are the same thing that is a river flowing through mountains, you're the same thing that is wind blowing through a forest, you're composed of the identical quantum material that makes up all of nature, and nature is beautiful, nature doesn't make mistakes, nobody looks at a sunset and thinks, God, that sunset really isn't working hard enough today, you just think, wow, that's a beautiful sunset, look at the moon, no one looks at the moon and thinks, God, Jesus, it just really seems to have fallen off lately in the way that it's shining up there through the clouds, it used to be so much more connected with its moon-like qualities, you just think it's a beautiful moon, and you're made of the same stuff, and these they're healers, I wonder, I don't think there's much of a difference between a teacher and a healer, and the healing that they do is by helping you just for a second come out of the amnesia that has caused you to forget that you are the sunset and the sunrise and the moon and the mountains and the rivers and the flowers and the muskrats, even muskrats, maybe you're not a muskrat, they're not so cute, I guess they're kind of cute, whatever it is out there, you're the same thing, you're just as welcome to this party as the most beautiful mountain and as the most, as the deepest, most refreshing river and as any other component of nature, you're just as welcome to the party, and instead of moping around in the corner feeling like you don't fit in here, these teachers invite you to start dancing again, and I'm really grateful that they exist, and I'm excited for you to hear this interview, we're going to dive right into it, but first, some quick business. Today's episode of the Dunkin Trussell Family, our podcast is brought to you by Harrys.com. Harrys.com is a company that sells precision engineered razor blades and fancy razor blade handles and super nice shaving cream for about half the price of what you're going to pay if you go to one of those doom drug stores and wait behind a 16-inch plexiglass cage where the overpriced awful razors are sold for a manager to come and with shaking hands unlock it as though he's opening up the Fort Knox to bring out gold bars. Don't go through that crap, go to harrys.com and do yourself a favor and order some nice blades. I don't advertise anything on this podcast that I don't use, and until I started working with Harrys, if I heard the term precision engineered blade, then my ass would tighten up and my ears would shut down as though somebody had poured wax inside of them because it honestly doesn't sound real, but it does make a big difference. Harrys will give you a fancy shave, it's the kind of shave that Prince gets in between recording albums when he has one of his genetically modified sexless shaving drones come and shave his face with blades that were forged in some palace in the Middle East. You can have that same experience without paying the 50 million dollars that Prince pays for his razors and having to genetically engineer a sexless shaving drone. Just by going to harrys.com you can have shipped to your house a really nice box with a really fancy razor in it and for a few minutes a day you could pretend that you are some prince whose body has been coated in a rare kind of cream by your sex slaves and who for a moment is experiencing the glory of fancy shaving.

Salisberg happens to be existing in the time space continuum welcome to the Dunkin Trussell family our podcast Sharon Salisberg hi Sharon welcome to the Dunkin Trussell family our podcast thank you so much for taking the time out of your day to be on the show well thank you for having me um well it's a it's a real honor that you're here you're one of the uh most renowned buddhist teachers in the west I would say and uh it's very exciting for me to get to talk with you um just to get right into it I want to talk with you about dealing with anger because it seems like you have a real deep understanding of what anger is and how to handle it when it pops into your life okay well in uh in Tibetan buddhism they say that anger is that which we pick up when we feel weak because we want to feel strong we think it's going to make us strong and uh within buddhist teaching in general there is a strength to anger that's admitted and spoken about um it's an energy and as an energy plays a very positive role sometimes it helps us make boundaries and have a sense of integrity like this is a violation this is beyond what I can tolerate um sometimes you know how sometimes the angriest people in the room are the most honest it's like everyone else is looking the other way or trying to pretend something isn't wrong and that angry person is saying look there you know yeah uh you know so there's just there could be an honesty to it and certainly an energy we're not passive we're not complacent but it also can be so phenomenally self-destructive as well as of course destructive to relationships and so on they say that anger is like a forest fire which burns up its own support so it can leave us devastated and like a forest fire it can range really wild and and can leave us very far from where we actually want to be because there's also a sort of delusion in anger sometimes it's like if you think about the last time you're really angry at yourself however long ago that might have been and it's not usually a time where you're also thinking you know I made that terrible mistake and I did five great things that very same morning usually those five great things they are gone they have disappeared all we can remember what we actually obsess about is that terrible mistake well they don't you the and that is true and you you know one thing that you uh mentioned in a talk that you gave is that thinking about those five things is like nails on a chalkboard it's a it does there's no emotional resonance especially compared to the overwhelming energy and frequency that comes from uh from from anger because it's such a powerful thing but the thing I this the thing that I'm confused about is anger comes that I I can't really do anything about the initial emotional burst that happens and from my rather lazy approach to meditation and mindfulness I can do a thing where the anger comes and I don't react to it immediately and I think oh look you're you're getting angry so now we're not going to react but it's that place I want to talk with you about because in that kind of liminal spot between the feeling and when you decide how you're going to act this is the place that seems to give birth in in my life to not a compassionate place but more of a kind of phony place where uh it's like I'm angry but I'm going to act like I'm not and so I'm curious what what's the how do you authentically react to an emotion that and I know you you mentioned all these wonderful things that can come from anger my experience with it has been 95 percent of the time it's destructive so I well it is it is very destructive and I think that's an important point the reason I started with the kind of positive parts of it is because it's not that useful to condemn ourselves and to think you know this is all completely screwed up there is an energy there and what we want to do is to be able to utilize that energy without being lost in either the the fixation of the anger like I'm just that mistake or you are just that person who did that thing or get get lost in obsession you know how we like to go over the list of somebody's faults and we just go over it and over it and over it and over it we don't even think of a new fault it's just like the same list yes but we go over it and over it and over it uh so a lot of our life's energy is is kind of wasted in in grudges and resentments and you know it's a very debilitating state so um it's really important to understand we want to capture that energy without condemning ourselves for what we're feeling and without getting lost in the anger so that's the very delicate dance of my phone so I want to say what you described yourself as doing I think is very good and powerful it's not like a it's not like second best because we we cannot control what arises in our minds we cannot and it doesn't mean that when you get really good at meditation that anger will never arise it becomes more porous you know less solid seeming more like the cloud moving through the sky um but it still may arise and the kind of despair that we feel and the self-blame that we feel is really extra because uh you're not going to be able to control it but it's not going to matter in the same way so the first thing is to know what we're feeling as we're feeling it not like 15 consequential actions later you know not after you've gone off to the computer and typed out the email and pressed send and not after you've um you know one of my favorite definitions of mindfulness is uh came from an article in the New York Times many years ago about a private program bringing mindfulness to a fourth grade classroom in Oakland California and uh there were two quotations in it that I especially liked one was they talked to one of the researchers and he said all day long we tell kids to pay attention but we never teach them how and then they asked one of the kids so the kids like in fourth grade he's like nine or ten years old they said to him what is mindfulness what is mindfulness and he said mindfulness means not hitting someone in the mouth that's what mindfulness means and I thought great definition you know because what does that imply it means knowing you're starting to feel angry when you're starting to feel angry right you're that in touch you're that in tune with what's going on within and it also implies actually a kind of balanced relationship to that anger because if you just fall into it you get swallowed up you have no center you have no space from what the varying emotions that come and go are doing then you're going to probably hit a lot of people in the mouth and on the other hand if you hate the anger and you fear it and you you can't stand that it's there and you just get tighter and tighter and tighter and then you explode and anything can happen so we talked about mindfulness is that place in the middle where you know what's happening you can recognize it you're not sucked into it you're also not pushing against it that's like the sweet spot right there yes it's quite magic so every time we feel that anger and we do not act on it it's a conscious choice it's not second best it's saying maybe you know that kid had a moment it's like you created some space with his mindfulness and what you could reflect you know I hit someone in the mouth last week didn't work out that well yes you know yeah let me try this let me try that but but I don't you know it's it's like what you're talking about and what many buddhist teachers are talking about reminds me of the difference between fossil fuel and solar power and most many of us have learned to be fueled by anger and by despair and by the that either hating the self or loathing the self for not being able to control this stuff or loathing the people around us for the very same crime and so it's kind of like you're saying just install solar panels into your into your factory that used to burn the blackest of coal but it's the problem is is once I get the solar panels in I don't know how to run the gears I don't know how to work the machine I don't know how to in that space I don't know how to what to do after that because if I'm so addicted to either you know pointing out what someone has done that's wrong or or thinking oh Duncan you're just an erotic asshole that I don't know the length this length I I don't understand how to do the dance that you're talking I can kind of hear the music I don't know the dance moves and to put it into concrete terms if I'm with somebody and they're doing doing something that's clearly obnoxious or threatening or or whatever and I don't let anger dictate the way that I respond to them then I feel completely lost at sea well that's why we haven't practiced right yeah that's that's why we have a path really truly because I mean of course everything you're saying I think is is totally accurate and it's why in a way it also takes a lot of courage to want to be different and sometimes that courage comes because we've really suffered you know it's like there are anger is a very consequential emotion not the feeling of it but the acting on it you know people destroy a lot through uh through their anger you know the expression of their anger because it's very there's a quality in anger when we're lost in it not just feeling it but lost in it that's also kind of diluted you know we forget so much in that moment it's like um I sometimes tell this story about years and years ago uh when I was first doing email like the very first time and I was trying to do something and something went wrong in the relationship between my computer and my printer and just before then I was online and I actually got an email from somebody who said which was always very exciting and said something like can you tell me something about what the problem with anger was being lost in anger and and I wrote to him and I said you know one of the problems with being lost in anger is that when we're lost in it we just put people in a box and then I got offline I was trying to do this project and that's when something went terribly wrong in the relationship between my my computer my printer and I got really angry and the first person I was angry at was my uh we called them we didn't even have the phrase it then like my computer assistant and I was really angry because I thought well uh you know he was in Hawaii on vacation and I thought he's never here when I need him he's like totally betrayed me he's gone off to Hawaii and then and I forgot in that moment well it was literally true which was that the reason he was on vacation is because I had decided he needed a vacation and the reason he was in Hawaii was because I had gone to the airport and used my frequent flyer miles to get him a ticket to Hawaii it's like I forgot that yes in and just being lost in the moment and I also was really angry at myself like why can't you be the kind of person who can fix these things you never do these kind of things you know why can't you fix it and it was like in the meantime I fixed it you know but I hardly even took a moment to uh appreciate it you know and because I was just so locked in so then I got back up I fixed it I got back up into my chair and I wrote you know my thing and then I went back online and I saw that there was an email from my original correspondent and he said I don't understand what you mean when you say that when you're lost in anger you just put people in a box so then I read to him and I said this is what I just did I put that guy in a box I put myself in a box and so that's the learning you know this is what anger really feels like it's not as strong we don't get as strong as we think we're going to get we don't have as many options when we're lost there that's the learning and we have to learn that again and again and again because then what happens is that you know someone is being obnoxious and there's all this stuff happening and you remind yourself I'm not wrong to feel what I'm feeling but I'm not gonna act on it right now I'm gonna take a breath I'm gonna maybe write out the email and not press send right away but I'm gonna say to somebody I'll get back to you something like that but what if you're sitting in front of them or living with them or what if they're there is no so I'm good at that I'll get back to you thing I can really pull that off and if there was a way when I started feeling angry that I could vanish into some alternate universe and just look at flowers for a few hours and then appear back in the same second I'd be great but man you just you're you're right across from the person you're in that moment with the person in the small scale was someone in your family or someone you live with but in the big scale you know you're somebody in Ferguson staring at police officers dressed like Darth Vader who are statistically very likely to kill you or at least more likely to kill you than most other things in your environment what about those moments because there's no nothing nothing's changing with the with them no matter how peaceful you get well that's true and you know I don't want to be glib about these things it's just that we suffer so much from not realizing we might have alternatives so with your family member you know a lot would depend on what the contract what's the understanding you know do you want to stretch the boundaries there are ways I mean it also depends how vulnerable do you want to be how much do you want to reveal because sometimes underneath the anger is sadness it's disappointment it's frustration it's grief it's guilt whatever and fear and you might perhaps be in a relationship with that person where it's certainly a more authentic form of communication to say I feel uh really disappointed I was hoping for that card you know uh or you know because I wrote this book Real Happiness at Work it comes up a lot in terms of work you know and even though it's a little bit formulaic or feels weird you know to actually it's actually more useful to say you know I really needed that memo to come in by Friday and because it didn't um you know I'm not able to go on vacation and these 15 people are gonna have to work harder you know so I'm really disappointed I think this can't go on it tends to be more useful than you're an idiot you know yes you never get anything done you know but you may not in every relationship want to be that vulnerable and reveal more of what's going on so that's a decision you know like uh in terms of family and sometimes there are a lot of surprises that happen in a really good way when uh you know when we can be more authentic in in those ways and at least we feel you know we don't feel that kind of regret afterwards like I just tried to destroy them I tried to damage them in in some way you know I said what I had to say I was clear and then in terms of Ferguson or some awful situation you know we don't have many models but we have some of people who with enormous courage um really got out there and it's the mistake that people perpetually make that non-violence means passivity and that you're just gonna uh you know take it and it's really not I think if you ask many an activist um kind of living in perpetual outrage is too much you know it's too exhausting it's too debilitating it's like maybe we need the fuel of that outrage um to be active that's the energy right the energy of the anger but you can't just constantly abide in that environment because you're burnt out and so how is the sustained action really really performed you know how do we hang in there um it's like how can you be uh steady how can you be compassionate in a situation where it's not obvious you're gonna be able to fix it yes you know that it can make it all better exactly that is so that what you just said that's the root of the thing for me where where and I guess it illuminates the fact that my whole practice is based on manipulation of my external environment which is pretty but because if it's not gonna get the thing I want then it's like well then why am I doing it really what's the point and yeah well it's not incredible like to have a really big picture of time and and not to be lost in the kind of ordinary frustrations that come because of our impatience like it's got to work out now yes not like not like if I'm gonna do this pause between reacting to whatever the thing is that you did then within the next 10 minutes I want you to transform into a completely different person there you go so it's it's actually it seems like what I'm really doing is just another form of aggression it's not even the thing it's just I'm tricking myself into thinking that this pause that I'm doing is of any merit at all when it really is just uh waiting for someone else to be different well I you know uh let me try to cheer you up I think you're doing better than you think you're doing thank you I mean I wouldn't just miss it you know out of hand in that way because we you know it's step by step and even coming to the pause is a is a very big thing you know to understand the difference between what we feel and and how we respond how we act um that is a very big thing and then we just get wiser and and we have it's one of the reasons we actually need one another we need usually a sense of community um because these things are not always that easy to figure out all alone and like that moment and that pause you know for somebody to say you know like you just said I thought I was really being cool and I you know I thought it was the kind of pause that opened up all this space but really there was a lot of expectation and there allows someone else to notice that about themselves and it's good right yeah it's a I understand the right I love the aspect of buddhism that invites you to not be in a hurry and I've heard various ways of describing how long we're here in this thing and that trying to suddenly become this ideal is just creating more of the same kind of reactions but sometimes it just seems so imperative to make decisive moves decisive actions I I know what you're talking about what what you're saying I can I recognize how powerful it is because it when I really contemplate that idea of of uh not reacting to anger and and being in the moment and not for any other reason than to for my not to change the people around me it makes me feel like when I was a kid sitting at the edge of a high dive or something you know like this that it's terrifying it's terrifying and I know and I want to keep saying not just for me just because I don't want to seem sound like a coward I guess but I'm a comedian I'm friends with comedians and again and again and again I've heard from comedians if I stop being angry I'm done I won't be funny anymore I'm not going to have anything to talk about on stage I'm not going to be able to express myself artistically and something about this it creates the same kind of feeling in me which is it makes me feel powerless I don't understand how power how to be powerful while feeling love I don't know how to how to or compassion it's hard for me to imagine that when I feel love or compassion I feel so desperately vulnerable and so terrified and so it's prone to instantly shutting down and being like well I open myself up to you and you are an asshole so this is what you get I'll never do it again well isn't there I mean uh there are different kinds of humor right and they're not necessarily all fueled by anger they may all be or many of them are fueled by stepping away right by by having another kind of vision and not being caught you know by the ordinary day-to-day kind of obsessive consumerism of life yes and and just the the values of you know that might run our world we have to step away I mean that's what art is right it's it's moving away it's being on the edge in some sense and yes as looking back or looking differently but with a much bigger bigger vision but I mean there's a kind of humor in in just the human predicament right and um and and you know maybe it's ironic humor more than kind of brutal humor but but the irony of being a human being and and this life is pretty funny yes in some way yeah but you know I think maybe what you're saying is also like it's a reflection or something people have asked for a long time which is is like well if I uh a lot of people believe great art comes from anguish and has to come from this tremendous internal suffering and turmoil and yes uh not always so nice for the artist but um right that's right you know and that is a very western way of thinking in the east of course you know you'd have uh you know calligraphy or something you know that you'd have forms of art that really came from a sense of internal harmony and balance and compassion and it wasn't at all felt that states of wisdom and compassion left you not creative you know that's where creativity came from but but Sharon there's no calligraphy channel there's no no one compared to the comedy channel yeah compared to any other walking dead or you know any of the great shows or movies or you know these are like so much of them you could just tell they're so fueled by that anguish that you're talking about it's a very real thing and I you know I was just around a comedian who I consider to be uh one of the one of the funniest comedians working right now I won't say his name uh but he in this weird quick moment uh he uh he said you know if I I just I I just always have to be busy because I'm afraid if I sit still just for a second I'm gonna have to deal with all the shit inside of me and and I I thought yeah yeah you what you did you don't know that you just said you know you just described having a spiritual practice and but but uh you know that moment you look at him and realize how sad this guy is crucifying himself and the result of this crucifixion is truly brilliant comedy that is you know making him not just making him a ton of money but making people laugh so hard so it's that's the fear you know is is there's a real sacrifice in giving up the addiction to the anguish the anger the the negative mood states is is fuel for the way that you behave well I mean it may be a sacrifice it's certainly a transformation yes you know and you don't know what you lose and what you gain until you have that that sense of adventure first of all in buddhist psychology anger and fear can be considered the same mind state they're just two different forms and you know we the angers the outflowing expressive energized form the fears the held in frozen imploding form of wanting to separate from what's happening wanting to strike out against what's happening and and you know we we probably tend to romanticize anger we don't tend to romanticize fear so the way you just described your friend saying I'm afraid of stopping I'm afraid of looking inside you know I'm afraid of really knowing what I'm feeling that's not that inviting you know right uh you know then you think well what would happen if you were in touch if you weren't so afraid if you weren't so bound to the fear you know all kinds of things might happen as a result and and and they don't make you bland you know and just kind of like oh I'm just gonna be conventional and like everyone else I don't see that being overcome by fear by fear is that greatest thing no no I don't either I don't even know what it I mean outside of the times I get to chat with people like you or Jack cornfield or you know people who actually are doing the work you don't come into contact with with it that often I it is fear that is the root of it I know it isn't me for sure there's no question but that the reason I get pissed off if I'm mad at my someone in my family it's because I'm afraid you know generally it's because I'm afraid of the way they're gonna act if I tell them how I really feel or if I'm you know in a relationship and I'm angry it's always because I'm afraid of losing them and I don't I don't want to be alone it's always fear it really is pathetic it because you don't you know anger you get you get a you get angry and it's like yeah that's the angry guy don't mess with him but you never want to be like oh yeah man don't make him don't don't don't do anything that bothers him because he'll just start crying and run they run away in terror or he's just a frightened man no one wants to be a a frightened man is the worst thing to be compared to an angry man you know archetypically there's no frightened men who are heroes the archetypical masculine form is an angry god angry god there's no jahova if we take if we take what you're saying to the to into the into the uh into the into the new old testament this angry god jahova if we're saying that anger is the outflow of fear then that means that jahova the god in the garden of eden obviously prime myth but that means he's a scared god yeah that's wild indeed but you know I understand that that um that way of thinking you know that the uh the loss of that anger that anguish is gonna have us lose our creative edge I just don't happen to think it's true you know oh no I know I you're right you're totally right yeah I get it it just popped into my head now it's so nice to be chatting with you I totally get it of course not of course it wouldn't do any it's just it's just it's a way to avoid dealing with a fear that's all it is bottom line nobody wants to jump into that's I should have told you in the see if I knew what I was talking about in the beginning of this thing I've been like let's talk about fear yeah well that's good let's talk about compassion for oneself okay because that's the other side in a way you know it's like um when I teach meditation which of course is what I do yes uh I emphasize over and over and over and over and over again uh the moment after you've been distracted because let's say let's just say you're using a method like settling your attention on the feeling of the breath it's likely not going to be 9000 breaths before your mind wanders you know it's going to be one can you can you say that again only because it fuzzed out a little bit you said it's settling your attention yeah if you're settling if your method the method of practice that you're using yes is settling your attention on the feeling of the breath something like that or could be a mantra but let's say it's the breath um it's likely not going to be 9000 breaths before your mind wanders it's likely going to be like one or two or maybe four or five and then your mind's going to jump to the past or jump to the future judgment or speculation and then comes a magic moment when you realize oh it's been quite some time since I last felt the breath and that's actually considered the most important moment in the whole process because that's the moment we have the chance to be really different so instead of judging ourselves or blaming ourselves or feeling like we failed we practice letting go and with some compassion for ourselves we practice beginning again and so you might have to let go and begin again 10 billion times in a meditation session and that's not considered a problem that's the actual training but we we're so down on ourselves as a general rule you know oh no my mind wandered I'm so bad you know yesterday I could only be with two breaths today I can only be with two breaths I'm not making any progress and usually people that's one of the hardest things to believe that it actually doesn't matter that we're learning how to forgive ourselves and come back we're learning how to start over it's like a resilience practice in some way and um and we take that or it follows us we're not even conscious sometimes of it but it follows us right into life you know you make a mistake you can bounce back and um you have a big aspiration you lose sight of it you can start over you know that's what we really need because nothing in life is a straight shot you know we're always having to adjust and start over and remember and recover and repair and that's the worst see yeah exactly because eventually you're just like that's it I'm you know I'm just not gonna do it again I'm not starting over anymore because every time I start over the whole thing inevitably collapses that's it I'm just not gonna write I'm not gonna try anything I'm not gonna exercise I'm done exercise or whatever the thing is because every time I get moving just a little bit personally me anytime I get going sure as shit I'm gonna be looking back two months later thinking you might remember when you are meditating every day well you failed again trussle it's and so eventually I get to the place where I'm like well I'm not even gonna fool myself into thinking that I do this anymore because every time I get going I stop and what you're saying is that is actually the practice too that's right that is the path right there because uh it's true for everybody it's just not going to be a straight shot and so um being able to realize that that's normal it's what one of my teachers once called exercising the letting go muscle say that exercising the um you know we let go we start over we we say sometimes the healing is that we exercise the letting go muscle and the healing is in the what the healing is in the return oh wild that is wild wow that is so sweet that's the answer for sure oh that is the answer wow I just get so frustrated that I wow that is really cool yeah because I just you know I end up just wanting to give up because I know I know well people do end up wanting to give up but that's why uh I think we need a different perspective because it's not just comforting it's true yeah yes no of course yeah no it is it is very true but it just just hearing it just it makes me feel this like it just it's really I can't even describe how good that feels huh yeah because it's exhausting though I mean the mindset that I have is exhausting because you you sort of just start looking at this like you know ladder that you're supposed to be climbing or you're the some path the process whatever it is and you always get up to a certain rung and then sure enough you just slip back down and you're screaming at somebody or you're you know just like exactly what you you're saying you're just lost you're not even not even anywhere just sort of just this swirl of static this thing that's just this kind of state of like not a nausea not to get too existential there's this sense of like ugh you're just gone and what you're saying is that that moment where you're back just for a second yeah sorry I don't mean to just be sort of stammering but you definitely just blew my mind well I mean I think that that is the moment and we give very little appreciation to it the moment we come back we don't recognize that's a big deal to be able to come back that's a huge transformation for most of us right yeah right and that's compassion yes that's compassion and it's essential because that's the way to get something done that's the way to make a change that's the way to uh really have an endeavor you know like make something happen because it's always going to be up and down it just is and and you know we feel so much like we failed when we have it it's just a natural part of the process it's like it's like there's this you're a there's a room in your house where you that you know you need to clean and you keep shutting the door in that room because you don't even want to look in there because the amount of work that you know that you've got to do and anytime you start if you don't know that thing that happens where you like start cleaning I don't know if this happens to you it happens to me I smoke too much marijuana so when I'm clean when I'm cleaning inevitably you'll find like an old letter from somebody and then you pick up the letter you start reading the letter and and feeling all this emotion for that person and then that will lead you to um going to find a picture of them or some other sentiment the next thing you know four hours is past you're playing video games because you didn't want to feel why you were cleaning you know and then by then it's like you know I'll just leave the place a mess and this this thing that you're talking about reminds me of that and instead of just being the idea is that once you come once you are oh shit I'm playing video games I'll just get back to cleaning you don't you don't then think like what's wrong with me why can't I just clean the damn house what's my problem I'm distracted I've ADD or something you actually realize like oh no this moment of realizing that I got lost again is that's the experience of the healing energy of the universe mm-hmm exactly hmm how often do you get lost well I get lost a lot I don't smoke any mirror whenever but there are a lot of reasons we get lost I mean really uh but that's the I mean if I was gonna say people will ask all the time because I've been meditating over 40 years now and people say you know what's changed what's different and the truth is that that's what's different is that there's so much more kindness toward myself and toward others and and I can just see yes you know like we all make mistakes we all uh can recover we can come back and that's the that's the miracle yeah that that yeah if somebody comes out of a coma just for a second the people aren't going to be like you are asleep you lazy asshole you sleep too much exactly so why do that to yourself it's that's a very good point just the fact that you even get these brief moments of waking up for a second that's glorious because you're it's just probably very is is is enlightenment the state of not falling asleep anymore like that of not going not losing your footing on reality or is that what in light an awakened person is that's my guess if you ever come in contact with an enlightened being I feel like I have I mean they they would say no no you know but um I feel like I have that being certainly the more enlightened than I you know or they would say more than light than they used to be so I trust that and I think that's um you know it's it's very genuine and you know people are extraordinary made extraordinarily loving and compassionate and wise people when did you realize that you were going to be a teacher well I realized I was going to be a teacher uh I'm not sure I even realized it I had one of those extraordinarily loving wise enlightened compassionate teachers who was a woman named Deepa Ma which is a kind of nickname for Deepa's mother and um she was a person she was like a model both for me because uh I'm sorry you fade it out for one second she was like a what she was like she was like a model for me okay because she um uh she had a life of tremendous personal suffering and she emerged from it with this amazing kind of compassion for everybody like she's been she was a Bengali woman she'd been placed in an arranged marriage when she was 12 years old and uh she and her husband actually fell very deeply in love which didn't always happen but um then they they didn't have children for about 18 years and then they had three children and two of her children died um and then uh they were living in Burma she and her family at that point her husband was in a civil service and he wasn't feeling well one afternoon and came home and died by that night so she was completely overcome by grief and they said she developed a heart condition too so um just overcome and she went to bed she couldn't get that she didn't have the strength to get out of bed uh the doctor came and he said to her you're actually gonna die of a broken heart unless you do something about your mind she said you should learn how to meditate and so she still had Deepa the the one daughter to raise so she got out of bed and she went to the meditation center to learn how to meditate and he said that she was so weak that she actually couldn't get up the stairs to go into the actual meditation room so she crawled to get up into that room and she she learned how to meditate and she she used her meditation practice both to experience a state of peace and uh she just emerged with this enormous enormous compassion for everybody and so she was one of my teachers so in 19 i'd gone to india in 1970 i did my first meditation retreat in january of 1971 that's where i met like krishadas and ramdas and all these people and um in 19 and then i came back i'd gone to school i came back finished school went back to india and in 1974 i was leaving india for i was totally convinced was going to be a very very brief period of uh coming back to the states and just doing things i needed to do before i could go back to india and live there for the entire rest of my life wow so i went to see deeper march was living in calcutta uh to say goodbye and get her blessing for what i was sure was this extremely extremely brief period and and uh she said to me when you go back you'll be teaching my friend joseph ghost you had already come back maybe six months before so she said you'll be teaching with joseph and i said no i won't and she said yes you will and i said no i won't and she said yes you will and i said no i won't and then she said two things that were really amazing one was she said you really understand suffering that's why you should teach and it's true i'd had you know life not like hers but you know like a childhood certainly a lot of turmoil and uh difficulty and and i never really thought of it as kind of a credential for helping others but of course it is yeah um she said you really understand suffering that's why you should teach and then she said you can do anything you want to do it's just you're thinking you can't do it that's going to stop you and i left her her room thinking no i won't and i came back to the states and um joseph was at that point europe institute just opened up in bolder colorado and joseph was there with rhombus and a bunch of people and uh i ended up in bolder and joseph and i started teaching together and every time i thought oh you know it's the jack you know that's where i met jack was in bolder and um jack cornfield jack cornfield yeah so i thought oh it's just just for a little while then i'll go back and it's just for a little while and i'll go back and then hello one day i realized oh i'm not actually my life now so i'm sorry sharon you're fading out a little bit okay so where did you lose me um well you i let i lost you right when you were thinking i'll just be i'll be going back what you know i'll be going back soon and then it faded out yeah so i you know joseph and jack and i would would respond to these invitations and i would teach and every time i thought i'll go back to india soon yes uh and then one day i kind of woke up and i thought oh i'm not going back you know i'll go back to visit but this is really my life now and that's how i became a teacher it's kind of the the very old fashioned way you know through my own teachers yes yeah and that's probably that's got to be the right way um uh and and when you're doing kind of what you just did with me is there that what is coming through what is that is that considered the dharma that's coming what are they what are they what would your teacher say is coming through a person when they open somebody up or help a person get a little unstuck yeah sure it's a total blessing for me to be able to do it and it's the dharma coming through and do you feel like a conduit when that's happening do you feel something or is is there i do yeah i do can you just it's not about me you know i don't feel like what clever thing can i say that will make a difference it's it's not like conscious you know it's not even strategic it's just uh getting more open where is that energy coming from that's coming through you when you when you do things like that what what is that i think of it as the dharma you know i don't think of it so much in personal terms though i suppose i could think of it in terms of lineage or you know generations of teachers but mostly i just think of it as is a kind of truth that's available to all of us and sometimes we're in a box and we can't quite access it all on our own that's why we all you know we we do i'll come back to we all kind of need one another uh well you are i'm very glad that you did not stay in india sharing and i'm very thankful uh for you for for giving me this interview and uh it's

Greetings to you, my sweet, pulsing, energetic blob of glorious organs, meat, and water. I'm so happy that you're here with me. This is the Duck at Russell Family Hour podcast. And if you're like me and you're somebody who loves all the weird stuff, UFOs, pyramids, conspiracy theories, mud, flood, multiverse simulation theory. The list goes on and on. I could probably go on. You know what? Let's see how long I can go. Listing weird theories, and I get to start over. UAPs, UFOs, government retrieval programs, pyramids, ancient civilizations, mud, flood, illuminati, the reptilian, Rothschilds, hollow earth theory, structures on the moon, the insolatists, Saturnian, satanic cults, ball, baffa, mystical, hidden orders of benevolent, clerics attempting to upshift global consciousness, visitations from aliens, Crowley's encounter with a gray parallels in Tibetan Buddhism to current events in UFO history. The resurrection of Christ, the nostic interpretation of the resurrection of Christ, dangers of fluoride in the water, Chernobyl as a siop's to cover up something within the Chernobyl region. I just made that one up, but why not? Baffamette, the coming matreia? Okay, that's where I'm at right now. Just a list of subjects that I'm interested in and that will definitely grab my attention if I see any post related to those subjects on reddit conspiracy or wherever else I go to slurp up my outside of default reality data sets. The point is, this is one of my favorite contemplative pastimes. Maybe that's not a good thing, but it's the way I am. And so as someone who loves these things, and I know all of you out there who also love these things are probably somewhat delighted witnessing the shit show that is currently happening thanks to the whistleblower program that has been set up to allow private contractors to come forward with any data they might have regarding information related to the unidentified aerial phenomena that we have all been witnessing over the last few years, a couple of years. I mean, for some reason they decided to change it from unidentified flying objects to unidentified aerial phenomena, which is obnoxious to say the least. I don't like people like that. Somebody just wanted to like, I don't know, reclaim UFOs. Maybe there's too much stigma attached to UFOs. Maybe that was the idea, but the point is, thanks to this whistleblower program, we have all of these private, these people coming forward. Not all of them worked for private contractors. And most recently, one of them worked for the US government and some kind of faction of the US government that was investigating UAPs. And this person has come out and stated that, yeah, we have wreckage. We've got smashed UFOs. We've got non-smashed UFOs. These are my words, not his. We have big UFOs, small UFOs, pretty UFOs, ugly UFOs. We've got wreckage. And not just that, we've got pilots, we've got alien bodies. Maybe some of them are still alive. You didn't say that, I don't know, we just said pilots, which is hilarious. Now what's interesting about this is that it's not being met with the usual level of debunking that you often see, and coinciding with it, are all of these debriefings that have been happening with government officials not just from our country, but from other countries. So, this is fascinating in the sense that we're not looking at like third-hand reports. We're not hearing whispers of people who claim that private contractors have these crafts, have figured out how to reverse engineer these crafts. These are not the weird stories you hear about US presidents who had knowledge of these things, deathbed confessions. This is coming from someone who just worked in a government program that was an IS trying to understand what the fuck these things are that we're suddenly seeing all over the place. Now even if this person did not come forward, I keep saying this person because I'm too lazy to Google search his name. David, I keep wanting to say David Grohlsch, but isn't that a famous drummer? I'll look it up right now. Let's see, UFO whistle, blower, grush. His name's Grush. It's all over the place. You can just Google search UFO at this point. David Grush, a former intelligence official who led analysis of unexplained anomalous, not aerial anomalous phenomena. Now I get why they changed it. Some of it's not flying, I guess. Some of it's under the water. David Grush, a former intelligence official who led analysis of unexplained anomalous phenomena within the U.S. Department of Defense Agency, caused headlines around the world with this assertion that the U.S. had been collecting non-human craft for decades. That prompted the U.S. House of Representatives to announce an investigation into Russia's allegations with a hearing on the issue expected to be announced in the next few weeks. But skipping a little bit. Crush's whistle-blowing claims have grown more dramatic after he has emerged into the public eye and are now facing growing skepticism. After initially telling the debris website, the government had possession of intact and partially intact alien vehicles. He's gone on to suggest the US has also encountered malevolent alien pilots. Now, malevolent is a strong word. Experts and you have a lore, has suggested his assertions should be taken with the grain of salt, question the veracity of his claims, and demanded proof. He is not presented anything like the evidence that we would expect to believe something as extraordinary as this said Garrett Graff, a journalist, and who's an historian, who's upcoming book, UFO. The inside story of the US government search for alien life here and out there will be published in October. There's no firsthand knowledge. He didn't see these things himself. He didn't touch them. He wasn't part of the operation to retrieve them. And we haven't heard from anyone who was. Well, you know, that's a pretty harsh criticism. But fair enough, until we set eyes on the damn thing, we should be skeptical. That's healthy. That makes sense, a little boring. But what are the benefits of having security clearance, having the resume of working for the DOD in a really weird department? What are the benefits outside of some fleeting temporary UFO fame? What are the benefits of coming forward as a whistleblower at that level? Maybe I'm just an idiot and can't figure it out. Like a book deal, I guess there's some financial benefit, but surely there's equal if not more financial benefit to maintaining your security clearance and getting like a job with a private contractor. Surely. I mean, what's the point? Why would you do that? Doesn't make sense. And again, if this were just one person, you know, I think his critique would be more powerful, but the problem is we have multiple whistleblowers coming forward now. I talked about it on the Jeremy Corbell episode of this podcast. You should listen to it if you haven't yet. And Jeremy talked about it. Lots coming forward, lots coming forward, not just one. So UFOs aside, just as like a cultural phenomenon, just as a fascinating blast of novelty. This is incredible, just that alone. Even if for whatever reason this guy thought it would make sense to destroy any hopes he would ever have of getting a job again with like security clearance access. Even if he's just lost his mind, maybe he like somebody gave him bad toad venom. Maybe he went to a bad spiritual retreat. He lost his fucking mind and just he's having a manic episode or something. Even if no one had come forward to support who he was, not his claims, which has happened. It's still wild. It's wild that on top of all the other weird shit going on in the world, the planetary civilization must now contend with an increasing number of leaks related to the existence of aliens. I mean, that by itself is wild and maddening. To me, if you wanna go meta on all the stuff that's been happening, including the pandemic, what is it all having common? And to me, it's confusion. It all has confusion and common. The pandemic was confusing. It was frustrating the way that information was changing, the way that information was coming out that would seemingly negate prior information and then go back to affirming that information. I mean, you had, I think Fauci was saying, like, yeah, we don't masks. Don't want really going to work too. You just wear masks to the studies that came out. They're like, masks don't really work. All the stuff, the weird quality of confusion, the specific quality of confusion, seems identical in the sense that with a pandemic, with COVID, and even with the conflict happening between Russia and the Ukraine, information right now, it's almost as though there's multiple timelines coexisting. On one timeline, Russia is winning. On one timeline, the vaccines help. On another timeline, Ukraine is winning. On another timeline, vaccines are poison on one timeline. The US government has wreckage on another info timeline. It's project blue beam. On another info timeline, it's just lies coming from fame seeking whistleblowers. That to me is like the direct experience of this stuff. It all has, in common, whatever the particular historic moment is, is almost irrelevant compared to the confusion that it will instill in you if you get too caught by it. It's confusing. You have what is obviously some kind of arm wrestling match happening between people who are attempting to shape the narrative, who are attempting to get their version of reality out into the world. And where it gets really weird is we shouldn't be saying version of reality. It should just be something more related to like this is reality. There's just one reality. But no, it's as though some kind of bullet had been fired into the windshield of default reality and all these cracks are appearing. And it's confusing. So have some compassion on yourself. You're not alone. If you feel completely confused, frustrated, overwhelmed because you have been grabbed by this. And why wouldn't you be? Why wouldn't you be grabbed by a whistleblower saying, we have alien crafts? And why wouldn't you be grabbed by the videos of these senators post private debriefing when they are in the hallways and they tell us to lock our fucking doors? I don't know if you saw that with Senator Ted Kennedy, but it's not exactly comforting, even if he is being tongue in cheek. And again, I'm fully comfortable with my lack of journalistic integrity. I didn't go to school to learn to do that. And I am easily, easily tricked, sadly. them easily, easily tricked, sadly. Often sending out pictures and memes that someone is like, that's 100% bullshit and showing me why. So I admit it. I'm not ashamed to admit that. It's easy to get tricked. Sometimes it's fun to get tricked. But truly, if there's anything in the news cycle right now, worthy of your attention, worthy of contemplation, worthy of your own personal exploration of why right now. It's this stuff Why right now Maybe my naive idea is that they have so much control over the outflow of data that they release it intentionally You know, so there is no that why is just because this is when it happened It's like asking why right now did a bird shit on your head? It wasn't a conspiracy. The bird had to shit. Your head was in range of it's shit. I mean, maybe that's the problem. Like the US government, the federal government has been so good at projecting this aura of control that anytime stuff like this comes out, you assume it's intentional. They are intentionally dripping weird information into our brains with some mysterious motive behind that. And when in fact, it's just courageous people who are sick of holding on to secrets that have the potential to completely, permanently alter our paradigm regarding who we are and are we alone in physics. It could just be, this is the thing. This is the thing that like we knew would eventually happen. You stay on the planet long enough, you get born in the right timeline, you see the ships, they come by every once in a while. They don't care about who the government is. They don't care about which monkey descendants have have the gavel. They just come back and do whatever the fuck they do. And that's a little creepy to think about. Or it's just a sign that we have too many cooks in the fucking kitchen. It's just a sign that once you like create like bizarre aspects of the federal government and then fragment those departments, separate people, control the flow of information to the point where people who need to share information can't, then you could just expect shit like this. You could expect people who got confused regarding what they heard coming out. Or you could use the useful idiot model. I don't know if you've heard that or not. I think it's a Russian propaganda model, which is leak crazy information to people knowing that they will spread that information and you won't be in the crosshairs as the messenger. I don't know what it is but I love it. Bottom line, I love it. What is more exciting? I mean the last time That we got even close to this was Roswell Which was very quickly debunked as a weather balloon now with what this was a blower saying we have to rethink all the stuff You have to go back all the way through Every UFO abduction you've heard about every fucking UFO story you've rolled your eyes at. You have to go back and if somehow these hearings are actually effective or if because this guy had the guts to come out and say he'd been told this stuff, other people come out. So you get like a kind of me to movement situation, but for UFOs, then one of the delightful things we're all going to be able to do is go back and look at all the stuff that was intentionally debunked. It was fraudulently debunked. We get to debunk the debunkers. We get to go back and say, oh shit, maybe that was real. Fuck, maybe you're as well really was a, an alien ship. Think about all the cattle mutilations, the crop circles, the abductions. I mean, again, it's a thought experiment, but if by some bizarre miracle, all this stuff turns out to be true, I Think there is going to be so much anger From people so much anger at being misled It being told that the sophisticated mindset in relation to UFOs u a p's Was to instantaneously not believe What people are saying if they were talking about UFOs. Oh, they're crazy. They're having a manic episode. They want attention. They're full of shit. That's not real. They couldn't be real. How could that be real? We would know by now. No one takes good pictures of these things. How come there's no real pictures? Where's the pictures of the wreckage? It's all bullshit. Complete lies. Those people are going to feel embarrassed and angry probably when they realize that they were misled intentionally by a relatively small group of people, probably in the military industrial complex, who had some dark motivation for keeping this information from the rest of us. Maybe that's the thing. It's kind of like, I don't know if you have that thing happen where someone texts you and you forget to text them back, but two days have passed and you're like, fuck. Now if I text them back, I seem like such a dick. My options are, I tell a lie and I'm like, oh shit, sorry, I missed your message, but you didn't, you saw it. Or you just text him back, like, and apologize and just feel like an asshole for not texting back, or you just don't, if you're me, don't, because you get into this neurotic paralysis. And so then, by then, a month is passed, now you definitely can't text them back. Now you really seem we are texting someone back after a month. And this can go on forever. Maybe we're looking at that, but with UFOs. Maybe they're just like, shit, we can't tell them now, because we should have told them two years ago. They're gonna be fucking pissed. So just don't tell them, we'll keep it a secret forever. I mean, probably there is some legal implications too, right? Like, again, thought experiment. The whistleblower is telling the truth. Maybe there's like some real like like ways people could go to jail for hiding this information from us. I don't know, but enjoy it. Now there's lots of other UFO stuff going on. I will not ear be you about the Las Vegas UFO gray encounter, but I would invite you to Google search that and specifically to watch the video, the kid who saw this thing posted, it's so weird and so funny on one level and then just so strange. You know what it reminds me of? A low-budget, found footage movie. That's what it feels like. When you're watching that video, it feels like all of this. Feels like you're watching Act One in some kind of found footage movie about an alien invasion. That's what it feels like. That's why it's so surreal, because we've encountered different versions of this except in the movies. We've encountered different versions of this on TV shows. I mean, why is a kid V? Oh my god. Did you guys see V? Whoa, it was so cool. Just all of a sudden these big ships appeared over the cities of the world. They didn't do anything. They just kind of hovered there for a while, freaking everybody out. And then, you know, there's a whole dumb story about it, but the point is, this has been in the zeitgeist, just in the fiction part of the zeitgeist. And so to see manifestations of the exact scenarios that we've seen in movies, it's a little off-putting. It's surreal. My brain can't really accept it. And I think a lot of people can't accept it and just don't want to deal with it, which is why don't do what I've been doing. Don't ear beat your partners, your wives, about this too much if they're not interested. If they don't want to hear it, even though you want to. They just, some people, they're just, they got other fucking fish to fry. That's another wonderful explanation for why not to release this stuff. Maybe there's just a general understanding by sociologists working for the federal government that there's not going to be a real net positive from people shifting into a cosmology that involves extraterrestrial civilizations. I mean, it's not their place. Truth is truth. If it's upsetting, it's supposed to be upsetting. And the upset theoretically helps you evolve as a person or a planet. But maybe that's it. There's like, yeah, okay. For you, maybe, but not for everybody. For some people, this could completely drive them permanently nuts. Some people won't be able to function in society anymore. If they have to deal with the reality that we're just one tiny part of an ever-growing galactic civilization and that we're getting invited to join it right now. Some people might not like that. A lot of people might not like that. I mean, to me, if you ask me, it's a hell of a lot better than like we're completely alone in the universe, which by the way, it seems much more improbable, much more improbable than there could be aliens. But who knows? I'm no sociologist. I'm no cultural anthropologist. Is that even a thing? Maybe this is supposed to be private information for a reason. And the reason isn't because they're trying to reverse engineer this stuff so that they can create a superior military. I mean, come on. Why would they want to do that? No. We all know the truth. Most of the time, the US government, when it makes decisions, it's for us. It has nothing to do with making money or power. So probably the reason they haven't shared this information with us is because they want to protect us, because we need to be protected, because we need to be kept safe. And a nice circumference of truth, and separated from truth, they could upset our poor little human lives. Did you give us gas? And then the government will come and have to burp us. We don't wanna get burped by Uncle Sam. That's not gonna feel good. Uncle Sam putting you down on his knee or throwing you over his shoulder, smacking your back with his big, thick, calloused hands. We have a wonderful podcast for you today. Returning guests. Rom Dave. This was a member of the Rom Doss Satsang, as we call it, the communities. Friends with Rom Doss, he was fortunate enough to hang out with Neem Crowley Baba, the great guru that you are probably aware of if you're at B here now, and I love our conversations. He runs a foundation called the Living Dying Project, which I would invite you to check out. It's not hospice in the sense that hospice is a lot of what hospice does, is just getting you ready to die comfortably, taking care of the families of the dying people. Hospice is incredible. This is a foundation that helps dying people live while they're still here. Teach us a mindfulness practice and spiritual techniques that allow people to fully spend whatever amount of time they have left in the human realm in a way that maybe isn't so marred by anxiety and fear and guilt and all the things that go along not just with life, but the end of life. So he's been working with dying people for a very long time and anytime you run into people who have made that their lives work, you inevitably encounter a beautiful wisdom, a kind of expansive consciousness that comes from someone really experiencing every day the reality of our limited time and our human bodies here on Planet Earth. Also, he's just funny, I love him. So we're gonna jump right into that, but first this. This episode of the DTFH has been sponsored by Better Help. Listen, why are you putting off therapy? I know what, I know what you're putting off getting therapy. You're putting off getting therapy in the same way. You put off going to the gym or any other thing that you know will improve your life. But you're gonna have to do a little bit of work for that improvement to happen. And therapy, what's so cool about it, is it is work. Every time that I go to my therapist, there is a moment, there's a pause, I'm like, yeah, I'm gonna cancel the day. I don't know if I wanna take a submarine down into the subterranean depths of my consciousness today. I don't know if I want to confront the demons, bats, warlocks, prants around down there. But what's awesome about therapy is, there's this alchemical thing that happens where those demons, warlocks, and bats get transformed into angels. You're free to them. Not free to them in a sense that you gotta emulate them or throw them into some kind of deeper pit, but somehow just by confronting them, seeing them, knowing they're there, they change. It's something that isn't sinister anymore. If you're thinking of starting therapy, you should give better help a try. It's entirely online, designed to be convenient, flexible, and suited to your schedule. You just fill out a brief questionnaire, you get matched with a licensed therapist, and you can switch therapists any time and for no additional charge. That is a part of therapy. Sometimes you do have to like find a therapist who is right for you. Some therapists are good for some people, not good for others. Better help makes that easy. Find more balance with BetterHelp.

If you have to fly from Afghanistan, you should come to these shows. This is the last standup show, standup weekend. I'm gonna be doing for a few months because after that I'm going on paternity leave. So to speak, I just have to be here. I can't be out on the road if Aaron, my wife, has the baby. Not cool, not cool to tell my daughter. I missed her birth because I was performing stand-up. It's a weird story. You got to be there. I want to be there. So taking some time off from going on the road, that being said, if you live in Austin, I will have some shows coming up at the mothership that you can come see me at. And you can check the website for that. Now, everybody, please open your third eyes, stretch out your heart, chakra, since some sweet beams of perfect love light out into the cosmic, mycilial mystical web that connects all of us to today's guest feels all you love. Welcome back to the DTFH Ramdev. I do, I will, I do, take care of you. I love you, I love you. It's the Duncan Trash, the William, the William, the William, Ramdev, welcome back. Yeah. How you doing off mic, you were telling me, you just finished your book. So this is a great day of a celebratory day. How are you feeling? Yeah. Well, about 30 years ago, I was teaching a workshop with a friend of mine who was a writer and he had a book agent who was the Polish Pope's book agent. And she said to me, I'd never met somebody who was such a good book in them who hadn't written the book as you. And that was 30 years ago. So I finally wrote it. It's been kind of over my shoulder there for a really long time. What's the name of the book? It's called Life in a Body. Ah, subtitle. Subtitle. How to live your life so you can die without fear? Well, I mean, I would, one thing I love about what you teach and practice is just, you know, it helps me recognize that probably the way I'm doing right now is how I'm going to die, right? It's as simple as that. Like, if you're living every day with some level of fear, some level of anxiety just under the surface, why would you think it's going to be any different when you die? Well, because what the first thing that happens when you die is you realize you're not your body. One of the big difficulties is it seems like you're in Texas and I'm in California. Yeah. And we're two separate people and we've got these bodies that are going to die. One of the big difficulties is it seems like you're in Texas and I'm in California. Yeah. And we're two separate people and we've got these bodies that are going to die. But at the same time, if you look at your hand, your body is an object. Yes. But to say you're not the body is obviously ridiculous at the same time. You can look in a mirror and there's somebody there. But what I'm saying is that there's these two levels of reality. Relative reality where we're separate, we got a body, we suffer, we die, we elect Donald Trump, we do all these things. And there's another level of reality where it's all one. Maraji said, I'm always with you, we said, somebody asked him, is the world real? He says it's completely real. It's completely false and it's both at the same time. Most people are lost and it's completely real. And when you die, one of the first things you see that it's not completely real. Like during a nerdy death experience, if somebody's been blind all of their life, they can see what's going on at the site of the accident or the operating room or whatever. Interesting. If they've got like tons of narcotics in their bloodstream because of a surgery, analgesic medication, it's not affecting their consciousness. They're not the body. So that one way of looking at spiritual practices we're preparing to die by identifying more with who we really are than with all of our conditioning. And who we really are is pure consciousness. Round us at the end of his life was always saying, I am living awareness, right? Or loving awareness. Loving awareness, right? That's what I meant. I know. You got it. Living awareness ain't bad though. Yeah, so like Gandhi when he was assassinated, somebody pumped three bullets into him and he was falling over, he said, Ram Ram Ram, the name of God. Right. And he didn't say Ram Ram Ram because he was shot. He said, Ram Ram Ram because he was shot. He said Ram Ram Ram because he was always saying Ram Ram Ram and dying was another moment of Ram Ram Ram. Right. Right. So when Kennedy got shot, he probably wasn't saying Hail Mary or something like that. He was like, what the hell was that? I don't think he was saying anything. His brains were splattered all over the car. I'm pretty sure he was just out. There's still one second there. Anyway, I just say it for sure. were splattered all over the car. I'm pretty sure he was just out. That's the second there were anyway. I was just saying for sure. So a lot of people wonder what is the difference between this kind of realignment with non-embodied consciousness and disassociation. What's the is there a difference between the, what you're talking about and what causes a lot of people anxiety if they happen to experience it, which is a sense of unreality, a sense of no longer being connected to the body, a sense of maybe not being anything at all other than some kind of awareness. Some people find that to be a really unnerving experience that happens during horrible experiences they're having. Like almost an evasion of reality. Right. I got an email from a guide just last week saying I took your online course. I really liked it a lot. Plugged there. We got an online course on our website. But he said, there was a guided meditation in your course. And at the end of the meditation, I got to this place where I wasn't me. There was just, there was nobody and it was really kind of scary, right? So whether you get there through meditation or whether you get there through a dissociative experience or something, it can be really difficult because you're not who you thought you were. Traditionally, however, these practices to take you into this boundless spaciousness are only done after a lot of mindfulness and a lot of compassion practice. So that the way into this spaciousness is through an open heart rather than if you just get dropped in there through serendipity or a random guided meditation or a drug or something like that, it's like so discontinuous from all of your assumptions that it can really be a freak out thing, right? It was my, one experience I had on drugs with it was the opposite, which was, I mean, as I recall, I start remembering, I remembered I was doing something. So I'm thinking, what was I doing? I was doing something. I was, oh, I'm human. Oh, I was being human. Oh, I'm human. It was such a bummer to go. And whatever the state I was in, you know, I, the only way that I knew that I was no longer that state was, you know, when I started coming back into my, started coming back into my current incarnation. And I was not excited about it. I was a real bummer, kind of. I didn't want that. I mean, it was going from some kind of beautiful, very earthy consciousness where there was no body to this hairy thing. And I didn't like it much at all. I mean, so is this a product of age? Maybe it's the younger people who are more freaked out by no longer being their body. maybe older folks, older we get. That's such a great way to start a paragraph. The Buddha say you could get away saying almost anything about it. Anything. But the Buddha say that this earth has the perfect amount of friction to wake up. If we're harder, nobody'd want to do it. If we're easier, nobody would want to do it, right? Right. But yeah, it's a job to drag around the body and have a personality in all this childhood conditioning and all that kind of stuff. But at the same time, there's this great line by Rumi where somebody's complaining to God, hey, I'm praying and I never hear back from you. God says in the poem, the yearning you cry out from is the return message. So feeling that sense of my body is like having on two types of a shoe and I really don't like it, that sense of resistance and friction and uncomfortable is exactly what's driving us to want to figure out who we really are beyond that. It reminds me of things I've heard about regarding the experience in the womb, which gets increasingly uncomfortable, apparently, for the kid. You know, at first, you're floating around in there. There's lots of room, and then it gets tighter and tighter. As you grow, the tighter and tighter and tighter, until finally, at some point, I guess you're like, fuck this, pull whatever cord, baby's pulling there. I know it's not a literal cord, but that's how I fantasize. It is a birth cord and then out you go. But it reminds me of that. I don't see any reason it wouldn't be like that. I don't see any reason. The assumption is we go from a womb into final reality. Like this is it. But I don't see why we don't go from womb to womb to womb. I can jump in. It's like the same. But the big difference is when you're in the womb, you can't stay there. You got to get out. Right? Yeah, well, you can't stay here either, can you? But, but you don't get to what we're saying is that you can pull that cord before you leave the body. When you're in the womb, you're in the womb and nine months comes or whatever, and then it's time. I mean, like organically, you've got to leave. But what we're saying is like St. Paul in the Bible says, die before you die. Can you pull the cord before you leave the body? Can you dunk an N.E. Ramdev right now pull the cord so that when we're together? Yeah, we get this thing that there's two bodies and we're having a conversation and it's gonna be a podcast. And there's just this one, this one thing. Like these three guys just got a Nobel Prize for quantum entanglement, Nobel Prize in Physics, which essentially says there's only one thing. The universe, one song, there's only one. And that's going on at the same time as there's the two of us, and all of the separation and the duality. Can we pull the cord dropping into that spaciousness? So like Ramdha said, he had this metaphor that spiritual life is like jumping out of an airplane, and part of the way down realizing it's okay, because I mean, part of the way down realizing, hey, because I mean part of the way down realizing hey, I don't want to run a parachute right and yeah really scary but then further the way down realizing it's okay because there's no ground Yeah, yes, I know in that moment Go Well, no, please continue. I'm sorry to cut you off. Then I'll make whatever point I was trying to make. Yeah, so I'm just saying that... That yeah, we suffer, yeah, we have a body. And it's like pulling the cord you want to get out, but the baby doesn't have much choice. He's pushed out when nature tells him, we have a choice through practice, through introspection, through devotion, through surrender. To get out before nature says it's time to get out of the body. Like we're practicing dying, we're practicing the pulling the cord moment to moment day to day. Right. This is, you know, what I love about, like a mindfulness practice is, or my mindfulness practice, it's, it gets really interesting. At first, it's, at least for me, it was very, it's quite confusing. And then you start getting these little glimpses of what you're talking about. And those glimpses seem astounding, at least for me. Like it's like, oh my God, like every single glimpse I've caught, I've been like, I am now and officially enlightened. Like I have woken up. And then plunged back into like the world or the body or the day-to-day stuff, you completely forget about the glimpse. And then the glimpse, you and you wonder, well, I ever have that again. Like, and you know, the first glimpse I caught of it was not for meditation. It was like many people in the West LSD. It was really good LSD. And suddenly experiencing that unitive consciousness, whatever the word you want to use for it. And realizing this is why acid is so popular. It's not the skulls you see bubbling in the ceiling. It's this. This is whatever this is it. And then, you know, years and years pass before anything like that happens again. But those moments for me, they do, they become more common, more familiar, less shocking. And then it seems like it kind of starts balancing itself out where you get to experience life at some fundamental level. And then you get lost, maybe a little less frequently into the body. And that for me, those are, that's a real shocking thing now where, you know, it's just weird. You just suddenly wake up and you're like, shit, I forgot all of it. How many days passed? Where am I? Like an alcoholic in a hotel room. Where's the, where, what hotel is this? Where, what the fuck? I was so, you know that. It's like, whoa, I really lost it. I was back deep in the deep, trussle experience. I'm pissed. I'm like annoyed. My needs are not being met. And then you remember it again. And it's just an interesting game of ping pong between these two coexistent realities. So we started this conversation about the difference between this associate of experiences that are really scary and difficult and getting there through meditation or something like that. Yeah. What? Whether it's taking a psychedelic or meditating, there's a very clear sense that this is not a hallucination, this is not a fantasy. It's the nature of reality that's always there, but I'm forgetting it. You use the term forgetting, but something's being revealed that's always always there. And if you're thrown into that suddenly, it's very disorienting. But if through mindfulness practice, Vapassana literally means self-inquiry, insight meditation. You have insight into the nature of reality. And so as the mind begins to calm down and the heart begins to open, then we have a foundation. We have some sense of being able to deal with this continuity, which really isn't even discontinuous. It's like, okay, I trust my heart, I trust being here, and maybe it's not the way I think it is. So that really there's two kinds of suffering. There's suffering from early childhood conditioning and there's suffering that I think I'm a separate human being. I'm more self-kind of suffering. And psychotherapy deals with the first kind, meditation deals with the second kind, we got to deal with both kinds to be comfortable in that spaciousness. Right. I mean, because you still, that's the thing. You're still, you know, there's all kinds of analogies we hear in the spiritual texts, the salt in the ocean, melting sugar, you know, the ocean, melting sugar, you know, but you, yeah, you're still you. So the, you know, the, truly, the human reality is so fucking painful. And the encounter or their realization, a recognition of this other nature that seems more real than the human realm or something like that, doesn't seem to do much for my own like karmic bullshit for all the levels you just mentioned other than making me less engaged with it and you know less obsessed with it because that's the thing. The psychotherapy or the attempt to fix one's own personal suffering by a never-ending fetishistic obsession with the past, you know, it becomes just more of a kind of expression of one's own identity or ego, right? Like that's the danger of it. Suddenly you've just become even more obsessed with yourself, more obsessed with it. I was just listening to Thomas Merton and he said he thinks that if he continued taking psychotherapy that if anything was going to drive him insane, it was psychotherapy that it was it was it somehow in the Western model of consciousness and addressing it, you just hit a wall of nihilism. You know, you're just a bundle of neurosis and that's it before you die. Smooth them out, get to a Freudian tolerable healthy level of pain and that's it. Go about your life and then die. Nothing else. Yeah, okay, a lot to unpack. level of pain and that's it. Go about your life and then die. Nothing else. Yeah, okay, a lot to add back. So you were saying something about being obsessed and being disengaged and to me the more I'm not obsessed with my suffering, the more engaged I am, right? Yes. And that beyond that, there's a real difference between pain and suffering. So that in Tibetan Buddhism, they talk about compassion, being a mixture of sadness and joy, that sadness about how much pain and suffering there is in the world, and a joy that transcends happiness and sadness. So that can we be with both of these dimensions that we were talking about before of realizing that babies are starving to death and horrible people are amassing great wealth and all these things are happening and feel sad about how much suffering is really be moved by, really be touched by it, really be touched by it. Not spiritual bypass, not pretend that's not happening, not use spiritual practice as a way of avoiding it, but at the same time, at least some of the time, inhabiting a level of consciousness where there is a sense of wholeness, that even with the pain in the world, it is... there is a joy of bodies at the atomic level that swarms and robots can figure you ourselves being anything we want.

One of my earliest childhood memories, I am probably three, two, and I'm smelling Jasmine in Georgia, in St. Simon's Island, Georgia. And I had no language to articulate what I was experiencing. But it's one of the most beautiful moments of my life. Like I remember it how overwhelming it was, how perfect it was, how it wasn't like I was smelling it as much as I was it and it was me and the world was perfect and everything was good. And in contemplating that experience, I wonder, is the problem language? Is the problem that we have confused language with reality? Is this the mechanism with which what we call being human crystalizes? That we go from driving, looking out the window to having a camera, that's our Neo Cortex filming reality, labeling it, and then giving us this kind of secondary, lifeless simulation of primary reality. And then we start thinking, well, that's what's happening. It's what I think is happening. It's though my description of what's happening. It's my understanding of what Jasmine is followed by well I'm not gonna be smelling the Jasmine much longer to because we've got to go to work Or do you know what I'm saying? Is that the problem? It's a big part of the problem and I think there's a difference between Just smelling the Jasmine and thinking I'm smelling this flower called the jasmine and I like what I'm Yeah, it's smelling and you're all lost in those concepts like in English. Yeah, just as an example with fear We say I am afraid in Spanish. We say fear is here and it's a bet and they say I'm sorry. I screwed that up and In English we say, I am afraid. In Spanish we say, I have fear in Tibetan. They say fear is here. So just in the way we language things in English, it's a mistake. I'm not afraid. Fear is an emotion that I am experiencing. So that, like, you can imagine that your mind is like vast like the sky, right? And through language, we put a window frame around the chunk of the sky that we think is ours. And to the extent you're identified with the thoughts in the language, the window frame gets smaller. And then if a cloud comes into that chunk of window frame, all you see is the cloud. Instead of if you have a bigger window frame, you see the context, the clouds, and the blue sky. So, are you the weather, are you the sky, right? Are you the clouds, or are you the sky? And Are you the sky, right? Are you the clouds or are you the sky? And language is one of the primary things that pulls us out of that direct perception. In fact, at the end of meditation retreats, where I get sometimes, at least when I used to go to retreats, I would get in this wide open place, I would notice how beginning to talk to people at the end of the retreat was really what started bringing me back into being quad and duality again and like oh my god look at all this stuff look at here and there and So that there's this James Joyce novel where mr. So and so is living Outside of his body the whole time because he's living in his head, he's living in his thoughts. Yeah. So there's a whole difference between, I love you as a thought and actually surrendering into that being that. Yeah. Yeah. It's, and that's where, to me, it gets infuriatingly simple. When, you know, the, the, the sort of issue is issue is, it's just like, where I'm not told me, you know, we've got to get you out of your head and your heart. And I was like, well, that's never going to happen. Yeah, it's impossible. And he got a big smile and said, it's actually, it's easy. And on one level, it seems like that. That it's so simple. And then suddenly, there you are, back where you've always been. Now, what, the location of that specific place is, I have no idea. That's more labeling. That's just more labeling. And tell me if I'm on the right track here, sometimes, I experience myself in the same way I experience other people when I'm people watching. Just another person, just another person going about some some Sarik loop, eating chicken and dumplings at 3 a.m. You know what I mean? Like here he goes again. Here we go. Watching myself eat the chicken and dumplings and really feeling just compassion. There's no sense of like you piece of shit. What are you doing eating chicken and dumplings at 3 a.m.? This has got to be a bad sign. But more just like, well, this is what he's doing. This is the pattern. And then having the experience when you're looking at other people almost as though you're looking at yourself. Now I don't have these experiences all the time, but sometimes I do, and it's really wonderful. Like, something seems to go along with it, that involves being less hung up, less judgmental. You know, less ferocious in my labeling of people is like, oh, look at that piece of shit. Look at the way they treat their kid. Can you believe that? Oh, no, I'm talking to you. But just more of like, that's me. That's my mind. I'm looking at different versions of me. Is that narcissism or is that wisdom? Well, I love see, they're one of those things. But before you were talking about how sometimes you're in that place of being wide open, and then you feel guilty because you're not doing something about the pain in the world. You're feeling like I'm just being spiritual. I ought to be out fixing the planet or something. Feel like I'm skipping school. Right. And the humorous EB White said, when I wake up in the morning, I'm torn between a desire to improve the world and to enjoy myself. It makes it very hard to plan the day. So what I'm saying is there's a real difference between those moments where it opens up and you feel the spaciousness. And then it closes down. And even the feeling guilty, it's just your ego's way of taking you out of that place. Because that place is death to the ego. So the ego comes up with feeling guilty or all kinds of different manipulative tactics that it has. And using mindfulness to begin to feel when you're in that open place, how free it is, how you're acting, how you're connected with other people, you're connected with yourself, you're not judging people as being pieces of shit even though they're acting crazy or stupid or whatever they're doing. And what does it feel like when you're being in that judging mind, that lost in conceptual mind? And when you're in that second place, there is suffering. And there's this fundamental assumption and Buddhism that we are basically good and whole. And if you begin to pay attention that gradually, and the essential word here is gradually, it might take a whole long, long time, we will be attracted toward what feels good, what feels whole, which is our true nature, which is good. Right? And everybody's got that place in them. And some people, they're so afraid to feel that spaciousness, to let go of identification with separateness, that they're just locked in there. I mean, think about what it would take for Trump to have some compassion for himself. It's almost unthinkable, right? Oh, we don't know. We don't know. I mean, that's the thing. We don't know. I mean, God, having you ever done the contemplation of like, like that in fact, Trump or whoever the particular despot or villain of the year may be, that in fact, if you were to experience their reality, you might be horrified to find that they actually are experiencing compassion. If you ever played with that idea at all? I have, but compassion doesn't call it compassion. It has a quality of being connected to other people suffering it. I don't feel that. Well, in this particular case, right? Theoretically, what you're saying makes sense. But, and maybe it was a bad example. All I'm saying is that, can you and I, in this moment right now, can the listeners ask, are we feeling connected to ourselves? Are we feeling connected to Duncan and Ramdev? Or is there some sense of, I'm lost in concepts? My ego's got to be here. I've got to reify my ego. And there's all these stories of people let out a prison after a long time and they're freaked out. They don't want to leave her. An animal has been in a cage for a really long time. They open up the cage. The animal doesn't want to come out because he saw comfortable in a horrible way and being in the cage. And that's what the eagle does. It's created a cage. So that when you were that three-year-old who is just like smelling the jasmine, there was no cage built yet with all these concepts. But you needed the ego to survive. But you're not the ego. The ego's, its ego is a verb, but something we do. It's not a thing. And we can become aware of it. We can have a kindness. We can have mercy toward it. You know my least favorite thing in the world is when I'm using a public bathroom and somebody opens the door. Yes, it's my fault, I should have locked it, but I didn't. Suddenly, I have cursed someone with having to watch me using the bathroom. And I am cursed by the look of horror as they as they as they look at me is that is they watched the way I use the bathroom. And I won't go into details here about that. It's a nightmare. I have nightmares about it. It's horrible. And if you don't have a VPN protecting your activities online, you're doing the same thing technologically.

Yeah, see that's the, that's, that's as far as I must admit, I feel quite guilty when you're saying, you know, you wake up in the morning and you think, how do I help the world? This is not what I'm thinking. I wake up in the morning. I'm like, is there any coffee left? I bet we drank all the fucking coffee and didn't order more. I'm a piece of shit from there. I wish I woke up and the first thought out of my mind was, ah, do I serve myself or help the world? Right. But the times that I have wanted to help the world, in retrospect, that feeling of wanting to help the world, if it's coming out of this sort of condensed, crystallized, me state, it inevitably has a kind of aggression attached to it. Like the same way that I don't do it anymore, but in the old days, I would look in the mirror and be like, look at you, you fat piece of shit. I was so mean to myself. And so my attempts to improve myself were similar to some brutal farmer whipping an ox or a donkey or something to try to get it to pull a cart, yelling expletives at the poor thing, like screaming at it, just fucking move. And so I think maybe one of the reasons the current political climate in the world is as it is, is because people are what they think is serving the world is just turning the horrible way they're trying to improve themselves onto others. You know, thinking, oh, let me whip these people into shape. Let me punish these people, shame these people, humiliate the other, whoever they may be. Until finally, in a moment of absolute horrible, like anti-apiphany, they realize what a moment of absolute horrible, like anti-apiphany, they realize what a piece of shit they are, apologize, and then become like me. You know, and that's not really helping the world. That's just whipping the world, like it's an old sad donkey. Yeah, but isn't that kind of behavior whether you're coming from the right or coming from the left? It's still based on donkey. Yeah, but isn't that kind of behavior, whether you're coming from the right or coming from the left, it's still based on being lost in concepts. Both sides are saying, you're gonna destroy the country. I don't care what the rules are, I don't care what the laws, we've gotta do what we've gotta do because you guys are gonna ruin the whole American experiment. So we've gotta do whatever we can do to make sure that you are ground down into a piece of dust. Yeah. And it takes a bit of stability, a slightly quieter mind to feel what that behavior feels like. It feels, there's hatred there. It hurts the heart. It's not a good feeling. No. And that feeling of, my God, where the fuck is the coffee in the morning or something, what does that feel like? So it really comes back to, can we begin to practice and feel the difference between being lost and being not lost and move toward a possibility of practicing and living from a place of abundance and richness rather than poverty and then adequacy and self-judgment? Right? I mean, there have been times when the sun is out and you and your wife are having the greatest day ever and your kids are happy and the banker count looks good and whatever all the things are. And it's just there and then something changes and it's not there. And And can you, can you do you have cameras in my house? Are you observing me? Just microphones. Is that what my internet's weird? Everybody has it, everybody. So that, that, to me it all boils down to motivation. And most people come to practice because they're really damn tired of it. To me, it all boils down to motivation. And most people come to practice because they're really damn tired of suffering. They want to not suffer so much. They want to be happier. And there is this thing. I mean, like, I'm not into all this Buddhist technology. I'm really not. But there are these things called the foreign-nobled truths. And the first one is, there's suffering being in a human incarnation. And the second one is, you suffer because you're attached. The third one is let go of attachment, no more suffering. And the fourth one is, there's a way to do that. Right. So when you really begin to feel what it's like to wake up in the morning and freak out about the coffee, It hurts the heart, and it hurts your wife to see you have a hurt heart, right? And there's something inherent in us that is moving toward that sense of homeless, that sense of connectedness. And how motivated are you? How deeply do you want to awaken? Right. And I'm thus wrote a book called, Grist for the Mill. It's all grist for the Mill. My favorite. He said, suffering is grace. What does that mean? I mean, suffering is grace only if you want to wake up. If that is your motivation, that you want to use this life, this moment, to become a more awake, alive, passionate human being. You know what? I got to tell you, I disagree with what with that. I think suffering is great, even if you don't want to wake up. You just don't know it's grace. I mean, I've spent some time thinking about this, and this is another thing where I'm, Rondas talks about, I don't some time thinking about this. And this is another thing Rondas talks about. I don't remember where it's from. But how there's this strange symbiosis between things that are seemingly antithetical, that the cops can't exist without criminals. Like in another version of this that I've heard, which is Buddhist, I think it's Buddhist, is that something on the lines of all of your karma is mitigated. All of your past shity acts are forgiven, so to speak. That's not the language Buddhism uses, it's more of Christian language I'm using here. If those things have propelled you to a state of waking up. That, and so, you know, this is something that like, that was in playing around with the cosmology of multiple lifetimes, looking at what is going on with you right now, not as some horrific accident, prison, a nightmare occurs, but as an intermediary state between you becoming the Buddha that apparently all of us become, at some point in the incarnational cycle, then it instantly transforms it. You know, but I don't think that you need to have even the slightest inclination towards anything spiritual, necessarily, for that to be the case. You just don't, you just think your suffering is suffering. Yeah, you're right. I didn't say it accurately enough. Suffering is grace for everybody, but only if you're motivated to wake up, do you know that? Right. And if people are blindly trying to run away from suffering, then the spiritual path becomes, what can I say here? Like really tricky year-olds almost on the veil, because the big paradox is that healing happens by contacting our suffering, going beyond the concepts, going beyond the narrative, directly nakedly feeling what's going on in my life right now, and then opening one's heart to it. Where is there such a condition tendency like you touch a hot stove you pull away. There's such a condition tendency when you're feeling suffering to push it away to run away from it to deny it. Suffering arises. The three things you can do. One is you push it away. I don't want to feel that. Second one is completely lost in it. Oh my God, this is a catastrophe. And the third one is a compassionate, embodied, mindful response to it. Right. And it takes practice to get to that third one, particularly when the places are deeply conditioned. Oh, but God, I am so addicted to cynicism. Like all of the spiritual talk aside, I'm just realizing, God, I love being cynical. It's so gross too. It's so lazy and cowardly. But fuck, I just lately, I've just been thinking, you know, like the way I used to think about my body, now I feel the same way about my cynicism. Like look at that, like if you could see my how absolutely, how horrible that aspect of my emotional body looks right now. I mean, my cynicism has moves with moves. My cynicism does not use the other end. My cynicism is unwashed and like really a beast, really a beast. And I don't, I don't know how to get out of that. Like it's like, I should send you a picture of my feet, Rom Dave. That's good. I'm not into feet. I'm not into feet. That's not my thing. You definitely wouldn't be in the my feet. My kids. That's how they'll fungus. How about you? I let them. I know. Somehow I shouldn't have avoided toenail fungus, along with all the other stuff going on with my feet. You know, maybe I do have it. I wouldn't know. You can't tell. My children look at my feet and they go boo boo, boo boo bandaid. They think they think I'm wounded. But this is what my cynicism is like, my lazy reversion to just a general heart-hearted cynical attitude towards the world. I think Ramda saw that in me, and he was not... Plet, I could just feel, I could just feel he saw that. And like, and really found it to be like, not great. And I, not cute. You know, not like anything more than like a kind of real fucked up waste of time. I mean, obviously that doesn't sound like Rondas. It could be my own projection. I think there might be a own projection effect In fact, I was reading this article by this psychotherapist guy and he said, I was talking to Ramdas and Ramdas asked me, can you see your clients as being whole, right? And that's what his work was, is to see you as whole even though you're thinking you're not whole. So I don't think he was being cynical about your cynicism. I'd really go back, I'd like to go back to you saying that you're addicted to your cynicism. I am. Because the operative word is addiction, whether it's addicted to cynicism or bad relationships This is a bad relationship or drinker, drugs or whatever it is. Addiction is like living from implicit memory that you think you're living in the present, but you're actually five years old or three years old being mad at mommy or daddy or whatever it is going on. Yes, yes, right, right, right, right. And to begin to become alert to that feeling of, I'm helpless, I'm powerless, I don't have any power here that my, I need this ego, I need this relationship with the world that might be really painful and cynical and all kinds of things, to be able to survive. This is almost like life and death. But if you're not cynical, the dunkin' that needs to survive is in real danger. And so there's this basic fundamental fear, it's really fear of death at the root of all. And there are ways to deal with that. One of them is how deep is your faith in God or faith in the Dharma or faith in Maharaja or Hanuman or Christ or whatever it is. But the other is, can you feel the fear rather than fixate on the trigger? The trigger is that person out there who you're being cynical about or your feet or the guy in the mirror or whoever it is. And we get so caught up in relationship with the trigger. Let go of the trigger. What does it actually feel like to be afraid? What does it feel like to be cynical? It feels like shit, shit, but we're so busy fixating on the trigger that we don't feel it. So anger, sadness, are difficult to be sure, but fear is the hardest one to really feel fear in your body without fixating on the object of fear. Like, now, think of something or somebody you're afraid of. And what does it feel like in your body? Let go of the story And what does it feel like in your body, let go of the story. What does it feel like in your belly? Was it feel like in your chest? Yeah, it's, you know, it's, it's, it's definitely, you know, for me, it's just like real tight energy in the chest, real tight, real numb, you know, a kind of numb, exhausted, tight, shitty energy. It's like a, you ever get like a nice bottle of wine, but the court, the court's fucked up. Never have that happen. Not the one, but it's happened, yeah. I don't, I don't drink anymore, but the just remember sometimes having some nice bottle of wine in there, you just maybe you're in too much of a hurry to get the cork out or who knows what, but the corks fucked up. You know there's wine under there. You can smell it kind of through the cork. That's what it feels like to me. It's like having some garbage cork shoved exactly in my whole. It's like, except you know on the other side of that is where all of what makes you wonderful is, you know it. Like that's what's so frustrating about it. Like to me, this is also the like the where you do get the un, generally unspoken side effects of some of this stuff. To me, this is also the, like, the, where you do get the un... generally unspoken side effects of some of this stuff. Right. It's like you get the taste. You feel it, there it is. There was nothing to be afraid of, but it's right now where I'm at. It's just, it's so last thought. It's so fucking vulnerable, man. Like when I get into my heart, so fucking vulnerable man. Like when I get into my heart, I am just as mushy as you can be. Like thinking about it, I can start tearing up right now. Like it's the, it feels so weak, so unfunny. And so absolutely just spineless. You know, it sucks because when I'm there, it's none of those things. But when I'm not there, from the other side of the cork, it just looks like embarrassment upon embarrassment. Okay, whoa. Duncan, it's hard work. Yeah. So So let me give you a metaphor. I imagine that I've got this brain that's got grooves in it, right? Okay. I suppose that you have a groove of being a cynical guy. Yeah. And every time you become cynical and you're unconscious, you just do that because it's the pattern you've been doing for a long time. Yeah. conscious. You just do that because it's the pattern you've been doing for a long time. Groove gets a little deeper and it's a little harder not to do it next time. But every time that you're aware of what it feels like to be in that pattern, what does it feel like? What's it like being mindful of being cynical? What does it feel like in your body instead of being lost in the trigger? God is pouring a little nectar into that groove so it's not quite as deep next time, right? And it's easier next time not to get caught in that place. You've been doing the same thing for decades. I've been doing the same kinds of things for a long time too. And those grooves are deep so that it's and those grooves are deep so that it's very unlikely that they're going to go away by watching it one or two times. It's a gradual process of becoming aware of what it feels like instead of being lost in the pattern and the trigger and that eventually then we won't be lost and we'll just be noticing it and it doesn't feel good, we'll stop the pattern. The other thing is that being in the heart so that it gets all mushy and that is a really vulnerable place and to me the heart needs to be supported by the belly, like the martial art of being Duncan, having the the cheese, the hara, strong open. Right. So, so that you're not depending on the environment to keep the heart open. You can have your heart open whether it's a sunny day or not sunny day. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yes, I, you know, and I get it. Yeah, I get it. I totally get it. I should, I mean, I'm not, the good news is I'm not proud of it anymore. Like I don't, I used to think of it as some kind of mark of sophistication. Like I've managed to become the most cynical person. I've managed to look down on people who seem to be emoting anything other than a general dismissal of time space. You know what I mean? A general like, I roll in all reality. I used to think that meant I was smart. So at least I know that. And it's just, it's very frustrating, you know? It's very frustrating. It's like, to get back to the Jasmine idea, you know, it's like, there's so many Jasmine like things around me right now, my children, my marriage, my standup, my friends. And it's so annoying to have this sense of like, fuck, man, I've got this thick, fungal callus that seems to be separating me from truly connecting with them. And in the way, I know I would if I could maintain a more stable, open-hearted way of being. It's very frustrating. But do you get how big a step it is that you're at the place in your life where you're aware of that? You're aware that it's an impediment, and you want it to change. So from that point, it's all downhill. It might be a rocky road, it might be an up and down, but once you see that clearly, that you're causing suffering, it's over. And to feel guilty about it, to feel ashamed about it, to feel stupid about it, is just your ego's way of slowing down the process because it's holding on to it. You know what I think is the most painful part of it, is that I have, thanks to people like you, been experiencing the other side of that cork, so to speak. And it's just so annoying to like have extended periods of that, extended periods not happening because I've like found a great catamene dealer or MDMA dealer, because they've extended periods of it that are just happening. And then it just, it's like, it goes away. It's the worst, man. It really is. It's not the worst. It's not the worst. And the worst is not having it there in the first place. So, there is this guy, Shreer Bindo, who said, walking down the spiritual path, is like, you're going down the path and God knocks you over into this mud puddle and you get up and you shake your fist and say why are you doing this to me I'm all muddy and you get up and you continue your way and then he knocks you over again or she whoever and you get up and you yell not quite as loudly and finally he knocks you over and you just get up and you keep walking that how much you complain about it and beat yourself up about it is just slowing you down. There's no need to do that. As soon as you notice, get back to doing it. And that quality of saying it's the worst, I'm guilty, a woe is me. Yeah. It is your ego's way of not feeling the suffering of it and moving on. You know what? It's jumping into concepts about it. I just, I've been on a little bit of a Thomas Merton kick. Okay. And he was saying that despair is a form of laziness. Mm-hmm. He's so, I agree. He's fierce. Merton is so, do you ever get into him at all? Yeah. He's so ferocious and simple simultaneously that it's really intense to listen to him. But yeah, it's like, that's the other thing. You sort of recognize like, man, this, whatever this game is I'm playing with myself, it really is just no different than what I do when I need to like write or make music for the podcast and end up getting caught up in some technical thing. Maybe if I move this wire here or that wire there, or get a better keyboard or whatever, I will make more music, or write. And you just realize, my God, this is just procrastination disguised as like trying to align, trying to get your studio set up. It feels like that. It feels like that. And you know, talking to you now, it's like I can feel the other side of the cork. You make me feel the other side of the cork every time we talk. You know what? And I think that's one of the reasons sometimes I reschedule our episodes because it's so, it's so like dropping back into it is such an intense feeling. And, but when you're there, you're like, why did I ever not want to be here? St.terace of Lusso said, I would much rather speak to God than about him. Yeah. Ryan and Thomas Merton said, and I kind of paraphrase this quote of his, love and prayer are learned in the hour. When prayer becomes impossible, the heart turns to stone. So that's exactly the place you're talking about, like you're calling the cynicism. And you say, I can't do this. It's, I'm too cynical. I'm too messed up. And in that moment, that's when you need to pray. That's when you need to meditate. Yeah. That's the moment you just don't want to do any of that shit. Like that is the moment where you, you, you, you, at least where I feel so far away from prayer, we, where it feels empty, but then also mixed in is this sense of like, well, if I pray, if I meditate, this feeling will chant, this will go away. Like, it'll melt the ice. You know it. And then that's where it gets interesting because you realize, oh, yeah, I don't want the ice to melt. I don't want the ice to melt. I want the boo-boo. I want to show people my bandaid, you know, like kids, they're proud of their boo-boo. They, the first thing they'll show you if they have a nice wound, you know, it's like that. It's a very immature fixation on this shallow way of being. One time I was with my son and he was about six years old, maybe. We were in Maui at a shopping center. His mom was out shopping and he was running around and he fell down and he scraped his knee. It wasn't bleeding, it wasn't an open cut, it was just an abrasion, but like he fell down and was shocking, started crying, he came running to me. And he expected that he was gonna get the comfort. And the, oh, Declan, it's okay, I love you, don't worry about it. Oh, I love you, let me hold you. But instead, I said, you know, Declan, you're okay. It's only it's only a scrape. You're good to go. And he was kind of like shocked at first. And he realized he was okay. And he just went back to playing. And I realized that that we could condition into making our pain physical or emotional into catastrophe. So we get more love, we get more comfort. And then, it's a kind of a tricky thing to learn to love a child without encouraging them to get lost in emotion like that. Yes, God, I do that. It's just, my wife has been calling me out on that because like, I do that, because you're sort of like, depending on what your childhood was like, you know, you accidentally become reactive. You know, you're projecting yourself as a child onto your kid. And you're, which is again, more selfishness because you're not even trying child onto your kid. And your, which is again, more selfishness, because you're not even trying to help your kid. You're trying to help you as a child when your current child is suffering. You know, you're not even trying to mitigate that you might think you are, but really what you're trying to do is sooth some old wound via this wonderful child of yours. You know, and then, yeah, I know what you're trying to do is soothe some old wound via this wonderful child of yours. You know, and then, yeah, I know what you mean, like not doing that, letting them realize they're fine. They're fine already. Yeah, you know, and how quickly they get better if you don't fan the flames of that behavior pattern. You know, it's like, God forbid you should scream when the gate falls down. But you know, Duncan, I got to confess, I listened to the midnight gospel episode with your mother before she died. And I think there's even some YouTube of her talking about things, or maybe it's just the midnight gospel. She was a remarkable woman. Yeah, I mean, she must have been really a fantastic mother. And yet, here you are with all this baggage, so that, I mean, it is kind of the human condition. I mean, some people have a lot of mothers than you had for sure, right? Oh, my God, yes. And I just loved her so much when I heard her talking, and particularly I think there's some YouTube of her or something, maybe I'm wrong about that, but one friend of mine who is a therapist said, if it's not one thing, it's your mother, right? And as long as your mother's not completely enlightened, as long as your father's not completely enlightened, there's going to be These places where we get lost in separateness where we're protecting ourselves where we're creating this ego that needs to Survive at all costs like holding on with our teeth Yeah, because now what do you I mean that you know, this is I'm sorry if I've already told you the story. When I first met Rob Dess, one of my first questions then was, are you my guru and he goes, yeah, now what? What? What? What? What? What? What? It was so funny and so perfect, but similarly, that's the other side of this stuff is it's like, now what? Okay, great. Now I am beyond, now I've dropped into my heart. Now I am there. Now what? Now what do I do? I mean, I've been living my whole life putting band-aids on imaginary wounds. What do I... What are real wounds? Or both, a mix. But what do I do now? That's the other thing. What activity? What does the world do? Minus its suffering. It's almost like a strangely parallel to what we're wondering with AI. What the fuck are we going to do? What are we going to do if it does everything for us? What if your entire life has been spent attempting to fix your suffering by rearranging things in your external world, by attempting varying levels of alcohol, acid, weed, sex, and suddenly you drop into that place. What now? Well in India they say the function of the Guru takes place in one second. That you meet the Guru and you see the possibility of love and then it's up to you to actualize that. It's up to you to get that into your life. So, I mean, Rambas is lying to what now is the perfect response really. That if he is your guru, he shows you what love is, whether it's him or Maharaja, your Christ or Buddha, whatever. Right. And you see that there is another possible way to live. You get it. There's this direct transmission of connectedness with the one. And now the rest of your life is about bringing that into manifestation. And it is really frustrating. Several times in our conversations, just now you've talked about how frustrated you are, how annoying it is, how upsetting it is. And that's the practice is dealing with those emotions and coming back to that initial connectedness. Yeah. Yeah, it's like a debt. That's crazy what you just said about the guru. That is so, it's like a data packet that is, that you can, it's like a data packet that is, that you can, it's like DNA. You know, you can unfold DNA. It's massive if you unwind it apparently. I don't know, people say it could stretch to the moon or whatever, but it's like that. It's like, yeah, I never thought of it that way. You get this thing that you must deal with now because there it is. There it is not in a book, but in the flesh. And now what? Now you see it's a possibility. It's like, imagine if the whole, like if somehow the whole planet was granted a vision of some alternate earth in a reality just next to ours, where somehow everyone figured out how to get along. No more war, no more violence, some kind of harmonious planet. And we saw that. It's the exact same people on that planet that are on this planet. Now what? Because it's possible. Now we know it's possible, right? Now the whole idea of global planetary harmony piece seems like, you know, seems like something somebody, you know, thought up on like a nice blast of nitrous. But, you know, but yeah, I get it. It's like, you see it. And now what? It's almost, yeah, that's amazing. To me, it's like the first time you have that taste like the first time I took acid, the first time I was with Maharaji, I got addicted to that feeling of wholeness. Yeah. At the same time, I'm addicted to these other things, right? So there's these competing addictions, right? There's this addiction to being back in that place when I first took acid, when I first met Maharajee, but there's also addiction to my ego structure, to being cynical for in your case or whatever my case was, right? And there's these competing threads going on that eventually the connection thread is going to win, but it's frustrating. It's a torturous journey for most of us to let go of those other addictions, not even let go of them, but to be clearly in touch with them enough, they begin to dissolve through the power of mindfulness and compassion. And to really accept grace, like a lot of what we're talking about is here are two people with penises, you and me, two men who are talking about how to do this, what to do, but really in a way it gets to be more about receiving the blessing that's here. It's not doing it. It's getting out of the way, having God act through us, of accepting the blessing, accepting the grace. It's all grace, right? And to say, I've got to do it, and I'm not doing it well enough, and I'm really a slump, or I'm really this, or I'm really the... Mistake. It's a mistake. My thinking is's no, I don't mean that's a mistake. I mean, generally with what you're talking about, when I allow myself to like kick around how lucky I am to like gotten hang out with Ramdass or that I get to have conversations like this with you or anything like that. My general feeling is like, well, something is malfunctioning here. Like I should, I don't deserve. Like I don't deserve this. I don't deserve this at all. Like there is no part of me that deserves anything other than chaos. And that. But Duncan, who's saying that? Who's saying that? That's some wounded child part of you. I mean, you do deserve it. You're this really beautiful human being. I mean, even if you were not as beautiful as you are, everybody deserves it, you deserve it. You've been working hard. Right, yeah, but I mean, I know it's just, you know, that sense of like, it's a really curious problem to have. You know, I know it's why, like, it's the source of depression and anger and all that stuff is you just, you sort of like, you know, it's like there's some people who you give them a gift and they can't really take it. Like, they don't, they can't accept it. It seems to them like they, I don't know, they, they've conned you or something, they've tricked you. And that's how I feel. I mean, this, the anytime Raku or Ramdas or you or any people, you know, talk about named curly Baba, like just the idea, like if, if this being is in your life, if you somehow have made contact with this being embodied or not, that you're, it's taken care of from that point forward. And I look at like my life after really connecting with that energy and truly, it's just been like blessing upon blessing upon blessing. But still to this day, like sometimes I look at this picture of my wall, It's just been like blessing upon blessing upon blessing. But still to this day, like sometimes I look at his picture on my wall. And I think, what am I doing hanging that there? That's just nonsense. There's nothing there. You don't, you're not like Ragu. You're not like Ramdhaver, Ramdas. You didn't really make contact with that. You just wishful thinking, man. There's this poem by Hopfees where he says, in the eyes of your beloved, beloved with the capital B, in the eyes of your beloved, everything you ever do think or say is always, always beautiful. And yet then there's the voice of the super ego that was learned when you were almost helpless child that says, I don't deserve this. I'm no good. I can't do it. Yeah. And to begin to hear that voice for what it is, it was needed when you were a tiny child to survive. And that scene now is the voice of survival. You believe it. You think, I don't believe it, I might die. But that's the little child is feeling that. And can you have compassion for that part of Duncan? Can you do loving kindness practice or compassion practice for the part of you that feels so ashamed, so unworthy that having God's God in your life or Maharaj's picture on your wall is that you feel you might not deserve that. Of course you deserve it. He chose you. You didn't choose him. Yeah, right. And to really hear that voice for what it is, but it's such a hard voice to not see as only another thought. Here's a thought, what's for lunch, here's a thought, I like this, here's a thought, I'm no good, and that no good thought we take is real. I mean, even at the end of long meditation retreats, I would notice, my mind would go really, really still. And then there is this voice that says, oh, your practice is pretty good. Oh, your practice, you can change it a little bit here or there. That I was still judging, that I have to get better. Right. Yeah. Right. Yeah. I mean, that's so many people right now just feel like pieces of shit. Like so many people feel completely useless or defeated or just yeah. But maybe there's no more people feeling that thing before, but you're beginning to notice it because your heart is more open. Right, yeah. Yeah, right, you just, to me, it seems like this, the thing we're talking about, this is the path for all the social activist stuff, that like any activist, anybody trying to make change in the world right now should start here. That somehow, and this is the great dream, if everyone just started doing, like just reconnecting like this, that things would drastically change. But maybe that's not the point. You ever play around with that idea that maybe like part of what makes the world or the human incarnation perfect, according to the Buddhists, is that we need Trump's potions and all the many versions of them to play that condensed role to help wake us up that like they weirdly are the gurus too. You know what I'm talking about? I do, but I'm kind of recovering scientists. What I want to know is, what can I do to wake up now? And what can I do to help the person I'm talking to? Right. I mean, there is the human condition and you're talking about drastic change. I kind of have some strong feeling that we're not going to change as a species suddenly unless we wipe ourselves out, but that change is gradual. I mean, there's a lot fewer hungry people now than there were a few decades ago. There's fewer starving babies, there's fewer wars going on. There's a lot that's better, but it's a slow gradual process. Like a big ship, when you turn it, takes miles to turn the damn thing around, right? Right. So I'm not looking for, I'm not looking for immediate global change. I'm trying to be an individual who's changing and radiating that around me. And trusting that that's the best I can do and not really worry about the things I can't do. Ronda has told this story that when he was at Harvard, the faculty got all upset because men had to wear neckties in the faculty club. So there's a big protest and they wanted Rambas to join the protest and they thought, well I agree with that but this is not my fight. Fighting about neckties is not something I want to put my energy into, right? Right. I got this other thing I'm doing. Right. Yeah, neck tie fights. My God, it's just, but I can imagine how in the moment of being invited to protest, how you just feel so much pressure to get involved in the dumbest protest of all time. Yeah. But then again, maybe it's all necktie fights in a certain sense. Yes. That's what I'm saying. I mean, in every single one of them is like so powerful and so as the potential to really consume you, scare you, make you angry, make you hate yourself for not caring about it or even worse, making you pretend you care about, make you hate yourself for not caring about it, or even worse, making you pretend you care about it, because you wanna see him right. You wanna see like you're on the right team or something. You know, and that's the worst feeling of all. No. Wow. Are you doing a retreat coming up? Is that what you're saying? No, I'm not, I didn't say that. I'm not doing a full fun. Oh, you should do one. I go where I'm invited. I just got back from along, retreat up in British Columbia, but I'm not doing one. Just one closing thing here, Maharajee wants, the President of India came to see him. I don't know if I told this story on a previous podcast. Tell it again. So the President of India was a devotee of Maharaj. He's not the prime minister. The prime minister's a much bigger deal, but still he's the President of India. And he came to see Maharaj and he brought cars full of followers and psychophants and baskets of fruit and candy. And he gave it all to Maharaj. He made a big production out of it, you know. and baskets of fruit and candy, and he gave it all to Maharaj. He made a big production out of it, you know. And then when they were leaving and their cars were winding the way up the side of the valley there in the Himalayas, Maharaj, he turned to us and said, all that fuss in these just to worldly king. Wow. And it just blew my mind. Here is the president, and he could see that, here's the president, he's caught up and look, I'm the president, look at my mind. Here is the president, and he could see that. Here's the president that's caught up and look on the president, look at my power. It's just a worldly king. So I try to remember that. It's like I run the Living Dying Project, but it's really Hanamon's Living Dying Project. It's Maharaj's Living Dying Project. W-W-W-W-W-W-LivingDying.org, making a plug there, of course. I know folks can directly connect with you, right? Like, is that possible? We've got ongoing groups, free, very complete website about meditation. And I know folks can directly connect with you, right? We've got ongoing groups, free, very complete website about meditation. And I know folks can directly connect with you, right? Like, is that possible? We've got ongoing groups, free, that's very complete website about meditation and end of life stuff. Do you have to be dying to participate in these groups? No, no, it's the living dying project. There's the living part, conscious living, there's the dying part, conscious dying, conscious caregiving. So, I've got every other Saturday, Zoom group that's got like 430 people in it where we rarely talk about death at all. It's about the spiritual past and stuff that you and I have been talking about. There's an online workshop, a lot of stuff like that. Beautiful. Thank you so much. You are the best. Can we please keep doing these? Are you done with me? I can say it to you. I really love you.

46^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - 457: Rosebud Baker Transcript and Discussion^2021-08-22^Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. It's my dirty little angel. You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Greetings to you, my beautiful friends. It is ID Trussell reporting in to you from COVID land. At the end of my COVID quarantine, I got diagnosed with the disease. And I'm not going to look. I don't want to go on and on with the experience of having COVID or earbeat you too much with like all the COVID talk that you've all been fucking getting. I'll just say this, I'm fine now. It got a little, a little weird for a couple of days. But thank God that I got this fucking vaccine. Thank God that I got to microdose COVID because I would not want a full dose of this shit. It is weird. Not enough people are talking about how alien it feels. They're talking about all of these like physiological symptoms, the coughing, the shortness of breath, the losing your taste or smell, which thank God didn't happen to me as I am a professional chef. And next week, I'm headed to Paris for a pretty big fucking cooking contest. But the thing that doesn't seem to be getting covered is it's like, you've got an alien in you. This is a brand new thing. Whether it came from a bat or a bat or outer space, this is like apparently the first time this little fella's been rampaging around inside the human biome. And it feels psychologically just weird. Also, I think the tactic that a lot of people are using right now to try to shame people or like attack people's intelligence because they're not getting the vaccine is super lame and not effective at all. And you all have been doing it, need to stop. And I've been slightly guilty of it myself. It's the go-to, right? Because we all assume that other people are running the same operating system that we are. We forget the basic reality of just how fucking weird human beings are in the sense that they can look like us. We've got bipedal hominids without wings. I like saying that. I read it once in the description for humans. Bipedal wingless hominids. We've got, they all kind of look the same. Different, like mild differences in size and et cetera, et cetera. But inside the weird universes and galaxies that exist inside of the individual human being can be so vastly different. This is why we get serial killers. This is why we get to enjoy like documentaries on the Zodiac Killer. My point is this, right now, I guarantee that within a 50 mile radius of view, there is someone in their closet in front of a shrine to Bigfoot or Justin Bieber offering it bowls of their cum that they've collected over the last many days. And they think that's normal. They also don't wanna get the vaccine. And so the idea that you're gonna get someone who offers cum tributes to cryptids or celebrities to get vaccinated by insulting their intelligence is a little naive on your part. It's just not gonna work. You've got somebody right now filling up silver bowls of cum and offering it to mythological woodland forest creatures. And you think that you're like savage tweet calling them idiots or murderers is gonna move the vaccine needle. I'm sorry, I just don't think it's gonna work. That being said, I'm so, so glad that I got the shot. I'm so glad I got the shot. I'm so glad that I'm at the end of this thing. And I haven't been in a hospital and that I didn't get like the horrible symptoms that go along with this motherfucker. So the mercy of Bigfoot was upon me. I made it through it with relatively unscathed though I still feel a little weird. A little fatigued, a little bit of a brain fog but that could be related to the fact that I've been doing LSD on and off for the better part of my adult life. We have a fantastic episode for you today. Comedian Rosebud Baker is here with us. We're gonna jump right into it. But first, this. This episode of the DTFH has been brought to you by theGeniuses over at Squarespace.com. You wanna make a beautiful website. There's a few ways you could do it. You can get down on your knees and you can pray to fucking God that you get lucky enough to find a web designer that hasn't gone completely insane from blasting their perineum with sunlight. Now look, I'm not saying doing that isn't good for you but some web designers, you can look it up. It's a whole phenomena. They overdo it. They bake their taints and the madness spreads into their brains and they no longer are capable of helping you create the website of your dreams. So you could do that. You can pray and hope and roll the dice or you go to Squarespace and you give them a try. And here's a little nugget of glory for you.

Give him a shot. Thank you, Squarespace. Look, I don't have my editor, okay? So this is me doing it the way I used to do it. My wonderful genius editor has gone on a spiritual journey, I think, I'm not sure. I think everything he does is spiritual because he's practically enlightened. The point is, I'm doing this myself now so you're not gonna get the pristine, sweet, perfect, beautiful, glorious sound that you get from an Aaron Goldberg edited podcast. This is me doing it the old way. I wanna invite you to check out my Patreon. It's at patreon.com, Ford slash DTFH. My apologies to the DTFH family who I ghosted this last Friday. If any of you are listening, I'm so sorry I didn't make it to the family gathering. I completely forgot, but I think I have a pretty good excuse. I've got the plague, but we'll be back. Don't worry, things will get back to normal. Every week we get together, and I love it, we've got a weekly meditation group, journey into boredom, and every Friday we have a family gathering, and it's a really awesome group of some of the most brilliant, beautiful, powerful, erotic, occult, laden sorcerers, sorceresses, wizards, necromancers, and a variety of other weird mystical wizard things, including all forms of pagan and alien worshiping folks, and I think probably definitely some aliens and some gen at this point are hanging out at the DTFH Discord server, which you'll get access to when you go to patreon.com, Ford slash DTFH. Today we have a powerful comedian. She is so funny. I got to hang out with her a little bit in New York at some shows, we had some great conversations. She's brilliant, and thank God she just released a wonderful comedy special called Whiskey Fists, which you can watch for free on YouTube right now, and I really hope you will, because it's super funny, and you'll see just how much love, Rosebud, poured into it. Now everybody please welcome to the Dunkin' Trussell family, our podcast, Rosebud Baker. Rosebud, God bless you. Thank you so much for being on this episode of the DTFH, a very special episode, I've got COVID, so how wonderful to be talking to a human being. Topical. Oh yeah, I try to stay, I wanna stay relevant, so I went and made out with a bunch of cowboys here in Austin, Texas, the epicenter of the seas right now. Rosebud, I gotta say, your special is so good, and congratulations, you must be feeling great to have got all that. How long did it take you to develop that set? I mean, that's like, I would say, I've been doing comedy now for nine years, maybe 10 years, I can't, it's like you have to add two years on, yeah, it was 10 years. What do you mean you gotta add two years on? Well, because I was like, how many years was I doing comedy when the pandemic hit? You know what I mean? And so, because the whole year that the pandemic was going on, I felt like, I mean, I was still doing comedy, I was still doing the road and stuff, but I wasn't as loose or as confident as I had been, and everything felt so raw, and I just thought, this is kind of a perfect time to do a special, because I'm so raw. Like, there's so much going on, and there's so much tension, and that can be, obviously, like people think that it's not good for comedy, there's some people do, but I think it's such a great thing to be in the middle of, and so I decided I would do it in the middle of everything. I did it in March of 2021. Holy shit. That was when we recorded it, yeah. Wow, that is crazy, that's crazy. That's the kind of thing where everything it was telling you not to do it. I mean, there must have been people telling you should, are you sure you wanna do this right now? Yeah, yeah, everybody was like, just maybe like hold off, or maybe, and I just was like, I'm gonna do it myself, so, you know, I'm just gonna do it. And also, because here's the thing, we get on stage and we talk about how we feel at the moment, and when, in the moment, and comedy is like a living, breathing thing, so once you have changed as a person, the things that you were saying before no longer feel, they don't ring the true the same way. Like they don't feel as funny, or they just don't feel as ripe is really how it is. So I was like, I don't want to take 10 years of work and throw it in the garbage, and then I would like to put it out and have people see it, and so I was like, I'm gonna do it whether it goes on my YouTube or whatever, and then Comedy Central, actually, all things comedy got behind it, and then Comedy Central got behind it, and now it's streaming on their YouTube. So it all kind of worked out, but yeah, you're right. I was like, all signs we're pointing to, please don't do this. So glad you did it. Did you ever got like, I love that you're pointing out that aspect of comedy, which is, it's the strangest art form. There's so many, it's like, you know, when you're a painter painting on a canvas, it's like you don't have to worry about the canvas's opinions changing or social events altering the, while working on something, like it's not going to suddenly, like not like a certain color that you're painting or feel like the strokes you're using are weird, or anyway, I'm so glad you're acknowledging that, and have you ever gone into robot mode? You know what I mean, which I have, rather than admitting I've changed, the world is different now, something's changed in me, I just keep doing the same fucking bit, because it works. Have you ever gotten stuck like that, like a skipping record? You know, I've definitely had sets like that where you get on stage and you're like, but here's the thing, I always know that it's, that I'm in that mode. I can't ever like be in that mode and just like be cool with it. I'm always miserable. It's always like, if it feels like it isn't true, or if it feels like it's not hitting the same way, or that it's not as ripe anymore, I feel so bad. Even if the set went well, the laughs make me like sick. I get like ill from listening to them. You know, and it was happening a lot. Yeah, it was happening a lot during the pandemic. It was like, I would walk into a comedy club, even when things were opening up again, and I felt like, you know, what is going on? Like I would be in the middle of a set, and ask the audience, what am I doing here? And it was like, yeah, yeah. Like people in the Midwest who like, weren't really that worried about COVID, and I was coming from New York city, where there's like boxes of bodies on the street, and I'd be like, what are we doing? And they're looking at me like, ladies, you're bumming us out. Yeah, how about that? When we leave LA, I moved the whole family, we moved the whole family up to North Carolina, where, you know, they were aware of the pandemic, but the same situation where, you know, they just hadn't tasted the insanity that people living in big cities had gone through. And I remember just being like, realizing like, fuck, if this is some low-level form of PTSD, these people think I'm crazy, because I'm like stuttering to them like, you don't understand, you know, everything was on fire, and we left, the sun turned red, it would look like blood. Well, the sun looked like blood, and they're just like, what are you talking about? Yeah, so, so strange. I mean, and are you back in New York right now? I'm back now, yeah. I was in LA in the beginning of the pandemic, though. Oh, right. Yeah, I ran into you at the comedy store sometime right around the end of the world. I remember that now. Yeah, yeah. How's New York now? Are people starting to freak out about Delta? It's, no, I think that New York, once things opened up in New York, the CDC was like, hey, guys, we're not done battling COVID, and New York was like, maybe you're not. Like, we're done. Like, New York, I mean, we're still walking around with masks on and stuff, because New Yorkers just, they're just like, just let me go to work, you know what I mean? Right. Just let me keep going to work. And so, we'll do what we gotta do to battle COVID or whatever we have to do, but for the most part, right now, things are very open, and things are, people are vaccinated, and people are just living their lives. It's kind of great at the moment. Yeah. Knock on wood. I keep hearing that. I keep hearing that. I mean, here in Austin, it's very loose, people aren't worried about it, and I was here for only a few days and got fucking COVID. You know? Yeah. I'm vaccinated, so it wasn't so terrible. When we were talking, and I'm sorry if this is something you don't want to say publicly, I'll delete it, you had COVID? Yeah, I had COVID after I shot the special. It was so weird because I got my second shot. I had had, I wonder if, had I had my first shot, or was it like right after that that I had my, yeah, I had my first shot at the end of March, and then I had my second shot in April, and I got my second shot, and then, I think I had to get a COVID test for a shoot that I was doing, and it came back positive, and I was confused because I got a positive test, and then I got a negative test right afterwards, but let me tell you something. The side effects that I had from the second shot were really bad. Like, I was like, if this is just side effects, and they're not COVID, and it's not COVID, I feel fucked up, and I also couldn't smell anything for like a solid two months, just couldn't smell anything. So I'm like, I definitely, some people said that I had a false positive, but I'm like, I don't think I did. I think it was, I think it was real, you know? Cause I could not smell anything. Yeah, yeah. It's such a weird disease. It's like, it's got this like psychedelic quality to it. It's like, I don't know what it's doing. Okay, I'm not alone in that, thank God, cause I've done drugs my whole life, so I'm like, well, I don't know, I could just be burnout, but you experienced that. Can you talk about that a little bit? Yeah, there's a weird thing that happened. Like, I remember when I was in the hotel room with my husband, who didn't get it, by the way, who didn't get COVID from me, and I was like, it was right when, it was the night after I'd gotten the shot, and I started to feel this weird like thing in my forehead, like it was like a sinus infection, and then I started to look at my face, and my face looked like if you drew a face on a volleyball, you know, like there was just, there was less definition in my face, and I, and then I started to say things that you would say in the middle of a bad trip or something, you know? Like I was like, I was asking my husband, why can't you make me feel better? Like a baby, you know what I mean? It's like that baby voice that comes from your childhood, and just like, comes out and is like, someone please help me, you know what I mean? Like that kind of like, and that's how it felt. It was a very weird, there's kind of a psychedelic quality, I think, to every sickness, every time you get a fever, you get this sort of like weird, it's like a return to your childhood, and that's sort of how I felt every time I did psychedelics. You know, I was like, oh, I'm taking a trip back in time here, emotionally. Oh, do you have a favorite psychedelic? You know, I don't really like them. I mean, if I had to pick a favorite, I guess it would be mushrooms, but I don't really like psychedelics that much. I'm not like, I love control. I mean, it's really like, I like to feel in control, and it's not just like, it's interesting because it's not like you're out of control with psychedelics, or it's not like you're less out of control on psychedelics than you are in general, in your life. But the thing that freaks me out the most with mushrooms or acid or anything, it's like, it's losing my mind and having people witness it. It's people seeing me is really, if you get really down into it, it's people seeing me and seeing how frightened or scared I really am, you know? Oh, okay, yeah, sure. Yeah. And so. That's great. It's, yeah, I mean, I've thought about this a lot. Because, you know, I. Go ahead, sorry. No, I've been sober for a long time now, and a lot of times I think about doing ayahuasca, you know, as a, really for spiritual purposes and to kind of dig deep and kind of find what's left to unearth, and because you unearth a lot when you're sober, you walk around. It's like, there's nothing to sort of quell the emotions. So. Right. There's a lot you learn about yourself. It's kind of a meditative way of life in the sense that you go through things. Yeah. And yeah, so I've thought about it, but I just, it's so scary to me. It's really scary. I wanna thank Purple for supporting this episode of the DTFH. Doesn't it seem like the world's against us from getting a good night's sleep this time of year? You know, like, I don't know, maybe because we end up getting COVID and are waking up in the middle of the night, not sure if we're gonna end up in the hospital, like what just happened to me over the last few days. But when you have a purple mattress, you can sleep cool and comfortable, no matter what the world throws at you. That's because only purple mattresses have the grid. Its unique ventilated design allows air to flow through to help you sleep cool, even when it feels like a thousand degrees out or you're running a low grade fever from COVID. And the grid is amazingly supportive for your back and legs while cushioning your shoulders, neck and hips, no matter how you sleep. Unlike memory foam, which remembers everything, the grid bounces back as you move and shift. So you never get that I'm stuck feeling you do with memory foam. I have a purple pillow and I love it. You know what it is, and I don't care if this makes me sound pathetic, it's my go-to hugging pillow. You know, cause like at night, when you wanna like cradle something that isn't alive, you know, like a pillow, it's the best. It just feels cool and it's great to sleep on. It's like something straight out of Star Trek. And look, I know we've all been beaten over the head by charlatan pillow mongers out there, but purple is the real deal. You want a futuristic pillow or mattress that makes you think like, holy shit, maybe the singularity is about to happen. Then purple is the mattress for you. I love them. You can try your purple mattress risk-free with free shipping and returns and financing is available to you. Purple, it's comfort reinvented. Right now, you'll get 10% off any order of $200 or more.

I love you purple. Yeah, I get it. Well, I think some of my sober friends will mention the ayahuasca idea. And I mean, I love drugs and I always feel like a complete jerk or a hypocrite. And I'm like, don't do that. Like, because my friends who are hardcore addicts, they almost died. Like, they, you know, they, in any time that they start using a relapse, they almost always die again. And so I've, whenever I hear them say that, as much as I love psychedelics, I always think, wow. But what if, what if, like, how do you know? You don't know what's gonna happen. Like these fucking shamans, there's no certification for shamans out there. You don't know you're gonna end up right in the brain. You don't know you're gonna end up right in the brew itself. Apparently ayahuasca just means brew. So it could be any number of ingredients inside of the thing that you're taking. That being said, you could probably find someone who is like good and all of that. And, but my God, I've heard it's, people have to do it more than once. And then suddenly you're having to do it multiple times and then the next thing you know. That's the thing. Because I know, like as someone who is very addictive and has been addicted to many things, one of the massive, I have massive respect for sober people. Because when I do start, when things start getting weird, when I'm sober and shit gets weird, I'll just be like, oh, I'll just get fucking stoned. Like if I start feeling the thing, whatever, existential dread, the fear of death, a general sense of wooziness when it comes to my relationship with reality, it's like my meditation teacher invites me to sit with that. And you know, what is that? Explore that, get into that. What's going on there? What is, what is that? And you're like, how do I RSVP know to that invitation? Exactly. But maybe psychedelics don't have to be something you eat. I mean, you know, cause like that's the other thing. Whenever I hear about these 12 steps and these meetings and these rooms, it sounds like witchcraft. It's these like cabals of people doing some kind of communal secretive healing ritual. You know, it's real. So maybe, you know, that's pretty intense just by itself. You know? Well, yeah, there is like something about it that is, there's like a connection where I feel like when I, okay, so I was at a club a couple of weekends ago and I got, I ordered a Diet Coke and they brought me a Diet Coke, but it had, it was filled with Jack Daniels, right? They didn't know I was sober. So I took this giant swig of it. It's happened a couple of times to me in my career. And, and I, I was, it kind of rocked me. Like I was like, oh shit, you know, like right before I go on stage. And I just texted a friend who's also sober and was like, oh fuck, I just did this thing and I just, I'm about to go on stage, but I just like, I had to tell somebody. It was this weird thing where I was like, I'm going to tell somebody and then I'll feel better. And it's just somebody who suffers from the same thing, who has been sober the same amount of time as me, who's also a comedian and was like, it's happened to me four or five times in my career. Get on stage, talk about it. It's going to be fine. Call me tomorrow. And I was like, oh okay, cool. You know what I mean? Like I wasn't upset anymore. It was just this, it's the needing to be understood needing to know you're not alone. All of that, that you would seek from drugs or alcohol. You just get it from people. And it's harder to do, I'll say that. It's harder to say to somebody, hey, I'm scared. Or like, hey, I did this thing and I'm ashamed of it. Or it was an accident, but I still feel guilty and you know, all of that. But it's useful, you know? Yeah, I mean, look what you, again, like I'm not trying to see, I mean, I love psychedelics. They're the best. I love taking drugs. I'll do them for the rest of my life. And I, anyone out there, I've heard really great things about psychedelic therapy, you know? And it's, you know, the data on it is really good. I have a friend who's a psychiatrist and we talk about it sometimes using psilocybin to treat addiction and stuff like that. It could really work. So I don't mean to say don't do the ayahuasca. I just feel like I'm going to get a million fucking shitty tweets from people being like, it healed me, cured me or anything. So I'm not, I just, I'm old now and I'm careful with stuff like this. But this, to me, what's interesting, sorry, one, very quickly, it's interesting to me that you are such, that you have chosen a profession that invites you to bear your soul to strangers, to show your true self to people because if you don't, they know and then they don't like you. But also you don't want people to witness this fear that you're talking about, this, you know, this inner self that you feel like you're hiding from people. It's just curious to me that you have, it's like you've literally picked. Like there's so many other jobs where you don't, but is that, maybe that's part of what makes you funny? I don't know, is that you're, if you're, is, how, I guess, how different is the rosebud on stage from the rosebud off stage? Well, it's so like, it's, I really don't feel all that different from who I am on stage. But I, there is one part of myself that I 100% leave out of my comedy, I think, and or have been, and it's something that I've been dealing with over the pandemic where I, I think before, and I think in this hour, my tendency was to, I was so sure of myself, you know, and I was so sure about the things that I was talking about, and I also, just to be fair, being on stage is a very controlled experience. I mean, I have literally spent years, like making sure that the wording of these jokes is exactly what I wanted to be, that I could defend every joke that I've written, and that I, I could even like expand on it, you know, so all of that is very controlled. I have a microphone, the crowd can't, can't talk back. I mean, they can, but it's like, I have the mic, so there's already, there's a power dynamic there where I'm in control and they're along for the ride. But, you know, I don't talk about like my sensitivity. I don't talk about like moments where I felt vulnerable and I'm trying to, I mean, I, of course, I talk about my sister's death and all of that, but I don't like, I don't know, there's like a side of me that's very sensitive and I feel like it doesn't come off on stage because my sense of humor is not sensitive. My sense of humor lacks sensitivity, I think. And, you know, I, like I watch my husband on stage and he talks about how like, he has this great joke about his mom, he's like, you know, when I was born, my mom had such bad postpartum depression that she couldn't hold me without crying. And he says, and my, my question about that is, why do I know that? And it's just like... That's a great joke. It's such a good joke and it's so, like, it's so, you just know everything about him in that one joke, like it says everything about who he is, like deep inside. And I really, I want to be able to channel the parts of me that are, that feel vulnerable like that and to make them funny. This episode of the DTFH has been sponsored by Babble.

You don't think talking about what happened? That, to me, seems incredibly vulnerable and brave and almost impossible to talk about offstage, much less in front of people. I had worked through all of the complicated feelings about that before I ever started talking about it on stage. I think that I left out jokes that I could have expanded on and even more, you know what I mean? I could have expanded on what's hard about it. Now, after the last year, it was like the pandemic happened and then my husband and I were trying to get pregnant and I had two miscarriages back to back and it was like, now I'm like, thank you, but I'm trying to talk about that on stage and the way that things are coming out, it's still fresh in the sense that I'm still working through a lot of the feelings privately. But then when I get on stage, I'm also talking about these experiences, like the advice that people give you when you go through a miscarriage is so misguided and how the way that my response to some of that advice is I think pretty funny. So I'm trying to talk about that. I had a friend call me up and unprompted was just like, there's nothing wrong with you. And I thought that's so nice if I had said that I think something's wrong with me. You know what I mean? But I compare it to walking up to a single woman at a wedding and being like, you're not ugly. It's just like, so I'm trying to kind of get into that and it's really a fun, this is the beauty of comedy and of any sort of art form, right? It's like you keep digging, you keep finding where you're afraid to go and you just keep going there because that's the only way that I know how to do this. Therapy's great. I've been in therapy for eight, nine years now and it's all like body therapy where you punch pillows and yell at your dad and get things out of your body. But doing it on stage in front of people, having people witness the humor in what you're going through is more empowering to me than anything else. Fuck yeah. And God bless you for going after those motherfuckers because they need to stop. They need to stop. You know, it's like a whole legion of demonic, compassionate people. That's what's so fucked up is they're legit. I want a friend of mine lost her, I don't, I'm going to change the, a friend of mine lost someone very close to, why am I, we've had these conversations off Mike. So I just, you know, I remember having a conversation with a friend of mine who had a catastrophic loss in their life, unexpected, horrific, horrific. And listening to her talk about just what you're saying, just these well-intentioned people coming up to you, trying to comfort you when you're just essentially like, you're like a fucking crater. You know what I mean? There's a vacuum that used to be someone that you were married to walking around in your life and you have people coming up, giving you these like weird flippant Dr. Phil fucking things. And like she, but she was saying, you know, what I've learned to do is just recognize what's behind it is love. You know, it's like, it's like, it's like somebody, it's like a fucked up kid bringing you like a bowl of diarrhea mixed with crayons. I mean, like, I made this for you. But, but the thing behind it is they, they love you, you know, that, you know, so, yeah, but fuck it. I'm so glad you're attacking that because it has to, I don't know. What do you think is the right, is the right way for people to react to someone who has gone through something like losing someone they love, miscarriage or a great loss? What, how, how are we to react in a way that is respectful? You know, I think it really depends on the person. I, like, I would love for there to be a rule, you know, but I don't think there is and people have all kinds of different beliefs around death and, and feelings around loss and so there's really no right way to do it. I just think that, like for me, some people would look at the way that I react to loss. Like when somebody says that they lost someone, I never say I'm sorry because I, I feel like that's asking for them to comfort me. You know what I mean? So I just, sort of, I do that. I gotta stop. I just did it to you. No, but it's, it's one of those things. It's, it's like a natural reaction. It's the way that we have been conditioned to respond to that. Right. And so I always just say, oh God, you know what I mean? And then I just kind of witness where they're at with it, you know? Cause you can tell, like if somebody really wants to talk about it, they'll, you know, talk about it. But if they're in the middle of, like, a story and they have to mention that somebody's dead and then they're trying to get to the point and they don't really want to get, like, caught in the feelings that go along. It's, you know, you can tell they're just, they're trying to get to the other side of the story. And so I just, I kind of, I just go, oh yeah. Or I just witness it, you know what I mean? That's really what I felt like. One thing that I noticed with miscarriage specifically is that no one talks about it and no one knows what to say. And they tell you as a woman, like, you can start trying again as soon as you want to. And you, and they never, like, they never go if you're ready or if you want or like, and it's so crazy that we're supposed to just go through that and then go to work. Like, you just, because being pregnant changes you biologically on so many levels and then, and changes who you are. I mean, so I feel like part of what I'm doing on stage right now is trying to incorporate who I've become through that experience, which is like, to be honest, a much more, much gentler person than I was before I ever got pregnant and before I ever experienced a miscarriage. It was like, I mean, that's like the, you want to talk about a psychedelic experience. That shit is fucking crazy. Like, having had the experience of just being pregnant for as long as I was is like, I mean, it's like opening the fucking doors to a whole other, you're like, I'm a shape-shifting superhuman. It's awesome. And I don't feel necessarily like bad for myself that I didn't have a kid. That's the thing that I came out of this with is like, I was feeling awful and I was crying and I was like, why would this happen to me? And I realized that a lot of my grief was tied up in women are supposed to have babies and if I can't have a baby, I'm not useful. And that's not, and then I was like, oh, maybe I'm crying because I still on some level believe this bullshit. You know? Wow. So, you know, at the end of the day, I truly don't see this loss as something that, I see it as a step in my own evolution, more than the loss of something or someone, even though it's also that. So it's very, yeah, I feel like I just babbled on for a long time. No, you, I'm so, it's so nice to hear you. It's one of those things, you know, as a guy, there's nothing, there's nothing we can say. You know, I have kids and when I've watched my wife go through it, there's nothing. What can you say? What can you do? You really do become like this kind of, I've become just a bumbling, stuttering dope. I mean, there's not much you, you're, you're watching. So, you know, whether, no matter what, it's, there's very, I can't think of anything other, anything to say in the face of it. We need something better than what we've got in our language for this shit. We're just in that, and I'll tell you that thing where they're like, okay, back to work. That thing, to me, that is one of the most shocking qualities of human society where it's at right now. It's like, somehow there's no place for that. There's, you're just like, okay, you know, dust yourself off. And then, you know, just go back into the fucking mosh pit of society. Like, it's nuts when I went in and we need something like God damn it. We need something like some kind of like orb, like a little glass orb that you will keep in a special pouch in your pocket where someone tells you something like that and you break it in front of them. You don't say anything, you just break the glass. Right. Maybe it makes your hand bleed a little bit. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's kind of why I talk about the stuff that I talk about on stage is because I'm just like, why can't this be part of our conversation? Like, why can't we talk about tragic shit with the same ease that we talk about everything else? Like, it's there, and it's a part of our life the same way that everything else is. And if you have to go back to work on Monday, you should at least be able to say, oh yeah, I just had a miscarriage this weekend. Fucking crazy. Yes. You know what I mean? You should be able to say that. If you got attacked by a dog, you would say it. If you saw your friend get like sideswiped by a moped, you'd say it. If like, you know, if like your dog got carried off by a hawk, you'd fucking say it. But for some reason, women who have gone through that are invited by some, I don't know what, some societal whatever the fuck to not talk about it. To the point where when you get the positive on the pregnancy test, you are instructed by one person. Inevitably, you know what, don't let, don't share the news for this many months. Yes. Because you know. Yeah. You know what I mean? That is so weird. It doesn't make any sense at all. What the fuck is that all about? Right. It's superstitious. It's creepy. I know. And yeah, I'm so I'm glad you're talking about it. It's fucking crazy. And I, I never paid attention to any of that. Like I was somebody that like the second that I got pregnant, I was telling everybody. I was like, Oh yeah, I'm pregnant. Yes. And then everybody was like, Oh, you shouldn't tell people. You shouldn't tell people. And I'm like, I'm so fucking glad I told people because otherwise I'd just be walking around like a fucking Trader Joe's employee on 9 11, just smiling through the craziest shit. Like, you know what I mean? Like you have to. I mean, you got to, you have to honor your own experience. That's pretty much all I'm trying to say is like, you have to be honest about what you're going through. And you're not because the thing is you're not unique. Like we're not, you're not that special. Like everyone's going through it. So fucking like be honest and let people know they're not alone. And it's, and because it's a fucking crazy life. Yeah. Is this, do you think this is something, this is like, and this is another part of this epidemic, right? You, you hear about these statistics. You read the statistics about how many people have lost someone at this point. It is right fucking insane. But where I don't see the, the, I don't see people expressing what I would imagine people would be expressing, you know, with the amount of insanity that's happening in the world right now. It's, you know, there's a job I heard about. It's a professional mourner. Have you heard of this in the Middle East? You're heard of these people. You pay them to come to funerals and stuff. They scream and they pull their hair and shit like that. Like, but it's basically like you said, like when you're at, what's that? I said, I want that job. Me too. But it's almost like an acknowledgement of like, look, this is you, you know, I get it. You can't do it right now. But here's someone who will like make the sounds that you're, you're feeling inside. But fuck. Right. I do get the feeling that people are just kind of like pretending at this point, nothing's happening. And that is really making things a million times worse than they already are. Yeah. You know, it would be nice if people were just like acknowledging that this is completely fucking crazy. Like this is, this is going on and on and on and we're all confused and like everyone's like weirded out. I know I'm the one who's babbling. I've got brain fog. I can blame it on that. No. You should see what I'm seeing right now. There's like, no, I'm standing on the TV right now. No, but you know what I'm saying? Like, like we, like I'm in fucking quarantine right now. This isn't normal. I'm like sitting in a hotel room day fucking eight or nine of a quarantine. It's what we do. People do need to be open about this bullshit because otherwise we're just all going to turn into robots. Yeah. And it's already happening. I mean, like the way that people, I mean, like, I was talking to somebody. I think it was Drew Michael. He, he shared about going to his grandmother's funeral on zoom. Right. And what it was to experience a funeral on zoom, like, like grief, which is like just the rawest, realist emotion out there through the prism of your computer screen. And like how, how disconnected you can be from someone who you knew as they like, it's just this crazy experience. And I don't know. I think there's like, we have somewhat, we've removed ourselves from our humanity while trying to honor one another's humanity. It's this weird fucking thing. It's a, there's this cognitive dissonance that's happening because, you know, I go online and I see on Twitter just like people who are not real. Like it's not, it's not real because it's on Twitter. But the emotions that it can, that it like stirs up in me, especially when they start to like go after like a friend of mine. Right. And I, I get so furious because I'm like, you are talking about a whole person as if you understand them completely and as if you've ever met them even once. So it's just this crazy shit where I'm like, you guys are fighting for people you don't know against someone you don't know. And it's all for, for the good of humanity. But what, you're not helping humanity. Like you're, you are, you're a disease. You are, you know, the same way that people who think that everything is, that all of this is fake. Like it's so funny to me that people in QAnon, which is a literal cult, are constantly talking about the importance of forming your own opinion. Like, I'm, I'm like, you're, you're in a cult. What? Yeah. Well, there's someone's like retweeting a meme that says, be an individual. You know, it's like, like, not even, a lot of the time they're not even saying anything. They're just regurgitating memes talking about individuality. I know. I know what you mean. Put my head through a fucking wall. I swear to God. I like, it makes me furious. It's so mad. Oh, you know, yeah. It's getting, it's like, yeah, I think the only answer and I can't do it. I was like looking at Twitter today and getting upset, you know, everything on there and very different things. And I'm just thinking like, what, I need to like get off of this shit. Like of all the drugs I've ever been hooked on, this one's the most destructive. This is the one that's causing me the most anxiety. This is the one that's distorting reality like in horrible ways. Yeah. Maybe that's what we're doing ruining my creativity too. Just like, you take your creativity and just fucking flattens it. And yeah, there's no, I have no ideas all day because I'm just looking at people's opinions of me. You know what I mean? Yeah. It's like, what? And how especially now is my, yeah, I'm, well, yeah, but with the special coming out and everything, it's like, I'll just read through people's opinions and it's not the ones that are good that even make a dent. You know what I mean? It's everything that, that I even tried, I even tried to, at the end of my special, I put this guy who just cracked me up. He was just so funny to me because they asked, I was like, get the crowd's reactions, you know? And they went out and this guy was like, you know, she's, she's just trying to hard to be edgy, you know? She doesn't, she's trying to, she's trying to hard to be edgy. Which, it's so funny to me because that alone is like, that is just, people are like, comedians never push, like, they never push the envelope anymore. They're all just, and then you do it and you're, they're like, oh, it's too much. You know? That's a, that's a bit much. But also, yeah, but also then that guy is like, it's, he doesn't know that what he's saying is gendered. But if I was a man, he wouldn't, he wouldn't have the same reaction. And like, I, I, I never really am one to go to, this is happening because I'm a woman. I think it's very easy to go to that. And if you do jump to that conclusion, you kind of miss out on a lot of opportunities to better yourself as a human being. But in this case, I, I watched that and I was like, that's so funny. He has no idea. He doesn't know that he is feeling that way because he doesn't want to hear a woman tell these jokes. You know? Well, yeah. I mean, look, we all know, like if for women, like the number one easiest job you can do is stand up comedy, for sure. It's just. Oh yeah. No, just the easiest. Yeah. Everyone loves, everyone loves, loves women comics. They don't have a hard time at all. I mean, at all. I said, trust me, I've been through the fucking ringer. I'm a, I'm a dude. I got a fucking beard. You know how hard it is to get on stage with a beard rose, but it's really fucking hard. You know what? Can I tell you something right now? I wouldn't disagree with you, but I do think that it's like it's not. I wouldn't disagree right now. I mean, there's it's so funny, like the fucking victim Olympics that happen. But I think that at the end of the day, I look, it's not an easy job being a stand up in general as a woman. It's very tough. But the things that are tough about it are so much bigger than like, you know, some club owner not booking as many women. It's the fact that like you, you literally have to sacrifice having a family because there's no protections or mater maternity leave or fertility extension, financial aid. There's none of that. That is the stuff that's really hard. And that's like, I have to call the president to like fix that. You know what I mean? That's like not fixable right in this decade. So no, you know, I look at it, but it's, but criticisms like that are so funny to me because they are not only are they gendered, but they're also my own criticisms of myself. Like when he said that shit, a part of me was like, he's right. You know what I mean? And he didn't even have to say it for me to think it like it was already there or else it wouldn't have made an in a dent. And I just thought, well, why don't I just put it in? Why don't I just roll credits over this dude? You know what I mean? So funny. Also, you wouldn't have put it in if you didn't know that you had an incredible comedy special. I mean, maybe you would, but come on. You knew it was good. This was after you'd edited it, right? Like this is when it, okay. So that's why you put, I mean, look, you put that in there. I mean, cause that was, you have a killer special on your hand. So it's like you, you did the worst thing you could do to that guy. Like that was really quite cruel. If you think about what you did to him, it's like you edited this wonderful special and then you put this asshole in people are going to, everyone's making fun of him now. I'm sure he's being attacked online. He's probably just so depressed. Like he was like, what the fuck did I do that for? Oh, but good for you. I mean, cause also that, you know what I hate? I hate, and I think I'm allowed to hate it because I've been guilty of it many times. I hate edgelording comedy. I fucking hate it. It's lazy and annoying and it's not what you're doing. That is not what you're doing. So his criticism was just completely fucked up on every level on every level. Right. Yeah. Um, you know, by the way, I think you got to go. It's a three 36. You got a little more time. What's your schedule looking like? Rose. I got some more time. I got some more time. Listen, I'm doing nothing. I've got like, I'm going to walk my dog and go to the cellar and that's it. Okay. Beautiful. Thank you. So zoom roll. What do you think? Zoom, but for funerals. Like, huh? Like, huh? What do you think? We could do it. I love that. Zoomerall. Oh, my God. That's great. I think his problem was zoom. The interface doesn't, I don't even think you can choose like a nice, respectful, black zoom. You can't. So seeing the blue of zoom and then like, you know, it probably could clash with a casket. That's me. Yeah. Now I'm the fucking embarrassing edge, Lord. I'm sorry. No, I think it's perfect. We put some flowers in the corners. You know what I mean? You get a filter on your screen with whatever you would be bringing to the funeral or, you know, like whatever your religious icon, iconography is, you could put that in your, in your shit. I think that's great. No. Yeah. I love it. Let me tell you something. They would sell that as if it was the most compassionate thing that had ever been created. They would sell that like they were doing a favor for humanity. Yes, they would. I mean, I, I think you probably popped someone's balloon. I imagine someone had already poured tons of R and D money into this thing already. It's like, look, people are dying to plague. We got to do, we got to make a respectful funeral zoom. Rosebud. Did you do, did you do comedy over zoom by the way during the pandemic? Hell no. I'm sorry to put off your question. Did you, it was, no, it's, did you do that? I didn't, but I, there was a lot, well actually no, I did one bachelor party for like $2,000. I roasted a bunch of bachelors on zoom, which was like pretty great. But the easiest money I've ever fucking made. But I, there was a company that basically was created for comics to do shows like corporate shows over zoom. And I, I recently got an email from them saying that they have developed an AI robot to tell jokes. And they were like, we're thinking about developing a show around this where the comics respond to our AI robots. And I was like, oh my God, you guys were just studying us. Like that's what, holy fuck. That is so scary. That's so scary. I know. Yeah. I know. I want to write back and be like, are you out of your fucking minds? Like. Yeah. No. What is wrong with you guys? Comedians, we're so, listen, every comedian I know is so like weirdly has just been like, our job will be around no matter what. And then the fucking pandemic hits and it's like, fuck, no, it won't. Guess what? You can't tour anymore. You're fucked. But still comedians are like, yeah. But you know what? At least we're not going to get replaced by robots. Yes, you are. Yes, you are. It's like they're going to, it's just a matter of time. I mean, this is, I talk about too much on this podcast, the point where people get annoyed. But this is like, and I know, like I read an interview with you. You mentioned celebrity conspiracies. Like, you know, and I don't know exactly what you meant by that. Like, because there's a lot of different potential celebrity conspiracies, but the whole, like my favorite one, my favorite of them all is the idea of like celebrities being replaced by their clones. Yeah. Do you ever go that deep into it? Yes. So what do you think? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Great. I'm sorry for not doing deeper research into that. But can you, what do you think about that? Do you, like, do you believe it in what I believe it, which is it's, well, maybe, but probably not, or do you, what do you think? I honestly think that as long as the celebrities are still getting the money, I think you're doing them a favor, like let these people live, you know what I mean? Let them have a regular life, give them their privacy back and let the clones do the work. I feel bad for the clones because the clones are coming in just, you know, having no idea what regular humanity feels like. But in a way, that's probably better than what they're doing than just, than having had a regular life and being thrown into celebrity. Because I don't think people ever think about how traumatic it must be to lose your right to anonymity. You know? Right. Yeah. That's gotta be fucking crazy. I mean, but you're, it's, you've, you've experienced, you're experiencing that. You're out there. People know about you. You're in, if things, you know, after this special, it's probably going to get, it's going to get, you're going to have to deal with that yourself. I mean, are you, I mean, surely you experienced that. I've been like recognized a couple of times, but it's not like people are watching what I tweet or like watching what I do and being like, because the truth is I'm not successful enough to worry about it. Like there's, there's a level of celebrity that you get to where people all of a sudden want to take away your life. Like there's like, I've watched it happen, you know, and it's all so fucking tribal. The way that we like lift these people up and make them in gods, right? If you look at the way that we were like just, I'm talking like eons back, right? We would take someone and we would, we would make them a God. We would treat them like a God. We'd give them all the best clothes, the best food, the best housing, and then, and then we would sacrifice them to God. And that is what we do to celebrities now. And it's so fucking weird, especially with the canceling. It's like the, the, the way it feels so fucking Catholic, like let's excommunicate them. It's just so fucking gross and nobody seems to go, guys, this isn't progressive. This is no regressive. Yeah. Yeah. And it's hackable as the other scary fucking thing. It's like bad enough that these mobs of who the fuck knows whoever are doing this, but then add to it those sinister pictures of like a bank of like 700 cell phones that all have their own individual Twitter accounts that are just randomly tweeting from different places to give the fucking illusion that there's something going on in that regard and that anyone who can just put together 700 phones, not even that 300, 300 phones and just sick them on whoever you feel like sicking them on or reversing it. You could like inflate someone with just 300 phones, a thousand you're cooking with gas. So it's like the whole, there's an illusion to, to, to it because for some weird reason, people are just assuming that the people behind these accounts are even human beings when most of them aren't, they're just bots. And then some percentage of them are, are like, you know, who the fuck knows, like working for this company or that company. And so yeah, I know what you mean. It's like a invasion of the body snatcher situation, you know, but what are you going to do? You made this great special. What are you going to do? I mean, do you have a, do you have a plan like some, some, you know, I know you've seen it. I've seen it. Some of my friends, you know, all of a sudden they like explode into the stratosphere and like they get, you know, they become so fucking famous and then everyone's just attacking them out of the blue. But what's your plan? Do you, what are you going to do? If like, if, you know, you put out a great special, it's, yeah, what are you going to do when they come for you? That's the last question Rose, but what are you going to do when they come for you? I've thought about that, dude. I've thought about that a lot and I don't, for the amount of time that I've spent thinking about it, I really have come up with zero plan. Like I don't have one. I've, I've like, I'm like, I think the best thing to do is not say anything. That's probably the best thing to do because the more like, if you react to it, it ends up like, inflaming it more. And I like, I really love the way Michael Trey deals with his haters. He's just like, he like enjoys it. You know what I mean? Like he really has a fun time. And I think a part of me really enjoys doing shit like that. But then, then I don't, I'll have a moment where I'm like, oh fuck, I'm just, I'm just like making things harder for myself, you know? And so I, so I'll like take it down or, or I'll not respond. But I just, yeah, I think it's better to just not say anything. And that's probably the hardest thing for me to do. But that's what I'll do. Most likely. Well, disappear for a second. No one's going to come for you. You're great. You're going to be this special. I'm telling you, this is a, it's so nice to see a special, you know, and like the thing like when I was, when I was the talent coordinator at the comedy store, you know, like, and I got to spend time with Mitzi and this is the kind of special that she would have just, she would have loved it so much. And it's not my place to speak for her, but like, she really like, that was how I not just like, I mean, obviously the, your, your act and your, and your performance, but the way the whole production was so simple, but so somehow it was like super glamorous at the same time. It like brought me back to like, you know, those like great special, the prior specials, you know what I mean? Like those great, simple, awesome specials.

Hello my sweet friends. Hello my sweet little motes of nothingness parading around in bags of meat. It is I, Duncan Trussell, the skrillex of podcasting and you have tuned in to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast. It happened. You are allowing the flocks of words flying out of the cave of my mouth to nest in your brain. You are allowing the flocks of words pouring out of my mouth. These flocks of words, the beating of their wings sounds like my raspy lesbian voice. You are letting these things nest in your brain. You are letting them fly into the caves on the side of your head that you call ears. They fly in there and they nest. What an honor that you are allowing the word birds of my mind to fly into the cave holes on the side of your head. That really does amaze me and I am very grateful to you. I will do everything I can, everything in my power to only let the good birds fly out of my mouth during this podcast. Not the bad words. I don't mean bad words like shit or fuck or all of those which are obviously not bad words at all. They are both crucial as descriptions for essential aspects of human existence. I am talking about bad words. I am talking about the dark raven words. I am talking about the demonic word birds that fly out of people's mouths and fly into the caves on the side of your head and infect your mind with a darkness that can cause you to behave in pretty terrible ways. In the old days, flocks of shit words that flew out of the cave of a person's mouth and into the ear cave of another person infecting their mind with dark thought patterns were called curses. That was the name for it. Cursing a person, cursing a person, you can definitely curse people and you may have been cursed. In fact, most unfortunately humans on this planet are operating under the spell of a series of very dark curses that came from the words of doom flying out of the mouths of bad magicians, usually completely unconscious of their power, usually completely unaware of the great potency that they wield. Every time they open up the caves of their mouth and allow the dark language bats, the vampiric parasitic entities that flock together in the form of shit sentences to go pouring out into the universe and infect the inner sanctum of their fellow human beings' brains. But it happens all the time. The fucking TV is one of the number one purveyors of curses on this planet. That thing's a curse machine gun that you turn that thing on and you will get rocketed into your brain. So many flocks of dark ideas and sentences that before you know it, you could be sitting in front of that fucking thing watching your fifth hour of forensic files and feeling that the dimension that you are currently existing in is a hell realm. Go out into the world and you see the world through the lens of forensic files all of a sudden. You don't see a beautiful, spacious, garden of Eden style planet with color and sound and light, which is amazing to be able to behold. You see a place where if there's a kid wandering by himself, that son of a bitch has probably got a four hour lifespan before some trench coat wearing hook handed mustachioid demon comes driving by in an ice cream van, snatches that kid up and throws him in a wood chipper after fisting him for a few hours. That's a curse, man. That's a curse. You've been cursed. Now, sometimes maybe curses are fun for a lot of people. It's fun to walk through the world and look at it through the lens of danger, horror, awfulness. I think this is the number one reason people watch the news. We get a new curse every few months when it comes to news. There's always a new currently the way we're being cursed is ISIS. A lot of people are stumbling through the world right now who have been cursed with ISIS fear, the fear curse of ISIS. There's a lot of people who wake up in the morning and worry about ISIS and they live in fucking Idaho. Think about that. There's a lot of people who every morning within six minutes of waking up, they start thinking about the dangers of ISIS. They start thinking about the potentiality of some future terrorist attack in some part of the United States due to ISIS. When they wake up, they don't think, Holy shit, I'm a perfectly harmonized cloud of atoms capable of orgasm. They wake up and they think the Islamic Caliphate is at this very moment setting up bases all over Mexico and they're planning a massive terrorist attack against our sweet country. All thanks to that motherfucking B-rock Obama and his insane policies. Oh God, where's my respirator? I need a cigarette. They're cursed. These are victims of the dark sorcerers that run mainstream news. And most of us have been cursed. It's kind of inevitable when you exist on that planet. I don't know if you guys are aware of the fact that there's a kind of fungus called cordyceps that will actually get into the brain of an ant and the ant will climb up on tree limbs and explode this fungus down on his fellow ants and they all become infected too. Well in the same way curses travel through generations via the words of parents to children and those fucking things can go on and on and on and on and they can get more and more and more and more powerful and people can just go crazy. Some parents just hang over their children just like those infected ants and they dust their minds with fear patterns that have existed for millennia and you might be one of those people who have become possessed by negative thought patterns and that's called being cursed. What's the opposite of a curse? A blessing. How do you get rid of the weird shitty thought patterns? Well there's lots of ways. There's psychology. You can find a great therapist. You can start meditation. It's up to you. Really. You just have to decide you want to do it. You have to make the decision. It really is and I think Alex Gray and Allison Gray taught me this that you get to depict. You get to pick what window you want to look through. Do you want to look through the cursed lens? Do you want to look through the window that's covered with all the negative sentences? Do you want to look through the lens that's filled with all the dark words that have been told to you by slumbering magicians who didn't realize that they were unleashing demons every time they opened their mouth and those demons have the tendency to fly into the ear holes of anyone who happens to be around and drag their lives into a dark mediocre state of limitation, guilt, and anxiety? They didn't know it's not their fault. There was no malice there. They were just infected by a linguistic fungus. You can choose to look through that window or you can do little thought experiments. You can allow yourself just for fun. You don't have to believe it for the rest of your life, but just for fun. Just like an acting exercise or a little bit of make-believe. You can move your eyes from the window of doom into the window of paradise and just stay there for a second. Pretty quickly, a lot of sirens will start going off in your brain. All the various curses will start activating and one of the first things that might come into your consciousness is if I have hope, I'm going to be disappointed. Ooh, that's a powerful curse and it's gotten a lot of people. It's gotten a lot of people good. If I allow myself to believe this now, I'll be hurt in the future. It's some variation of that. That thing will start kicking in, but just for a second, just for a second, as much as you're able with your will or however you transform your thought patterns, allow yourself to sit still and imagine that you are limitless, that you can do anything that you want, that you deserve love, and that you are a slumbering volcano of bliss. You know how like there's inact dormant volcanoes? Well, you're a dormant love volcano and you can at any second erupt and geyser pure unfiltered love into your community, into your family, in the form of selfless action. It can happen. I believe it can happen. Allow yourself the fantasy that it can happen just for a few minutes each day and then get back to your forensic files marathon, study the results, do these exercises and then keep a little journal and write down any change that happens in your life. Write down anything that happens that's different from the usual stuff that goes on. If nothing changes, then you don't have to do the experiment anymore. But if you find that by allowing yourself a few minutes each day to indulge in the fantasy that you're a limitless being that deserves love and is composed of love, who has the potential to radically transform not just your own physical body and psyche, but the lives of the people closest to you and this creates some kind of change for the better in your life. Well, then congratulations. You've figured out a tool that you could use to improve your little flicker of existence that you're currently enjoying in this dimension that we call Planet Earth. Hare Krishna! We've got a great guest for you today. We're going to dive right into that. But first, some quick biosnias. People, not a lot of people, but sometimes our parents have done that to us. Sometimes our friends will do that to us. They don't mean to do it. They're not malicious. They're not trying to hurt us. They've just been infected by a linguistic fungus that's been traveling through generations of human beings. And who knows where it started? The main thing is this. The takeaway is this, my friends. I invite you to do a magical analysis, a biological survey of the subjective life forms that you call recurring thought patterns to figure out what beings that are currently existing in the ecosystem of your brain cave are moving you in the direction of heightened states of bliss and happiness and joy and connectivity and which of these beings are dragging you down into the tar pits of limitation, sadness, misery, depression, guilt, and pointlessness. Just analyze it and then, I don't know what you're supposed to do, but it's a real fun thought experiment to allow yourself the beautiful fantasy that every single limiting thought pattern that you currently have is not an accurate representation of who you are, but is in fact the echo of a curse that's been placed upon you by some dark magician. I don't mean gargamel, but I'm saying a person who has fallen into the numb, ambient haze of modern life and is not paying attention to what they're saying to the people around them. And that could have been your mom, it could have been your dad, it could be your brother, it could be your boyfriend or girlfriend or husband and wife. They didn't mean to hurt you. They just became the accidental transmitter of a dark paradigm that has been afflicting humans since we were being dragged out of our huts by Vikings and decapitated and raped by Genghis Khan. It's a dark time back there, man. We come from a pretty vicious world. We've had some dark periods here, so during those dark periods, people start saying shitty things to each other and that echo can go on and on and on and on. Quote my dear friend, Joe Rogan, the echo of savages. I love that phrase. Anyway, don't let yourself be cursed, guys, and for God's sakes, don't curse. Allow yourself, and you can go right back if you want to, into believing that you're a limited, awful, horrendous, angry, bloodthirsty, selfish piece of shit if that's where you want to live, if that's where you want to hang out, if that's the universe you want to be in and that's the window you want to look through. I get it, man. I've looked through that window for a very long time and I understand why it could be fun. But just for fun, pull yourself away from that window and allow yourself to look through the insane window of the alchemist. Allow yourself to look through the window of the practicing magician, the yogi, or the bogey, or the saint, or the mystic. Just for a second, you don't have to keep looking out that window if you don't want to. You're welcome to go back and look through the window of doom whenever you want to. You can get right back to forensic files. You can get right back to watching Nancy Gray stammer about semen samples. You can do it, but for one second, allow yourself to imagine that you are a limitless, super powerful, creative force that with focus and discipline can, starting right now, create a temporal wave of positivity that will not only roll through your physical form and manifest as health and getting into shape and having more energy and just feeling good, but will actually roll out of the cave of your mouth in the form of angelic words that spontaneously erupt at odd moments in the day. And those have been called prayer, where all of a sudden you find yourself just saying thank you to nothing in particular or to everything. Imagine, just for a second, that that's what you really are, that you can be a kind of fountain of bliss that goes erupting into this dimension, a volcano of joy that explodes into your particular community. And it can happen in an unexpected way, just like out of the blue, volcanoes will suddenly explode. In the same way, out of the blue, you can start exploding love into your family and friends and work and business. And not in a bullshit way, not in the phony bullshit way where people explode love when really all they're trying to do is make you feel like a goddamn asshole because they're better than you, but in the actual way where suddenly you don't even know what you're saying, but you're saying just the right thing at just the right time to the person who needs to hear it and you don't even know why. And you don't even have to worry about why, but it can happen. These volcanoes have been exploding throughout history. They exploded in the form of Buddha and Jesus and Muhammad, Albert Einstein, Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Mother Teresa, Amma, Neem Karoli, Baba Ramdas. And it can happen to you. You are the very crest of the wave of existence. As far as we know, you are the most advanced being living in the galaxy that you've incarnated into. And relative to the great universe that you're existing in, you are one, they're not a lot of humans. Sure, it seems like a lot because the planet ain't that big, but compared to the number of stars, compared to the number of galaxies, there's not a lot of us here. You're special. You're unique. You have such incredible power. You're running the exact same bio-computer that gave birth to such things as the theory of relativity, electricity, quantum physics, all philosophical systems, yoga, and anything that any human ever did. You're running that exact same computer. That's you. That's you. That's the kind of power that you have. You can literally do anything. You can be the being that intuits or channels an entirely new system of thought that can transform a huge part of the biomass that you're currently a member of. It happens all the time. Happened with Buddhism. It happened with Islam. It happened with Christianity. It could happen with you. I'm not saying you're Jesus. I'm not saying you're Muhammad. God, who would want to be any of those things anyway? I mean, I guess if you really like people, I don't know. But you can actually... I see I'm doing the opposite of a curse on you right now. You can actually, at this very moment, this very moment, create the first movement. You know, like an avalanche can start with a pebble. Just a pebble moved out of place can hit another pebble, which hits another pebble and creates a chain reaction that creates an avalanche. You can, at this very moment, if you wanted to, move that one little pebble, that one little piece of limitation, whatever it may be. You can just push it a little bit and you could create an avalanche of limitlessness in your life. Whatever that fucking means. You could do it. You could do it. You're a limitless being that deserves love and you exist in paradise. There, I said it. You deserve love. You exist in paradise and you have the potential to do anything you want, regardless of what your current situation may seem. And I don't mean this in a kind of like televangelist bullshit way. I'm telling you, read Victor Frankel's Man's Search for Meaning. Study. You got to work hard. I'm not saying if you just lay back and suddenly decide that everything's perfect, everything's going to become perfect. No! The blessing I'm placing on you is a blessing of action. And it's got to fucking start with the realization that you're limitless. It starts with joy. It can. It starts with allowing yourself to go crazy. You let yourself go crazy. That's the point. You let yourself become Don Quixote. You let yourself believe that you're a hero, even if your current patterns of activity happen to be completely meaningless. You let yourself, you allow yourself the delusion that you are made of love. You allow yourself to pretend that and see what happens. Just see what happens. Like a scientist. Study it. What happens if you allow yourself to be hypnotized by this hippie spirituality rant that I'm spewing into your ears right now, allow yourself to be temporarily lulled into a state of believing that you are incredibly powerful and that you matter and that you can do whatever you want and anything that you think is limiting you as an illusion, then pretty wild shit will start happening in your life. Try it. Just do the experiment. If it doesn't work, go back to forensic files. If it doesn't work, find where it does work. Find your footing. Find your place where the thing works out. But just for a little while, go down into the subjective chasm of your consciousness and drive out all the bats that exist there as any limiting thought pattern that keeps repeating in your mind. See if you can do it. Replace them just temporarily and see what happens. It's pretty fucking cool. It's pretty cool. It could possibly result in you changing the way you act. It could possibly result in you beginning to act in ways that amplify and accelerate your physical well-being, your health. It could get you to the gym. It could get you jogging. It could get you to take some class that you've been putting off taking. It could get you to read more. It could get you to start moving in the direction of amplifying your feelings of bliss. And if you want to feel good, one of the best ways to do it is to start taking care of your body. There's lots of other ways, too. And not all of them involve plunging a needle in your fucking arm or pouring booze down your throat. Though those things will allow you a temporary state of bliss, it's true. They definitely have a high price. There's other ways, my friends, other ways. What did I just say? It's fun. I love you. You deserve love. Fuck it, I said it. God damn it, I fucking said it. Beautiful world. It's a beautiful world. We have a beautiful guest today. We're going to dive right into this podcast. But first, some quick business. This episode of the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast is brought to you by the electronic genies over at Squarespace.com. Squarespace. I'm going to admit something to you guys. I've said it before. I used to be a charlatan web designer. I tricked myself into believing that I knew how to build websites and I actually took money from a few people to build a subpar mediocre crap website, which I pretended was okay. That's the problem. There's a lot of charlatan web designers out there. There's some really good web designers, but they're super expensive because they've spent years developing their craft. It's hard to find a great web designer. And if you're somebody who's wanting to start a business, you might not have a lot of money to get the business going, which is why Squarespace is awesome.

Your hands will be trembling because somewhere in the midst of learning to code while on Adderall, you witness the black leathery wings of an ancient species of immortal nefarious entities that want nothing more than to climb out of the darkness and drag all of humanity into hell. So don't go there. There's no point. It'd be better for you to study the Necronomicon than to try to learn how to code. Go to Squarespace today. They support this podcast. I hope you'll support them. At least try out a trial membership to torture your dad. It could be lots of fun. Give it a shot. Squarespace.com. Use offer code Duncan. And thanks, you guys, for supporting this podcast. We're also brought to you by Amazon.com. A great way for you to support this podcast that doesn't involve donating or buying one of our beautiful t-shirts is to go through our Amazon portal, which is located in the comments section of any of these episodes. Amazon's incredible. You don't have to go to a store to buy anything anymore. They're amazing. And if you live in Los Angeles, they actually have a grocery delivery service. They will get stuff to your door the next day, sometimes the same day. It's shocking. I recently bought a Fitbit Flex, which I highly recommend. This is one of these body tracker devices. It's the high end of their body tracking pulse tracking devices. I've been wearing it and it's so addictive. I don't know why, but there's something really empowering about knowing how many hours you've been sleeping and somehow this thing tracks it. It also has GPS in it tracks how far you're running. It's pretty cool. If you're thinking about getting in shape, something about gathering metrics about what you're doing really seems to help motivate you. You can get one of these things by going through our portal, located at DuncanTrustle.com. If you buy anything through them, they actually give us a small percentage of anything that you buy and it costs you nothing. And it's a fantastic way to support the show. And to those of you who have been doing that, God bless you. Thank you. The Amazon portal is doing better than it has ever done before. And that's all because of you. And I hope others of you who are listening will consider going through that portal and bookmarking it. We also have a lot of great t-shirts located at DuncanTrustle.com. Some other cool stuff there. My favorite t-shirt right now is the one by Ron Regi. It has a Hamza on it and a lot of different symbols which are designed to create a metaphysical shield to ward off the evil eye. Which is what happens when a player hater gazes at you because they can't stand the effulgence of the radiant beauty glowing out of your third eye. And I'll try to shoot you down by giving you an eye roll or a glare and these shirts are designed not only to protect you from the evil eye, but to draw potential lovers to you at music festivals. That's right. If you find yourself at a music festival and you're wearing one of these shirts, hopefully, theoretically, it will draw to you other listeners to the show. And it is my wish that the other listener that this shirt draws to you is someone who you will fall in love with, someone that you will make sweet love to in the dark of the night, and someone who you will suckle upon and lick and touch and allow your mouth to descend upon their briny, luscious holes. Please get one of these shirts. You can go to DuncanTruzzle.com, click on the shop link. It's there. And finally, forgive me for this long intro. It was really fun to do. I've got some live shows coming up. Very exciting. On July 21st, I'm going to be doing stand up at the Montreal Comedy Festival just for laughs. And I'm also going to be doing a live podcast out there. That's July 21st and 24th. If you go to DuncanTruzzle.com and click on the link, you can buy tickets there. Okay. I think that's about it, guys. Let's get on with this podcast. Today's guest is a comedian and DMT aficionado who has a wonderful podcast called Here We Are, where he interviews science experts across the country. He also has a new comedy album coming out called My Big Break. It's actually out right now. You can get it on iTunes, Amazon and Spotify. Links will be at DuncanTruzzle.com. And you can check out his comedy special mating season, which is available on iTunes and Netflix. Everybody, please welcome to the DuncanTruzzle family hour podcast, Shane Mouse. It's the DuncanTruzzle family. Shane, welcome to the DuncanTruzzle family hour podcast. Thank you for coming over. As often happens when you're doing a podcast, we started talking about neuroscience. And I asked you and you were saying, you know, some of it's hard to understand. Yeah. And I asked, really, I wasn't recording and I asked you, what's the most difficult thing? What are you having the most difficult thing understanding in neuroscience? Should we just start over? Gotta leave that in there. Okay. All right. So I would say the, what I have the most trouble with, and it's, it's not that, I mean, I have to study a bunch of different fields for my podcast and everything anyway. So I'm not just concentrating on neuroscience, which is good. It's, it's bad to just stick with one area. But I think with neuroscience, the big thing is, is you have kind of how the brain works on these big levels and then how it works on just the, the scale of like the neurotransmitter. And, and understanding those two things is not that difficult, but the stuff that's happening in between, I think is, is really, really, really, really difficult. But the stuff that's happening in between, I think is very difficult. So. But it's safe to say no one quite gets the way it's working just yet, right? Right. Especially like our non-conscious mind and stuff. We get, we kind of have to look for evidence of things. So like a great example of it is, is a lot of neuroscience is almost like metaphors for what's happening. So I just had a guy on my podcast who wrote a book called The Rational Animal. It's a very good book, pretty straightforward. And the idea is, and you have to think about these as metaphors, not like some solid fact of exactly how the brain works. Right. Is that, so, so, you know, it's, he's an evolutionary psychologist and, and the idea is, you know, we're trying to pass our genes on, where, where there's vehicles for our genes. And to do that, you're going to need a bunch of different strategies. So we all have to do these various roles in our lives to, to effectively pass our genes on. And so, so we have, we wear these many hats. So he separates it into seven sub selves, which is like a survival, you know, like the, he calls it the night watchman on the lookout for danger. And then, and then there's a disease avoidance sub self. And then there's like a social sub self or hanging out with friends and, you know, getting along with coworkers and whatnot. And then there's a status sub self. Yes. Kind of aware of, okay, I need to work my way up whatever hierarchy is relevant in this particularly particular environment. And then there's a mate acquisition sub self and then a mate retention sub self. Yes. And then a child rearing sub self. So those are like the seven sub selves. I, I'm way into meditation. I think there's like kind of an eighth one that's more of like an observer. I think that's kind of what you're acting as when you're meditating and you're seeing like ideas floating by. Yes. I think a lot of those ideas are coming from kind of the seven sub selves. Again, this is more of a metaphor than anything. Right. But, but a good example of how these sub selves work is they can be primed in various ways. So like a really fascinating study is, is he took, he got two descriptions of restaurants and he got them just right so that your average person would pick one or the other just 50% of the time. So one restaurant is like, Hey, this is the main restaurant in this city. Right in the top, you know, tourist area. Everyone that comes here goes here and, and blah, blah, blah. And then there's another restaurant that's like, Hey, this is a neat little gem tucked away. You know, if you're willing to go through the, you know, the back alley or whatever, you'll find this. So, so people will pick one of these with like 50% of the time, but then they prime people by showing them a movie. So if they show those people a horror movie and prime that fear response, people will pick the popular restaurant that's like around a bunch of people and, you know, well lit and safe. But if you show someone a romantic comedy and prime that mate acquisition sub self, then people will go and pick that other restaurant to like, Oh, this would be a romantic place. Oh, that's so cool, man. I don't studies like that are so cool because you know that they just must come up again and again in the boardrooms of corporations as they, you know, because when, when I went to school eons ago, we called that kind of, we called that black psychology corporate psychology, which is the, not that you're this guy necessarily studying that for the corporations, but a lot of neuroscientists have been hired to discover ways to manipulate the masses to sell products. Of course. And it's so interesting. It's like, it's like Target. Do you know Target's famous study of how they, how they figured out to tell when a woman's pregnant? How? Um, so it was just this computer programmer who worked for Target and they were trying to figure out they're like, how would we know if a woman's pregnant? Because if you can get pregnant women to come into Target, pregnant women are too busy and they don't have any energy left. And so if you can get them there to get one thing, like say you send them a coupon for diapers, then they're going to get everything else in that one stop. So, so that's a real boon. And then they're shopping there for life, you know, so, so this is a big money market. So they actually figured out through a series of algorithms that there was, there was like three or four simple things that intuitively don't make sense. But when added together, it's a good chance you're pregnant, which is like, it was like some multivitamin like zinc or something like that. I forget what it was and a larger purse. And then like some other bizarre thing like that. Um, that, that was, or like jogging pants or something like that. It was, if you got these three things, chances are you're pregnant. It was so crazy cause they would send in the early stages of it, they would send coupons for diapers to, uh, like at one point, um, a girl's father called Target complaining. Like, why are you sending my, my daughter, these diaper coupons? She's not pregnant. And then he called back like a week or two later apologizing because she was pregnant. Target knew she was pregnant before the girl's father did. And then the other thing is, is they, is it's kind of creepy. So Target finds out that you're pregnant and then all of a sudden you're getting these dark diaper coupons. And then that seems, you know, very shady and, and people don't necessarily like that. So what they do instead is they put that diaper coupon still on the front, but they surround it by like, here's a coupon for a lawn mower and like all this other stuff. Yeah. To hide it. Pull up bar. Yeah. Yeah. People get really nervous when they hear about the very detailed research that's being done on them by people who want to make money from them. And it's a uncomfortable feeling to know that this research is generally being used to extract money from people. That's quite often what's funding the research is crowd manipulation. And it gets even more sinister when you consider, okay, if Target has done this level of research and all they have to gain is simple money, right? How much more research is being done by the CIA? How much more research is being done by governments around the world who have world domination to gain from it? And how many of these studies are being made public? Right. Right. Because when I think about the NSA and all the stuff that came out from this just treasure trove of data that they have extracted, I think, you know, I bet they're not just using that data to try to hunt down terrorists or monitor homeland terrorists or whatever nefarious reasons Alex Jones may have for it. But I bet they're actually using that data in ways that we don't even know yet. Right. They're trying to take the pulse of all of society to understand how deep the hypnosis is maybe, to understand when the next move is going to be, like how fertile the ground is for the next war. It's the military industrial complex is behind a lot of it, I imagine. Oh, yeah. It's kind of it's insane. I've heard stories of scientists being brought together by the military and everything to kind of brainstorm locomotion and in like wild animals to figure out how to make a tank work better. Yeah. Just like real, real strange. It is unfortunate because most of the scientists that I meet doing my podcast are, I mean, seemingly have pure intentions and are just interested in understanding human nature. It's just that they also have to get these studies funded and everything. Yeah. Someone has to fund them. And maybe if the general public was more interested in this, you know, there's like Gladwell or Skydan Ariely that are pretty popular writers about kind of like a lot of behavioral economics stuff and that sort of thing or like the free economics stuff. And I think when the general public is interested, then there is a lot more research done on our behalf just kind of helping to understand ourselves. Sure. But otherwise it needs to be funded from somewhere. It's always like that. The story is the king gets, gathers together the great wizards or magicians of the kingdom and has them do whatever he wants them to do based on his desire for conquest. It's an old story. It's like the oldest story ever. Right. And it's fun to think about. It's fun to imagine the cobbles of scientists who've been paid off by the military industrial complex. And it's fun to, because I like to think like, okay, if I've got infinite money and I suppose that the United States military has something like infinite money because we print money and we've got, we print our own money. So they're like outside the game. So they've got infinite resources, right? So when I think about that, I had infinite resources and I had access to the world's top scientists. Not all of them. I'm sure there's some scientists who when they're contacted by one group or another, like I just don't want to do that kind of research. I'm sorry. But I bet there's a hundred more for every one of them that's like, fuck. Yes. Give me that security clearance. Let me in. I will help you invent an invisibility cloak if I can. We'll work this shit out. You know when they're sitting around brainstorming, because they must brainstorm, right? These think tanks of scientists and somebody from the military must sit down with them and say, listen guys, it's probably not possible, but we kind of want to control the weather. Yeah. They're like, well, we'll look into it. Don't know if we can or not, but we're definitely going to look into it to see if we can control the weather, because if we can control the weather, we have the ultimate weapon of war. We have the ultimate weapon. If you can control the weather, you can conquer the planet. All you got to do is figure out a way to do it. Possible? Probably not, but guaranteed at this very moment. There's scientists working in some fucking government laboratory trying to figure out if they can control the weather, right? Wouldn't you say? Right, right. But I mean, scientists also expose all sorts of insane stuff too. Like I had a guy on who's like a modern archeologist. So he does archeology of like modern stuff that happens. So he looks for, he goes down to the border of Mexico and there's this part in the border of Mexico where they just funnel immigrants through into the states. Basically, they use the desert as a deterrent. Wow. And so they actually have the fence up and then they stop the fence so that everyone will go through this one part because it's like a five day hike through this desert. And a lot of times they see them on like day one and they're just like, well, we'll just let them go. We'll get them on day five when they're like starving and tired and to really teach them a lesson. And then people are dying and stuff too. So he's going and he's finding like people's like old shoes and water drugs and stuff like that, that they're leaving behind and exposing this kind of nefarious thing that our government is doing. So and the other thing is, is that I don't think our government is, I wish our government was more intelligent. And actually, I think a lot of times our government doesn't give a shit about scientists. I'm not that worried about the mad scientist stuff because I don't think, yeah, when it comes to like invisibility cloaks and stuff like that, yeah, you can get some funding for that. But I wish they cared more about having scientists run some of these studies. Like I just got done talking with a guy who's like probably going to eradicate AIDS. This dude is maybe going to eradicate AIDS. And he's doing it on like a shoestring budget because we're not, we're not putting money into stuff like that. Have you ever heard this great quote by Alistair Crowley? Mad, I'm going to butcher this here. Magic is what the vulgar call, magic is science for the vulgar. It's really cool. Like, you know, a lot of people when they hear about Crowley, they rightfully so. A lot of the stuff is, who knows, complete fucking lunacy. But what they don't know about him is that he was really into science and really into the scientific method and really into studying the subjective universe through a stringent, strict lens to try to understand the internal state. And his idea was that this guy curing AIDS is doing magic. This is magic. And the fact that we know how it works doesn't therefore negate the fact that it's magic. But what this guy is doing is he's eradicating a demon. There is a world dragon conquering the planet right now. There's a dragon running rampant through the world. It's called fucking AIDS. And this guy is coming up with a way to defeat that dragon or demon or monster, whatever you want to call it. And he's using some very guaranteed. He's using the most high tech tools accessible to him right now. And when it comes to science, those tools generally seem to involve the manipulation of reality at the quantum or near quantum level, right? That's what they're doing. They're the genetic level. Very, very tiny, tiny manipulations of the universe that result in massive profound changes in the external universe that are no longer tiny. The splitting of the atom being a classic example of this. So what's so cool to me about science is it gets down deep, man. It gets into the deep, deep, tiniest recesses of the dimension that we're in. And it creates insane chain reactions that result in massive shifts in our biomass. It's fucking magic as far as I'm concerned. I like to call it magic because if somebody, I think probably because when I was being taught science, it was by an asshole. So now the word sucks for me. Yeah. Yeah. I remember my chemistry class in high school. My chemistry teacher gave us like an extra credit homework assignment on he has this idea that we're all we all came because we all came from Adam and Eve, which he actually believed. Yes. The literal interpretation that we all came from Adam and Eve. We're all because we're all a product of that incest. That's why we're getting dumber from generation to generation. Wow. This is what my chemistry teacher was teaching kids at a public school. Yeah. Yeah. It's unbelievable. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. But yeah, and it is amazing the holes in science. So when you ask like what I have trouble with in neuroscience, it's so, so you take like kind of this bigger idea of these sub selves, which is more like toward the end of what's happening in the process of the brain. But then if you go back to the beginning and what's happening just on this small difference of these neurotransmitter and these action potentials being blasted off by one neuron. Yeah. And then how that arises into this neural pattern and then how those build and construct ideas and how ideas come into being. Yeah. That's where everything kind of falls apart is trying to find that. Like you mentioned physics, it's like trying to unify, you know, the theory of relativity with the quantum world. Yeah. Right. And that's the real challenge. The, that to me, one of my most profound LSD trips was sitting and listening to classical music and I'm listening to it and I'm tripping and it's such, it was very good LSD. This is years, probably the best LSD I ever took. It was years and years ago, very clean, liquid, just wonderful stuff. Like you know, every once in a while, I don't know if you're, do you, have you ever taken acid? Yeah. Yeah. So I took acid like seven times and then had got in an accident on acid and then I stopped doing acid up, but I still do mushrooms and everything. With acid every once in a while, you will encounter a batch that feels like it was just taken out of the oven, like fresh cookies or something where it's just like, it's somebody just whipped this stuff up and it's like, for whatever reason, it's amazing. And I don't know the science behind it and it's been unfortunately quite some time since I've taken LSD, but this stuff, man, I was so good and I was listening to classical music and then I was watching my thoughts. This is before I ever knew anything about mindfulness or Buddhism or anything, but I start watching my thoughts and then I start thinking, where are my thoughts coming from? Like where is this question here coming from? What's producing the thoughts? What's the prelingual thing where it goes from a nothingness to a somethingness? And in that moment, I just went back all the way and got the, where the subject and the object merge that can happen on a psychedelic, where suddenly it was just like every your ego is just wiped out and for one quick second, everything, pure expansiveness, that sense of eradication of the self. And you're both watching it and a part of it at the same time? Yeah. Well, you know, from time to time, and I think that this is, is a possibility. You can, I believe you can just blink out. Like you can go to pure observer mode where that, which is being, you just become the witness purely. So you're not witnessing the witness anymore. You're just that wide open, unobservable eye that's just it, whatever it happens to be, whether it's, you've managed to get to the very back of the neurological, you're in the back, backstage of the neurological theater, whether you've merged with some universal externalized consciousness, depending on what language you want to use for it. You've zapped into that place, you know, where even your life or the every single thing that you are, or all the little pieces that make you what you are, it's just like a little moat of dust and this kind of vast, vast, vast thing that we all really are. What does science call that? Well, I mean, it's, it's very interesting. I, I, I try to challenge myself to think of science and neurological explanations for stuff like that. And, and it is a challenge. I, I do think that, that there's, like, if you look at, like, why, so everyone's like, oh, what's the meaning of life? And people always think there's like a meaning of life, not like a bunch of meanings that are, that are dependent on context and are subjective. But, but people think there's like a meaning. And this is, and it's strange because like, how old were you when you'd say you started thinking like, what, what does all of this mean? Like, I think I started thinking that when I was like, maybe five, six years. I, I started first having the, the little, little bits of questioning, like, wait, what is, what does all this mean? Right? I don't know if you remember how old you were. I, it's, it's like an ever present itchiness or something. Exactly. Exactly. So, so we can agree that like five year olds aren't saying a lot of profound shit, right? Right. So clearly this is the same, this is seemingly an instinct. And why would there be an instinct? Well, think about, think about what our DNA does. Our, our same, basically the essentially, we all have essentially almost the exact same string of DNA and that string of DNA has made astronauts. Yeah. Cowboys. Yeah. You know, Eskimos. Yep. It's, it's made, you know, we find ourselves in all these unpredictable environments. Humans are, have somehow been able to live in hot, cold, you know, whatever cities, rural areas and, and your genes don't really know what kind of environment you're going to be plopped into. Right. And so that they kind of have to just equip you with this flexible set of tools and then, and then leave it open enough so that you can take in the information in the environment and then use those tools accordingly for the environment that you're in. Oh, you're on an island. Here's the tools for an Islander. Oh, you're in a landlocked desert area. Here's the tools for that person. And you're saying that those traits come out based on the environment that you get shot out of a vagina into. Yeah. And then, and then this changes throughout your life history. So you hit puberty and now all of a sudden you go through all these biological changes. And now you have these new purposes. Now you want to get laid, right? Yeah. Now you have these new roles and you become a father. You have this new role. Yes. And so this is always changing. So my thinking is that there has to be something in there just always poking at you, always prodding, just being like, what is the purpose of this? Always kind of, it's just kind of a goal oriented kind of searching for a goal. What are you doing here? Yeah. Yeah. What's going on right now? Where should we, what do we do next? Yeah. And I think that that feeling of meaning of life is, I think it's, I think we have it the other way around. I think rather than our brains are trying to get us to a meaning in life, I think that idea of thinking that there's a meaning is actually on the backside prodding us, pushing us in our barriers. And it's got an evolutionary function. It's just trying to get us to investigate our environment more and more and more, possibly to add more data to whatever that strand of DNA is. Yeah. Is it kind of ex, you know, I love, if you ever, I'm going to mispronounce his name. You ever read any, uh, Taylor, Taylor de Chardon? You ever read any of his? No, I haven't. Oh, you will love him. He's great. This is a great book called The Phenomenon of Man that I've been reading and it is fucking awesome because he's a Jesuit priest, but he's really into evolution, like really into tracing. He, he, he talks a lot about the moment that geologic life or inorganic matter became organic matter. Cause that did happen on this planet and it's a mystery as to why it happened. What could have been a meteor impact? We don't know. We don't know. Could have just been the swirling around of just the right stuff that ended up creating this like insane miracle. We don't know what it is. It definitely happened inarguably, right? It had to have happened. The earth wasn't always flourishing with life at one point, but he talks a lot about how the earth in its pre-organic life state had all these potentials inside of it, right? Inside the earth was in the same way that inside of our DNA is the potential to make astronauts, Islanders, spaceships, time machines, microwaves. I don't know about time machines, but everything else. It's not outside of the laws of physics as far as we know. Theoretically, it can happen. But in the same way the earth had inside of it a fucking moon. The earth had the moon in it at one point before whatever impact caused the moon to explode out of it. You know, it had all this potentiality inside of it. It had the potential for DNA. It was inside that whatever the fuck the earliest version of earth was. And then this thing happened, which we don't know. And it's kind of infuriating because we might never fucking know. We have theories, amino acids or what do you call, you know, like we have theories and that's all we can ever have unless we do come up with a time machine and get to go back and witness that first fucking moment, that first moment. Oh, don't you love thinking about that first moment? The moment where the rock in the water became life. Right. Whoa, shit, that happened. There's all these like it's very like kind of fractal ish kind of moment. You know, it's like trying to figure out the point of when when does water boil? OK, so you have you find this set temperature and they say, OK, now let's try to find it, get a little more accurate. OK, so it's X temperature point five. All right, let's get it. Let's add another decimal point in another decimal point. Let's get it more and more accurate. And then you can actually never find out exactly the point that water boils. It's it's it's just it keeps on going infinitely. And there's that same sort of essence in that first little bit of life. Yeah, you could never figure it out. It's one of the great mysteries. And it we want to get back to what you're talking to originally when you go to the genesis of thought, you find yourself in a similar predicament, which is this planet, which managed to spit out super advanced monkey descendants, continues its strange function of creating something out of nothing or the recalibration or the mixing of certain molecules to produce that which didn't exist before. We do that constantly all the time because our fucking brains are constantly bubbling with thoughts that come from as far as we can tell nowhere like where to come from, like the joke that you tell or the the the time you say just the right thing or just whatever you're about to say right now, you can't figure it out, man. It's just like coming out of some general sense of momentum or something. It's just rising out of the nothing. Yeah, I mean, I guess I think about that a lot about about how how the genesis of ideas and where they go and every it's. But it seems like there are some kind of neural patterns in there. So, you know, you picture in your mind's eye, you can picture like a square or a rectangle or a circle, and this happens pretty quickly. Right. Yes. But but but then if you want to picture something like more complex, like say a bathroom, yes, what would happen is as you would maybe picture like a bunch of different. There's a lot of like what is a perfect bathroom? You know, is it public or private? Or there's a million different. It starts constructing all of these pieces, like in your mind as you're doing it. And each of these little pieces is arising out of somewhere and then kind of being constructed in sort of your conscious awareness and like kind of this point in between consciousness and non-consciousness. And you can form this idea in your head and then you can go and think about an orange or something like that. And the bathroom just goes away. Yeah, like doesn't exist in your consciousness anymore. And then you can bring that back and it's maybe back where it was. Yeah. Last where you assembled it. But like a better example of this is, is you have an idea for a joke. Say, you think of an idea for a joke and it's like, well, this is, I don't know why I bothered to write this down. It's a shit idea. Yes. Whatever. The idea goes away. And then a month later, it just pops back into your head out of nowhere. Like the best joke you've ever written. Yeah, better. And it's so much better than it was. It went into your consciousness like this homeless, drunken degenerate and, and then somehow popped out wearing this fancy suit with a top hat and all ready to go and ready to perform. And so what the fuck was that idea doing? Yeah. When it was down there. And I often think about as we were talking about DMT before recording is that I wonder, especially since doing DMT a bunch, it makes me think about this a lot is that so our environment, our conscious environment is getting information from outside of ourselves. We're getting the light bouncing off of the walls and here is going into my eyes. And and that's forming my consciousness is environment. Yeah. But what is the environment like in the non-conscious conscious and say, and say we did have kind of these, these, you know, seven sub selves just as a metaphor. Yeah. Say you had kind of these things in there that like that take shape, like the shape of an idea, then how. Like a good example is. Is if you want to, you know, if you want to remember something, they tell you like, say you want to make a grocery list. I got to go and get some stuff from the grocery store. So I need like some razor blades and and I need some Drano and some bottles of water. And then and you construct a story in like an outrageous story. In your head of of like you jump into a bunch of water and all of a sudden you're swimming through razor blades and yeah, and and you you need to get yourself unstuck quick. So you need this liquid. And so if you construct this outrageous story, somehow your brain remembers it a lot, a lot better. And so I think I think like these ideas are kind of going down into this visual processing area and they're constructing these kind of neural patterns that I think take shape like down below and almost create their own worlds. Yeah. And so I think there are like these beings and things like that that are actually just these various sub selves with different tasks within our mind. And it's just that that environment looks completely different and insane than the environment that we're used to. Right. You know, and it would be it would make sense to have it be like a very fractal ish world. I mean, that that's the best way to communicate a bunch of information would be a bunch of like holographic fractals would be a great source of because you can fit an infinite amount of information into a finite space with a fractal. Well, it's, you know, what you're saying are mine. It's like if you know the God, I say that I talk about this too much private, you know, if you ever heard of you heard of the immoral tablet of Hermes Trimestigerius, do you know about this? So this is like consider this is like an alchemical scripture and it's very simple and I don't have the whole thing memorized, but I do have the first part. I remember the first part and the first part is as above so below. So it's the notion that the way things work in the small tends to be the way things work in the big. Now, it seems like, you know, deep, weird quantum physics is showing that isn't necessarily the case, but it's mostly the case. So the idea is we've get, we know we're in a universe where big bangs happen because a big bang happened. We know that we know something happened 13.5 billion years ago that involved an incredible release of energy like a universe, our universe expanded and we're part of that expansion. The expansion is continuing to happen, right? So we know that whatever this dimension that we are in, we know one of the qualities of the dimension is that it creates universes, safe to say, because we're in a universe, right? So you can pretty much inarguably say that place that we're at right now has a tendency where it creates universes. So that universal, that tendency to create universes, I think probably is continuing to happen inside of our psyche because we're composed of the same material that the big bang is composed of. So probably the universal, the tendency for big bangs to happen or the inflation of dimensions or whatever you want to call where we're at, it's still happening inside of us. And it's probably, that's where you had, had down to when you take a nice suck on the DMT pipe. But, but, uh, uh, where it gets really curious is that the, um, you say, okay, these thoughts, they go down into the, as though they're a sub-seller, sub-basement in ourself, right? That's the, you've constructed that, uh, as a way to kind of, as a thought experiment to work out what could be happening. This is all simply metaphors, simply metaphors, but if you go, like, it's really gets interesting when you start looking at the quantum functioning of the brain and you, and you realize that way, way down there, we're dealing with something that's so small that it's being affected by the vibratory state of everything around us, that there's just a connection of vibrations. That's what's happening, right? It's like an undulating vibratory pattern that's manifested as our brain, right? That's what it is. I mean, I, for one, I just simply don't know enough about quantum physics. That never stopped me from fucking talking about it. And I'm not sure anyone does know how quantum physics is. Well, let's not call it, let's not call it, let's not call it quantum physics. But, well, I mean, the one thing that it does see, as far as, as far as we know, your smallest neurotransmitter is orders and orders and orders of magnitude larger than the scale at which the quantum level works. But the neurotransmitter has got to be made of atoms and the atoms have got to be made of quarks and neutrinos. And so it's still, even the thing itself is composed of this, like these tiny, tiny little points of data, which are inexorably connected to all other points of data and which sort of, you know, like another way to put it is, we are, you know, what we're in right now is an atomic soup that happens to have differentiated itself into the your form and my form and the room that we're in and all the aspects of everything. It's just a soup that has differentiated itself and its, its, its soupiness is always changing, but the stuff itself is eternal. You know, the stuff itself, energy cannot be created or destroyed. So the soup that, that's the, the deepest atomic elements of this stuff that we're in, it's never, it's not going anywhere, apparently, according to what is, which law of thermodynamics is energy cannot be created or destroyed? What is that? Um, well, let's see, it's not the second. Who fucking cares? It's one of them, right? But that soupy shit. I need to brush up on my physics. God, me too. What, but we're in this soup, right? We're in this soup, we're in the soupiness, the soupiness of matter that has differentiated itself into the form of thinking monkey descendants that have the tendency to create thoughts and they, we use these thoughts to manipulate the ex the soup even more. So that's what we, that's what we do. We are, are, we have these thought forms that emerge and then through those thought forms, some of us construct jokes or cars or spaceships or we basically use that to reassemble the soup to suit our desires or to suit our desires usually. That's what we do. That's what we seem to be doing. The question, this is where it gets cool, man. The, if we don't know where our thoughts come from, in other words, we don't choose to have thoughts, the thoughts just come. We don't choose, we can open ourselves up to fields of study that might produce certain thoughts or I can sit here and think, okay, I want to invent based on my complete lack of understanding of anything to do with quantum physics or science in general, I want to build a time machine. So what would I do to build a time machine? I can ask the question and I'll be met with a series of ridiculous thoughts based on whatever data I've accrued from watching like shit documentaries on Netflix and maybe from a few acid trips and maybe just from fantasy. And then my brain will produce all these varying possibilities that can lead me in the direction of inventing a time machine. But where those thoughts came from is a mystery, right? It's a fucking mystery. Even where the question came from is a mystery. No, no one decides to ask the question. The question emerges. The question emerges into us. That needling thing that you're talking about, we didn't decide to come up with that inquisitive thing. It's just in us, right? It's coming from something. Yeah. So what we're consciously aware of is kind of we're observing this like I already thought of these words before they were coming out of my mouth. And that was coming from a non-conscious. And then my consciousness is hopefully at best kind of steering things a little bit. You know, it's like the ships moving forward. And maybe if I can get some accurate amount of feedback from observing my environment, I'm able to guide my non-conscious into selecting words and things to talk about that are appropriate for this context. That's what we like to believe. Because if we don't believe that when we suddenly become these fucking autonomous, these mechanistic things that have no free will and we need free will because we don't have free will and everything's meaningless. But to get back to Taylor Deschardin, his idea, which is really fucking cool, is this soupy mass that we're part of right now that's differentiated in our separate bodies and all composite bits of phenomena or whatever. I'm sure there's a better way to say that. We're being drawn towards a thing that some future point that he calls the Omega point, there is a point that is actually sucking all of this soupy matter into it and the closer we get to it, the more we see an increased complexification and harmonization of the soup that we happen to be part of. And that's what we're witnessing in the birth of technology. And that's what we're witnessing in all results that come from scientific innovation is actually the sort of manifestation of this Omega point that we're getting sucked into. It's what Kurzweil calls the singularity, Terrence McKenna calls the stranger tractor at the end of time and that that itchy like prodding thing is not so much for us to like figure out how to get better at living in whatever particular environment that we're in, but it's actually the same fucking thing that makes an embryo grow into a human being, only the embryo that we're a part of is about to become some kind of, well, we don't know yet. Yeah. I mean, well, a few things, one, I mean, I don't necessarily subscribe to that way of thinking necessarily because I don't really believe that evolution has an direction other than in hindsight after the fact. Yeah, but it's very true that like that we have all of these things driving us that aren't necessarily in an individual organism's interest. Like our genes don't give a fuck about us, this vehicle that they want to be passed on and and here we are like obsessed with sex and everything. And we don't even, a lot of times you don't even realize that like, oh, yeah, like babies happen that you know, you're just it just feels good to blow loads. Yes. And so and so. To quote Albert Einstein. You are, you are just very much an Antonimitan, just running around and and you do all these, like a lot of people seem to think all of this intelligence and us sitting here philosophizing about whatever big idea is all just driven by this need to advertise fitness and to show off a good way to advertise fitness is to show off your intelligence and to do that. You have to do something costly, which is like, hey, I read a bunch of fucking bullshit books about this and memorized this and this. Yes. And now I tail feathers, tail feathers. Yeah, yeah, right. It's no more than when you see the nature documentary and the little guy throws up his tail and like does a dance. Yeah, yeah, like that. That's what I mean. You only need like I think I think they've constructed there. There's like a thousand word vocabulary that you can give to the military to speak like, if you know these thousand words in any language, you can communicate enough, but every word has all all these basically unnecessary words that we're using to advertise and everything. But but then back to saying, I mean, I don't necessarily like subscribe or like they agree with or especially in the past, I didn't agree with a lot of the things that you were saying. But I have like seen that stuff on DMT. Like I have seen like these this like kind of what you're saying. I it looked to me like a like a plane of existence. Like everything is existing in this weird, smooth pattern. And then like us as an individual, it's almost like just kind of bubbling up a little bit and then floating back in literally what's happening. And and and I mean, I definitely I've seen that. I don't I don't trust my perception, but that's that's definitely happened. I mean, like you are bubbling out of the earth and you dissolve back into the earth. There's no way to argue with that. Definitely bubble out of the earth and you go back into the earth. Right. You got to agree with that. That's for real. Yeah, there's no way around that. We bubble out of the earth and we melt back into the earth and the way we melt back into the earth is through either the bacteria eating us and we dissolve back into it or we get cremated and our and our bones and ashes get scattered. But we bubble out of the thing. We go back in and I love the genetic that that idea of like these genes, they don't give a fuck about you. They just need to travel on. Now, that sounds so dire to a lot of people because they want to believe that they're an individual and they want to believe that they go on forever and they want to believe that they have some great importance in relation to the some total of all other organisms that existed on the planet. And the reason they want to believe that is because it's somehow terrifying to imagine that you're just a part of this beautiful, unfolding biological miracle that is exploding out of this planet. And where it gets really cool, man, is like if you imagine that all organic life on the planet, if you were to like look at it from the fast, if you were to fast forward, if you could do the dream, which is to go back in time and then fast forward the whole fucking thing and watch it all happen. Dude, I've like seen that on on a really fucking hard mushroom trip. People, it's a dream. It's a fucking dream. But you look at the like, OK, you look at the Amoeba, right? And you see the Amoeba and the way the Amoeba will shoot all those. What are they called? Something pods that tendrils will come. So in Amoeba, if you look at Amoeba, it'll shoot out these weird pods or these tendrils, these like these like they have a name for it. As slime molds do the same thing where it's these beautiful tendrils come climbing out of the fucking thing, exploring its environment, right? So the sum total of the biomass on planet Earth is doing that very same thing. And the tools that it's using are all forms of organic life. It's springing out of the earth. It's spreading its weird tendrils all over the planet, investigating every fucking nook and cranny and a hole. Like when you see like cave fish deep in there, that's just a pseudopod. I think that's what they call it. That's a tendril of the biomass exploring the depths of some cave. And when you see human beings, that's just a very powerful tendril of the biomass that has expanded itself into the human form and is exploring its environment and from the exploration of the environment continues to fucking change. The tool refines itself. And that's what evolution is. Now, why it does that? Who the fuck knows? Well, there's some interesting ideas about that, too. There's like, I mean, so so what's interesting is what you just described was was these organisms with these tools to explore this objective physical environment. And now humans can explore this whole subjective world, this world of ideas. And how in the world did that did that rise? There's actually I saw an interesting idea one time. It was about how seventy five thousand years ago, there was this cognitive revolution and they don't know exactly what happened because there was the Neanderthals were around and they were they were bigger than us and seemingly smarter than us, seemingly had like better tools and everything else than humans were just kind of just getting by, just barely. There's these little tribes of fifty and here and there. And there wasn't that many of them. And they think that what happened was at some point, somehow, the human brain was able to understand the idea of subjective reality. So so like a subjective reality is is it hides in places that it's hard to see. So like if you want to define is Walmart and that so objective reality is like, you know, a door or the law of physics or something like that. But if you want to define is Walmart or target, we were talking about target earlier now, what is target is if you wanted to destroy target, say, how how would you do it? Would what if you bulldozed all of the target buildings? Would there still be a target? Yes, they could still build new buildings. But if you fired every target, the employees fire every employee. Now you could just hire there's targets still there. What about the CEO must be must be like the leaders of the company? No, they switch all the time. You can get rid of him. So how would you get rid of a target? Well, somehow, if a judge, if a judge decides they're like a monopoly or something. So if a guy wearing like the silly dress hits like a piece of wood onto a desk a few times and then says these words that we we all just agreed upon mean something, but actually don't. Target would no longer be a thing. That's right. It would be destroyed by an idea right then and there. You just describe magic and yet we but us being able to believe in these things makes our lives much easier. We're able to like, hey, let's go meet a target and you don't have to be like, but what the fuck is that? We grasp these subjective ideas really easily. And and they think maybe what happened 75,000 years ago, this cognitive revolution where maybe we are able to start grasping these ideas was that now all of a sudden these tribes were able to bond over a bigger idea before it was just them fighting off each other and everyone's off on their own or whatever and you care about your tribe. But now you're able to form these alliances based on these ideas of like a higher power or or or or some moral ideal or whatever it might be. And perhaps that was why that evolved in second Big Bang. That was the second. So there's like that was the subjective Big Bang, which is the the opening up of the internal universe that we are that contains all targets and all McDonald's and all thought and that's that is a really different. What's really cool about that universe is compared to the external universe. It's quite difficult to explore and because we don't have the tools yet to do it and I can't wait until we get them because that's going to be an awesome moment in science when they finally fucking figure out a way to. DVR acid trip. That's going to be one of the great moments in human history because because we're all we're all kind of doomed to description right now, which I mean, we love to do it because we're comedians, but it's not a very accurate tool for nor is it trustworthy. Like I can tell I can talk about my DMT experiences all day long. And at the end of the day, I'd be like, now, don't believe a word that I just said because I don't. Yeah, you know, I'm merely reporting with the best possible hope of grabbing on to like an essence of what I experienced. You can you can you know, the thing is you could always say like when I like so if I'm having a mushroom trip where I'm witnessing a legion of entities and seeing these kind of like woodland, wild spirit beings that seem reminiscent of like pan or like some kind of forest god. When I'm looking at that, there's a million things that I can tell myself that I'm seeing I can start at the furthest skeptical part that I can find, which is that this is chemically like shoving my finger against a digital watch and it's creating a kind of wash of symbols that I'm then applying meaning to or I can go to the other side of the scale and say, I'm seeing elves right now. I'm seeing living entities, but you get to pick what definition you want to give for that right now. But what you can inarguably say when you're seeing those things, nobody can argue with this, I don't think anyone can argue with anything, but I think it's pretty safe to say the universe does this. This is something the universe does. I'm witnessing a product of the universe. I'm witnessing something that actually happens. And what actually happens in the internal universe of our brain's subconscious, whatever you want to call it, is that there is a proliferation of disembodied beings, whatever you want to fucking call them, you can call them. And it really doesn't matter. There's something in there that's for sure. Yes, it's teeming with life. It's teeming with life. I I tend to think and by the way, I if I like, I mean, I smoked DMT on a podcast before and you can listen to it. What podcast? Ryan Singer has me and paranormal you. I don't know if you know Ryan Singer, but I gave it to him for his first time. And then I smoked it. But you can hear like before I smoke it, I'm talking to you like much like I a little bit skeptical about some of the stuff. And I spoke the shit and I explain what I'm seeing and I got out. I'm like, oh, yeah, this is all a lie. Right. Like there's not a doubt in my mind right now. Why is it a lie? This is all like a lie. Why a lie? I mean, you witnessed it, didn't you? You saw what you were saying. No, no, no. I mean, I mean, after I'm a DMT. Oh, this place. Yeah, this this real exist real quote on existence that that we're in right now is a lie compared to that compared to that. What do you think this is a lie? I mean, I I honestly just think it's all a lie. I don't I don't put any stuck in any perception when I think of the word lie. I think of intentionality behind it. Someone intentionally you sort of are personifying the thing into a trickster form when you say lie. So you're saying, I mean, I mean, first off, so so in that sense, it was like, oh, this is all like a simulation or something like that because because I just saw like the real deal and the real deal. But but now me talking about how is this a lie? I would say, I mean, just sex is a very easy one to go back to. Where it's where it's you're attracted to, you know, a nice, a nice fertile woman. You have you have these standards of what you're looking for. And a lot of it's like face symmetry and stuff like that is is what's giving you this idea that this is a good looking thing that you're looking at. And it's all kind of bullshit. Really, Maya, it's all it's like pure bullshit. You know the term Maya? No, I don't. So Maya is the term that in Hinduism, that's the word that they give for the universe. And that word translates into personified illusion is what they call it. Right. Another way they put it is this entire universe is like the reflection of trees on a lake. So what we're in is a reflection of some more substantial truth state. But it's still happening. Like this is real. I don't see it as a lie. This is a real we're in something real, right? Yeah. And it's changing. Yeah. And this is what I think is different from when you talk about the non-conscious world, I think it actually is very, very much different than the universe. I think the non-conscious is the realm of possibilities. I think is processing that. So so here's something I think about a lot. So take a moment in time. Like you had like you find out you have testicular cancer or something. Or like last year I break my feet, right? I jumped off this thing. I knew it was too high before I jumped. I was out hiking, landed my feet broke. I heard them break. I'm like, oh, I'm fucked. But at that moment in time, in your mind's eye, in your non-conscious, you think of you think of several different things. One, you think of, OK, what do I do going forward? Like your mind's eye runs a simulation. What do I do here? Do I call 911? Will that bring a helicopter here? Can I crawl down? So you're looking at all these various paths and then your mind's kind of running this simulation, OK, here's here's a number of options that you have right here. Let's follow this option to its logical conclusion. And then it's maybe and then that so I'm going to call 911. OK, let's run that simulation. What's that look like? And then that will branch off here. What if I don't have insurance or what if my insurance doesn't cover that? And that branches off and that branches off. And pretty soon there's these branches of possibilities moving forward. But at that exact same moment, you also your brain also looks back. So so this is a big part of how how we train habits is through dopamine. So you give like a rat and a reward for a light comes on and it hits a lever three times and it gets a reward. Yeah, trains you figure that out. And dopamine is the reward that it gets in the beginning. They they get the reward and then they get dopamine. But then after a while, dopamine is released right when the light comes. Yes, to motivate to get food or whatever. Because this is like, oh, there's something exciting. And dopamine is what what actually motivates you. And so it's like a way of your brain going back in time to see like, oh, that worked last time. Let's do like you can teach pigeons superstition. It's really funny. You can have you can have pigeons that that seemingly you train them so that they do tasks and they get a reward. And this is how their life works. This is their environment. And one day, just like when they're just hanging out in there, just throwing a reward randomly and then they'll just develop like a tick of like whatever they were doing. So they were like scratching their their right side at that time. So now they'll keep on like scratching that right side. Yeah, well, that yielded a result last time. You don't really even have to consciously think about it. Cargo cult, you know about cargo cults? No, I think during World War two, they were dropping supplies on some up until that point, uncocked, contacted islands where there were people living there who apparently hadn't had contact with humans for a long time. And so all of a sudden, you know, they're living in like that wonderful, blissful state of pre-civilization where everything that happened yesterday is probably going to happen tomorrow. It's all kind of like just the same day without any, you know, that's the way it is. And then all of a sudden out of the blue, a fucking goddamn box filled with crazy shit falls out of the sky. And so supposedly you look it up, man, maybe this has been debunked, but I'm pretty sure it's real. So they sounds familiar. They do what they were doing on that day in the hopes of summoning that thing back down. So so now think of so, you know, I can't pretend to know what it's like to be diagnosed with cancer. So I'll stick with, you know, my feet. So I break my feet right. And then so not only are these there are these possibilities going forward, but now there's all these possibilities backwards. What what if I had just argued with my friend a little more? What if I climbed down a little more instead of jumping? What if what if and you follow that backwards to a point where there is a decision and then you go, OK, what if I had done something else? And then that branches off into this possibility. So somehow in your brain, you have like this infinite amount of simulations of yourself all stemming from this one point in time going forward and backward. And and and so and that's doing that somehow and you'll see this when you dream. You can see this in perfect clarity. Well, I think in our non-conscious world, it is just always in perfect clarity like that. And this kind of life flashing before your eyes or whatever, it's just kind of your mind's eyes dipping down like quickly. If you're going to die quick, your your mind, your whatever consciousness that dips into the non-conscious is looking like, hey, do we have anything for this? Do we have any do we have any solutions to this problem? Just searching back through every moment in your life as fast as it could possibly. You know, you're falling out of the plane. It's so funny. Yeah, it's just like going through all the drawers in your house trying to find something you don't even know what you're looking for. You're just hoping to find something. Yeah, that's cool, man. Yeah. So now take what we were talking about before with this. Where does this idea you have a shitty joke idea goes down, forgotten about, and then pops out this beautiful, well-working joke a month later. And you haven't given a second thought since that first initial incarnation of it, and where did it go? Well, maybe that idea went and it was run through all these various simulations. Maybe there is a universe down there that takes like ideas, takes shapes. It's like where the penguins go to fuck. It's like, you know, like in there's like a place emperor penguins go to fuck. They like why they do it, who knows? But they go waddling so far into this blasted place to actually, I think it's not to fuck, it's to make babies, or maybe it is to fuck. They go there to fuck. They pair off, they make babies. Maybe that's our shitty ideas. They like migrate through this wilderness of our mind and there's some beautiful place where ideas just make love with other ideas and then come back pregnant and just give birth to some better, more evolved version of the idea. I love that. That's a really cool notion. Yeah, I've just been trying to like I've been trying to see it and just with doing DMT and like having these ideas before I go in and then trying to observe which changes things, you know, when you have idea. Like if you have a sense of what's happening in DMT world and then you go in, chances are it's going to give you whatever your inclination was, it's going to show you what you wanted to see, which is just more evidence that it probably is your non-conscious. Well, we've got to learn how to, I mean, like the trick is to, you know, this is why I love mindfulness practice and just learning to sort of watch, just watch the way it happens and not necessarily getting in there to try to make something happen. You ever go in a float tank? I haven't yet. I've been meaning to so bad, man. Yeah, man, they're pretty incredible. And when you're in a float tank, you basically you're like kind of going into a dream state, but you're wide awake. So you're dreaming while you're what your eyes are open, but you're going in this dream state and it's a practice like you have to do it more than once. I just did this. I went to, there's a great place in Austin called the Float Institute that I went to and did a two hour float. And then that was where, like, I don't, you don't know the amount of time, but towards the end of it, based in retrospect, because the light came on fairly soon after this, you know, something starts happening. Because I know my eyes are opening and I'm peering into this pitch black. And all of a sudden there's these like two just bright lights up there, two little bright lights. And I'm thinking, man, I guess there's a crack in the top of the float tank or something that these lights have are coming through. And then I was, oh, oh, this is the thing they talk. This is my brain spitting out some kind of, and then it's gone. Because that part of your, that part that's exerted the realization is like taking you out of whatever that state is that you're in. So DMT, it must be the same way. It's like, how many times have you done DMT? I've only done DMT about four times, I'd say. And never the, I've never gotten around the corner, never, never seen else, but have certainly had some incredibly beneficial, beautiful experiences from it. But, you know, I don't, I guess probably one difference between you and me is I have no problem. The symbol system I use to explain what's going on in there is not a neurological symbol system. I just think you're, it's like allowing you to see into the, what's been called the astral plane or you're seeing what's been called the spirit world or you're seeing these. I mean, I've, I've certainly seen all sorts of shit like that. There's no denying it. I've seen all that stuff. I don't necessarily trust what I saw, but I definitely, I've seen it. I've talked with things in there. Yeah, they do have a lot to say. And for me, it's just a matter of convenience because to me, it's like, I'm going to go for the juicy symbols or I'm going to go for the symbols that the symbols that I decide to use are going to be the ones that produce states of bliss or novelty or joy or more than anything are going to be help me be more effective in articulating my experience of the universe. And it was just fun, right? And for me, you know, I can think about what I saw on DMT and I could think, well, I must be witnessing some kind of, you know, the subconch, the arc, the some compartment in my mind where all the archetypes are stored up and or I can be like, oh, you know, I could, you know, go to the Terence McKenna route where he just is like, it's some ridiculousness about how it changes the spin of your atoms and you're actually witnessing an alternate universe that surrounds you at all times. And for me, that works a fuckload better than to think, oh, this is just like some marsupial symbol pocket that's down in the deep subbasement of my brain. And that's what I'm seeing. It's more like, fuck no, man. This is goddamn. This is the fucking death bardo. Like I'm witnessing the some completely alternate plane of existence that I seem to be existing on right now. It does. It certainly gives that perception. Yeah. Absolutely. Absolutely. I so so there's there's several things that make me suspicious of that. Sometimes, which is like one thing that I noticed within myself is is I'll do DMT and especially in the beginning, it would be like as if I was opening and closing my eyes as fast as I possibly could. And each time I opened my eyes, I was in a whole new world. Now I'm in a palace. Now I'm in a bathroom. Now I'm under the ocean. Now I'm in a volcano. And and there was hardly even any point at at like trying to capture any one of these scenes because it's like a blink of an eye and then you're on to the next amazing, except rather than a volcano or whatever, this is shit you've never seen before and and like holograms and unimaginable indescribable things. But what's interesting is that it was always very because I was always very resistant and I'm just a very scientific minded person. I'm I err toward the side of skepticism. I like to think of myself as open minded, but I don't know how open minded I am. But anyway, after like after some time, I would start accepting a little more. And when I accepted, then these scenes would slow down a little bit and I would gain more clarity and what I think might be happening, though, is is just simply the idea of accepting it. So so you just put all these drugs into your brain and now your eyes are closed or whatever and your brain's like coming up with ideas of like like, oh, what the fuck is happening right now? And then it's just like, what about this? Is this what's happening? Is this what's happening? Is that just throwing a thousand of different like ideas, like narratives of things that could be happening and you're sitting there like, what the fuck is it? No, no, not possible, not possible, not possible. So it's like, well, how about this? How about this? And then eventually, after a while, you go, well, maybe. And then as soon as you go, maybe it's like, oh, OK, there you go. This is working. OK, well, we'll play with this narrative for a little longer. And I wonder how much of our lives are like that, where where we're just believing in a perception enough where it's slowing down and we're buying into it more and more. Yeah. And you wonder how much of our lives is that one hundred fucking percent, man. And the beauty of being a human being is that we get to decide where to say maybe we get to decide where to say, possibly this, possibly this. That's the very good point. That's the potency because there's so many of those frames flying in front of us. There's the frame of our inevitable debt. There's the frame of the idea that everybody around us is just, you know, genetically selfish genetic machines. There's the frame where every single person around us deserves love. There's the frame where we deserve love. There's the frame where we can do just about anything that we wanted to. We can be healthy. We can get in shape. We can become better at whatever it is. There's all these other frames you get to pick. That's all. And I agree. And when you pick, maybe the best way to pick is to go, maybe, maybe this instead of being like, this is definitely it, because then you're probably a fool. Yeah, just as give it a maybe because a lot of times most people that maybe that they're giving to they're giving this is definitely it. And that this is definitely that they're, they're applying to whatever frame there and is usually a shit frame. Yeah, because most people have come to associate truth and suffering. They think the truth must always, the truth hurts. The truth must always hurt. I don't think that's the case. I think that you can pick and compose. You can build your own frame if you want. I mean, that's a very good point. I agree with you very much. I mean, when thinking of because there's only so far, you can chase the like existential rabbit hole down where you have to eventually decide like what you want to allow yourself to believe in. So it's like, OK, we're all we're all vehicles for our genes and these automatons being pushed around by our instincts. And, and, and, you know, the only reason why we find this this lake or whatever aesthetically pleasing is because of the construction of it was ideal for our ancestors. There's a water source there and there's trees there that aren't too clumped together, but enough that can provide shade and it can provide cover. Sounds like a nice lake you're describing. Yeah, exactly. But we're drawn to this sort of thing because this was this was a very useful environment to us. But so, so, you know, it's kind of a lie that that is beautiful. But what do you want to do? Do you want to flip a switch that makes you not like sunsets anymore? You know? That's a choice that you have to make. Yeah. And so you have to be like, no, I like the sunset lie. Fuck yeah. Or because the other thing is the other thing might as well just be as much of a lie that the real truth of the matter is whatever the fuck it is that without lake or those trees or the sunset, all of it's going away, all of it's going away. All of it will be gone. I think that's beautiful. Yeah, me too. I like that you're just a rivulet of matter running in, you know, running through time and that for a temporary moment, this rivulet is experiencing itself and that during that moment of experience, you can allow yourself to be kind to the people around you and to ease their suffering as best you can if you want to. And and that's fucking fun. And God damn it, if that's just a tail feather to get jizz blasting out of your cock, it's a better tail feather than a lot of the other ones. So pick that fucking tail feather. You know, yeah, it's interesting. Science, this just helps confirm something that I've thought for science and magic are very similar. It's just that magic is a word that scientists don't like and science is a word that, well, assholes don't like, I guess, but not assholes. But you know what I mean? Right. Anyway, man, this is a been a wonderful conversation. Thank you so much. I hope you'll come back on the show again soon. Really, really, really great. I'm going to put this one up right now.

It is I, Duncan Trussell, and you are listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast, and this is part two in a series of podcasts I'm doing about the folks who are making great efforts to get MDMA legalized. I actually am just calling it a series. It just coincidentally happens that I interviewed two people in a row who happened to be working really hard to change the draconian, archaic, monolithic, Machiavellian, and ridiculous drug laws that are keeping people locked up behind bars with murderers for doing nothing more than trying to expand their consciousness or trying to expand the consciousness of folks around them. You guys know how I feel about this. I hope I'm not seeming to one note. If you just started listening to the podcast's last episode because of Rick Doblin, please don't think that the only thing we talk about on this podcast is the legalization of drugs, though I do find it an interesting topic, and though it is something I love talking about, it's not the only thing we talk about, and I hope that if you are bored with this subject matter, you will forgive me and trust me when I say we've got a lot of great podcasts coming up that don't have to do with the fact that alchemists and chemists and teachers and saints and people who only wanted to love a little bit more or people who are hurting really bad and just using what they had at their disposal to try to escape the pain are currently festering in the dungeons of the Illuminani or whoever the fuck is behind the prison industrial complex. I have a feeling it isn't the Illuminani, it's probably just a bunch of grumpy, scared people and nothing as sinister as it seems if you think about it too hard. We got some great podcasts coming up. Pete Holmes is going to be on the show this Thursday. My friend Johnny Ross, who is one of the leaders in the virtual reality community, is going to be on the podcast and then we can get right back into talking about the other strange stuff that's currently happening in the world, but I do think it's important since it is spring, we did just celebrate the resurrection of Jesus to spend a little bit of time talking with folks who understand that there are certain powerful medicinal psychoactive chemicals out there that need to be brought out of the dark of prohibition and see the light of day so that all the stigma currently attached to these substances can be lifted and people can begin to experience the benefits that come from these substances and when I say these substances generally what I'm talking about is psilocybin or magic mushrooms, MDMA, marijuana, dimethyltryptamine, which is ayahuasca and any safe, time-honored substance that has very little negative repercussions and if used responsibly and moderately with good intention and surrounded by people you trust and love can have supremely powerful outcomes when it comes to your ability to connect with the people around you and to forgive people that perhaps desperately need your forgiveness. They also help with understanding myth. There are great lenses that you can revisit the religions that you may have been raised with. A lot of folks were raised in fundamentalist conservative households where whatever the story being told was for a lot of folks that's fundamentalist Christianity, for a lot of folks that's like Pentecostal Christianity, that story sometimes because it's being told by scared people or people who have been taught to fear the Lord, it gets tainted and so you end up missing this incredible information packet that's encapsulated in all the symbols that make up the story of Jesus Christ or whatever your particular, whatever religion you were raised in. If you were given it the wrong way then you're going to have the same response to Christianity that I currently have whenever I smell absent. I can't drink absinthe anymore. I used to really enjoy absinthe not just because I'm a closet goth but because it's a really interesting tasting alcohol but ever since I did drunk history whenever I get around absinthe it just makes me want to puke in the same way because of my body's trying to protect me and telling me oh shit man that's poison I almost killed us once. There's some metaphysical or perhaps neurological part of the human brain that after you have been exposed to fundamentalism and you revisit it you have a poison response your body contracts you clench your forehead down and whoever happens to be yapping about sweet baby Jesus you just want to tell him to go shove it where the fucking sun doesn't shine you proselytizing holier than thou piece of shit I am an adult and I don't have to eat these poison pellets that were fed to me every Sunday when I was a kid but if you take a psychedelic and revisit those stories quite often you will recognize that the stories weren't what was fucked up but the people who were telling them had twisted agendas that didn't really have much to do with the myth that they were telling you. That's another reason psychedelics are great. Psychedelics are great if you're having the inevitable sort of stagnant period that can come in a long-term relationship. Lots of folks have that it's completely normal to have that if you're hanging out with somebody all the time that initial burst of firework like passion can diminish and suddenly it feels like you're eaten stale crackers and watching a black and white I love Lucy rerun instead of enjoying that incredible passionate love-filled fuckfest that your relationship used to be what happened to the showers you would take together where you'd scrub each other off and pretend you were in some kind of 90s soft-core porn what happened to listening to enigma and rubbing coconut oil in each other's moobs it's gone it just vanishes and the next thing you know you're just like wafting farts on each other and praying for death it can happen but the responsible MDMA session done in the right way with the right intentions behind it the right prayers intoned the right sigils written down can bring you right back into that passionate sweet beautiful connective place that you experience when you first met whoever it is you've been with for a long time so that's another reason psychedelics are incredibly useful and all the research is out there you can see the research happening with giving psilocybin to folks who have late-stage terminal illnesses who are more than likely about to exit the casino and are feeling the kind of anxiety that goes along with knowing you're going to die and somewhere in the process of taking a high dose of psilocybin you realize that this ego identity this human body this vortex of atoms and and memories and and essentially this bag of meat that you've gotten so fixated on is just one infinitesimal part of what you actually are because sometimes a good mushroom trip done in the right way can show you that what is waiting for you after the death of the body is very similar to somebody who's been living in Syria for their entire lives going to visit Hawaii it's almost like that and you realize that the uh what what what is waiting for you is so beautiful and profound and incredible and uh familiar uh that the the fear that you're experiencing or a lot of the fear that you're experiencing in relation to that inevitable event that every single person on the planet living today will more than likely experience unless you believe or occurs well in which case we're all going to get broken apart by nanobots and go drifting into space and turn the moon into a Commodore 64 or something I hope that happens but it may be that we're all going to die and in that and so psychedelics can alleviate a lot of the anxiety and tension that all of us are probably secretly feeling at least in some small way so that's another excellent use for psychedelics um there's a lot of other great uses for psychedelics too and I could probably go on for about 700 hours listing all of them but I'm not going to do that just know that this is the second part of a two-part series on the legalization of MDMA and uh we've got a lot of other top groups that are going to come up we don't just talk about drugs on the Duncan Trussell family our podcast much thanks to the AV club for giving me a review on the Rick Doblin episode reviews are interesting sometimes it feels like they gotta throw in a tiny little jab and the critique that I got in the review from the AV club was that uh uh I was I'm not I'm gonna misquote it you can google search it but it seems like they thought that I was ascribing a little too much benefit to these substances uh and that uh you know maybe they're they're not the they're not gonna fix every problem in your life I will concede that point I don't think that they're gonna fix every problem in your life but I do think that they're going to help you as you address all the problems in your life with a brand new uh uh with a brand new set of goggles on they're gonna help you look at the problems in your life uh in a brand new way and they're gonna help you deal with some of the difficulty that you've been experiencing in creative ways that you might otherwise not have thought of uh to sum it up they're gonna help you forgive everybody who's ever done any shitty thing to you and uh in the process you're gonna forgive yourself and so in that way I think they are a wonderful tool that can be used uh that should be used responsibly and should be used along with perhaps therapy or meditation or just a general desire to evolve yourself so that you can be a more giving gentle compassionate and empathetic member of whatever community you happen to have incarnated into okay my friends okay so we're gonna dive right into this podcast now listen I've got to I've got to call somebody out here my dear friend and teacher Raghu Marcus was at the Whole Foods in Asheville North Carolina and encountered a grocery clerk who was working there who recommended uh for him to listen to the Rick Doblin episode so thank you my friend for doing that and then complained about my commercials that I do on this podcast and uh he said he doesn't want to fucking hear about somebody yapping about web design so look I understand friend uh I get it you know what I don't necessarily want to hear commercials either they annoy me uh when I'm watching The Walking Dead and they and they're there in the in the middle of the fucking action a god damn car commercial comes on I'm getting ripped apart by zombies I might I'm I'm afraid my sweet dear sheriff Rick uh might be getting about to get murdered my sweet sweet man who I wish could protect me and everything that I do in the real world I wish Sheriff Rick lived with me and guided every guided me every step of the way uh and anytime him or his friends get into danger I don't want to see some bullshit about a goddamn antidepressant or car commercial but uh you gotta get you I have to go through that they interrupt it that's what I'm saying they interrupt the show several times with these goddamn commercials I sweet friend at Whole Foods in Asheville North Carolina put the commercials in the very fucking beginning of this goddamn podcast which means that if you take the slightest amount of time and maybe I'm wrong about this maybe whatever system you're using doesn't have a keyboard or a mouse and you can't just jump forward but I think you can just jump forward that's all just jump forward are you really not willing to expend that amount of energy to it's probably four calories is my guess it's half a cracker's worth of calories to jump ahead in my rambling commercials and I will admit sometimes they're too long and I will admit that sometimes I go on and on about them and I shouldn't but the reason I do that is because something about just reading off the paper makes me feel like some kind of robotic shill and um I don't know I I just don't want to like do the whole like news real thing or you just read the copy and then move on so that's why I do it maybe I'll figure out the time codes or something and for those of you who don't want to listen and obviously I'm the opposite of offended that you wouldn't wouldn't want want to listen to a commercial but for those of you don't want to listen you could just dive ahead move into the next phase jump right into the interview you don't have to listen to me ramble about uh some crap you're not interested just jump ahead do that for me would you all that being said I'm not going to do a commercial uh for this particular podcast at least uh I'm not going to do any of the Casper Squarespace or any of those but I am going to do my uh I am going to talk about the Amazon portal for a second you could have already jumped ahead are you still listening you could have already jumped ahead is it that hard I want you to be happy I want you a Whole Foods clerk to be happy in fact at this moment I'm thinking of the unified consciousness of all things the love field that we are all a part of and I'm imagining that all sentient beings at this very moment in the universe are pumping your life filled with the most incredible blessings synchronicities coincidence joys I'm you're seeing fucking I'm monarch butterflies that's what I'm imagining I'm imagining you're waking up in the morning your window is flying open and just a a a a a bustle is that what you call a swarm of monarch butterflies a bustle of monarchs kids come soaring into your room and their beautiful orange wings are flapping and they're flapping it's synchronistically so that the the drone of their flap starts making the oom sound over your bed and any dying flowers that you have around your room or any dying things that you have around your room are coming back to life and even and you are getting younger because of this magical butterfly event that's what I want for you I want you to be happy and to enjoy this podcast but I got to do commercials because that's what pays the bill so I'm sorry you don't enjoy them and and I thank you for recommending the podcast to Ragu but for god's sakes man just

that if you're interested in pitching in a little bit to get this movie made I'll have links to that at DuncanTrussell.com he's an activist and he's working really hard to get the ridiculous drug

goo goes shooting down the transcendent conduits that connect all human beings to each other and lands right in the sweetest spot of Emmanuel Sferios's spine so that he experiences a temporary blast of pure nirvanic love bliss everybody now please welcome to the DuncanTrussell family hour podcast Emmanuel Sferios Emmanuel Sferios welcome to the DuncanTrussell family hour you are the founder of DanceSafe.org can you tell me a little bit about what DanceSafe.org is? Sure DanceSafe is more than a website it's actually a harm reduction organization has chapters now in 12 cities throughout the U.S. harm reduction provides an alternative to the just say no model of drug education operating under the philosophy that there will always be people who choose to use drugs and if they do they should do so as safely as possible until they decide to quit and so DanceSafe provides truthful non-judgmental drug education and services to young people in the electronic dance music community where ecstasy or Molly now as the younger generation calls it is widely used so you guys and I've you know I've seen I remember seeing documentaries about it and and stuff popping up about it and just being kind of amazed that somehow you could legally test people's ecstasy at raves I didn't understand how come you didn't get arrested for doing that well you know Duncan I fully planned to be arrested it just never happened I found a needle exchange attorney in the San Francisco Bay Area where I lived and I was like this is going to save lives and perhaps it's technically against the law because we're touching controlled substances but I'm going to do it anyway and I was sort of you know expecting it to happen but it actually didn't we ended up working cooperatively with local health departments and even local police and a number of cities around the country that was back in the early days the politics have changed a little bit since then ironically it's kind of gotten worse and that was when the federal government came in and passed a piece of legislation called the rave act senator biden passed it now vice president back then and it basically expanded the crack house laws to commercial venues right which could prosecute promoters or club owners if they were quote unquote maintaining a drug involved premises this real vague language you know what does it actually mean but it sent a chill through the industry and when that happened the promoters were more reluctant to welcome dance safe in to do this harm reduction work it just seems to me it seems like such an easy thing if I was a cop and I was going to a rave and I wanted to bust people it seems like all I'd have to do is stand near the dance safe table and wait for people to come up and reveal that they had drugs and then arrest them how come cops didn't do that well a lot of the events back then Duncan were sort of underground events they did hire private security but you know everyone you know sort of knew that there were drugs there and the strategy and these underground events at the time was let's try to keep people safe because we're not going to be able to stop people from getting drugs in and that's been demonstrated today where a lot of these major festivals like electric zoo in New York implement draconian search policies with you know dogs that supposedly can sniff out drugs etc and they can't stop people from getting their drugs in or or even worse young people will see the dogs get scared and then they'll take all their drugs at once before they come in which can more easily cause problems overdose etc so so it's your philosophy and the philosophy of dance safe seems pretty logical which is that the making drugs illegal is not stopping anyone from doing drugs it never has that's correct and and so harm reduction is and is you know it can it coexist with a law enforcement model as it does in many countries somewhat successfully the Netherlands being a good example where the government actually funds harm reduction services including drug checking pill testing services that I started doing with dance safe where we actually would test people's ecstasy to help them avoid ingesting the pills that contained PMA paramethoxam phetamine and many other drugs that are being sold as ecstasy or molly now that are far more dangerous the Dutch government actually does this themselves that's where I I modeled dance safe off of the Netherlands program so you know ecstasy is still illegal in the Netherlands but the the government takes a public health approach towards the illicit use what's the difference between you and everybody else who's taken ecstasy realized it's great and then it hasn't done nothing for the community what got you what what made you to decide it to take steps to create this organization well first of all there are a lot of people who've done a lot of great things in for the rave community and ironically I actually had wasn't a part of the rave community when I started uh dance safe I had I had used ecstasy back when I was a teenager I was 16 but I didn't get it at rave I actually read an article in news week about the drug being used in therapy right and said hey I you know I wanted to try this to gain the insights and I was dealing with a lot of issues for my own child and child child to search it out and found it and did it and and it was very very helpful to me and it's a very powerful medicine and I probably I can't say every time I did it was strictly therapeutic back when I was a teenager you know I had some house parties and I turned some friends on to it and probably there's a couple year period there where I took the drug a dozen times or so and then I forgot about it you know went to college and you know traveled around and now here I am living in the San Francisco Bay Area in 1998 and a friend of mine gives me some ecstasy again and now we have the internet now I wow I can really learn what did we know in the last 10 years right what have we learned and I was blown away by what had happened to the illicit market it was incredible because back in 86 when I did it there was no fear when you bought ecstasy that you were going to get some deadly drug it was pretty much all MDMA back and now it was the most it had become even back in 1998 the most highly adulterated illicit drug market in the world and I discovered the Dutch program to help users and just said hey I'm going to do that here I had been an activist for many years and had done needle exchange volunteer work and also worked in downtown Oakland with inner city families who's you know mostly African American families who had you know male relatives in prison for 10 years or life for you know a handful of you know rocks of crack cocaine and so I had a already an understanding of how the drug war was not just failing but it was actually causing most of the problems well that's what I'm really curious about and I know that I hope that you don't think I'm getting too far away from ecstasy but I'm really curious about that moment in a person's life where they go from being a consumer to being an activist like what what what's that first move that you made in the direction of starting dance safe I what got you well when were you like okay I'm gonna do something to help these are great questions I hadn't and no one's ever asked me this before you know and so so the the truth is I was an activist on other issues before that as I just explained one of them being a homeless rights I worked for you may have heard of this international organization food not bombs yes yeah so I was a food not bombs activist in Berkeley for four years and one of the things that we did we weren't just advocates for homeless rights we were also a direct service for homeless people we cooked and served vegetarian meals five days a week in Berkeley and served in in People's Park not just for homeless it was anyone can eat right yeah students ate with us it was um you know picnic atmosphere and that's kind of you know and then on top of it we did advocacy too and through that I learned that the best way to affect social change is to combine your political advocacy work with direct action let's do this ourselves so when I discovered that there were these testing kits these chemical reagents that again the government of the Netherlands was using they would set booths up at these events where people use ecstasy and you'd scrape a tiny bit of the pill onto a white ceramic plate and you'd put a drop of this chemical on and you could tell whether there was actually MDMA in the pill or not right I realized what a magical thing this was because I could go out to events and try to organize people to change drug laws you know young people and say look drug war is not working you know we need to you know change these laws but you know you hand out literature but you know really you're not gonna galvanize people that way but if you're actually helping them right just to be safe then they're gonna like you know be impressed right yeah and and other people are going to help you and they're you know and so it sort of grew this this what began as sort of this like you know let's um you know more of a politically oriented activist um sensibility in me kind of grew into a a community that took care of itself right dance safe is a peer-based drug education nonprofit and young people across the country are educating themselves and taking care of themselves really a beautiful thing it is it's beautiful and uh it's it's um uh it's to me it is and I'm sorry I keep going back here but I'm thinking about myself selfish Duncan and I'm thinking about perhaps many of the people listening they're not like you they want to help we want to help we want to do things to help the world we think it would be beautiful to help the world but we don't help the world there seems to be this impenetrable magnetic barrier between us and going out there and becoming activists and organizing and doing these beautiful things and I'm just curious about what the first moment you passed through that membrane you well in my life I passed through that membrane when I was a teenager and I went to an anti-death penalty protest just sort of off the cuff wasn't an activist at the time I just said to myself gosh you know I think I was 14 right and I said how could the government kill people when they tell us we can't kill people it was this hypocrisy thing right I didn't really have a social justice consciousness but I took a bunch three city buses to get there because I grew up in Florida and public transit was horrible and it took like three hours to get to this protest and there was just two people there and they were with the american friend service committee the political wing of the quakers and they were also the first two gay adults a man and a woman they were both gay who treated me with respect like I was this 14 year old kid with a mohawk and they asked me what I thought about things and and they offered me a ride home and took me by their office and I introduced me to all their social justice literature and everything and at that point I sort of you know became an activist they channeled my anger from this bad childhood you know into a productive capacity and I'll never forget those two people because I think if I hadn't stumbled upon them I could have easily gone down a more uh destruct self-destructive road in my life but you know my anger over you know what was happening in my childhood and whatnot some sort of took on you know was channeled into this political activism I don't know if that answers your question no it does it does it's go ahead I didn't mean to cut you off I'm sorry there also might be something in me right that some of us are just a little more brazen a little more courageous to take risks you know people told me I was crazy when I was going to test ecstasy tablets like you're going to get arrested I was like I know I want to get arrested I saw this happen to me the the courageous needle exchange pioneers some of them spent time in jail but now look even in states where it's needle exchange is not explicitly legal the cops leave them alone because everybody knows this is saving lives right so someone's got to do it someone has to have the courage well yes no I I mean we need you uh and and there's more of us than there are you and I think though obviously it's a cliche thing to say but the world would be an absolute paradise if the majority of people became like you and that's something that's always uh well frustrated you know well it's true you know it is true if everyone just uh it's an interesting thing isn't it you have some event that happens in your life uh for a lot of people it's a a rough childhood for sure for some people it's other things but you have this event that creates a kind of energy uh a radioactive energy tablet inside of you that if you don't channel that energy in the direction of helping the world then you can only channel it in the direction of self-destruction and you it starts eating you from the inside out and you become sunken in and cruel and awful and Machiavellian and so I want to when I get to talk to people like you I want to I want to figure out how to why have I not crossed that membrane uh in in such a I mean I have a podcast and I talk to people like you but that are you cruel and Machiavellian I have you know I have been uh and and I I'm not right now uh and I think a reason that I am not like cruel and Machiavellian is a lot of that has to do with my interaction with MDMA and psilocybin and psychedelics and I think that maybe those things didn't push me in the direction that they pushed you in or that they pushed Rick Doblin in or that they pushed some other activists in but they certainly have made me hesitate when I could be an asshole in times that I wouldn't have hesitated yeah no no they've had a profound effect on me too these substances can be extremely therapeutic and that's good to see that's becoming more widely recognized now the last three four years especially there's this huge cultural um you know rebirth of of psychedelics that the younger generation I think is more um courageous in coming out and and advocating that hey yes these things have helped me um so I have a lot of hope you know we all we have marijuana legalization I think psychedelics ought to be next and a slow you know followed by all drugs eventually and and and I should really clarify this too because this is very important for people to know when when most of the people in the drug policy reform movement when you say you want to legalize drugs you're not saying that because you want drugs to be accessible to you're more accessible to children uh you're you're saying let's legalize drugs precisely for the opposite reason because legalization actually means regulation prohibited drugs when you prohibition is the application of regulation it turns the manufacture and distribution of drugs over to criminals and so when we say when I say I think we need to legalize MDMA it's because providing adults with safe legal access to the drug will eliminate the criminal market and make drugs and MDMA less available to minors and I think that's a good thing I actually have a teenage stepdaughter and she tells me that she can buy molly from half a dozen kids in her school molly whatever it it you know might contain but to get alcohol she at least has to find an adult to buy it for when illicit drugs are more available to teenagers than than legal drugs something's wrong that's that that's right and and I it's it's a it's one of those obvious truths that is so obvious the fact that it's being suppressed that obvious truth uh just gives me chills because uh I contemplate quite often why are these substances prohibited and uh I was wondering if you could help me answer that question what is the rationalization uh from the federal government for keeping MDMA illegal well I think this goes back to LSD in the 60s and sort of an accident of history um but interestingly it involves PTSD right when LSD became popular in the 60s the Vietnam War was happening and the young adults who were being drafted to go to Vietnam witnessed the effects of war on their parents because World War II was a horrendous war probably there hasn't been an experience in this country where we had more people with post traumatic stress disorder than we did after World War II of course they called it shell shock back then they didn't call it PTSD but and the way that we as a society tried to deal with PTSD back then after World War II was to repress it right if you look at 50s culture we kind of everyone loves to make fun of it now you see you know father knows best and this show tunes now is the best time of our life and yeah it's all like you know but but the kids growing up with fathers who had PTSD and came back they saw the suicides they saw the domestic violence they were beaten and it was such a contradiction to what they were seeing on TV their society was telling them look everything's great that's why you had folks like Timothy Leary and others whose message was anti-establishment right tune it turn on dropout so LSD became a rebellious thing that with that was not only about you know screw this war you're not going to put me through the same shit you put my parents through right it was you know screw the establishment right that scared the crap out of Nixon it really did and the elite at the time and they thought that LSD itself was like somehow built into the drug and anti-establishment kind of drug and that led to this crackdown which we call the second wave of the drug war because really the drug war began you know back in 1914 with heroin and an alcohol prohibition at the same time and but this was sort of the second wave of it well interestingly you know I don't think today there's many people that see psychedelic drugs as anti-establishment anymore MDMA in the when it you know sort of became popular in the mid 80s certainly did not wasn't wedded to any kind of anti-war or political movement you know people in fact can take MDMA and LSD and become more integrated into their society so I think that fear is no longer driving the drug war today that's an interesting point you're making there and I don't know if I wonder I don't know if I agree with that 100% because when I think of because I don't look at integration is necessarily a great thing and and when I think of not you know MDMA by itself is to me one of the most potent powerful therapeutic relationship enhancing drugs I've ever encountered I've never seen anything so miraculous and profound chemically as that substance when it comes to bonding with someone else amazing but it's not just amazing in that way it's also has an incredible synergy with some other substances for example have you ever taken MDMA and psilocybin before I've never hippie flipped no okay well the combination of those two substances is so incredible and the experience that I think people have on it is so profound that because you don't just get the sort of bonding beautiful love-filled nirvanic bliss that can come from a great MDMA trip but you also get that kind of DMT level I mean depending on the dosage of mushrooms you know the DMT level visuals that sort of bring you out of your existence and in you enter into Terence McKenna land where you're no longer you realize that you are a super consciousness that seems to have become entangled with your body and that you know death suddenly is not this awful thing to be afraid of but more like a Hawaiian vacation that's waiting for everybody at the end of their lives and that leads you to a feeling of disattachment in the best way possible from the things that society seems to want you to be so attached to so is that and that doesn't seem to really integrate you so much with a hyper materialistic society it seems that it that that the perhaps they're still afraid yeah you that's absolutely right and even the pure MDMA experience which doesn't have those kinds of fireworks you know that's more about love and empathy that certainly also kind of goes against the old competitive cutthroat corporate culture that we're all raised in you know and some of the folks I interviewed for my film which we haven't talked about yet have mentioned you know some of the experts have said that there could be a very deep way in which MDMA has changed culture making the younger generation a little less competitive a little more cooperative more into you know helping each other helping the environment etc yes and and and this is the thing that I don't I don't want to believe one thing that you know what I don't want to believe I don't want to believe that there's a cartel of powerful people who are aware of the fact that psychedelics are opening windows to this truth that is letting us peer out of the conditioning and the the sort it's like being in solitary confinement and a symbolic solitary confinement created by the interweaving of all the non-truths that you've been told since you were a baby and for a second you're sitting in this solitary confinement this objective solitary confinement cell where that where you know you don't maybe you don't know anything and then all of a sudden this window pops open you look through the window you realize that you're in this incredibly beautiful expansive super intelligent matrix of life and it is terrifying to me to imagine that there are people who are going around the world right now at this moment slamming those windows shut whenever they can oh shut that down shut that window don't look out that window no that that window is you've gone nuts shut it down shut it down shut it down that's fucking scary to me man I think they don't understand it Duncan I think that more it's just there's a lot of people that operate from fear and they're afraid of you know the terrorists the communists etc they tend to be religious conservatives uh because studies have shown if you look at some of the research with them arise into conservative and liberal attitudes that conservatives are more motivated by negatives right when they things that could go wrong it really motivates them whereas liberals are more motivated by hope right that things potential positives are more motivated right so so I think it's just that psychedelics scare people and they particularly scare people because of their therapeutic potential because a lot of people are repressing a lot inside them especially things like you know pleasure they think to themselves look I I've sacrificed I'm not indulging you know and and they see drugs in general as these hedonistic things you know especially if you look at pictures of hippies in the 60s as all free love and sex and yeah this idea that it's about hedonism and I think that scares people who are or haven't really come to terms with their own desires you know the stereotypical republican who's anti gay but really he's gay himself so he's right and so psychedelics will bring it up you know especially MDMA it has this ability to kind of force you to confront things that you were pressing and and that scares people yes it does I mean it scares the shit out of people and it it um it it seems that the way that these people are reacting to fear is violence and you know I just I was actually uh just at the comedy store and I was talking to somebody who had who had met at this Alex Gray rave and she was telling me about one of her friends just went to jail for 12 years for uh LSD and ecstasy at LSD and ecstasy I think he had a vial of acid or something and ecstasy in his pocket and now he is in jail for 12 years 12 years and that kind of thing uh man that kind of cognitive dissonance I could walk around my house just squealing 12 years 12 years 12 years because to me if what you're saying is that this these drug policies are in place because of the opinions of frightened repressed conservatives who have a religious agenda then that makes me think that the servants of satan are in control that sounds like what the devil would do it doesn't it sounds like if there was satanist and I'm just using this symbolically I don't think there's some dark luciferian entity that exists in the universe necessarily I'm not positive about that but I don't want to believe that but if there were what would his servants do his servants would actively violently try to divert people from the truth at all costs yeah there's some sinister stuff out there Duncan for sure you know I there they're you know the that banning lsd has only created 25 i n bomb which maybe never heard of but this is the first drug that is active on a microgram level that can kill you if it's just slightly too much and you know there was that a big bust in the missile silo where the the dea but busted a Leonard Picard one of the big because I think that his name something Picard I think so yeah I yeah I think so and and really it really did dramatically reduce the amount of lsd in this country it was hard to find and I'm sure a lot of the dea that participated in that are patting themselves on the back saying look what a good job we've done we protected the children but all it really did was cause the proliferation of other new synthetic imposter drugs like 25 i n bomb that are much more dangerous and they're killing about one person a month so we ban the safer psychedelics that have a track record and all we're doing because you can't stop the desire to alter what your consciousness there is always going to be a huge percent of the population that want to do that and people to fulfill the demand and now it's being filled with drugs that are much more dangerous it's crazy but it's going back to the evil here there are people out there who think well that's a good thing if people die when they take what they think is lsd yeah you're right it sends the message to others that it's dangerous oh god you're right you're right because they're not trying they're not public health oriented they're not trying to save lives as much as they're trying to save souls and if you already are gonna sin and take an illicit drug then you're gone in their minds then you know you're not worth living anyway but your death it will set an example for other young people who haven't yet decided to cross that line into sin yet this is how they think holy shit it's 2015 it's 2015 and there are cultists in the world who have organized a system of repressing chemicals that contain within them keys that unlock doors in the human mind to great vast archives of information that can only benefit our species and they are they're they they they want people to die for going into those libraries it's 2015 this is no different to me than burning books this is no different to me than any other time tyrannical forces have tried to place their heel on the flow of information and for whatever reason we are still stuck in a period of human history where we only think of information as the data encoded in books and the data encoded in recorded conversations or movies we don't understand that there's data encoded in chemicals compounds we don't understand that yet but there is isn't there there is sure sure you know though i don't want to scare people away we should talk about some of the positive things we'll get into the positive i'm sorry you gotta let me howl at the moon for a second i swear to god i'll turn it away and you guys always do this you know the graze did it too like i start like i will i at a moment's notice i will definitely become chicken little and start freaking out over the stuff and i'm just giving voice to the frustration inside of me but yeah i know that i know that i have to i know that there are good things happening and it's when i say that there's people like that out there i'm not saying those are the people controlling the drug war i don't believe they are you know i think most of them those you know the nixon cabinet folks are gone well i guess rumsfeld is still around right yeah but but uh these days i think it's mostly that people just they don't understand drugs because so few people use them relatively speaking right it's probably five percent ten percent max of the population has used any psychedelic drug you know within well at period right so so people don't understand them and then they don't believe uh those of us when we say these drugs are therapeutic these drugs benefits yes they might think oh those are those are just those hedonistic they just love feeling pleasure and justifies their drug use you know this is one of the reasons why mdma i think was uh made schedule one in 1985 by the dea despite a coalition of therapists suing the dea when they placed it on emergency schedule one and they went to court in front of a administrative law judge and they had hundreds of hours of testimony from doctors and therapists who had been using it for almost 10 years with great results and the dea law judge francis young actually ruled in favor of the therapist and said mdma should be schedule three wow clearly it has a medical value but the dea just chose to ignore their own judge's ruling because it was only an advisory hearing and they kept it on schedule one and i think the reason is because they were used to hearing people in the 60s saying that you know hippies and what is a lsd is therapeutic etc and and they just didn't believe it because they were still in this mindset that we discussed earlier with you know this anti-establishment hippies that want to drop out and they hate america and all this kind of stuff right well you know it it is a uh like i understand that the getting too shrill about it doesn't really help anything and sometimes can hurt things and and more than it helps i guess so i know it there needs to be a kind of moderate uh viewpoint when it comes to the gears that have to turn to make these things uh legal but man i really you know when i really contemplate it's one of those things when i contemplate it and and look at all the good that it's done for me and look at all the good that it's done for so many other people both you know entrepreneurs and famous people and just regular people and and soldiers and uh when i look at all that and then and hear that someone's gone to jail for for 12 years it's a tough thing to swallow which is why we need folks like you getting the the good information out there and which is why it's cool that you have actually made a movie you've made the movie right and you've shot it or you're still in the process of making the movie i know i'm still in the process i've had four film shoots and out of those i put together a nine minute short film on MDMA therapy where i interviewed some veterans who participated in FDA approved studies using the drug to treat post-traumatic stress disorder as well as a rape survivor and some others but this is a film short film i produced just sort of to show people uh that i can make a quality film um it's only on MDMA therapy the full documentary is going to also cover harm reduction as an appropriate public health alternative to failed efforts of prohibition i plan to fly to europe uh we're not just the netherlands but many countries in europe now are offering services to uh ecstasy users that far surpass what we're able to do legally here in the united states and i want to juxtapose the successes that they've had in reducing medical emergencies and fatalities with the failures of us drug policy as well as the uk and canada and australia the english speaking world um where through their zero tolerance drug war approach um we've seen well the latest statistics we have we're back from 2012 where we had over 12 000 emergency room visits related to ecstasy or molly the vast majority of those were from fake or adulterated pills and even the ones that came from pure MDMA or the and they're you know here and we have to say uh it's important to know there have been fatalities after individual is taken pure MDMA uh MDMA is not completely safe right and but i but i think that actually puts it in uh a category that makes it very appropriate to focus on for the next phase of the drug policy reform movement because it shares a lot of qualities with marijuana which is completely safe and we have seen some progress a lot of progress now on legalization uh shares those qualities along with some of the qualities of the harder drugs that um are more problematic to deal with and um because i'm an activist for drug policy reform across the board um i uh i want to you know give an argument and help this movement uh move forward so that we have rational drug policy and keep everyone out of jail addicts don't deserve to be in jail anymore than ecstasy users even if their drug of choice isn't as therapeutic as ecstasy or the psychedelic exactly man that's exactly right well no one deserves to be in jail because they wanted to experience pleasure and they took their own biochemistry into their own hands that is not a crime that is not illegal there is nothing it's illegal but it's not a crime it's not a sin it's just an exploratory person who may be a self-destructive deciding that they want to you know man i i just watched this documentary last night it's pretty good documentary it's on it's on uh netflix and uh it's about these guys who want to climb k2 you know k2 that deadly mountain that's uh it's in i guess it's in what napal hold on i'll look it up i don't know where look i'm sure i'll get fat no matter what i say i'll fuck it up so i'm sorry all the mountain experts out there prepare for me to mess something up about k2 but well i won't even go into details about it aside to say that it is a mountain that is somehow deadlier than everist it's like this is the this is the one of the most insurmountable horrible cruel monstrous beasts and you know it draws mountain climbers to it man anyone that wants to climb that needs to go to rehab immediately yeah put them in jail put them in jail it kills you it's kills like 20 of the people who try to climb it that's a really dangerous fucking mountain let's get a fucking giant iron wall around that mountain and shoot anybody trying to go in and then if someone does manage to get into that mountain let's fucking take their money away from them let's take their home away from them let's take their family away from that let's call climbing equipment paraphernalia and ban things like harnesses and carabiners yes exactly man it's like they're so what they're trying to do is they're trying to activate a biochemical change in their brain which is the what must just be the most stupendous release of dopamine and serotonin anyone can experience once you finally clamber to the top of that awful peak it just must be like the touching god it must be like your brain turns into a clitoris it must be so fucking incredible it's so amazing but they're doing it by climbing instead of by injecting snorting eating or getting it into their bloodstream so it's okay but the moment that you decide i'm going to actually put some some information into my bloodstream and experience a heightened state of consciousness why because i want to because i exist in a dimension where i'm going to die i have about 60 70 if life extension therapy happens 150 years to live in this temporary trance like state what do we call human incarnation and i'm gonna play around with uh the colors that i can experience in the spectrum of experience and the fact that there are sons of bitches out there who think that we aren't allowed to do that is something that uh really obviously i'm sorry i keep going on these rants but it really gets me puffed up like one of those puffer fish in the ocean when i think about it too much just because it seems so absolutely absurd yeah more well let's talk strategy for a minute okay how are we going to affect rational drug policy in this shrill ranting my friend shrill ranting that changes everything oh you have to do this right high-pitched shrill ranting with with i guess that's i don't know man help us to provide everyone who thinks like us with the language to articulate a winning argument and here is that winning argument i i i i have to i can't stress this enough uh marijuana has made its gains largely based on a civil rights argument leave us alone this is a good drug it helps me it's medicinal etc yet not everyone likes it but it nobody's ever died from it you know look at how dangerous alcohol is it makes no sense to its marijuana that's great but marijuana has something very very unique that most other drugs don't have a quality of it and that is it is the safest recreational drug in existence right nobody's died from i don't think anyone's died from mushrooms or peyote or lsd either but those drugs are so unknown so few people have used them it's hard to win with that argument right and then with mdma and any other drug you want to talk about there have been deaths and so the argument the winning argument needs to be legalization and regulation to strip the control and distribution of drugs from criminals right allowing adults legal safe access and thus reducing access to children can't stress that enough that's what's going to win reform because i have a you know a stepdaughter and i care i worry like every parent does about kids getting in trouble with drugs right just like we don't let our kids eat sugar because their brains haven't evolved enough to be able to delay gratification and all they would do is eat candy and ice cream all day parent knows that so you don't want your kids taking pleasure drugs to that can uh if you use them to much kill you or cause addiction etc we we want to wait until young people are old enough now maybe we disagree on that age and teenage years it's different for every child but there's got to be some arbitrary age that we just say look as a society this is what we're saying i think it should be 18 i think it'd be 18 with alcohol you know right it's 21 whatever the whatever it is we we have to put out an argument that's reasonable to protect children from substances including sugar that's going to be potentially uh dangerous right it's why we got to get sugar out of schools that's why that movie that documentary fed up is such an important documentary you know right yeah it's it's the idea is like come on are you seriously thinking that your kids aren't taking drugs because they're illegal that's ridiculous you know what my drug dealer was like when i was in high school man holy shit he had like porn magazines scattered all over the floor of his trailer unidentifiable animal bones scattered everywhere it looked like straight out of the texas chains on massacre that house i'm not even joking like like bone wind chimes and like you know he was freely just selling drugs to high school kids he didn't care he was just like whatever he's making fucking money and and we would go there and and buy the drugs and we would go off and do them feeling like the most vile criminals on earth so every single trip slightly tainted by the uh dishonesty now that's another yeah this is another aspect of it there's the the way the way that these prohibition is hurting families is uh not only are kids having to sneak around to get drugs but they're having to be dishonest with their parents when they do drugs so right they take these drugs they have these spectacular experiences they gain all this information they get all this wisdom they probably have shit tons of questions to ask their parents because suddenly they just got this huge download of truth into their brains and they can't mention it because if they mention it their parents are going to take them to a drug rehab they're going to start giving them piss tests they're going to kick them out of the house potentially they're going to call the cops and it's going to be awful so you know that's the other side of it it's not just these kids are because of the prohibition being exposed to toxic uh chemicals that aren't what they say they are they're also being taught to lie to the people they love the most uh in in their lying in their pursuit of truth it's fucked up man it's fucked up it's even worse than that Duncan and it's a point that i try to make all the time because uh i didn't really know this until i started working with dance safe and i've spoken to and counseled you know thousands thousands of young people over the years and i firmly believe that prohibition and the culture created by the drug war not only causes young people a lot of their parents but actually manifests it actually creates the very drug misuse and abuse that the the prohibitionists claim they're trying to prevent because when you ban a drug and you send this message that drugs are bad drugs are evil if you do them there must be something wrong with you etc it creates a relationship with the drug where the young person isn't even open to the idea of using it responsibly they don't see it as something to gain insight from to learn from to be moderate in to respect that's why we see this language among teenagers let's get fucked up dude and and bragging about how many pills you've taken pushing your limits and things like that well you know there's always going to be some crazy people like that but this cult this is part of a culture of prohibition and if we you know recognize these drugs as medicines we would reduce that greatly just like teen drug use decreased after prop 215 in california and and the best theory as to why is because it's all these young people thought well it's just a medicine that my parents do now it's not this cool thing you know exactly because that's that that's exactly right man you your teenagers they want to go skittering off into the dark and the moment this if this substance if any of these if mdma suddenly became associated with education that it's a form of psychological education or a therapeutic experience what's that a therapeutic drug a therapeutic drug teenagers like fuck that man i'm not going to do that goddamn sappy shit i think oh it's going to make me not hate my parents no thanks i don't want to do that because i really i mean here let me just say some true blasphemy here so this is blasphemy right now in the era that we're living in but can you imagine what would happen if some parents and some kids and their kids who are estranged from them sat down for an evening with some therapists and took mdma together can you imagine what that would do for a family no you can't i mean no one knows what it would do and you can imagine but we don't know because that if that came out oh shit a family took ecstasy or their kids they're having problems with they would all get hauled away to the kid they lose the kid i wish i could remember her name but there is a life coach this woman gosh i talked to her on the phone but you should google her because she did that and she came out every year for like five ten years in a row her entire family her kids all got together and did mdma once a year on like christmas eve or something like that and she's got a website and she's got a a ted talk or at least a video on youtube about it i can't remember her name but yeah no she did it and there are a lot of other people that have too i took mdma with my father before he died wow wow what was that like it was it was great you know i don't want can't reveal too much personal stuff about it but i can tell you this um after i was an adult right but i was 30 years old at the time and he lived a long time after that and we only did it once but after that every time we talked to each other on the phone uh we would say i love you to each other and that never happened before that may session god that was so beautiful he didn't change but uh our relationship changed so that was good well you know man this is good work that you're doing and uh i think a lot of people are going to want want to get involved in somewhere another i hope i i hope that people if you wanted to do something that can help right now you can go to my crowdfunding campaign and donate some money there's 10 days left i've raised $46,000 so far i chose $100,000 as my goal i'm still a little hopeful because i've been talking with some funders who might
