246^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - 562: David Nichtern Transcript and Discussion^2023-04-24^I love living independently at home, but sometimes I need a little help. That's when it's nice to know that I have an angel by my side. It won't last, it won't last, you'll get old, you'll get fat. Filled with parasites from your cat, stinky cream upon your back. Look at Johnny Rotten, all you cool kids in despair. He still has orange hair, but now he looks like Cher. It won't last, it won't last, you'll get old, you'll get fat. Filled with parasites from your cat, menthol cream upon your back. If I could turn back time. From which one arthritis, plan up for shyness, seven should today, cause you all should have colitis. Can't cure cancer with a record collection, backstage passes won't cure your infection. You play the guitar, travel with a phone, your anesthesiologist will care who you are. Your cardiac surgeon doesn't care who you are. The coroner doesn't care who you are. Oh you worry. Once you raged against the machine, now you need a breathing machine or you'll have a heart attack. While you shop at Nordstrom Rack. You'll ring me, must see me, saying kids is soul their soul. You'll clinch the remote control as you die on the toilet bowl. It won't last, it won't last, you'll get old, you'll get fat. Your face chewed on by your cat, no one wondering where you're at. Your landlord look up knocking when they complain about the stink. Your cat will get adopted, you're closed out on the street. It won't last, it won't last, you'll reincarnate as a bat. Try to be kind instead of cool while you're still in human school. Visiting angels, America's choice of home care. Greetings friends, that was Candies, Ladies, Feet friends and that's a track of their new LP Blaster.

Before we jump into that, I want to invite you, if you're having to be in the North Carolina area, to come and see me and William Montgomery. We're going to be at Good Nights in Raleigh. Then the next week, coming right up, going to be at Helium in Portland. Our shows are about to sell out. So get your tickets in advance, please. It makes me feel good. It's comforting. It feeds my ego and it bloats me out like an old bloated ego fly. What a show we have for you. Oh shit, one last plug. I forgot. Patreon.com forward slash DTFH head there for commercial free episodes of this glorious podcast. Won't you? Also, we hang out generally once a week. We have a meditation and what we call a family gathering. It's just yapping. Our community makes the folks at Spawn Ranch look like assholes. I guess it comes as no surprise to you guys that I am in love and probably always will be in love with sweet THC, which is why I love today's sponsor, Loomi Labs. My God, I know you've experienced it. I certainly have. That moment where the thing you thought was a easy, gentle edible turns out to be an egg laid from the asshole of Baphomet. Suddenly you were sucked into a cyclone of darkness, paranoia, fear, and horror. It goes on and on and on. This is not where I want to be in life. I don't want to lay my psychological health in the hands of somebody somewhere in some weird black lit place, whipping together whatever their particular edible happens to be. I want my edibles to be made in a true lab, in a Loomi Lab. Loomi Lab has figured out the exact right dose of THC. It's amazing. No more freakouts for daddy. Just a nice, simple, soft, wonderful, relaxing, glowy feeling that helps me fall asleep is wonderful to experience while at the gym and just about anywhere else. No matter, microdose gummies are available everywhere. You can fly with these things. I take them with me on the road. To learn more about microdosing THC, go to microdose.com and use code DUNCAN to get free shipping and 30% off your first order. Microdose is available nationwide. Leagues can be found at DuncanTrussell.com, but again, it's microdose.com code DUNCAN. Thank you, Loomi Labs. All right, friends, here we go. David Nickturn is an author. He runs a wonderful foundation called Dharma Moon. He's also my meditation teacher, and of course, he's David from the Midnight Gospel. And on Tuesday, May 9th, David and I are going to have a free live online discussion about artificial intelligence, Buddhism, and the future of mindfulness. That's May 9th. I hope that you will sign up. We're also going to talk about his Dharma Moon meditation teacher training beginning in June 2023. All the links you need to find that will be at DuncanTrussell.com. Also, if you like David, you can join him and Eve Lewis Preto, the main voice and teacher on the Headspace app for the start of a special four week online course on the foundations of mindfulness. Again, all those links at DuncanTrussell.com. Now let's dive in. Welcome, David Nickturn. My editor, Aaron's out of town, so I don't have a theme song. Welcome, welcome all of you. Welcome to you. It's the DuncanTrussell Family Hour. Welcome back, David. It's so great to see you. I've been looking forward to our conversation all day. How you doing? I'm very happy right now. All right. Congratulations. I don't know why, but when you asked me, I thought I'm going to check right this moment how I am. Not tell you how I've been for the last days or weeks or anything like that. That's amazing. Of course, it's great to see you. That always brings me joy. Great to see you. Now, as a Buddhist teacher, as a teacher of meditation, do you think you could quantify happiness to unhappiness in your life? Happiness versus what percentage of unhappiness? Well, a Buddhist teacher who does not talk about suffering is not worth their salt. So all this happiness, this happiness, that, to me, the big topics are suffering and freedom from suffering. That's like right to the Four Noble Truths there. And that's the first time out of the barn with the Buddha mind. So happiness could be pretty relative, don't you think? Yeah. Can you give an example of a combo suffering, happiness, state of consciousness? Easily comes to mind. Relative happiness is like you have a nice bowl of soup that was in the fridge, but it was in the fridge for too long. So while you're eating it, you're happy. And right after you feel happy. And three hours later, you don't feel so happy. It's so easy to make us happy and take our happiness away that it's almost, you wonder why we didn't invest so much time in it. And that's something I've been thinking about, which is life is process. Looking at life as a process versus framing it as this is exactly what's happening. So if you could get your third eye a little bit above the time space continuum, so that instead of seeing just what's happening right now, but look at the future and the way you have memories, then what you're talking about would become crystal clear, which is that yes, right now you're happy or you're unhappy right now, but you would recognize this is leading to potentially the polar opposite condition. But we can't do that. We're in the present moment, so it's easy to trick yourself into thinking, I'm going to feel great about this soup for the rest of the night. Well, that's why like, you know, to me, this has all been iterated kind of perfectly already. So not to put anybody off like thinking that there's somebody kind of clearly stated what's going on. But the four kinds of suffering, you know, you know, one is not getting what you want. Two is getting what you don't want. It's really good, right? Yeah. Three is alternation, the pain of alternation between getting what you want and not getting what you want. That itself is painful. And the fourth one is all-pervasive suffering, which is just the undertone of kind of like, even in the most peak moments, even in the worst moments, it's just a sort of general sense of dissatisfaction. You know, you just described Las Vegas. Well, that's what I was trying to do. I've never heard a more perfect description of Las Vegas in my entire life. Yeah, the alternation, you're getting what you want, then you're not, then you are, then the whole thing sucks. When you really like take a moment, look around Las Vegas and all the people who came there ready to experience the peak of their lives. And it's a scam, a fraud. So underneath all the drunken revelry, there's that pure suffering of suffering. Then you see, the last time I went there, a guy at a slot machine next to me hits the machine and yells out, I worked so hard for that money. And you're just like, what the fuck did you think was gonna happen? You're playing Wizard of Oz slots with like money that you care about? But still in that moment, he was fully like in the alternation because truly like 20 minutes before his friends were around, they're sharing, they're like, yes, the look in his eyes like, oh my God, my life's about to change for the better. Yeah. Well, you know what the real meaning of Las Vegas is, right? You know the translation or not? No. It translates roughly to something like this, obviously samsaric, clearly samsaric. Right, right. And for which you could kind of dig it in a way. You go like, okay, this is really a chance to blow the whole thing up to the point where you're seeing the engine of the beast in a way. Yes. But it's no worse than any other place. It's the same, basically. It's just on high alert, high relief. I don't mind it there at all. And personally, do you like it? Well, once I learned what you just said, once I learned, I would go there with this idiot mentality of resisting Las Vegas. I don't gamble. It's like, well, why did you come for the shows? You want to see Circus. Well, I don't really enjoy strip clubs. Oh, really? So you're in Las Vegas. You know, it's like saying you don't like baguettes in Paris or something like that. So once I realized you just completely surrendered to the samsaric, throw yourself in completely decadence, insanity, madness, within reason, then it can be really... Well, you're just outlining Duncan. You're just outlining the two extremes, you know, right? You mean Paris and Las Vegas? No. Las Vegas. I love it. I'm in it. I dive all the way in and I'm not... I don't gamble. I don't get it. I don't like it here. So, you know, I've outlined kind of the gutters and the bowling alley of experience. Now, in between there, there's experience unfolding in real time that probably is as worth noting there as it would be anywhere else. Because the art is not getting in the right situation. The art is perfecting the art of awareness, right? Isn't that what we're sort of tuning into? Yes. Sure. Whichever of the six realms you're in, the key is awareness, right? Right. Now, but, you know, can you... Let's talk about awareness in detail, in the sense that, like, when I... Initially, you hear awareness and you feel like... And I imagine it does mean this. You feel like it means a kind of, like, tuning into specific components of your reality, phenomena. Like, tuning into sort of the pixels of phenomena around you. Is that what you mean by awareness? Wow. That's kind of a pointillist approach. You know, I'm sure, you know, some of the Impressionist painters were very happy that you said that. Yeah. Pixels of awareness, right? Yeah. And, well, that raises a really interesting question. Is awareness digital or analog? Is it a high-resolution digital experience, or is it a flowing fluid experience? I think that takes us right back to what you were texting me about earlier, which is continuity and discontinuity. So, is awareness continuous or discontinuous? You know, I'm going to say that it's discontinuous in the way rivers are above ground and underground. That because you're not seeing the river doesn't mean it's not there. Or because, you know, like, for example, it's tragic in California. All these people, because of climate change, they build all these farms. They build all these structures in a dried-up lakebed. But the snows came, the rains came. Now it's turning back into a lake, and they're fucked because they built in a lakebed. And roads and, like, things that just, they thought, well, this lakebed is never returning. Even though it's a lakebed, the water will never come back. So, you know, what your question reminds me of that, that it's, you know, awareness, unawareness being the opposite of that, or, you know, you lose your keys, where was I when I lost my keys? Did I exist at all? Versus coming back and experiencing the moment as fully as you can. Well, I think we train, you know, like the way you and I are training with meditation type of practices is to train in digital awareness, meaning just you want to be as focused and clear as you can about one moment of iteration of the experience of consciousness, right? You want to just be right there with it as it bubbles up to the surface, and they call it now. And then you relax, and then you catch the next one, so that you're constantly developing a muscle of coming back into the present. Yes. Okay, yes. Is that what your practice is like? That's sort of what mine is like, to keep coming back. Yes, but it, you know, and there definitely seems to be a pattern within that, which is that the, first, just the recognition of what that even means, you know, you don't even know if you're doing it or experiencing it, or if this is it at first, you get hit with it. And you, and it's like, this seems like something, and then if you're my dumb ass, you're like, shit, I just got enlightened, baby. This is great. I'm enlightened. And then it just goes away. The lake dries up. Nothing's there. You're back to the thing that you were before. So it's like, it's almost like a little crack appears or something, a little light pops in into a cave in or something. And you're like, shit, is that what I think it is? And then it's gone. And then you start recognizing that as something consistent. At least that's, that's been my experience, and I'm fully prepared to be, and probably am wrong. Well, tell me if this reminds you of what you're saying in any way. So it's a short, short anecdote. The guy is rehearsing for a play, right? And he has one line, big actor, you know, one, one line, the whole play. Okay. And what happens is that when the cannons are fired in the play, his line is, Hark, I hear the cannons roar. That's his one line for the whole play. So of course he takes it very seriously as one would. And then they're having rehearsal after rehearsal, and he's rehearsing at home. He's walking around Hark, I hear the cannons roar, and he's trying with different accents and different flavors. And of course, then they don't actually fire the cannon off in rehearsals because it would be, you know, wasting bullets, so to speak. And now he's in the actual first performance of it after the dress rehearsal and all the rehearsals. And they actually fire the cannon off, and it's so loud. And he's like, what the fuck was that? So is that like practice? Yeah, yes. I think practice is more like that, in a way. Yeah, and I'll tell you that to me, that's like the big, that's the double-edged sword of, as far as I could tell, all spiritual techniques. Is that it gives you an idea, you think you know what cannons are going to sound like. So you're always looking for that. And then the natural cannon fire, fill in the blank, whatever you want it to be, it can't be, if you've never heard a cannon, it doesn't matter how good you are at imagining or extrapolating or picturing. Well, I know what a loud noise is, you will never be able to perfectly replicate a cannon. So that can become very confusing for people, because you're always looking for extrinsic affirmation of this very personal, very natural state. And that's where you get lost. That's where people get, also where they get railroaded and horn swoggled, because they find somebody who they think will affirm an intrinsic state. Yeah, and you'll follow anybody if you're that confused. Absolutely. Like being lost in the desert, you go like this person says, there's water over there. It's kind of the situation that we're in, partly, would you agree? It's sort of where we find ourselves as the curtain goes up a little bit. What do you mean? You know, a little bit bewildered. But what's going on? What's not going on? Yeah, I mean, I think that's a natural, a very natural way to be. It makes sense. Look at how bewildering everything is designed to bewilder. It's, depending on your definition of bewilderment, I mean, you know, the word for it is misinformation these days. That's the new word for Maya. Misinformation. We've got to protect everyone from misinformation. Label shit that this is misinformation and that person's deceptive and this person's deceptive. Deceptive algorithm. And it is. They're not wrong, but they're missing the root, the root of the issue, which is like pretty much as everything. If you are fixated on it as being a constant is going is misinformation. It's bewildering. You're in anything telling you this is a constant is misinforming you like to finish the point. I love car commercials because they are the most incredibly manipulative things you've ever seen in your life. They want you to not you. You can't sell a car to Aaron. They're car people who love cars, but I don't. And so I see them as they are. They all look the fucking same to me. It's a joke with Aaron. She'll be like, what kind of car is that? I have no idea. I don't know. It's a car. It's a buggy. They all look kind of dumb. Some of them are a little more sleek, but that's embarrassing. So the car companies know this. You can't do a commercial like fuck it. Just buy this car. It's like they're all the same, but ours is sort of different. So you got to add to it. You're not just buying a car, buying safety for your family. You're going to start going outside once you get this car. You're you're everything's going to improve with your car. But one thing they show the assholes. They've taken their fucking car to the Mojave Desert. Their marriage is now working out because of this car. They never show five months after you got your stupid car. There's a diet coke bottles laying around ashes in the car. You don't give a shit about the car anymore. The car is nothing. So to me, bewilderment. Bewilderment is the idea that that car is going to give you the new car feeling for the length of the lease or whatever you got into with it. Instead of realizing you're going to get high on this for about six months. If you're lucky, paint of alternation, paint of alternation. So yes, bewilderment. Absolutely not while we're in the car. Take another little drive with me. We left the theater with the guy yelling what the fuck was that. And now we're driving home, which I was, let's say, probably 35 years ago and was driving from Vermont to Montreal snowing, blizzard, bad idea, bad idea. The snow is now, you know how sometimes the snow will go like horizontally? It's like you don't even know which is up and which is down. That's kind of snow. A wiser person than me at that time would have said, all right, we're going to be late. Let's not worry about this. Let's park somewhere. But I didn't. We had to be somewhere. Now we cross over into Canada. And we're on the Canadian side of the border. And I'm driving and the wheels go into a skid, right? And I did everything right. This is the thing you go like, OK, I screwed up. I break fast. I didn't break. I turned into it. I did everything right. And then nothing. And then there was a moment of like, you could say almost orgasmic release without the pleasure element of it. It was just a feeling like diving into the void, right? Yes. And the car went like this. And then the railing just bent the wheels up under the car. And we went down an embankment about 40 feet. Oh, my God. I kind of saw him asking, who's my wife at the time? And asking, are we OK? Did we make it out of this? But there was a moment of the glide going into the oblivion of not knowing anything. And knowing that you were not knowing at that moment. Yeah. It is close to the basic bewilderment. It's also close to the primordial awareness. So all I want to throw out there is that the basic bewilderment, if you don't try to stack stuff on top of like a Chinese acrobat, you know, plates on top of it spinning, but you just go with the basic quality of it, it has already some quality of fundamental knowing and not knowing at a very primal level already in that. Wow. So then just to add another layer to it of the kind of poetry of the world, we're sitting down there and somebody came by and they saw us. So they came walking down and said, you guys all right, we can take you to a hotel and then you can get ready, you know, take your car in the morning. And they drove us back to a gas station. So guess who that was that stopped by and picked us up just by a total accident? Who? The local undertaker. You can't make this stuff up. Yeah, that makes sense. He hangs out by that bad curve. That's all. No, no. He's fishing. Now that's fishing for him. Trust me, the guy hangs out there during those storms just to pick up customers. What better? Find the most deadly, was it a hearse that he had you in? Are you? You know, it might have been his car. You know, it might have been his professional vehicle, that I don't remember. But the point, I guess, was that in that moment of glide, of losing control, which is there are states that we entered in which we are losing control, dream, orgasm, the bardo states that we've talked about before, in which you are not driving the car anymore. Right up until then you were driving the car. Soon after that you'll be driving it again. But that moment is a moment of vivid bewilderment and vivid awareness simultaneously co-emerging. Yeah, that's cool. Yeah, you know, the only thing I could think that happened to me recently like that is forest went galloping out in front of my car towards the road and a car was coming. And yeah, I wasn't there. Like I am not a dexterous person. I'm not athletic. But without me being involved at all, I like went into ninja mode and just snatched him. Like there was no way he could have gotten out in the street. It would have been important. But it wasn't me. Like if I'd spent a millisecond thinking about what I needed to do, it could have been, it wouldn't have been great. I mean, honestly, I think the lady like saw him and break, but still it was like that moment of like, shit, I see what you're saying. Like who did that? Where after the point you're thinking, who was that? Like what, where is that person all the other times I've tried to do athletic things? What was that? Where was, who was I in that moment? Because it wasn't me. But if you look at the layering of your mind and what you would call your ordinary state of being you, right, having the identity. I mean, we've studied this, but you can look at it. It's layered from that basic ground of kind of not knowing or also kind of in not knowing being very presently awake because there's not a lot of knowing to cover up the awake. And then layering on top of that thought after thought after thought by the time you get to the 19th thought you had, you're way far away from that basic ground. You're not, you're not in touch with the ground of bewilderment or of awareness. Okay, so this is what I want to talk to you about is that the basic ground of awareness. I'm curious about this only because, you know, quite often it gets described as groundlessness. And yet there seems to be a quality to it that is more grounded than anything else, that it is fundamentally stable. There isn't a... In fact, it's so fundamentally stable that if anything amplifies the instability, you know, it demonstrates more how whatever the thing is in the natural world or in the world or whatever it is that you're looking for is this is an example of, this is my rock. All of those things seem like transparencies compared to it. So I think it's a little confusing in that it gets described as groundlessness. Yeah, it's beautiful, isn't it? Yeah. Because otherwise you'd latch onto it in a certain way, you know, and that's the groundless part. There's nothing to latch onto in it and collaborate on it. Sure. We used to get in comfort and security from our elaboration on that basic quality of, you know, not knowing or vividly not knowing, yet still there's some kind of clear intelligence operating and clarity of mind at the same time. So from that point of view, it's groundless, it's unlayered, there's nothing to grasp onto. And from the other point of view that you're talking about, it has some strange, they call it the mother and child reunion, actually, in Tantra. No way. Yeah, it's like the mind is coming home to some sense of space that is very familiar to us at the same time. Yeah. And you could, you know, you could say, you know, I played with K.D. last weekend up at Garrison Institute. He got one in his talk, he said one thing about that the mantra, at a certain point, the mantra starts to feel like home and the wandering mind feels like, you know, vacation. Yeah. It reverses, you know. And I thought, yeah, that's true. The natural mind, at a certain point, you could, without all the elaboration, you could become familiar with it enough that it feels like, ah, well, just ah, you know, it feels like you've arrived at something that is stable in the way that you're talking about. Yeah. In fact, there's words used for it beyond stable. Like what? Like, well, in the great Buddhist, you know, comedy club of all time, permanent is one word is used. What a bait and switch. Oh, no kidding, man. You've got to be kidding me. That's a bait and switch, the whole bait and switch there. That's the layer. And that's very funny, though. That is very funny. Yeah, it is funny. There's other words, though, just to be fair. Like what? Which would be, well, like clear. There's clarity, quality. Luminous. Sure. There's a kind of brightness of energy around that. It's unobstructed. Brilliance, if you like. And, you know, unshakable or, you know, some kind of feeling, it's not based on a relative, you know, if this happened then that would happen, then this would happen. It's just kind of stable in a certain way. Yeah. Yeah. The, I think that what's funny about it and the reason I said the underground river thing is just because I don't, I don't, and we're talking about continuity specifically, but because one of the words is permanence, then it would imply that regardless of how absolutely bonkers you have been, it's always been there. Even if you were fixated on this or that your whole life. Or lifetimes. Lifetimes. It wouldn't negate this thing. Eons. Yeah. Yeah. And then safe. What about safe? Is that word get applied to it? That's a tricky word. It seems more relative, at least the way it sounds to me is like safe from what? Death. You can't be safe. Period. You're safe from something. If a lion's chasing you, you're safe from that. I mean, the way, the way Ram Dass says dying is completely safe. Oh, I don't know. I, I, I'd have to, we have to get him back so we can have that conversation. It's going to be hard. One more year. One more year. Yeah. You know, one more year we're going to have everyone back. Don't worry. AI is bringing everyone back for better or for worse. You know, actually that, and we don't have to talk about this because I'm excited about the talk we're going to do about it and I don't want to ruin anything that we're going to talk about. Well, can, and can we just mention that right now? Yeah, sure. May 9th, these two gentlemen, Duncan Trussell and David. Where? Oh, us. That's us. We'll be having a workshop online about AI and Dharma, basically. So we're going to not get into it tonight, but if you're, if you're able to register for that on May 9th at DharmaMoon.com, you can come and hear us get that topic. And if you register, even if you can't come to the live thing, you'll be able to get the recording. So I'm looking forward to that. I think we're going to like open, you know, a kind of interesting window by talking about that. I already had some interesting thoughts about it, but we're going to wait until May 9th to do that, right? I'm going to blow one thought, though, because this is, yeah. A teaser. So my friend sent me some article about how like in a year, we're looking at a year or two, you know, digital replicas of our parents. And I, I gotta tell you, man, I mean, I love my mom. But for a quick second, I was like, fuck, do I really want an infinite mom? Do we really want that? It's going to be great at first. But like how long before, like how long before all like, wait a minute. Can I delete my mom? Like do I do I anyway, we'll talk about this more in the, in our conversation. But yeah, I, you know, I think that the, all of the world, all the paths kind of like tinker around with this idea of coming home. Christianity. You get the prodigal son, the prodigal son goes, goes out. One son stays home. Does every does everything right. The other son goes and like goes to brothels and just fucks his life up ends up becoming like a pig. I don't know what you call it. What's a pig shepherd? Is that a thing like he takes? It's a good title for an album or something. You know, pig shepherds or a band, the pig shepherds. The pig shepherds, but he has to take care of pigs, which apparently, I don't know if there's ever been a time that they're supposed to be so smart. I don't know if they need to be taken care of that way. They just need to be, you need to feed them. I think keep the dirt, wet, throw in sloth. But like, yeah, so he like his whole, he basically destroys his life, comes slouching back to his father's home, destroyed, and his father, and he comes to his father and says, I'm sorry, and expecting rejection or something. And though, though, because I look deeply into this, I love this parable, but before he could finish his apology, his father is embracing him. So like he can't even keep saying, I'm sorry. It's just instantly embraced. And then his father basically says, we are throws this decadent party that and his son, his other son, he's like out in the fields, comes back and is like, what the fuck, like really? Like you're throwing a party for this asshole. We win is my party. It's literally what he says. And his father says something on the lines of like, you've been alive this whole time. But that which is dead has now come back to life. That's why we're throwing the party. And so isn't that cool? In relation to what we're talking about is like that that that that tantric reunion between mother and child has wrapped up in it. All of the beauty of watching, you know, after a child has done some destruction and has been scolded by the parent is reabsorbed is reabsorbed. The hug is there. No hard feelings. Everything's fine. You know, that's a beautiful, that's a beautiful thing. And I think in relation to this thing we're talking about, if we are going to talk about this groundless ground, it's truly the most incredible thing that that's a possibility that you get to go flopping around, getting become a pig shepherd out here, get lost, shoveling shit to pigs. And the any moment when if you wanted to, I think that's the in italics part of it. You got you kind of have to want to. Right? Like you can. Well, for example, just, you know, they say that samsara, which is sort of we're talking, that's the part where it's sort of endless cycling through, you know, kind of stages and levels of bewilderment and confusion, and taking it for, you know, basically mistaking a rope for a snake, you know, not seeing things as they are, and just on and on with one bumble after another and one, you know, one confusion leading to the next one. They said that's endless. Yeah, that process is not self relieving. So with what you're saying, there needs to be something intervening in order for the process of undoing that to become to get underway. Now, what that is, is that some kind of hitting bottom? Is that some kind of insight? Is that meeting somebody? Is that reading a book? That idea has to be introduced. And in most of the realms, it's not there. That's called the dharma. It's just not there. There's nothing interrupting the hell realm. For example, hell realms can go on for eons. Wow. Holy shit. That's terrifying. Yeah. But that's why there's a Buddha in each of the realms. A Buddha is not a person in that case. It's a sort of intelligence. In each realm, there's some kind of intelligence that's saying it's possible even in this context to recognize the nature of the experience as being causal. You know, one thing is causing the next thing is causing the next thing is causing the next thing. And the next thing that's happening to it is by recognizing the gap. Right. Right. Every realm has a gap. See, I think that's the key word here, is recognition. Recognition. Yeah. Versus discovery. You know, it's being able to identify the thing to really know the difference between a cannon and a bird tweeting. You know, to understand those two differences, I think, and then having feedback from people like you. I think that you do require, like, there does need to be a community around it or something. I mean, I think it would be very difficult, but not impossible, minus a community. But I think the community aspect of it is where you really need that. Not just to be like, was that a fucking cannon I just heard? You know, but also to the other experience of, I don't hear the cannon anymore. What happened to the cannon? Well, but you're iterating the three jewels. That's Sangha. Right. And, you know, it's not that easy to recognize. Also, you're saying recognize is a big word. It's the right word, actually, for mindfulness. And the word in Sanskrit is smirty, which the Val police have attacked because there's not enough vowels in that word. It's like SMR. Come on, give me a break. Give me a vowel. Can I get a vowel? Yeah. And it means recollection or recognition. Yeah. You're remembering something, which is the quality of being, that you're noticing that you're distracted and the quality of kind of simply returning. And, you know, I think people make, you can miss it by making too big a deal about it. That's why I call it ordinary mind, too. It's just not that big a deal. Now, you know, I would say the ordinary mind thing is problematic in that I feel like when I hear that initially, at least, I always say this people, I don't know why I can't tell you how I, when I, my friend, a very good friend of mine said, dude with one ball and a fucking weird beard. A dude with one ball. It's like, there's a guy with one ball. He heard that and found it off-putting. I hope it didn't off-put the other ball. That's all I've got to say about it. Off-putting in the sense, yeah, that's how he lost his ball, man. It's off-putting in the sense that in the world, we equate ordinary with not good. Yes, that's right. It's dull. So when you hear, well, here's some goal or whatever. It's very ordinary. You will be like, why the fuck do I want that? I need a fireworks show. I want high-fidelity, I want something wild, man. You know, or like, you know, sometimes Forest will say to me, I want to go somewhere new. So you hear it and you're put off by it a little bit, maybe, because it makes it sound like you're going to be in a DMV waiting area or something. Yeah, I mean, it's true. The language is very particular in that way, and you want to adapt the language to who you're talking to. And you know how people, they're speaking in a foreign country, or to somebody who does not speak English and they just start talking louder? Yes. That's not that smart, you know what I mean? That's not the problem. So we do that in a lot of different ways, probably, right? Right. Yeah, yeah. But I mean, like, what could be more ordinary than that? And what's interesting about that, though, is that somehow in that descriptor, is an implication that actually the Samsaric world or the world of getting, like, all up in your head and immersed in the stories is extraordinary. That we, in fact, if you're just living in a normal sort of life of suffering, that's extraordinary that you have gotten into that situation. That's an extraordinary situation to be in. If the reality is that you're, as much as anything else, part of this very ordinary, groundless state. We're going to cut to a quick break. Vitamins. Nobody really likes them. They're compressed, horrific pills. Many of them have hard, sharp edges. Rip your throat as you try to swallow them down. 100% of the time they taste like shit and they make your burps smell. Is that what you want to put in your body to feel better? Why would you do that to yourself when you could take athletic greens? Friends, when I drink my athletic greens every day, it's as though a rain of glorious poured upon my cells. My body delights in it. The little angels that live inside the subatomic particles within all of us seeing praises. They are so energized by the nectar that is athletic greens. It actually tastes good. You don't want to be a vitamin person, do you? You want to arrange your vitamins. You want to have those weird pill bottles all over your house. Monday, take 70 of these. Tuesday, 30 of these. I can't do it. Also, I don't like vomiting. It's not one of my favorite things. You know how it works. You take the vitamins at the wrong time before food or you're supposed to take them after food. The next thing you know, you're doing exorcist level geysers of vitamin puke all over your children. No, thank you. Athletic greens is the healthiest thing you can do in under a minute. It's powerful because it's so easy to fit in your lifestyle. Just one scoop of this magical powder mixed with water once a day. It's been part of millions of mornings since 2010. Friends, we're talking 75 vitamins, minerals, and whole food-sourced ingredients of the highest quality. It gives me major benefits like gut and mood support, boosted energy, beautiful-looking skin. The other day, someone said, your skin reminds me of a newborn unicorn. I just winked at him and said, If you're looking for an easier way to take supplements, Athletic Greens is giving you a free one-year supply of vitamin D and five free travel packs with your first purchase.

If you're looking for an easier way to take supplements, Athletic Greens is giving you a free one-year supply of vitamin D and five free travel packs. Go to athleticgreens.com. That's athleticgreens.com. Check it out. Yeah, an ordinary has a deflating quality that in this case is appropriate to go with that meaning. It's untrumped up. It's not exceptional. There's nothing to be chased down. There's nothing to be hunted after. So really, probably most people, most of us could arrive at it out of disappointment, out of letting go, you know, rather than achieving some kind of high, you know? It's very tricky because, you know, the engine of samsara is basically the notion that you could add something to the situation that will complete it. Yeah, right. The thing we're talking about, there's nowhere to hang your diploma. Like, otherwise it'd be covered. And I think that's kind of one of the, when they talk about liberation or, you know, a terminal talk about revolution. In a way, you could say it's revolutionary only in the sense that it's inaccessible to target. Like, it's inaccessible to branding. It's inaccessible to anybody who wants to lay claim to it or make it theirs. This is my groundless state of emptiness or welcome to the Starbucks tent in the realm of emptiness. In that way, there's a truly liberating quality to it if you've gotten sick of, like, being constantly drawn into infinite scams, generally self-perpetuated scams. Infinite self-perpetuated scam world. Yeah, infinite self-perpetuating scam world. Eventually, you get so sick of it. That's literally what they say is, there's, when I first learned that word, renunciation, which is part of the Buddhist path, is, the actual, I believe in Tibet, it's like something like Chinook. And it sounds a lot like Chinook. Yeah, it's amazing. Chinook. But it means nauseated. Yeah. And that feeling, you know, when you are about, when you get nauseous, it's like a feeling you just can't abide it anymore. You can't hold it down anymore. And that's what they say is that the renunciation is recognizing that quality in samsara, is that you've been there long enough, you've done it long enough. You've been up and down long enough, you've been disappointed long enough, you've been exhilarated long enough, and, you know, beginning to look for maybe something more stable quality, you know. Yeah. And then in looking for that, you can't find anything solid to hold onto there either, so you get a chance to feel the groundlessness, you know, there, before you touch the ground of that open space, you know. You know, that's, you know, do you get in a Jean-Paul Sartre at all? As an English major at Columbia College, I did. You know, that's his most famous book, right? Naja, the description of, that's what he called it, like he identified it that way too. Just like, and people hear that, and I think with him, you could argue he was quite pessimistic in a certain way. But, you know, people hear all this stuff and they feel like it sounds so pessimistic. It sounds, you know, oh really, you're going to call this nauseating. Are you kidding? Have you seen the new season of Succession? It's incredible. That episode made me cry. How dare you call this nauseating? I had a wonderful time in Costa Rica. Nauseating? Why would you say that? That wasn't nauseating. You Buddhists are so fucking bitter. You're, you know, and that, to me, I think that's where it gets really interesting is that in a lot of the descriptors, you're not hearing a critique of the world or of life or rejection of life as much as like a big sire relief from people who are like, oh fuck, that was nauseating. Like, you know, you go to, when you get off the roller coaster, you know, and you're sick, and then finally that nausea dissipates. What's a better feeling than when finally, oh my god, oh that was fucking nauseating. So I think sometimes in these descriptors, you're getting, you're confusing some, it gets confusing for people. An off-putting, it maybe even has the opposite effect. Sure. Well, you know, it could be that often Buddhism is the last stop on the train. Like you're riding around on the train, and you know, somewhere deep in the bowels of Brooklyn, it just, the train stops. There are no more stops. No more options. And you're just kind of sitting there. Unfortunately, that's sort of the Buddhist stop in a way. It doesn't offer more entertainment. And you know, it can be presented that way. And there is certainly a magnetic dimension to having given up and given in that much so that you're not grasping at phenomena anymore as a solution to a basic underlying problem of what is my identity. So I'll grasp it more phenomena in order to stabilize my sense of identity. And so there is a kind of definite desolation to it that's been spoken about quite a lot by different teachers. And then there is, you know, there are kind of things about it that can be presented in a magnetic way. And probably the role of a teacher is to be not a desolate the way you're talking about all the time. Well, you're not. For example, it's the ultimate sense of humor is at that last stop in the bowels of Brooklyn. You want to get some funny jokes. That's where you're going to get them. Right. Yeah, well, I mean, there is something innately funny about it. I mean, it actually is the four, you know, there is something within it that is incredibly comedic, but only because, like, it's not so goddamn funny when you haven't even when you have maybe haven't caught quite a glimpse of it. It's not funny at all. That's a tragedy. That is not a comedy. That's hell. That's a tragedy. It's just what you're talking about. But you catch that glimpse of the thing and then suddenly, yeah, it can become comedic or romantic or just poignant. It can become quite poignant. And yeah, yeah, I get I get that. I just I think that the mother and child reunion thing, that's a good way to describe, like, you know, like, think of when you come home from college, you know, you're college, you're on acid, you're banging girls with hairy legs. I'm sorry I said banging. You're making love to girls. You're making love to girls with hairy legs and you I don't think I've ever banged a day in my life. I don't even know if you call it making love. It's more of like a quick pop than a bang. Anyway, I don't have to get any details about that. You know, you come home and you have, you know, you've gotten your college. You've got you've convinced yourself. You're Dostoevsky or some shit. And then, you know, you come home and there's something incredibly boring about that. You're not looking forward to it even maybe you're like, I've got to go home. This is here we go back to home. But then you get home and your mom's in the driveway. My mom will come out in the driveway and she hugs you and, you know, and you smell your house and you get this. Something you just can't get. You're not going to get anywhere else. And so I think that is a perfect descriptor. It's like, except at home, you're not Dostoevsky anymore. You know, you're the kid who's you're still you. You're the person whose diapers were changed and who went through all the various phases that you were seen for and then that you're just you. That's you don't get the same if you've managed to like stir up some controversy about you in college or wherever you are getting off on that narcissistic twist that you've learned. You won't get that kind of generally. You don't get a order for that. There isn't that. So it's mundane. It's boring. But it's the best thing ever. People. It's harder to bullshit people because they know you pretty well. No more bullies. Your mother is extraordinary. Your mother. Let's just take a moment and just bow deeply at the feet of your mother. Thank you. What an extraordinary person that the communication you had with her is is not to be taken for granted. You know, most people don't have it. No, I got lucky without one. I was a good one. I share it with people like us, you know, who go, wow, that was some conversation there that you had. And for people who don't know what I'm talking about, you know, I'm talking about the last episode of the midnight gospel in which you are sharing your heart and mind with your mother in the most vulnerable moment possible, which is her begin to leave the world. And boy, I left a big imprint on me and I'm sure other people too. It's worth appreciating that for a minute. Wow. You know, mothers get short shrift in our society, you know, in the same way that like what you're talking about, the primordial awareness gets short shrift. In fact, you could almost say it's like an identical discarding of the damn thing, you know what I mean? But here is this thing that is completely, completely there for you, always there, there. And I mean mother archetype. I know some of us don't have that kind of mom or right now you don't have that kind of mom. But you know what I mean? But it's so there. Well, you're right. If you don't have it from your physiological mother doesn't doesn't diminish the principle of it. Because somewhere in this world there is that bank of energy that is nurturing supportive, you know, unchanging in terms of not not fickle. Yeah, in terms of the affection and everybody has a right to find a place like that. Even if it's a friend or a counselor or, you know, a dog. How do people have that with their dog? Yeah, yeah. Well, but it's, it's, you know, I do think it's like the first trick that the world wants to play on you is to get you to forget about your mom, to like forget about that quality, what you came from, all of it is the first trick. And in fact, in horror movies, my friend was telling me he took a seminar on writing horror scripts. And in horror movies, a repeating pattern in horror movies is you can't talk to your mom anymore. So like what was your, when was the last time you saw Alien? Oh, I've seen that. Do you remember what the name of the ship was? I forgot. Mother. Oh, right. Okay. And losing contact with mother. Holy mackerel. Yeah. So that plays into like the deepest primordial. Well, it goes deeper than that because the, the most ferocious alien is the mother, right? What? Which one? In the aliens, the one who she has the most endless battle with is the mother of the aliens. Right. Yeah. Well, I mean, yeah, right. So they even from that perspective of like what you think is hostile and aggressive, they've got a mother. I mean, acid and you know, protecting them. Yeah. Don't fuck with mothers. I mean, the, the, the, the, you really shouldn't. I mean, this is a, you know, again, like I don't care what the animal is. You find a chipmunk. Try to fuck with the chipmunks babies. Watch that chipmunk. The chipmunk will come, come so wrathful. We don't picture chipmunks is wrathful. And honestly, I'm just free ball and free ball. And is that a thing? I'm, but I'm guessing spitballing, I think is what they call it. Not free balling, spitballing free balling is very different. Right. If you stick your finger into a chipmunks nest where there's babies, you're going to bring back a bloody finger. And the chipmunk isn't thinking it's a giant doing this. So in the, in the description of mothers, which is what I love about Eastern traditions is they really cover all the angles of the mama. You know, it's, it's not just the loving, embraceful mother. It's the wrathful, protective mother. It's the mother that's scolding you mother. I was just talking to my friend about this. It's the sexy mother. You know, the whole picture gets covered. So I think if we're going to say this groundless primordial awareness state is a mother and child reunion situation, would you argue that within that primordial emptiness, those qualities somehow still exist? Well, yeah, do they exist in it as embedded as potentiality without a doubt? They're unmanifested at that level, but then they very quickly manifest a rise from it and take those forms that you're talking about. And dissolve back into the bigger space. So there is, I think, a space that's beyond what you're talking about. That's non-dual in nature. But it's very potent and for it to express itself even slightly, it has to manifest in polarity, which is what I think Tantra really is about. It's not really, the practicing end of it is dual. It is polarity. It is understanding the dynamic of that. And it's expressed as masculine and feminine. You can think of that in different ways if you need to. And you certainly don't have to associate it with the physical body of the male and the female. When you visualize the deity, that's a masculine and feminine deity in union. It's just you, an individual, visualizing it. And they're inseparably interlinked. And they're both aspects of yourself. So there's no attempt to sort of, let's say, have a sociological depiction of it. That could get you down the wrong tube. But there is polarity. And I think that's where people, that's where I balk at sometimes the new age, or some of the traditions go, you know, they are so much drawn to the non-dual, the blended quality of reality. But really, if you look at the challenge or the energy sparking, it comes from polarity. Now, these days, the polarity has gotten too stiff and too tight and it's not really dancing, you know? How do you mean? Well, you know, it's like, I've noticed this recently, like all kinds of arguments are arising in which one side has a very hard left and one side has a very hard right. So it's like the stereo image is too severe. Right. There's not like that nice blend of, oh, that creates a pastiche, that creates a diorama, that creates a kind of playful but powerful and challenging field of activity. It just creates warfare. Okay. What you just said reminds me of the story Krishnadas talks about. I can't remember. It was one of the, I can't remember which person it was hanging around with Neem Karoli Baba. One of Neem Karoli Baba's close associates. And Krishnadas tells the story of how they would have screaming philosophical fights in India, screaming at each other. But underneath it is just love. Like underneath it, which is my favorite kind of philosophical argument where with someone you trust and you love, you're able to trust each other enough to get into those kinds of like, absolutely. One of my best friends when we were in India, we were in a terrible argument. He flipped a table. He was like, when were you guys, we're going to stop this. You know, and it was the best and we're best friends to this day. But it was like, we loved each other enough that we could go to that level with each other and know at the other side of that. We're friends. Like it's not going anywhere. And I think what you're talking about is like, people are having those screaming fights minus the love. And then they're shooting each other quite literally. It's beyond a metaphor at this point. It's like, you go knocking on somebody's door and they come out with a shotgun. It's like, we're in crazy town right now. I mean, a lot of people are just living some kind of like measured existence and with consequences and things like that. But I think a lot of people I know feel like the train is slipping off the rails a little bit. Do you have that feeling? Well, yeah. I mean, I think the problem is that we haven't gotten to the last stop yet and the train is slipping off the rails. But I think the change is terrifying. Change is terrifying. And when people are afraid, they get angry instantly. And so like, you know, like today, I think we were just out during I laughed about it because we're having this nice text about emptiness. And some mother decided to do that thing where they have stick out of the turning lane instead of going all the way in the turning lane. A relatively minor offense in the world of driving and certainly when I am very guilty of. So I think I had just responded to you with voice text, some some bullshit about emptiness. This person does that. And I'm like, I played on the horn instantly. I didn't think about it. And then I'm driving and I'm laughing because I'm like, Jesus Christ, like I didn't think when I did that. Like I was looking back at that. I'm like, there was no, I'm going to teach this person a lesson or I need to really this person should understand the danger that they're presenting. Sure. Or the selfishness or it was just pure rage. Right. So that when you do when you go out in your of your house and shoot somebody or in your yard and shoot somebody. That means you have to think about the state of consciousness preceding the event. You know what I mean? That like there you're pretty wound up, man. You're pretty fucking wound up. I'm guessing. I don't know, but I imagine that my laying on the horn moment for them, it's shooting someone. Yes, that's right. I mean, it's like they're not there. And then they have to then add that's why they always have that weird look on their face after they've done it. Yeah, they're trying to work out in their mind. Yeah, how they managed to shoot somebody for going in their yard. You know, and so that I think the reason you're going to see upticks and uptick. I think you could just predict the more terrified people become, the more you can expect violence, the more completely freaked out people become the more. And then that creates the feedback loop, doesn't it? Because the more violence, the more terrified people become. And there's the Kali Yuga. Right. That's the idea. And the flip side of it is, I don't, you know, it's all terrible. And I saw that young teenage boy who just went to the wrong address by mistake to pick up his brother and sister. And all you have to do to really connect is think, what if that was my son? Yeah. Everybody could just for a minute put it all down and think, however this happened, what if that was my son? He went to the wrong address to pick up his brother or sister and innocently and somebody shot them. How would you feel? That's all you need to know. I mean, you need to know that it could be your son or your daughter and then you're going to have a different attitude towards it. Let's stretch it out to even more blasphemous terrain. Think of all the sons and daughters who were engaged in shit they shouldn't have been engaged in and got shot for it. Does that make it any better? I mean, is anything here good? Like, does it make it like, you know, everyone's like, you know, of course, it's a fucking tragedy that that happens by accident. It seems to be happening over and over. But anytime it happens for whatever, I mean, think of like the pregnant woman who was shoplifting at Walgreens or whatever and got shot. Like, does that somehow make it's a softer blow that somebody thought that was the right decision in that moment? No. No, like, think of the justified war, you know, the, you know, like, so does that make it better when we're watching like Russian soldiers get exploded by drones? Is suddenly that great when we're seeing someone in their last moments looking desperately up at the sky knowing they're about to die? No, no matter, no matter what the fact that this is a is where we've come to in our ability to have conversations regarding properties. Safety, justice is that this is the resort. Just some brutish, stupid violence. No, like all of it across the board is indicative of a massive amount of terror in the zeitgeist right now. A massive amount of fear, a massive amount of confusion. You know, I'm not that's not to say that when things are calmer, this shit doesn't happen. But yeah, I know. And again, I'm always speaking from my own personal experience with rage. It's going back to the earlier part of our pre conversation here before we started recording this. Just hello, everybody out there. Let's just join in wishing Duncan a happy birthday today. It's his birthday and April 20th. Yeah. And is it okay to say how old you are? Do you mind? Yeah, I don't mind. Okay, so 49, which is a big birthday because of the seven sevens and what I got seven sevens. I didn't even think of that. God, that explains why I'm feeling so good lately. It's a it's a big cycle moment. And they say you, you know, at that point, you can start spiraling up or spiraling down in terms of comically, you know. But that's a little esoteric thing. And then funny, you should say that because my friend for my birthday gave me heroin and a heroin needle. Right after we have this conversation, I was going to shoot up for the first time. Well, that'd be hopefully. That's an up spiral. Yeah. I'm just kidding. That's a bad joke. I'm sorry, David. But and here to make matters worse, what we shared is that it's also Adolf Hitler's birthday. God damn it. So how's that for co-emergence that you, the angel of light that you are and well being have shared the same origin point, birth point as probably one of the more obvious demonic manifestations in history. It's very annoying because we also, and again, I don't know why I'm making this podcast so freaking testicular. But apparently, apparently Adolf Hitler only had one ball. No. So we don't just share birthdays. Oh, is that true? I've looked it up and it's sort of like we don't know if that was propaganda or if that's real. Is it the same ball? I don't know. I've never seen Adolf Hitler's balls. I don't think there's a picture of them. Nobody knows which ball he didn't have. How weird would it be if he trimmed his bush with the same stupid mustache right above his junk? Adolf. Yeah. Adolf, 420, Columbine. It's a real, like it's a mixed birthday to have because there's all kinds of like shitty things that happen. Or I think Oklahoma City bombing right around now. We got to own him. We got to own him because I'm Jewish, you know. This is a big deal for me. Big, big deal. We can still be friends. People talk about, you know, challenging traumatic experiences. You know, this is the big, big, as big as it gets in my personal psyche. But, you know, we can't say he's another species from another planet. We can't really say that. He's one of us and he went that way and a lot of people followed. That's something to be really aware of. Nobody like that could do it on their own. Impossible. No. So we all have some of that, you know, whatever that energy is of wanting so hard to be right. I mean, it's sort of trivializing what that is all about. But at some level, it's the opposite of the mother and child reunion. Well, yeah. It's, you know, it's just a classic, like. It's the child killing the mother. Yeah. It's the, what's the story? There's the famous philosopher. I can't remember his name. It doesn't matter yet. Another famous Greek philosopher. He was renowned. And I think it was Caesar takes out his whole troop, his whole entourage, golden chariots, all the bullshit to go see this philosopher. I think was living next to a river. I think it was Diogenes, maybe I'm not sure, but living next to a river, eating out of a, I think he ate out of a dog bowl. And so Caesar comes and is standing before him and says to him, I will give you anything you want. And apparently this philosopher, I think Diogenes says, could you move a little to the right? You're blocking my light. Cause he was standing. Ultimate burn. Ultimate emperor burn. Roasted. Roasted. Like brutalized by this philosopher who's like, get the fuck. You're not buying me, motherfucker. Get out of here. Is that true? Is that true story? Yeah. Yeah. Look it up. It was the ultimate just refutation. The similar story when, you know, they try to trap Jesus by asking if should we pay taxes? Right. And he said, show me a coin. And whose face is on that coin? Caesar. And he said, give unto Caesar that, which is Caesar's. Another slap in the face. Which is like, yeah, take your stupid discs. You can have all of them. Take your little metal discs. You can have as many as you fucking want. You know, but that, you know, the, the, the enlightened ones, they're always doing that to power. And Hitler obviously is an example of someone trying to be the son, trying to be God, trying to be the sum total of everything. And, and, and, and that what sucks is, you know, the sun, the sun doesn't wear cool outfits, you know, so people get confused by it. The, the, the, what we're talking about, which I think you could argue as a kind of sun, primordial awareness. You know what I mean? Sun is good. Yeah. Even sun burns out faster than primordial awareness does though. Yes. Right. It's that kind of notion of time is embedded there. So, so the, the Hitler situation I think would be a person trying to trick people into thinking they're primordial awareness or they're the son or they're creating a completely unnecessary intermediary, right? That's, that's the issue. And, and religious, religions are famous for doing that too. Creating that intermediary and the intermediate intermediary by mistake or, you know, collusion or whatever happens, tries to lay claim to the primordial. Yeah. Yeah. Right. That's it. And then, in desperation, you go, well, okay, you are my source for the primordial. But that's like a very subtle point that, you know, you can have very potent and strong teachers who are smart and learned and, you know, deeply trained, but they don't own the primordial. That's a mistake. Yeah. Right. They don't own that access. They don't have it. You can't package it. No, they point to it. Yeah. They point to it. But don't, yeah. And I think that's where it gets interesting is like, I think, I don't know for sure about this, but I don't think there has to be any particular ethical, moral component to like, to recognize that thing that we're talking about. That's the, you can recognize it, but that doesn't necessarily mean that you're in that recognition. You're necessarily going to be making great decisions all the time, especially if you just catch a glimpse of it. Right. That's a super important point there. It's almost like a whole nother podcast, but you catch a glimpse of that. Yeah. If you're catching glimpses of it, it means it's not stabilized as your reference point. So therefore you're flickering, it's flickering on and off and all kinds of things are going to happen. But even, even if it's somewhat stable and the person has a kind of grounded groundlessness, you're right. That does not equate necessarily to the development of skillful means in action. That could be a separate learning curve. And I, you know, I don't, I know we only have a little bit more time here, but you know, I don't know why. I know I'm doing it now because I'm reading this great Charles Manson book, but I started watching Charles Manson videos again. And when you, what I think was so incredibly confusing about him as I think when you see him, you do see someone who seems to have caught a glimpse of this thing. You do see someone who's not faking it. You do see someone who's like really in the moment and someone who's like really just right there and yet not all like completely violent, completely power hungry, completely wanting to be the son. I mean his name was literally Manson, like wanting to like be the, the sum total, you know, it's a different spelling of son, obviously. But you know what I'm saying is like, this is a big, I think people, this is where people get really in trouble is because. Well, and it's a notion of rudra hood, rudra, the Tantra student who killed his teacher and became a kind of cause because there's it, once there's a certain amount of understanding or even cities, even little, you know, talents and powers that manifest because the person is kind of strongly moving towards some kind of wakeful situation at that glitch where they begin to freeze that up and kind of like see it as a power struggle. That's the most dangerous people that you have on the spiritual path, actually. Yeah. There's warnings about becoming that is the biggest warning I got and, and, you know, how to deal with it. So it's not, you know, it's not saying don't go for it, you know, but it's saying there has to be a system of checks and balances, which is usually teacher and that's why when Rudra killed his own teacher, he removed the system of checks and balances that he there was no one or anybody who could tell him he was wrong. Right. He got rid of the one like last like thing that was protecting him and then fuck your fuck like I maybe this is why in some traditions like Kabbalah or whatever they say you can't study this until you get to a certain age and the reason is because, you know, by the time you get to be my age, you're too exhausted to run a cult. You know what I mean? You're so fucking tired. You're not going to like, you know what I mean? The odds of you getting all mants and out by the glimpse or something like that or you're just like, you just want to nap. You want to roll a pina colada, you want to fucking pina colada, not, not a, not a chalice of LSD surrounded by filthy hippie girls humping each other. That sounds the opposite of fun to you when you get to my age. You're so old already. I'm only 49 today and look how, look at how I'm, I'm, well, I got kids. So it's like the whole orgy thing kind of goes out the window and you know what I mean? Like your, your priorities shift, you know, you, you, you just want to get home from dinner in time to watch a show and go to sleep. You know, so that, that's, and I like that. Yeah. I, I find that to be really wonderful. I did. It was not fun in the days of hungry for orgies and chalices of acid. I mean, it was fun, but not the same kind of fun. Well, you know what's happening is you're sort of fully getting boring. Well, no, you're, you're literally moving into the human realm, which it, which it's hard to see it, but it's, it's not one of the liberations. It's another realm, but it has this, it has a possibility because it's, there's not so much confidence or desolation. There's something between the two, which makes you a little more vulnerable to, um, you know, um, seeing the nature of the experience as it is, uh, but it's also a trap. Great. Another fucking Buddhist trap. I mean, you know, Buddha was in the human realm and then he had to go out and do a whole lot of practice, you know, look, I'll take human realm. It's a pretty great place. I mean, well, it's the only place, according to Buddhism that you can really do to have the conversation we're having right now. Right. Like, that's the only place. If we're jealous gods, gods, we can't have this conversation. If we're in hell realm, we can't have it. Yeah. If like Brian Wilson is like, if you're kissing Brian Wilson's feet or whatever your filthy ass is doing, you know what I mean? Like it's, what are you, what are you doing? What's going on here? What's, what are you, what are you up to here, Manson? Didn't anyone just take him aside and say, what's going on here, man? What are you doing? What's your plan? I guess if you did that, he'd be like, my, what is my plan? You are my plan. You, you make my plan, my plan. Some bullshit. Well, you know, even in nature, there are poisonous spiders, deadly poisonous snakes. You know, not every creature is meant to be, you know, handled with a kind of innocence and naivete as you, as you connect with them. Yeah. And I think the reason I get attracted to that story is because I recognize in me someone who would be like talking to a friend and be like, you've got to meet this guy I met, he is so fucking cool. His name is Charles Manson. He's got a ranch not far away. Let's go up there. If at the very least he's got like cute girls around him, good acid. Like I could just see me and he completely pulled in to, to that daddy figure that he was, you know, the like, has he played the daddy role or the like. But he was never an actual father, though. Oh, yes, he was. He had children. Yeah, Manson had. Yeah, you think he didn't have kids? He had a lot of kids. I don't know. He just didn't raise him. But yeah, I mean, David, this is a different podcast. We have a few minutes, but I'll, I'll send you, I'll send you. The funniest thing was there was this dude in LA claiming to be Manson's son and trying and having some band like that was like based on the theme that he was Manson's son. And then I think a paternity paternity test. They like he like he got pressured into doing a paternity test. And he was not the son of Charles. In fact, I think Manson's kids intentionally. It's that's not the first thing you're going to put on your resume. Like they intentionally avoid identifying him as their dad. You know, well, in honor of all the. Potentially misguided and, you know, kind of badly constructed human beings who've caused so much harm to other others and recognizing that we all have the potential to manifest that or manifest some kind of wise wisdom and compassion and that takes intention. It takes effort in that spirit. You know, we can recognize that without eschewing it and thinking it's not part of our ecosystem, right? Right, right, it should be recognized. And and that's why I think the dark side has to be kind of the shadow aspect has got to be worked with in your spiritual practice. Yeah, it can't be. It can't be just brushed under the rug and it doesn't have to be glorified. But I think we just got to bring awareness to the whole damn thing. You know, who are we? I agree, David. I think that's a that's a really sad thing when you don't want to just recognize that little Charlie Manson living in your heart. Let alone, you know, yeah, they're all hanging out in there, having a horrible, horrible time. David, let's so let's remind folks, everyone, I'm very excited about this day. You know, if you listen to this podcast at all, you know, I'm obsessed with AI and I love Buddhism and the idea of having a chance to sort of. Philosophically have a philosophical conversation with David about where the Dharma and AI meet or what the future might hold for us regarding. Buddhism in the era of AI or spirituality in the era of AI. I think these are just interesting, important things that we should be exploring as we. As we push the accelerator towards the singularity. So I'm excited about this. Will you tell everybody when it is again, David? OK, so that's going to be on May 9th coming up and it's going to be a 90 minute workshop and it's going to be combined with so you can. We'll put the link in the in your in your text scroll attached to this podcast so people know how to do it. But all you otherwise you can just go to Dharma moon dot com. Great. And it's also going to have a short info session as part of it for our upcoming 100 hour mindfulness meditation teacher training program, which starts June 23rd. And so we'll also be just talking a little bit about that and how people can check that out if they if they want to. So those those two events are connected. Is there a fee for it? I can't remember. No. So that's good. Thank you. That's very good to mention. It's free. You know, so I just removed your final, you know, obstacle to attending. And you can also register for it. And then if you're not available during the real time that it's happening, you'll get the recordings automatically in your email. Beautiful. Great. That's the hunt. That's for that session. And then that pre pre shadows the the entrance into the 100 hour mindfulness meditation teacher training, which you can also learn about at the website. We'll put a link for that in the in the text. And, you know, I gotta say, Duncan, we have one going on right now, which has at least 20 or 25 people who love you dearly, who are, you know, kind of wonderful have come into this situation through following you and podcasts and our conversation. So it's really gotten to be a kind of family kind of energetic to it. And I say it every time, but I like to acknowledge those kind of things every time. It's a good thing. There's there's a lot of people who are following you who are watching how you explore things and kind of getting a sense of humor from it, a sense of intelligence from it. And and, you know, then they start to explore their world in the same way that you've been exploring yours. And it's a good thing. I'm glad to hear it. I'm glad that's good. Anybody who like gets connected with you and Dharma Moon, that makes me happy because it certainly has had a positive effect on my life. And I can't wait for our talk. I'm so excited about it. I'll I'll try to maybe I'll see if I can like whip up some AI stuff that we could show or something like that. So people can kind of see where it's at. David, until next time. Thank you so much.

It is I, Dee Trussell, and you have tuned in to the ontological blaster known as the DTFH. Do I really know what ontological means? Not really. Let's look it up. Yes, just what I thought, relating to the branch of physics dealing with the nature of being. Yep, ontological blaster. That is what you have tuned into. And we're pouring in to your delicious waxy ear caverns on this very special week. Not only is this the birthday of the founder of the Church of Satan, Anton Leves, it is also the first time in human history that we laid eyes on a black hole. They took a picture while they combined a bunch of pictures. Well, they used radio imagery. Well, they captured slivers of light and used algorithms to weave together an image of a black fucking hole. A singularity. Do you remember the black hole movie? If you don't, it's probably because you are younger than me. But I remember the black hole movie. I remember how it impacted me in the most serious way, not just because there was a weird robot with that blender thing that shot out of his chest and ripped that guy's heart blended people up, but also because it was a fucking black hole. It was a movie about a black hole. And for a young deed trussell, there were a couple of things that were agony for my brain. Number one, the realization that I would never lay eyes on a living dinosaur. I don't think at the time we knew that birds were sort of evolved dinosaurs, and certainly we didn't know that some of our politicians could transform into reptilians. We just knew there was a thing called the brontosaurus in a meteor hit, and you're never going to see the fucking brontosaurus, except in those books with pictures of velociraptors perched on their back, ripping the brontosaurus flesh off as though it were fucking jerky. Do you remember those, the hyperviolent dinosaur pictures when you were a kid? I don't even know if they still do the hyperviolent dinosaur pictures, or maybe I just ended up with a fucked up book of dinosaurs. But the book I had, it was definitely not tiptoeing around the fact that life for a dinosaur, if you were a brontosaurus, basically meant at some point a bunch of velociraptors were going to jump on your back and slowly rip big steak chunks out of your back while you balefully looked at them in this sad way, not even fighting back up to your fucking knees in primordial swamp water. And then it would slowly dawn on you that you're never going to see that. You're never going to get to witness that. You're never going to see a pterodactyl. You're never going to get to see the mighty tyrannosaurus rex. And then you find out about a black hole, this infinitely deep, hyper-compressed, magical, potentially a magical gateway to another realm that was somewhere in space, but you were only going to look at pictures of it. And so Disney releases the black hole movie. I still remember the soundtrack to the black hole movie. It goes, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do. I'll see if I can find it. I used to have this album, but just sitting and staring at it and wish I was in a black hole. But he not had a beat to this. I am a hole of black. I'm smoking stars like cracker. You will never reach me. You will never bleach me. And if you do, your ass and your shoes will be black years apart while I spaghettify you, bitch. Fuck your science facts and fuck your science fiction. I shit on your physics, wipe my ass with your religion. Albert Einstein said, God, don't play dice, but I watched God and Jesus run a train on Einstein's quiet life. That's why she came. Neil LaGrosse Tyson coming for you, gonna suck your dick while I turn you into star goo. Game of thrones, give me a fucking reason that you put an entire year between your seventh and eighth season. Who would have thought that black holes would be Game of Thrones fans? Well, we've got a very special podcast for you today with one of my favorite creative minds on the planet. He is the co-creator of a series called Rick and Morty. Not only that, but he makes amazing video games. And he's got one that you can play on VR called Accounting, which is one of the funniest, craziest games I've ever played. And real soon, he's got a game coming out called Trover. In fact, pre-order it if you can. Give this man some love. He deserves it. How do you become the conduit of one of the funniest shows on TV right now and maintain a supremely cool, humble attitude? How does your ego not swell to the size of a billion fucking planets? How do you not implode and turn into a black hole and suck all of reality into your deep, compressed neuroticism? Somehow, Justin Roiland has pulled this off. We had a glorious conversation. We're going to jump right into this. But first, some quick business. And before I forget, if it's still online, check out House of Cosby's, another wonderful creation of Justin Roiland. I think you might have made it with Harmon. Thank god these two super geniuses are making stuff together. All right, that's it. We're going to jump right into this great episode. But first, some quick business.

And I'm sure that over the next thousand years, this immortal infinite being disguising himself as a mere human will bring us many, many, many more laughs which this particular sector of the multiverse so desperately needs. Now, everybody, welcome to the DTFH, the great Justin Roiland. I hate headphones, I don't like them. Well, they get your earwax smashed down. It's also just, I don't like hearing my own voice. Oh yeah, that's just nice. Even when I record the show, like Rick and Morty or Solar or any video game stuff, I'm just like, no headphones, I never wear them. Whoa! Yeah, unless they're like, no, you have to have to. What is it you don't like about your voice? I don't know, I hate myself. Oh really? Yeah, I'm one of those. Which part of yourself do you hate? I don't know, I think I've just always sort of had this from a very young age, this kind of sort of just dissatisfaction with me. You know, when I was real little, it was like I had freckles all over my face and I was like, oh fuck man, no one's ever gonna love this ugly, like you know, that kind of shit, you know? You told yourself that, does that sound like something somebody said to you? No, no, I fucking, nobody else said it. I was very much, I mean, I would just sort of gauge the, and I'm talking like kindergarten, first year, I mean, real little, I was like very down on myself, but I wasn't like I was some morose, miserable, you know, head down kid, I had tons of fun, but I definitely had a deep sort of like understanding, and like, okay, girls don't like me, I'm definitely not the popular kid, and I'm not, I don't trust myself enough to be outgoing and fun and wild, you know? Yeah, sure. And like to sort of win people over, and it just got worse and worse, but yeah, I also do this thing where I would like, you know, not to say my parents didn't give me enough attention, but maybe they didn't, because I used to, my mom would be watching TV, and I would just harass the fuck out of her until she would start punching me in the arm. What? It wasn't like, you know, abuse, I loved it, I wanted her to punch me in the arm really hard, and I've had girlfriends in the past, where I'm like, we just punch me in the arm really hard. Isn't that weird, how that fucking weird? It's not a sexual thing, it's sort of just more like this weird, like, I don't know, it's, yeah. But looking back, I was like, oh, that was me just trying to eke out any kind of like, you know, affection and love for my mom. From your mom. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And again, like, best parents, like fucking amazing parents. I just think my relationship with my dad kind of, it's not, there's distance there, it's sort of, it's not like this open loving, I love the guy, he loves me, but it's like, you know, it's not like this insane, you know, you know, like crying together, and like, yeah, yeah, there's, I've never cried, we've never had real intimacy, I guess is the thing. So, and so I've talked about that shit in therapy, and I'm like, I think it's definitely a contributing factor, but yeah, I don't know, it's just a bunch of shit, just like where you're just like, I don't fucking like myself. I'm better about it now, but yeah. Well, this is, there's this, Chogan, Trump, and Rinpoche said something super smart that I think about, which is, before you can reject yourself, you have to know who you are. And a lot of times, like people who, this is like, this, these days, man, lots of people hate themselves. Oh, sure. It's a bit, it's like. It's a sick time we live in. Yeah, people are really hard on themselves, and I used to hate myself. I used to, I used to not only hate myself, like I fashionably hated myself, like I thought it was embarrassing if people liked themselves. Oh, okay. And to this day. I'm kind of that way. Yeah, man. And you run into, well, there is something, cause like, sometimes you might run into someone who's, who's like. Just so kind, like, loves themselves, and they're, oh, and you're just like, dude. You're so schmaltzy, you're like, get the fuck out of here. Okay, you love yourself, whatever. What are you gonna fucking puff yourself up and go down the Macy's Day parade? You're so confused, so funny. But you know what? Well, keep going. Yeah, well, I wanna hear your point, yeah. Let me just make sure this recording, by the way, cause this is a good cover. I'm glad we're talking about this, because this is like something that's, I actually, someone asked me this the other day. What do you do about hating yourself? And then I'm studying meditation with this guy, David Nickturn. I got on the phone with him. I was talking FaceTiming with him. Yeah. And he was explaining to me about this conceptualization of the self in Buddhism called Abhidharma. And it's basically, there's like five Abhidharmas, which are your senses. And then the sixth Abhidharma is your thoughts. Then the seventh Abhidharma is your subconscious, you could say, or like the, not just that though, but like the, in Buddhism, there's reincarnation. So it's like the reservoir of all your past lives and shit. Interesting. And then the eighth one is like the Akashic records, the archetypes, the sum total of all human experience. And that is what anyone is. So these days, people think they're the sixth Abhidharma. That's how they, they don't, you look at your body, you don't really think that's who I am, but this never ending sort of expulsion of thought patterns that form some kind of cycle that you say, oh, that's me. I'm the think, I'm the thoughts, I'm the thoughts. I must be that. And that's usually when people say they hate themselves. They don't really hate themselves. They hate that incessant. It's like living next to someone with a shitty dog. Yeah, no, I mean, it's, it's, it's sort of that, that gets into sort of the, you know, observing your thoughts, stepping outside of your thoughts, like trying to separate your being from, from the rattling noise in your brain and sort of like step, stepping away and, and just sort of like, like what, what, what the fuck is this shit? Like what is all this stuff? Yeah, I mean, that's very much like, you know, like, I don't know, power of now or presence and just sort of like disassociating from the egoic mind, all that crazy shit, but it works. I mean, if you, I've had a lot of times where I'm freaking out, I'm anxiety or whatever. And then, and then I'm like, okay, like what, I just kind of try to elevate, pop to the part of my brain that's sort of above all of that madness and, and just look at it and observe it and let it continue. But just from a perspective of watching and your brain kind of starts to go, what the fuck are you doing? What are you doing? Stop watching me. Yeah, you know what I mean? If you can, if you can click into that spot, it's hard to do, but if you can click into that spot, it's kind of interesting to see how your brain, you know, reacts real quick, just to clarify, those confident people we were talking about a second ago that walk around and you're just like, oh my God, I think for me it's like, you know, it's a bit of like, I don't want to say jelly, maybe envy, but more so, it's closer to what you were saying where it's like, it's like, oh God, like you're not that fucking cool. You're not even cool, you're not that adorable. You know what I mean? These people are like, they're just like, no one ever told them like, hey, yeah, it's not like, shut the fuck up. You know what I mean? They had some blessed, like, or they're just impervious, they're just like so, there's a thing in their brain that's given them so much confidence that, like you ever see people on like American Idol and they're trying out and they're clearly incredibly talentless, not that I watch that show anymore. I mean, I'm talking, I haven't seen it since fucking forever, but I used to, like William Hong, you know, that's when I was watching it back that long ago, but I always found it fascinating, these people that would argue with them, like, no, I'm fucking good, like fuck you. And I'm like, I kind of want a little of that. Like I would love that, because I don't have that. I have the thing where if someone said that fucking sucks, I just fall into a pit of shame and I'll, and it's like, it's too easy to just break me, you know? Or at least I guess it used to be, but yeah, man. I've gotten pretty numb to it though, like as of now, I feel like, I'm just like, yeah, I just want to, I've gotten numb to it in the art, like making art, creating content. You have to be, right? Because your head's in the fucking blast furnace, man. It's like, you are, your show is like hyper-analyzed in the most insane way, and not just hyper-analyzed by like dopes who are like whatever, supers, like. Smart people, man. Super smart people breaking you down, like, you know. I can't even read it, I'm just. Yes, by the way, I'm saying this more as a. And it's Dan too, obviously, Harmon, you know, like, but yeah. I'm imagining, it's not like I'm like. I'm the dummy of the group. It's not like I just, you know. I'm the Garfunkel. Ah, please. No, no, Garfunkel is great, but I'm just saying. You're not a dummy, and you're not the Garfunkel, even, I don't know, but I have, I'm not, I just want to like say, it's not like I say, mostly anytime I've read anything about the stuff you're making, it's like worshipful. And I do, and I don't want to get too far off course, but I do want to bring up a time that I went, I went with Dan, and you were there. I don't know what it was. I think it was ATX in Texas, or in Austin, wasn't it? No, this was at a comic book store. Signing, yeah, I remember that. It was like the kid robot release of like this cool sculpture thing, yeah. Dude. That was wild. I had never seen that before. Yeah. And I have only experienced that level of intensity, an intense kind of silence, an intense murmuring silence in religious places. That was so, I was so drunk. I had to drink, I was like, I need to drink. I get so nervous. I was pasted, man, I was high. Yeah, yeah. But it was, but that, it was, it's, yeah. It was like a religion. It was like being, you guys were like priests. These people were gathering around you, and they were silently waiting for you to say anything. Yeah. And they were cherishing these icons in a really intense way. It's weird and it's hard for me to appreciate it. You know what I mean? Because I'm almost like, I'll never not be this way, where I'm just, I'm like, I'm just a fucking, yeah. You know what I mean? Like, it's crazy to see, but I try to just bring it down to like, hey, look, like if I meet somebody, or like if I'm at a convention or whatever, I do my fucking best to try to just bring it back down. Like, look, we're both, I don't know when every situation is different, but it's like, I'm, I'm just a, I'm just a person. Yeah, man. And I got really lucky. And like, yeah, like you are perceiving me on this pedestal, but honestly, I'm just like you. And you know, just, let's just, let's just be, let's just be people and, and, and hang out. But when you're doing these crazy signings like that, there's no time to sort of, you know, have those moments with everybody. It's kind of just this, this sort of water wheel of people coming and very surreal. And it's, it's, it definitely, like some people will, that's just fuel, like, like the, the adoration and the, the compliments and it just fills their cup, you know, but for me, it's, it doesn't do anything for me. It's, I, I, I don't, I don't take it for granted. And I don't, I don't look at it, look down upon it. I'm, I'm, I'm just kind of like, I'm almost outside of it. It feels like you sense the, the illusory nature of it. Like you get this feeling of like, whatever this particular dance or game is. Yeah. The intensity with which people are playing. I'm thinking, you know, in 10 years, you're going to be, you're, you know, you'll, you'll probably still have fond memories of the show and, and, and, and an, and an appreciation of me and Dan, but you'll be fanatical about some other thing, right? And it's like, so, or, you know, getting more morose. It's like, we're all going to die. So let's have a, I mean, that's a shitty way to look at it. But, but, well, I don't know. I, I, I, I'm trying not to think about life. I'm trying to be more in the moment and enjoy existing, but and not be so like, I'm going to die. Who gives a shit? Oh, nihilistic. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm trying to be less nihilistic, but, but, but, but no, like, yeah, I, I, it's, it's interesting. I really do appreciate the, I appreciate the connection that people have. I mean, honestly, like, you know, it's weird cause that was never really the plant. I, I, it was an unplanned, you know, like, if I could, I would take this conversation we're having and I would have you be the voice of one of those Mayan kids and this, as he's talking, is there taking him to the top of the pyramid and stab him with a fucking dagger? Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. He's just, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. Oh, it's so funny. Yeah, yeah, yeah, cause it's- It's sort of just, yeah. Cause you know, it's like, there's this, I think there's a thing built into us that like, when that level of intensity and adoration is- That's a great way to contextualize what- Yeah, I mean, cause it's, it's, it's scary because like they, they can turn on you. Sure. You know, what is that great, there's that great song by Loudon Wayne Wright, Saw Your Name In The Paper, and how does it go? It's like- I don't know that band, but like- Oh, dude, it's a, Rufus Wayne Wright's dad. He's an amazing folk singer, but the lyrics are- I don't know that band. The band. It's like, it's like, I love, I love Mazzy Star. She's cute. Great band. It's like, no, wait, anyway, sorry. It goes, the line goes like, take the money, take the love, take all the people give, the people they are dying, and somehow you help them live. It goes, Jesus, but the crushing lyric is like, the people will destroy you. That love will turn to hate, but right now you must scratch it, that itch that's grown so great. Saw your name in the paper. Saw your name- That's a great lyric. It's a great lyric, and it's a little dire if you ask me, but it's also, there is that- It's true kind of though. When I was at this thing and I was high as a kite, so my senses are off a little bit, the feeling was weird, man. It reminded me of when I've been at like occult rituals. I don't mean like it's literally that, but I mean like there was a certain type of thickness in the air that would make me, if I were in your shoes, a little unnerved by it. That's why I, you know, a couple of shots before, and just sip vodka or whatever during, but I mean, yeah, but it's also, like I don't want that to come off like, I need to do that to deal with these people or something, because there is a, I'm always just humbled and blown away, and our fan base is incredibly diverse, and I feel like, you know, you hear a lot of stuff, like Rick and Morty fans, you know, the meme of like, oh, they're all fucking douche-bat or whatever. Is that real? Well, I don't know if it is. I've seen whispers of it here and there, and like, you know, there's memes where it's like, oh, you have to be really smart to enjoy the show, you know, stuff like that, but like, I've met a ton of fans, and I've done a couple of like conventions, just meeting fans, and I've not come across a single shitty person, like every, and insane diversity, not in just gender, ethnicity, age, I mean, it's like all over the place. You've made the funniest show ever. It's so good. Dan and I did. Dan, of course. Yes, when I say you, I assume you have people, I know you guys made the show. We'll just say for the record, if we also meet Dan. And the sum total of the crew and everything, it's like, to me, it's like, they're really like, the beautiful thing about the internet, the hyper-connectivity that we experience is so incredible. And the writers and the bubble bubble, everybody. The sum total of all nature, the fucking cosmic thing that blew out, time and space to form the atoms, the spinning. The atoms that are in our, yeah. The quasar. The space dust that were made up. The space butterfly, all of it that came together to make this, it's wonderful. But to me, what inevitably ends up happening is this like, you know, some croaking toad has to blow out insults anytime anything gets to a certain, it's just a statistical probability. That's right. That once you get to a certain place, there's gonna be a croaking toad who's got some, he's gonna come roblin' out of his swamp. The fans, I guess y'all think you're so smart, don't you? It's like, this is an inevitability. It's a poisoner, essentially. Sure, sure, yeah, yeah, yeah. A shit-disturber. But like, every time I've watched Rick and Morty, I just laugh my ass off and I just, everyone, it's good, you made something great. Yeah, we definitely try to have fun. I mean, so, it's funny because, you know, art, making things, like just creating something, I feel zero inhibitions. I feel zero fear. I'm not worried what people are gonna think. I don't care if people are gonna hate it. It's very weird, because that's incomplete opposition to a lot of other shit in my head. When it comes to, so like for the video game, I have a video game coming out called Trover Saves the Universe. Didn't it just come out? I saw it on PlayStation. You can pre-order it right now. But it hits May 31st on PS4 and then June 4th on PC. And it's both VR and traditional. You could play it either way, blah, blah, blah. That's great. I wish they would do that more. More, me too, man. I mean, well, I can get into how that happened because it was a happy accident, but the point is like making that game, you know, I was just like, you know, obviously spend a lot of time breaking the story. Like that's important. You want a decent structural narrative to follow. But like, once we got into each level, we break the level, you know, narratively, and make sure that plugs into the larger structure of the story, of the full story. But then it was like, let's just have fucking, let's just go nuts. So like, I would just drink and like, we'd have our level master planner so we'd know all the lines we needed to get. I mean, thousands and thousands of dots. I mean, just crazy. And so what we learned, the best process was just like, okay, what do I got to do next? What's the next thing? Oh, this is the part where Trover, blah, blah, blah. I'm like, okay, got it. And then I just fucking riff and make up shit and I'm just drinking and having fun. What a joy. And it was so fun and it was so, and the end result ultimately, like if there were spots, if there were days that were bad days that, you know, it was like, I wasn't really in the best, I wasn't in the zone or I wasn't feeling the best, we would just chuck it out and do it again. And then there's days where it's like, just shit, I could never, ever come up with sitting at a computer typing, ever. Just shit that just came out of my mouth that's so fucking funny and ridiculous. And just the end result is this game. Where it just feels so different than other games because most games don't, the studios don't function that way. Like they tend to sort of- Fuck no. The scripts are very tight. And then you- And let somebody ramble on the mic. Never, never. You mentioned a master plan, level master planner. Is that an actual title? Yeah, yeah. What is that? It's just this fucking endless document that has every single line of the game. Every thing we would need for dialogue. Every- Oh my God. We have like over 20 hours of dialogue in this game. Like if you just sit and hang out with characters in VR or just on your TV, they'll have full fucking crazy conversations that are hilarious. Well, dude, I mean, this was a, you know, you released Accounting. Oh yeah, yeah, with William Pugh, the crows, crows, crows guys. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it's felt like it had a lot of that to it. Yeah. And that adds so- This is like times, I mean, Accounting's short. This game's like, this'll take about six to eight hours. Probably closer eight hours to just play the game. But if you want to hang out, you can- That's it. It's crazy. Yeah, you can be in there for a while. But the point I was trying to make is in the art, I'm very free and stuff. Yeah. But I found myself in the last like year and a half, maybe a little more completely silenced on social media, on like, I don't want to make a joke anymore. I don't want to say my opinion anymore. You're scared. I don't even want to look at the, I'll post a thing, but it's always, whenever I post on social, I'm kind of mostly on Instagram now. I kind of got the fuck away from Twitter. I still have it and I look at it occasionally. But like, Twitter scares me. Harmon was saying something interesting because we were talking about this. And he's like, I think, if you want to say something on there, create something. Like he does these little music videos, if you've seen them, they're really great. He did one for my birthday. It was fucking incredible. Yeah, yeah. That meant a lot to me that he did that. I was like, that was so fucking sweet of him. But like, he's like, if you create something, even if there's something in there that could potentially outrage people, it's art and it's potentially something that most people can't do. So they're not going to see it through the same lens as me typing a joke, tweeting it out, that some people might be outraged over or not understand the context of it being a joke. Hey, remember when jokes were, we all sort of had the social agreement that jokes were jokes, remember that? Remember when they were in the frame of, hey, this is a joke, doesn't mean I'm going to play this out in my life, doesn't mean that this is the content of my character, I just have a dark sense of humor and here's a joke. Nowadays, you can't do that at all. So it's like, I've been effectively like, all right, I'm just, I just feel, not that I need to fucking spout my little bullshit through a little digital bullhorn, but I definitely don't feel comfortable, like an ideal will come into my head or a thought and I'm just like, oh, I should, no, wait, no, never mind. I'm not going to say shit. Well, because the idea was like, there was a feeling that was more like a kind of like playground or something where we're just like playing games and we're like fucking around, man. Like it's just like we're making stuff. Oh, look, there's mud, let's run over here. Oh shit, Frank fell on his skin, his knee. Oh hell, let's go over here, climb that wall. What's that? It was fun, nothing meant anything, it was a game. There wasn't a sense of like, if I make this joke, it is an indication that I am connected to a dark cobble of evil humans and I'm basically like a swamp bubble coming out of like some infinite hive of doom people. I was just saying some shit that in the moment seemed funny. Also, I was kind of hammered when I said it and it seemed funny then, but none of it, I promise you, I'm not killing, there's no fucking like hostile, you know, situation under my house where I'm like getting to tourists and like flaying them. It was just a joke, but now these days have changed a little bit and what's really fucked up about it is that when you start like hearing about these Russian bot or troll farms. Oh yeah, dude, and then you don't know what's real and what's fake and that asshole that said the thing that bummed you out, is that just somebody being paid by a, it's crazy. Yeah, so there's the, that's where kind of where we've hit this like, I think, hopefully a point right now, a wobbly point in our interconnectivity through technology. We just have to deal with the fact that the immune system of the technology isn't strong enough to withstand outside influences. So basically like, it's like having a house, your Twitter account or whatever the account is, it's like having a house with a billion doors and you can't shut all the doors and you don't, and there's no, And some of them don't even have actual doors, they're just openings. You know what I mean? Just like big, beautiful arches. Yeah, man. Like the Flintstones house, remember that? They just had holes for windows. Pretty sure they did. It's a real mess, man, because if your fucking house has all those holes in it, you're gonna get the shit pummeled out of you. The mosquitoes are gonna be coming in. The robot, but it's literally like, what's so funny about it is that, you know, in the, like the model of the thing or the way we're modeling it right now, which is, it's not gonna be like this for a while. I mean, this is like when people used to have, my grandmother would tell me her phone number was like eight or whatever. It went on St. Simon's Island in Georgia. Like her phone number was something like eight, one, four, something or you'd pick up the phone and an operator would answer. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let me talk to Linda on four, nine flower lane. Hold on, and she'd plug a thing in. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That was what it used to be. And that's where we're at now with technology. It's just the differences. So we're wide open basically. And what that means is like, if you have a business, theoretically, whatever it may be, and you have a competitor, that competitor could literally manufacture fake things and swarm your ass and make you seem like a monster. It's scary. It's temporarily scary. And even just being a public figure, which I never, I always kind of said, I was like, I always like animations my jam because you can make stuff and no one really knows what you look like or, and then when the show started to take off, it's still kind of that. I mean, it's still pretty great because I don't get recognized a ton. It happens more than I ever thought it would, but it's also because I went, I did Ethan, you know, H3, H3, they're like YouTube, they're friends of mine, but they have a YouTube, big YouTube channel. He asked me, he's like, hey, we're starting a podcast, will you be our first guest? And I'm like, absolutely, yeah, I'd love to do that. And then, and then like, a week later, he's like, yeah, so we got the couch and like, oh man, the set looks really great. And I'm like, what do you mean? Like what set? Like, what are you talking about? He's like, oh yeah, no, no, like it's gonna be great. I'm like, wait, is this a, is there cameras there? Oh, fuck, yeah, anyway. So I was like, oh man, but I already... The old video podcast trap. Let me tell you, man, that's the worst when you go stumbling in, there's a fucking green screen, 18 cameras, lights everywhere. You're looking like you just crawled out of bed. You're like, wait, what? I thought you said podcast. No, that sucks, but I mean, not that their show sucks, but not being prepared for it as a fucking tour. Well, I at least was, I had enough, I mean, I found out, you know, a few weeks before, like I found out, but when I first said, yeah, I was like, but I was just like, oh man, I've been able to kind of, you know, have this amazing best of both worlds where it's like, I've got the creative, I've got a show, it's exciting, and it's like, but I also have this certain level of anonymity, like all these amazing voice actors, like Maurice LaMarche, and I mean, even to a certain extent, like Phil Hendry, and like, I mean, all these guys, they get recognized, but like, by and large, they can kind of just walk through the raindrops, they can go shopping at Ralph's, they can, you know, and they don't have to even think about it, they can just be normal, you know? I can't imagine being like a really famous celebrity, like an actor, you know, and how that would affect your, for me, it would be like cripple, it would just fuck me all up, but I would just become more and more like reclusive. Paranoid, reclusive, gates within gates within gates? I think so, I think so, I don't know. Lonely? I think so, I think about it, I'm like, if, you know, and it'll never happen for me, but it's, which is good, you know, but it's like, yeah, it's like, and I should clarify, anyone who has ever recognized me and come up to me, knock on fucking wood, has been just the sweetest, nicest people, I've never had an asshole ever approach me and be a dick. I hear, what do you know what I hear from you, man? I hear like, you want to put out there, I hope I don't sound like I'm complaining, I'm very grateful for my success, and I love the fact that people love what I'm making. It's just interesting for me, because I'm still, I hope I'm never anything other than outside of it, looking into it, and kind of going, that's weird, this is all weird. You don't want to lose that stance, man, because when you lose that stance, what's, there's nothing unique anymore. No fucking way, yeah. You were that, you were the kid with the freckles, you were the insecure person, and now you're getting this rare access to a kind of experience that I'm sure many people on the planet are curious to say the least about, like, what would that be like? And so I think there's something really beautiful about the way you're sort of reporting in from the outside, so to speak. Because it's like, we want to hear it, and because it's something you like, you think about peaks, you know, in Western society, peaks, and whether you like it or not, you guys are on a peak, and when we are all like, what's it like up there? And to hear, it's a little scary, and actually I still hate myself, he still hates himself, what did he say? He hates Hillary Clinton? What's his fucking problem? Burn his house down, burn his house down. Yeah, but that, so to me, it's like the, also as I'm listening to you talk, it makes me think of this thing I read, which is that to put someone on a pedestal is an aggression. So if you want to like, no matter what, if you find yourself in the presence of a person, even if you have deep respect for them, but you're elevating them to a place above where you're at, or where your mom is at, or your dad is at, or your family's at, not only are you being aggressive to yourself, you're being aggressive to them, because essentially it's like an non-consensual game of make-believe, which is, you know, because you're the person who keeps getting pedestalized, so to speak, that though you're brilliant, and your mind is like outflowing beautiful things into the world, you have this sense of like, guys, I don't know why it's happening, or what's happening, but I'm literally just like you. I got lucky, something happened, no difference. I got lucky, something happened, something flows out of me sometimes, and I love it, but I'm just like you. But they're like, no, you're not. I want to touch your feet. Let me worship you, please, and that is an aggression. It's non-consensual, and it's like. It's really interesting to hear the idea of putting someone on a pedestal is a non-consensual, what did you say exactly? It's an aggression, it's a non-consensual game of make-believe. Make-believe, a non-consensual game of make-believe, that's fucking really interesting. And you literally find yourself in the shit position of having to be like, now you have to be like, number one, I'm not doing false modesty. I'm not doing false humility. I'm literally telling you, whatever the thing is, you like what I made, this isn't me. That's not me, it's a collaborative effort. You know what I really do love about all of the success, though, is I've gotten to meet so many fucking interesting, amazing people that I would have never met, ever, ever. And not just famous people and stuff, but just people, just random people that I would have never met in a million years that are just fucking amazing, or have, I don't know, they're struggling through something and not to sound like I'm some fucking Mother Teresa, but it's nice to try to help them. I sent a friend, literally, four really long, things from your podcast, and then a couple of appearances that you were on Joe Rogan's podcast, talking about depression, talking about just really powerful shit that I sent to someone who I met recently, that I was like, I really think this is gonna help you. Like, significantly, you really, really need to listen to this, cause like, this person is very much depressed and very much in that place of, like, I can't even, you know, can't even muster the energy to go, like, even just walk around the block level, and I'm like, just listen to this stuff, cause it's really powerful. Glue trap, I call that the glue trap, where it can be the mice get on the glue trap. No, I think you literally say it, and one of the things I sent, that you make that analogy. And yeah, it's, that kind of stuff is really, really awesome to be able to sort of meet people, get to know them, talk to them, like, and people are very, I'm a Pisces, not that I'm some astrology lunatic, but I'm very kind of open and, I like to listen, and I'm very empathic, and like, when I meet somebody, if we're hanging out or whatever, like, I wanna know, and people tend to open up to me, and then, I don't know, it's interesting, and then I'm like, I wanna try to like help, I wanna like fix people. Yeah man, I don't know, like, yeah, yeah. You have a lot of compassion. I think it's a thing that I've been missing in my life for a while, that part of things, and I'm just kind of recently getting back into that, of the meeting new people, and like, I don't know, that kind of stuff will help fill my empty cup, yeah, yeah. Because that's the intent, man. This is what, I'm just learning about this right now. It's like, my, this guy said meditation with us, he, he like kind, he didn't, he doesn't know, they're all so sweet, like saying that they come down on you, and he's not the way to put it, but like, we were talking, and I was like, I don't have intention. Well, you know, I just do stuff, and there's not really any intention behind it, I just kind of, you know, do it, you know, without intention. I don't know why I was afraid of intention. But I remember he's, he didn't, I don't remember exactly what he said, but he really like, in the way only someone who like, is like, teaching you, he really like, got me, with his response, was just, I think something on the lines, if that is such horseshit, it's like, you're just saying that, you don't mean, of course you have intention, and it's like, when you meditate, one of the ideas is you, before you meditate, you create an intent, and the intent is, I hope this in some way helps everybody, and then when you're done meditating, you dedicate the merit of the practice, and they have various versions of this prayer, which is like, something along the lines of like, may all sentient beings be happy, may they have food in their stomach, may they no longer suffer, and so this is called, I just learned this word, so I'm glad you're bringing this up, Bodhichitta is what it's called, and it's, as I understand it, it's the beginning of like, a rising sun in your heart, and it's the sun that wants to help. It's like the thing inside of you that's like, wants to help people, and it is the only thing that matters. Everything else is literally irrelevant, which is why it's such a fucking pain in the ass to be selfish, man, it's like, how? I mean, I'm super selfish in other ways, so, you know what I mean? Like, there's like, yeah, there's no doubt about that. No dude, listen, this is the, as someone who suffers from depression, fairly regularly, and I have to be very careful about it, I have warning signs, I know like, the bed's not made, there's shit on the floor, I'm not exercising, it's like, uh-oh, watch out man, cause you're gonna get, you gotta go outside, you gotta go pee around people, you're gonna, anyway, I know that one of the, and I don't wanna say like, for those of you out there who are depressed, I am not trying to produce a, it's your fault thing, but from my own anecdotal evidence, I will say, that something that seems to be present in my depression is an abnormal fixation on myself in the negative. So it's like, and so, which is literally selfishness, but it's not even like the good kind of selfishness where you're like, give me that, that's my motherfucker, ooh, I need to chill, it's literally selfishness, it's where I'm like, you fucking piece of shit, you fuck. It's almost kind of, I guess a form of narcissism too, right? Reverse narcissism? Yeah, like, yeah, is there a term for that? Like, yeah, that's crazy. Not loving yourself, but being obsessed and absorbed in hating elements of your identity, being hyper-compressed, basically to me what it is, this is like, one of the concepts with compassion is like, compassion can't happen without space. So you need space to put, so like, in other words, like right now we're in this big fucking space chatting with each other, it's awesome, but you and I were in like a little metal box right now, shoved together with these microphones and we're starting to get hot, we'd start getting a little annoyed with each other, like, if I moved my, you know, especially if we were in this box for like, I don't know, 100 years. Six, okay, 100. Can you imagine every little movement would start fucking sucking, it would be agonizing, you would hate every hair of my beard, you would hate every exhalation of my stinky breath, it would all be a nightmare thing, but if we then expand the size of that box to the size of the entire planet, then it's great, man, we can be really good friends. So similarly, we're jammed into a box, but the box is ourselves. Our bodies are meat husks, that's crazy. So we're super hyper compressed into our identity, right? And so, so this is- These meat husks of ours, huh? Meat boxes. Man, what do you think of that meat husk over there, huh? Pretty, yeah, look at that meat husk. Look at that meat husk. What a beautiful meat husk, my dear. I wanna, yeah, yeah. Oh my God. I wanna suck all your meat husks. Take that meat husk home, but I'll leave the soul here if you don't mind. I wanna wear your meat husk on your back. Oh my God, imagine if that was a kink, like you're just into meat husks. Well, it is a kink, I mean, people love wearing other people's kink. Yeah, yeah, yeah, there's a bunch of serial killers and monsters out there, but, or I guess they're, I feel like there used to be more serial killers back in the 70s, 80s, 60s. There was like a- They're more prolific. There was a creativity boom when it came to like- And so you was like, ooh, this speaks to me. I need a hook if you're gonna kill a bunch of people. Yeah, I was like, I'm gonna be the zodiac one. Yeah. And now I'm gonna be the one that just fucking gets away with it and breaks it, like Ted Bundy just sneaks out- The fucking dogs talks to you. Yeah, and then Bundy really- Bundy just like fucking, he, that guy, boy, oh boy, he's like trying to catch a fish with your hands. He just kept running away, flipping out the window. He had a demon in him. He was possessed by a demon. He's full of shit. Are you talking about, cause like at the end, he was like, the stuff about him being all religious and stuff. No, he like had a, I think it's called a like a rush kasha or something. Oh, he literally- Oh man. He had a demon got in him, cause he would talk about it. He's like, I had to get super hammered. Do you believe in that kind of stuff? Fuck yeah. You do, see, I, well, you know what? I don't, I don't not believe in anything. I'm not like some, I know that's not true kind of person. I'm very much like, I don't know anything. I don't know what anything is. Well, obviously there's like, you know, proven scientific and medical and like, you know, historic, well, mostly historical information that can be proven, you know? But then there's stuff that's like, we just don't know, man. We don't fucking know anything. That's right. And then there's, there's human issues that we just don't know. Like, did that happen? Did that person do that thing? We don't know. There's evidence. And then the more evidence or the more it's like, okay, no, they did that thing. Or no, they definitely didn't. You know what I mean? Yeah, sure. But like, so I tend to stay in the kind of agnostic kind of center. Oh, that's a good place to hang out, yeah. Well, but I'm incredibly open to all kinds of stuff. I just don't want to believe that shit because yeah, like, I don't know. Maintain agnosticism. Are you'll embarrass yourself? I hang out there. You know, I like, in other words, when I say, fuck yeah, believe in demons, I don't mean like, I permanently believe in demons. Or I don't even mean like, in 10 minutes, I think there's gonna. Yeah. It's a thought experiment. Sometimes when I'm looking at a person like Ted Bundy, for example, and I think, well, he's a sociopathic narcissist or whatever the fuck. Okay, that's okay. But really when I'm looking at him and I'm like, that dude basically alien style, like burrowed through a slat. Wormed his way out a window and then ran into the fucking mountains and said it was the best time in his life. And then managed to skip across the country and kill a bunch more people. That's a demon. Yeah, yeah. That's to me it works. Did you say that? That's a demon. Yeah, it's a demon riding him around. No, you're right, you're right. That's not normal. But you know, nowadays it's like, what do you, there's just no, nobody's playing the game anymore. There's too many cameras maybe. DNA evidence too good. Forensic stuff too powerful. Like how, I'm trying to figure out why are there not as many, I'm not asking for them. That's terrible, but. They're out there. I was thinking about it and I'm like, man, there used to be like real creepy fucking weirdos that just would go on these horrible murder spree. Back in the good old days. When I was your age, we had colorful serial killers. Now you just get stranglers. Who gives a fuck about some boring old strangler. Now there's just mass shootings. Yeah, yeah. They all happen at once. Yeah, yeah. Not these fun long drawn out mysteries. Who's doing this? And everyone's afraid and locking their windows and girls with brown hair are like, stay indoors girls. There's a murderer on the loose on the east, on the west coast. Yeah man, I wore butterfly wings. Dude, I wore butterfly wings and a cape. The good old days. I fucking figured out a way to come sign eyes brother. Now what are you doing? You're a strangler. It's boring. Yeah. Yeah, I think that like, we have entered into a very, unfortunately, an age of anesthetized horror it seems like. It's like not only is the mechanism to show us this shit being like anesthetized, like the saddest thing is like those kids who got the Parkland kids. They're apparently trying to make it so that they have to upload the videos of the shootings. The next one that happens. They're signing things that says show my body. Look at this. Look and look. Face this. Face this. Yeah, I think we need that. I mean, it's, I personally, yeah, fuck man. I mean, I can't watch that shit, but I already get it. Like I'm already like, look that kind of, like I'm already there. I'm not the person that needs to see it. You know what I mean? There are people I think that do need to see that shit and for it to really sink in. Like this is happening all over the place. It's just a fucking crazy phenomenon. Like, I don't know. I don't know how the fuck or why or I don't know what is causing it. It's just mental health issues that we're not handling in the country. I have no idea, but I do know that the idea that those kids have, which is brilliant, can be applied subjectively because it's like, this is the shit I'm learning right now. I think everyone should just have to take psilocybin or acid, everyone. I think it like, as soon as you turn, whatever age you wanna put on it, 21, you have to just sit down with a shaman and just fucking take a fuck ton of it and just go through a spiritual journey, come out the other side and you will have more empathy for humanity. You'll have more- Connection and nature. You'll have a deeper understanding of what you are and that this whole thing is a big fuck, like you're gonna die. And all this like, grindy, materialistic motivations, I think kind of melt away a little bit. I mean, sure, you're still gonna have the people like me that buy toys and whatever, but the sort of like, I need to make a trillion fucking dollars that you can never spend it ever. I mean, not, I don't know, or the political, I'm gonna be a politician that has a very like, you know, anti-people, for lack of a better- Anti-people. Anti-people perspective. Earlier you were saying like, I don't wanna talk about, the whole death thing and the nihilism thing. And there was a time in my life when I used to really like, feel like death was a bad thing. And I just don't feel that anymore. Yeah. And I don't mean that like, edge lordy, I don't feel that anymore. I mean like, I think that it's a very beautiful, and a beautiful, beautiful thing that happens to all of us. And that the, in the way that those kids are like, oh, I want you to show the picture of my dead body. I think like, there's something really beautiful if you have the courage to do it, to turn your eyes and face your own mortality. And not just your own mortality in the sense of like the long-term thing, which is like, who's gonna, everyone has this crazy ass fantasy, which is they're gonna deathbed fantasy. Like all these people have this deathbed fantasy. They have this crazy idea that they're gonna be laying in their deathbed, maybe some quilts, the family around, some dogs here and there. And they're gonna be like, I love you, dad, I love you, goodbye. It doesn't work like that. Your fucking mind breaks. You start stammering, you're spinning through the past into the future, you fall asleep most of the time. Maybe you wake up for a second to like say some inarticulate thing. There's a postman up in there. We gotta get George Clooney down to this Amazon, you fall asleep. That's what death looks like, right? And so what happens is people create this absolute fantasy about the way they're gonna fucking die, which is like, well, I have time because eventually I'm gonna just calm it down and be like, okay, now I'm gonna love life. But it's like, shut the fuck up. Here's what's gonna happen. You're gonna wake up a little confused one morning, you're gonna go to take a piss and then you're gonna come to you and you're gonna be in the hospital. There's gonna be someone looking at you talking, but you won't know what they're saying. Their mouth is gonna be like, blah, blah, blah, and you'll fall back asleep. Then you're gonna wake up again. There'll be maybe some tubes on you. You'll hear your heart go boom, they'll be like, I can't really fucking breathe. Is this a dream? God, that's how it happens. And also, when you sort of create this fantasy of the way that you're gonna die, or you do this trust fund bullshit with your years, oh, I've got 20, 10, whatever you think you have. Fuck that. You got nothing, man. And also, you have no past. That's the other important thing. Your past has been annihilated. Everything before this moment is absolutely gone and everything after this doesn't exist yet. So all there is is this place here. It's so fucking weird. Well, fourth dimensional beings would disagree, but a third dimensional beings, for sure, are just slices of right now, literally right now, right now, all the time. You mean the fourth dimensional beings who like see us as these kinds of meat snakes coiling through time? Yeah, the long, like from a little baby all the way to the fucking decrepit. But before the baby, the spartan, yeah, the spitting out. And even before, I guess, how far back does it go? It goes all the way back to the big bang, I guess. I guess, yeah, they're fucking fourth dimensional, badass fucking people or characters. Well, yeah, yeah, so do you spend much time thinking about that kind of stuff? It seems like you do. Yeah, yeah, definitely. And you study chaos magic and stuff like that. I don't know, maybe, I don't know. Sometimes wraps up around this idea of like one of the aspects of it is agnosticism. So it's like Robert Anton Wilson would talk about it, just like maintaining the spirit of like, I'm going to manifest a ritual right now to contact one of these fourth dimensional beings, but I'm not gonna do it like I believe it. I'm just gonna do it to see what happens. So in a less absolutely insane, yet still insane way of saying it would be, when you see the poems in the beginning of some of the ancient Greek writing that's the invocation to the muse, that's literally like a prayer to a fourth dimensional being that come through me so that I can manifest your form into this dimension. Let me be, or another way to put it would be, I want to be a landing strip for UFOs that are flying out of the fourth dimension in the form of inspiration and coming through me in populating this dimension with some creativity, civilization. I feel that way when I, I feel like I'm tapping into that when I get really high, just weed, like which I don't really ever do because I have to suffer about an hour and a half of fucking existential panic, like pure legitimate panic attack. Whoa. And then once that subsides, it's just insane, like just ideas, like I'm channeling something, it's insanity. All these ideas are just coming, and I haven't done it in a long time, but real quick, I want to get back to the idea of the thing you said about every moment before this is gone, right? So do you ever think that two things, one, because of that fact, that everything preceding the current moment could potentially be changed, right? On a mass scale. What I mean by that is, you know the Mandela fact, right? Yeah, sure. Not literally that, but the idea that like, that is sort of a sign or a, I think a lot of those are bullshit, it's just a bunch of us not weed. Oh, I didn't pay that close attention, you know, but some of it may be, but the idea being that like, let's say we're in a simulation, and the people running the simulation, you smell that? Skunk. Getting high, dude. Yeah, man. No, no, no, no, is that a skunk or is somebody smoking weed? That's, that means you live in California. Okay, great. So anyway, the, like imagine, you know, somebody decided to change, pause the simulation right now, and then delete me or delete, and not just like, I'm disappear, and you're all of a sudden the mic drops, and you're like, where'd you go? It's like, no, no, no, I'm erased from everyone's mind. Any deeds, any things I've done are erased. You're not sitting here with me, you're sitting here with someone else, cause I didn't come and you may be, and nobody knows I existed, right? Like that. And it's, because it's all behind us. It's all, sure. And so the idea of like, just like, if we were in a simulation, that's such a, okay, now, so take that concept, right? The ability, that sort of, you know, the potential for things to just have been retroactively changed to the point where there's an entire mass reboot, and everyone, their minds are wiped of the thing, that thing doesn't exist, and now we still have, you know, Hidden Treasure cereal on the shelf, whatever stupid fucking difference, which is a great cereal, by the way, look it up. But, you know, it's delicious, but probably horrible for you, though, is it 90's cereal. But anyways, now, the idea that the way you, the things you do, the choices you make, so going into the future, that that could potentially change, like slipping into different multiverses. Like if I were to, like right now, like I'm like exercising, I'm like just to claw myself out of this depression that I've been in, I'm like exercising, I'm eating healthy, I'm not so much dieting, as I am like, okay, no sugar, I cut sugar out completely, which is the first time in my life I've ever done that. Wow, how long? I'm two weeks and a couple days in. Good fucking Lord, good job, man. It's crazy, I've never done it before, ever, but I cut it all out, and then I'm eating, you know, it's crazy, like you start to like actually, like spinach with some, like saute spinach with some coconut oil, and a little bit of salt and pepper, and you're like, that shit would make me fucking wanna puke, and now I'm like, no, it's fucking good, it actually tastes good, right? Wow. And that's after two or two weeks and three days. Did you get sick? Did you have any like withdrawals or anything? Oh yeah, depression, I mean my, like worsened, like energy, I mean, sugar addiction is fucking, I don't think people realize how powerful withdrawal, but yeah, it was really hard, but I feel good now, I don't even really crave it, more crave carbs than anything, which is I also cut out the carbs, but I had dreams last night that I was just like, fuck it, and I was just eating, and I woke up and I'm like, thank God, that was a dream, I was just eating all this shit, but anyways, the point is like, if there's a version of me right now that's still depressed, still eating shit, still, I wouldn't be here, I'd be like, ah, Duncan, I can't, like, you know, I'm sorry, either make up an excuse, or whatever it is, but then there's this version that's what I'm manifesting, which is like, I'm, no, fuck that, I'm gonna do all this, and then what's interesting about that is it literally is fracturing the multiverse in different directions for the future, so the past can be rebooted if we're in a simulation, if we're in a simulation, which I think we might be, anytime, and then the future can be completely changed based off of your own choices day to day, and what you decide to do, and it could be anything from health stuff, or it could be like, fuck it, I'm gonna go do open mic standup right now, even though I suck, or I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I mean, the dark horrible shit is like these people that are going, I don't wanna encourage any bad shit, but like, there's these people that are doing these horrible things to people, you know, on a mass scale, and it's like, that's fragmenting and changing the future in negative ways, you know what I mean? Absolutely, well, it's like, it's kind of like, there's a lot of cool ways to think about it, it's fun to imagine it as a form of locomotion, you can imagine that your identity is a spaceship traveling through the multiverse, and by creating a consistent, doing anything consistently over time is similar to like finding some coordinates and staying on that path, and the more you do that. And shifting more and more into that version of the multiverse, and like settling into it, and then what potentially changes around you, are you actually, are you actually crossing over? You know, is the world gonna get better? If you make better choices and you better yourself, are you gonna actually click over into another version of reality, another multiverse that's better, where people start to get more sane and people start to love each other more, and like, I don't know, it's an interesting thing, man. Well, it's sort of like, there's this like, in Buddhism there's the wheel of life, and the wheel of life has the hell of the hungry ghost, hell, the animal realm, human realm, realm of the jealous gods, and realm of the gods. And so, this represents all the potential, like literal, like incarnations, but the other idea of it is it's actually, this is the cycle of person's life. So you can sort of, I know that I have experienced hell in this world. Me too, yeah, yeah. And in the hell that I've experienced, I've also experienced paradise on the very same stretch of the 101. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I've been in like a fucking Jacob's Ladder hell, where I look around and it is like demons in cars, and the signs are all weird and warped and shit, and like everything's bad, like real bad, right? Yes, yes, yes. I've been on the same stretch of fucking highway, and it's like, whoa, this is amazing. Yeah, it's beautiful. Beautiful, but not only that, it's like the thing you're talking about is really quite interesting in the sense that the journey you're talking about is sort of like the journey out of one particular dimension into another, and yet it's the same dimension, except it's completely different. And what starts happening when you start taking that journey is you start running into fellow travelers. Oh, yes. I mean, other people who are making a similar kind of pilgrimage, and then when you run into those people, you're kind of like the way we're talking about it, except we're gonna blast it out to everybody, and they're like, you're out of their minds! But what happens is the way it works is you're kind of running to be like, hey, have you seen Jacob's Ladder, by the way? When I was a kid, and I was just so... You gotta watch it again. I need to watch it again, I was too young. I think I was like, what in the fuck is going on? I need to watch it again. But it's like Jacob's Ladder, it's like his spine, but it represents the transition from the earth realm into paradise, the potential for going into orbit. Basically, like he's conferring with other people in this kind of strange bardo status that's called, and they're all like, did we die? What is happening here? Are we dead? And it's like, what ends up happening is you start running into people in a very similar kind of conversation that starts happening, just like, hey, are we... Is this real? Is this a simulation, right? It's not, is this... What's happening here? Are you experiencing this too? And then what's beautiful about it is you start running into people who actually, if you really want to hear some crazy ass shit, who come back into this particular universe to find people who are ready to make the trip. And they're like, hey, okay, check it out. They're like a strider in Lord of the Rings, you know, the weird paths and the byways and stuff. And then the next, and I don't mean like, literally, these beings kind of, usually if they do show up, they don't look like the way you'd expect them to, and they don't stick around that long. Because their attitude is really one of like, hey, listen, I can show you there's a path here, but you're gonna have to do the path. Cause that's the thing, a lot of people don't want to do it. And a lot of times people will do the, start transitioning universes, so to speak, and it'll start experiencing the illumination, and suddenly everything seems brighter, lighter, the people you're hanging out with are more loving, people are really like sweet, people start giving you stuff more, you start giving them stuff more, synchronicities increase, you start making better decisions, you look in the mirror, your body is changed. And then you do get into that weird place, which I always get worried about, cause I'm like, is this solipsism, where you're watching the news and suddenly it's like, well, it looks like we might've found life on Mars. And then you're like, wait, what the fuck? Life on Mars. And then suddenly, and then you start wondering like, wait, if I were to maintain this practice, would suddenly it just be like, where like civilization would literally split in half? I met someone who told me that, she was like, said with great confidence. She's like, well, right now we're on the part of a spaceship that's undocking from the other civilization. She's like the civilization that with, with like Trump and all the autocrats and all that shit. She's like, that, that, she said it was such confidence. It was so awesome. They just turned into this hardcore technological civilization. But the thing that we're on right now, we're about to completely split away from them. And she said like the bridge connecting the two dimensions is starting to go like shake and break. And like, which is why it's a good time to have a great practice. And to buy Bitcoin. No, I'm just kidding. Definitely buy fucking Bitcoin. Buy high cello. Buy high cello. Buy high cello. But yeah, the, so yeah, the idea is like we, the apocalypse. You said to have a practice, a good time to have a practice is what you were saying when I made my dumb joke about crypto. Fuck, that is not a dumb, I made crypto jokes all day long. I could turn this into, I could do nine. This is the crypto show now. Welcome to the crypto show. Welcome to the crypto. We've got a lot of stuff to talk about. Yeah. Welcome to the crypto. Tales of the crypto. Let me tell you, I'm your host. John Shackler. You're a crypto creeper. Crypto creeper. Oh my God. So what you know, you were saying it's a good time to have a practice. Well no, it's because like, you know, you hear all these renditions of this idea in the various world religions and their renditions are always about like some end of the world experience. Yeah. But clearly what they're talking about is like if you are alive and you know you have a limited lifespan, you're living at the end of the world. The world, yes. Exactly. We all are. I remember, I literally had a teacher, there was an eclipse when I was a little kid in grade school and we all had our special little things to look at the eclipse. And I remember a teacher literally saying to the class that we're all, this is the generation, our generation, she's talking to us, will be the ones to see the end of the world. And I remember thinking, kind of like going, whoa, that, okay, and we're little so it's like impressionable and I'm like, that's wild, dude, it was crazy. Never forget it. It was very, it's very vivid. Wow. And I don't, yeah, it was so weird. And then I remember later thinking literally what you're saying, I was like, well, I'm going to see the end of the world no matter what, because I'm going to fucking die. But I used to always say, God, I'd be, I mean, this is fucked up, like, but I used to think how neat would it be to sort of be alive for some like massive fucking asteroid just crashing into earth and we all go together. And for us to have like a two year warning window to just see what humanity would be like for those two years, because I have theories, I have so many ideas of what I think it would be different all over the world in different pockets, but I think by and large, all the bullshit would stop. I truly think humanity would begin to, I don't think it would become like a fucking crazy society breaks down madness. I think currency would stop. I think all of that, all these systems we have in place would stop, but it would become like fucking burning, man. It would be like, let me, everyone would be helping each other. We all are going to die in two years. There's no reason to fucking, like, love would, it would just be this fucking utopia. I mean, utopias usually come with all kinds of fucked up shit, like, you know, but I think it would be like an actual, like what most people think of utopia to be, which is beautiful. Yeah. And I, that's what I think would happen. Now, there'd be a lot of questions like, okay, well, if you're an airplane pilot, are you going to keep flying people around the country knowing that you got two years to go? Are you going to quit? I mean, the infrastructure is, you know, like, are we going to be going and pumping gas still, like to drive, or is there going to be a guy at the gas station, or is he going to be trying to get to his family to just enjoy the last of the two years with whoever the fuck, you know what I mean? So there is like crazy infrastructure stuff that I'm not sure what would happen. But I do think by and large, people would be helping each other. It would be peace on earth, I think. The idea of saving money would seem so stupid. Right. And just, it would just be like, look, I have, I have a, I'm a farmer. I have food. Like I think a lot of people would, I think a lot of people, believe it or not, I think a lot of people wouldn't be selfish in those last two years. Why have a billion dollars in the bank? What are you going to do? Yeah. It's Brewster's million. And also, by the way, that money would be worthless overnight. Yeah. Like what's a billion dollars? Fucking carrots. How about some carrots? Yeah. There you go. How about some fucking, how about some food? Yeah, that's it. You know what I mean? So it's going, it literally would be like, I've never been to Burning Man, but I'm pretty familiar with it. You must go. I know, everyone tells me I need to go. Go next year. No, but you know, I know I'm going to be seeing some really cool stories from too many different people. It's a beautiful, beautiful possibility. And what you're saying is, like, I've actually heard that like, God, I've heard crazy, awesome theories about how like, you know, September 11th was like a split in the multiverse and the other, like that fucked up the possibility of essentially everything just turning into a thing like Burning Man. But like anyway, the, the, um, what you're talking about. I think is, um, really does remind me a little bit of like some of the chaos magic stuff I've, I've read and one of the practices in it is like, you know, just imagine for fun that you are in the part of the universe, the multiverse, so to speak, that is transitioning into this sort of utopia minus the asteroid. Because one of the sayings is like, well, the world's either going to end in war or festivals, one or the other. So we're sort of entering a really beautiful age, which is the age of quantum computing. And if you look up that shit, I was like, what the fuck? It's crazy. What the fuck? I know. I was watching this quantum computing shit, man. And like, I thought I was on like, uh, like new age website, because the guy was talking about this like machine that, uh, was going into like alternate universes and pulling back solutions from them into this universe. And I'm like, whoa, this is like some cool new age shit. And then it's like, no, it isn't. It's the guy who's making the quantum computers that are being used by NASA. And this, it's like, what? Dude, it's crazy. And think about computers in the 70s, they're, or like, you know, giant, they would take up a full room or like the 60s, I guess it was, you know, and now they're in our pockets and they're infinitely more powerful, not infinitely, but, you know, and now quantum, quantum computers are going to do, they're existing in a superposition. You know about superpositions. You know about that shit. Is this, is this, is this have anything to do with like, like, uh, oh, tell me, tell me, cause I just, I don't want to superposition is like a new cryptocurrency. It's like way better than fucking Bitcoin. And I highly recommend that you invest. Let me know where to buy it. No, no, no, what, what is it? So, so, so, well, I'm sorry, everyone. Let's see, forgive me. I obviously am not a quantum physicist and, but it's, oh wait, is this like the quantum entangled particles where like one particle fucking over here instantly change, like has a reaction to another one, which by the way, makes me think that's make, that's all, all, sorry, cause I know you're going to tell me the real thing. Cut it, cut it, cut it, cut the guy off, he's not superpositioning any time you want, man. No, but the, but, but like all, all of the like quantum physics stuff is that's the stuff that I look at as the, the, the most glaring evidence for the potential of us being in a simulation, cause it's just like, what in the fuck is going on here with the quantum entangled particles? If that, I might be saying that wrong, but like they're, they're, you know about that, right? Where it's like, there's a particle, they could be fucking across the fucking universe. Yeah. And, and so obviously faster than light, if I change, if this particle could get changed, that one immediately responds in real time. Which is, wait, let me interject here. This, this brings me to a point I forgot to make earlier. Yeah. And it kind of goes against the fucking nihilistic bullshit that I do love to bellow out for no reason. For I do like to say, there's no future, no past, baby. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But, uh, one of the ideas is, okay, so if this like quantum entanglement exists, and if there is this potential for there being a multiverse, and if the super position is the idea that like, essentially like a particle is existing in all the states at once, somehow in some way we don't understand. So there is theoretically a future version of you. That is enlightened, awakened, and existing in some kind of techno utopia that overcame all the problems of, or maybe it's like in the future, they took you, you're one of the people who does have a very high likelihood that the very least being reproduced with some AI and, and like sort of put in some kind of like, yeah, let's do it. So probably already happened. Put me in the, oh, that's where it, oh my God, of course. But that being said, if this is the potential that time is like all happening at once, then theoretically you could connect to that version of yourself in the future now. But even weirder, that version of you in the future could be calling all the various suffering versions of you into itself because it has compassion for all the various forms of itself that are suffering. The version of you that right now it could be like, I don't know, under a fucking pier right now and some sick glory hole up to your fucking waist and like shit wearing like a clown outfit, fairy wings, just cheeseburgers scattered around all the way to like a version of you that like, I don't know, is like incredibly obsessed with his abs or some shit to the version of you that like never, ever got into like art at all. There could be some being, some super hyperversion of you that's like, come home, come home, calling in the way that it's calling is by sending ideas backwards through time. And every time you get an epiphany or that desire to help or that desire to make yourself better, you're actually getting a telegram from the future perfected version of yourself saying, hey, I'm up here, over here, this way, come over here. That's that, you know, again, agnosticism. No, no, no, I mean, listen, I love, but that's what's, that's what's great about agnosticism is that you can talk, you can think about all this shit and explore it and get your mind, have your mind blown by it, you know, like, whoa, what the fuck, it's great, it's great. It's better than being like, you know, rigidly locked into some sort of ideology that you're basically engaged by, you know, we're almost at the top of the pyramid here. And because we have elevated you to this situation of a man God, do you have anything you want to say to the people before we put a obsidian dagger in your chest and offer your heart to the sun god? And then, well, I will haunt everyone. I'll do my very best to try to haunt everyone in some way. So maybe, maybe scientists, you know, keep an eye out for hauntings. That'll be me. No, um, I don't know. I always say the same fucking thing, which is just like, I think if you can do something good for somebody every day or try to, or even if it's just once a week on any level, on any scale, even if it's just tweeting something nice to somebody, uh, if that's all you're, you know, you have access to, let's say you're a total agoraphobe or whatever, just, just if there's someone out there that you're, that you're a fan of, or that you're, or that, or that you think kindly of, even if it's, even if it's just someone you know in real life, I don't know, just do something nice for people if you can. I think if everyone did more of that, not only does it make you feel better, but it also sends good energy out into the world and the people that receive that kindness, they'll cycle it back in other direct, it'll go back into the cycle of kindness. I just think there's too much, right now we have so much fucking disconnection from, from humanity and from empathy and, and emotions. Cause we're all just looking at these screens and texts and it's like you read the text in the tone that you perceive it to be written and it could be completely different tone and it could be, you know, there's just all of that going on and I don't know if you can, if you're hearing this, like just go out and help an old lady across the street. Just, no, I don't know. I mean, no, like seriously, like if you see a loose dog, like, like stop your car and try to save it from getting hit or if, if ever there's an opportunity that presents, presents itself for you to do something to, to make a positive impact in, in the world, you know, try your best to do it and imagine it as a doorway and imagine it as a door into another dimension. Because like, if you look at those opportunities, not as like, well, there's a thing I could do. It seems really small. Instead of thinking about that, think of your, your entire universe is this cube that you're stuck in. If you don't like where you're at and every time you do something good, you literally walk through a door into a slightly different universe. And all you need to do is like a few dogs, a couple old ladies, a few nice tweets, and the next thing you know, a fucking UFO to be landing. Oh man, Norm MacDonald had, had this, has this hilarious story about feeding a homeless guy. It's, I'm not going to repeat it. It's a long joke. He's so funny. Dude, I fuck, I love that guy so much. His sense of humor, because it's like, he's the perfect example of someone who's like, you know, he's a good dude, but then he has like an edgy, like his sense of, he's, he, he, he, he'll tell jokes that by today's standards would be like, if you know, the classic thing that happens, comedian tells joke, joke gets taken, put into text form by some outraged journalist. People read it and, and it's just anger across the globe. It's a joke. It's a fucking joke. Like, can we stop? But, but like, he's the perfect example of someone that, that would happen to all his old shit. It's like so easy to, like the whole Janice, the, the, the woman that goes missing, you know, that whole bit. I don't know if you remember, it's great. But anyway, so he, he has a whole bit about feeding a homeless guy. And it's, it's funny because it's like at the, it's at the crossroads of like, oh, you know, he's going to help this guy out. He's going to do a good thing. And then it's, then it's just the comedy comes in, the sort of Seinfeldian like reality of like this homeless guy stinking the whole fucking restaurant up and he's like, I should have just helped the guy get crack. You know, like, I think it's the punchline. It's like, you know, he's like, his, his mom always told them, oh, the homeless, don't give the homeless people money. They're going to go buy crack. And then he, he's like, I'm going to take him, I'm going to get by him, buy him, buy him food, you know, and take him, take him to, to lunch or whatever. Anyway, I've heard a variation of that joke where it's like, don't give him money. They're just going to use it for drugs. And it's like, I can't remember who says this joke. I hate doing this. I'm so sorry you ever told this joke. It's not me. I did not write this joke, a very famous, great comic wrote this joke. Forgive me. I'm sorry if someone tells me what it is. I will credit you. But the gag is like, yeah, he's just going to go buy drugs. And then I realized, well, that's just what I'm going to do too. That's great. Yeah. Well, we have to, you know, it's a, I think that like, you know, maybe what happens when they, when that you get to the top of the pyramid and right as the knife is about to plunge into your chest, if you've lived a good life, the pyramid flies away or something, you know, which is weird. I don't mean to like, keep going, but that was the weird idea of this multiverse super positioning shit is that you literally can't die. Yeah. You're connected to, it's across all of the, right? That's what's super. Whenever this you dies, you pop into the other one and then the next you and the next you and the next you really fucking crazy. No way out. No escape. Infinite. Never. No break. Oh man. Man, thank you. Yeah. Thanks man. It's great to see you. It was great to hang out with you. I always love hanging out with you. It's the best. I don't think we hang out enough to be honest. We gotta hang out. I agree. And this, this is such a wonderful conversation. Yeah. Thank you so much. Uh, how did Krishna? Thank you. Yes. Uh, yeah. No, no. How do you respond to that? I gotta stop doing it. Thanks for listening, everybody. That was Justin Roiland. Definitely. If you haven't seen it, watch Rick and Morty and make sure you play. Trover saves the universe.

Hamilton Morris, a true luminary in the psychedelic universe who has created an amazing series called Hamilton's Pharmacopia. For those of you familiar with it, you probably are aware that he now has a third season which is available on Amazon and if you haven't had the good fortune to see it yet, you'll be thrilled to hear that it's as far as I'm considered the best season yet. He's so funny and so brilliant and so good at capturing different facets of psychedelic culture and also sort of shotgunning just random interesting facts throughout every single episode. And on top of that, the show has insane production quality. It's just a beautiful show. It's got amazing animation. It's got just they spend a lot of time on their setups and their lighting and all of it just combines to make it a beautiful gift to the planet and I'm not just saying that because he took an hour and a half out of what I'm sure is his very busy schedule because on top of being a TV personality, a producer and a writer, he is also a working chemist which is incredible to think about the fact that he's a TV star who probably also knows how to make LSD. Does that make him the coolest person on earth? Definitely makes him one of them and he's here with us today. We're going to jump right into this episode but first, some quick business. A tremendous thank you to Express VPN, the great liberators of the internet for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH.

And now an excerpt from The Way of the Bodhisattva by Shanti Deva. Drop into our hands. Tigers, lions, elephants and bears, snakes and every hostile foe. Those who guard the prisoners in hell, ghosts and ghouls and every evil wraith. By simple binding of this mind alone all these things are likewise bound. By simple taming of this mind alone all these things are likewise tamed. For all anxiety and fear and pain in boundless quantity their source and wellspring is the mind itself. That's Way of the Bodhisattva. It was translated by the Dalai Lama and read by Wolston Fletcher. It's available on Audible. You should definitely listen to it not just because the narrator sounds like a character out of demon souls but also because it presents a variety of compelling arguments for the possibility that the you that you think you are is not you at all. And that's what I always loved about LSD. That's what I always loved about psychedelics was that moment where the identity is annihilated by the tsunami of the psychedelic and somewhere in that annihilation an entire new universe appears as though whatever the you you thought you were was actually some kind of blindfold that the universe was wearing. And the Way of the Bodhisattva has a lot of chapters that you might find useful. If you're somebody like me and you have anger problems, if you're tormented by anger it's got an entire chapter on how to deal with that, on the antidote for anger which is patience and also just because I love horror movies and I love the Hellraiser movies it's got some amazingly vivid descriptions of the hell realms. And it mentions more than once the janitors of hell which is an interesting idea. Like I had no idea hell had janitors but I guess it would need somebody would have to be there to like clean up the blood and mop up the sizzling guts. Speaking of sizzling guts I would like to invite you to head over to patreon.com forward slash DTFH and a big thank you to all the people who have recently subscribed to the Patreon. Because I'm doing a kind of paternity leave you have not experienced the full glory of the DTFH Patreon which you will begin to experience again next week. Starting Monday I'll be back to guiding our weekly group meditation journey into boredom and on Friday we'll resume our Friday family gatherings and then starting again in March will be our book club we have yet to pick that title.

not only will you have access to commercial free episodes of the DTFH but if you stick around long enough you will get exclusive merchandise a beautiful mug a sticker an incredible t-shirt go check us out it's at patreon.com forward slash DTFH friends we've got a wonderful podcast for you today returning to the DTFH the host of Hamilton's Pharmacopia welcome Hamilton Morris Hamilton welcome back to the DTFH it's so great to hear your voice thanks for having me I always love talking with you and I really am grateful to you for the uh sending me all the episodes of season three of Hamilton's Pharmacopia now available on Amazon what was the service it was on prior to Amazon Hulu it's you know it's a hard show for people to find it's very frustrating for me the majority of the messages that I get are from people trying to figure out how to watch it um yeah it's and I can't help people in that way because I don't even know it depends on where you are the easiest way if you're in the US is to just watch it on Amazon you can also buy it for I think two dollars an episode on YouTube and people have been uh have been like pirating it and putting it on YouTube which I think is great like I just want people to watch it the only issue is the people that pirate it do a terrible job and cut out pieces and like splice in soccer games and do things to get over whatever copyright bots so that all right just on the level of people not seeing the entire episode I really discourage people from watching those pirated ones uh but it's also on iTunes I hope it'll be on Hulu at some point I have no idea when no one will tell me um and it's on TV as well for people that I don't have a TV but I guess if you have a TV it's uh available on vice TV and in some cable packages not to start off with a pretty mundane technical question but are you producing these yourself or who's who's who are you making these with yeah I mean I am the writer and director of the show and I make it with a small closely knit group of people who help with every facet of the editing and the photography and the sound mix and the color correction and things like that but it's it's made by a very small number of people um considering and and doing this over the pandemic as well was you know like a really bizarre filmmaking exercise but uh but yeah this is it is something I'm doing myself sometimes people I think people are actually right now very confused by how things are made like yes like they are very detached from the act of creation and so they often attribute creative agency to corporations they're like yeah they're like why did vice make this or what like why did vice do this it's like vice is a logo vice doesn't exist why are you getting angry at a logo or why are you praising a logo like these are not like they're human beings that create these things and their names are in the credits but then on top of that I feel all these streaming services like Netflix and Amazon they actually cut the credits out of a lot of episodes now which I think exacerbates this problem of people not even being aware of the act of creation they don't on some level even think about what it means to make something I just well listen I want to praise whatever logo or non-logo has you know been part of making this show because it is so good the animation is amazing the you know some people who maybe haven't seen Hamilton's Pharmacopia you might think that it's uh monolithic in subject matter it's that it's just about drugs or something it isn't it's it's like a shotgun scattering of fascinating facts and it's just so you you've done such a good job editing it it just looks so pretty so thanks for making it I love it yeah thank you and the reason I even bring up this credit thing which I understand may sound like a weird pedantic note to begin the conversation with is because yeah it was insanely difficult to make and I I can't name all of the people that were involved but their names are in the credits and it was a real labor of love to do it I mean this was not a job for many of the people I had to work for or I chose to work for you know four months unpaid to get it done and it's because a lot of the people were just very passionate about the subject matter and getting these stories told a big thanks to athletic greens for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH do you have vitamin friends you know I'm talking about like the friends who take 9 000 different vitamins every single day one of my friends takes so many vitamins that once they actually threw up out the window of the car in the morning because they had not eaten food with their vitamins the point is if you're like me you don't have time to sort through a million endless pills what's going on you're not nurse ratchet you're not running some kind of vitamin psychiatric ward for yourself you just want to be healthy you're not running an apothecary in your own house what are you gonna do get

shows with the subject matter of hamilton's pharmacopia specifically psychoactive substances which is that anytime a show revolving around that subject is against it i i mean instant hate of the thing because it's embarrassing to watch it feels like some kind of you know throw back to the war on drugs but when it's pro the subject matter um and it's made poorly then you get that effect of like well i mean they're whatever stoners or acid heads or they're people who are psychonauts or whatever you want to call it and because of that their show sucks so anytime you get like a kind of the a great show meeting something that is not anti uh psychoactive substances i think it benefits everybody because it shows yeah you can i mean you're there's an the opening of the xenon gas episode you are inhaling you're inhaling a balloon of a gas that i'd only vaguely heard of and had no idea it was psychoactive incredible do you ever feel like you're putting yourself in danger doing this no and i think that's it that is sort of an interesting question is there's often at least in terms of the consumption of the psychoactive substances there's often this idea that it's very dangerous there are very dangerous things that happen in the show but the consumption of the psychoactive drugs is not one of them i would say um you know they're they're maybe in the xenon clinic there were some things that were questionable i mean that's a whole long story i don't know like it's a bit of a tangent we can get into that but um but you know the the consumption itself is often something that's done very carefully because you know i think for so long people have associated drug use with self-destruction like they consider even people that enjoy drugs even people that are in favor of drugs that think that they should be legal that think they should be researched many of those people still on some level believe that the use of a psychoactive drug is self-destructive and i think that one of the major things that i i try to communicate is it doesn't need to be that way and you can use these things in a way that is not only not destructive but constructive it actually will help you it will make you better than you were and and i think that that's uh an important lesson of course not all use is like that and it requires an enormous amount of discipline and research and care in order to achieve the best effect from these experiences but i think it's just important to keep that in mind that um this is not something that people need to be ashamed of or think is inherently bad for any reason i love psychoactive substances they have uh been a huge benefit in various parts of my life but hamilton i cannot get the effect of growing up during the war on drugs out of my head there's always some underlying sense of doing something wrong of you know uh that this is somehow uh getting off the track of what a life should be and these are things that i passionately love can you do you have that in you at all yes or did you have oh i do absolutely i think and i don't think it's even just the war on drugs i think that it's also capitalism and also it's not an entirely unreasonable idea to have because we are taught that well not even just taught we live in a capitalist society for better or worse where productivity is prized above all else and anything that interferes with productivity is not good in our society regardless of how it makes you feel so right you know my own i would say that the thing that i struggle with the most is cannabis i without question enjoy smoking it but i have never been able to fully overcome a sort of shame or guilt associated with using it and for that reason i use it infrequently because no matter how much i enjoy it no matter how beneficial or relaxing it is for me i still can't entirely shake this sense that it would be better if i were sober reading it would be better if i were studying it would be better if i were writing is this really oh is it truly permissible for me just to feel good and just relax and have a conversation or watch a movie yeah that's it i i think we're hopefully some of the last generations to be poisoned in that way and i'm hoping that might by the time my kids are old enough to you know safely use any of these substances that the propaganda mechanism will have worn down and will have the data available to show that it's beneficial but yeah wow so i guess that's just something we're gonna have to deal with for the rest of our lives and it impacts the experience itself i mean people often think of the placebo effect is something that exists entirely independently from the pharmacological action of drugs but the sense of those drugs that we have impacts the experience so if you grow up in a culture that says using lsd is therapeutic and beneficial and may actually make you a better person you can be sure that that user will have a better lsd experience than someone who calls it acid conceptualizes the experience as frying their brain calls the experience frying thinks that it's a poison of some kind i mean even even if you're having the best experience of your life if that's in the background you can't fully enjoy it in the same way that i can't you know i could eat the most delicious meal from mcdonald's in the world but i am still thinking about it as a like unethical poisonous material regardless of what it actually is you know i haven't you know done deep personal research into the nutritional value of fast food but my intuitive sense of it is that it's bad and should be avoided and so regardless i could you know maybe someone could sneak an extra healthy ethically raised piece of meat into my mcdonald's hamburger with like a carefully baked bun but i would still feel ashamed eating it because of this sense that it is bad and should be avoided yep i can't do it i i can't pull off i can't have a happy meal like no matter what's happening i'm always disgusted with myself if i'm eating mcdonald's matter how good it tastes bonjour ça va in case you don't speak perfect french that's me saying hello how are you doing using the words that i've

let's learn french thank you babel so i was thinking about what the questions i have for you now that you're three seasons in to this incredible show uh and i know that you're a person who is is constantly researching and like you get literally into the atomic depths of these substances in the way they affect our consciousness and i've been loosely following some of the research that's happening currently regarding implanting memories in creatures and the the implications of that to me are wonderful on one level in the sense of learning and expediting certain kinds of training or god it goes on and on uh but on another level it's the first time i've really sort of had an inner shutter like a eldest huxley sense of like oh my god is is this the next wave of psychedelics uh that we're gonna have memories implanted and removed meaning that this entire war on drugs problem theoretically could somehow be pharmaceutically softened or altered anyway the the question is if you and i'm sorry i know this is a terrible thing to ask people especially in these days of technological acceleration but do you have any uh prognostications regarding what types of psychedelics might be in our future yes um the the final episode of my show aired last night and it profiled a brilliant pharmacologist named brian roth are you have you heard his name before i have not he's a really interesting guy and he's one of these scientists who has done a lot of work that if you didn't know better you'd think it was science fiction um he was crucial in developing a technology called dread d r e a d d that stands for designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs and his idea was you know in traditional pharmacology one of the most important goals is to develop drugs that are selective for one receptor and only one receptor because when you look at a drug like ibogaine or dmt or mescaline or many of the drugs that people are aware of they often are promiscuous in their binding they have activity at a variety of different receptors and it makes it hard to study the causal relationship pharmacologically because if a drug is acting on several different receptors how do you know what receptor is responsible for what physiological neurological effect so if you can come up with a drug that is exclusively binding to one receptor it's a very useful pharmacological tool but it's hard i mean there are people that spend their entire careers trying to develop a drug that exclusively binds to the serotonin 2a receptor the serotonin 2b receptor or so on and so forth what what are those receptors responsible for um one is considered the primary site of psychedelic action that's the serotonin 2a receptor the 2b receptor is considered an undesirable target of some drugs that causes uh excessive growth of heart valves actually so but anyway so this guy brian roth his idea was okay what if we sidestep this entire issue and instead of trying to develop high selectivity drugs we develop high selectivity receptors receptors in a brain that exclusively are activated by one drug and only one drug and we reverse engineer the basically reverse engineer the brain for the drug instead of the drug for the brain whoa yeah and that and this is not and this is something he has actually done that scientists are currently using i it's not an entire brain of neurons it's one receptor but this is the the idea so there are these amazing things that are being done and then he's he's taken that a step further where if you know the molecular structure of a receptor you know every amino acid residue and how it is three-dimensionally arranged you can then based on the charge of those residues and their shape you can and using ai generate artificial drugs and bind those artificial drugs to the artificial receptor so you're doing basic pharmacology research but it's entirely in silico there's no actual proteins and there's no actual drugs you're just docking virtual drugs onto a virtual receptor but because you don't have to go to the trouble of synthesizing a drug or isolating a receptor protein you can look at the pharmacology of 10 million drugs a day so using this technology he has and he hasn't published it for two a yet but he claims to have developed entirely new scaffolds for psychedelics that is you know traditionally the psychedelics are fallen to a couple of structural classes urgolines tryptomines phenethylamines but hypothetically they could have totally different structures that haven't been discovered yet so he's using computers to discover new drugs on a virtual receptor and uh and you know that's that's one of these things it's just you know what is that going to do in the future who knows but it's very exciting and i think we are on the precipice of a lot of great discoveries this matches one of nick bostrom's predictions for how a superintelligence might come to the planet which is some interaction with an ai and um some kind of uh genetic shift in like the human nervous system to increase amplify whatever type of intelligence you want to amplify so that is wild to think about but just to jump back for a second you said in silico as in it's it's okay so that's that means just it's just happening in a computer it's uh it's like the what they're doing with protein folding right now but with psychoactive chemicals yeah whoa that is wild this is this this is one of the much like i mean even though every you know people are talking about a ai is being the future there just can never be enough emphasis on how it how it's going to transform culture but the addition of ai interacting with the genetic engineering of the human brain do you mean so you're saying there's the possibility of having a open brain surgery or how would you change your own brain in in a way that it would become receptive or a receptor to these artificial chemicals nobody has done that yet but i think hypothetically you would probably inject a virus into the brain that would cause a transcriptional change that would cause the uh the receptors to produce these new designer proteins so what you're talking about there is also like a nightmare bioweapon which is a virus that causes a change in the human brain that pairs with a chemical weapon that induces states of consciousness i mean yes there there are certainly potentially nefarious uses for this technology assuming that it could even work that way i mean that's that's a problem with a lot of these things like the uh you know implantation of memories in a snail or um dread technology being used as a weapon or things like that uh is that often it's just hard it's much harder to do these things than people realize you know on one hand you have the nickbostrums of the world that are talking about super intelligence and then on the other hand you have an iphone in 2021 that can't autocorrect i am to i apostrophe n right but you know we you know but just thinking in terms of uh uh like steam engines to the bullet trains in japan you know and the span of time between them is uh you know based on universal time not that long at all but in human time what is it's like almost a lifetime between those two uh transformations into technology but still this thing even if it is 50 30 years into the future it's we're talking about a kind of apocalypse i mean sometimes i think about the amount of um the amount of time that gets put into anyone getting good at anything and how the compression of that time is going to create uh genius like we've never seen before mixed in with a kind of terrible hubris you know it the there's some humiliation that has to happen in any path towards learning something it it fucks with your ego enough that hopefully by the time you get good at anything you have some humility but remove that gap of time via some pharmacological technology and suddenly we're gonna have a planet filled with these hyper talented beings that never have encountered the learning curve i i don't mean to get too like weird and into the and i don't know why i'm getting so negative with you hamilton but do you know what i mean that these all i'm saying is uh when we think about on the horizon of history uh what's coming our way it is so bizarre to imagine that we are potentially 10 years 15 years away from consuming a substance that transforms the way that we see uh we see ourselves by implanting memories that are healthy memories or even analyzing past memories and correcting them enough that they no longer that we're not beating ourselves up anymore do you ever like worry about that the that there is some potential for a dystopian pharmacological future for our species i mean i think we're we're already in a dystopian pharmacological future i so i think um you know i think that there's a lot of room for improvement where we currently are you know there's some enormous percentage of the american population taking ssri antidepressants i think it's something like 15 percent of american women something close to that seems like it's a lot more in new york it's in new york it seems like it's a solid third of women that i meet take ssri's and i of course understand that for some people it's beneficial i'm not gonna sit say that no one should use ssri's i don't think that but i think that very few people that use ssri's are extremely happy about it you know i i don't it's very rare for me to meet someone who says yeah i take prozac and i love it it's fantastic i'm so happy that prozac entered my life i am so grateful for prozac i want to take it forever it's been the best thing that ever happened to me it's usually a kind of begrudging well it's better than the way i was before it's a necessary evil um and you know i think that we can do better i think we can do a lot better and i have hope for that in terms of dystopian futures of implanted memories i don't know you know it's it's very easy to look at the headlines of these articles and then and not look at what's actually being done and what's actually being done it's like you know they're doing some it's not a memory in the sense that you or i think of a memory it's some like extremely minimal impulse and a snail that uh that is very different from what we would call memory that's not to say that it's impossible it probably is possible and probably will occur at some point i imagine not in either of our lifetimes but uh but when it happens i hope that we are mature enough to use these things constructively what are your thoughts regarding uh ketamine in the treatment of depression as compared to the ssri well yeah i mean related to what i was just saying you know there's a little bit of a crisis in psychiatry in that there have been so many years where we haven't had a dramatically new treatment for depression and i think the fda started to liberalize its criteria a little bit because actually the clinical data for ketamine were not all that impressive compared to placebo it wasn't it wasn't the at least in terms of the clinical trials that were done it was not a miracle cure for depression and really the only way that they were able to get it approved was by making it a fast-tracked breakthrough therapy for treatment resistant depression which is justifiably considered a life-threatening disease like cancer and so there are special designations available for diseases that are life-threatening where they can liberalize the criteria slightly to allow new therapies to be introduced to the market for conditions that could really benefit from them and ketamine is a complicated one yeah the i haven't been following every new piece of clinical data that emerges but uh but it's it seems like it anecdotally does help a lot of people um i certainly also know people who haven't been helped and have been uh i think have been harmed by it and it's a i think that because it's a psychedelic it might require a different strategy than is typically used for antidepressants and one that is not really part of our current medical framework because we're so used to this idea of an antidepressant is a drug that you take every day or in the case of ketamine i think typically every week or every second week and we're and we associate one off use of a psychoactive drug with non-medical recreational use but i do wonder if that type of strategy makes the most sense for ketamine i think it's funny the way that like so-called abuse or non-medical use is converging with medical orthodoxy where you know uh four years ago if you'd told a medical doctor i snort ketamine to treat my depression they would say you know that's irresponsible that's not the way that you use ketamine it's not okay to snort it you uh it's not a recognized antidepressant now johnson and johnson sells a nasal spray of ketamine to treat depression um but you know in my own use of ketamine as an antidepressant which i haven't done in years but in 2018 i was i was very depressed and um used it three times that year and i think that the way that i used it was actually very beneficial which wasn't to use it as a daily antidepressant or a weekly antidepressant but to use it as a kind of one-off tool to break out of a ingrained thought pattern that was disrupting my functioning if you had to describe the k-hole how how would you talk about it what is that place ha ha uh i mean it's it's not it's not easy to describe and it's not easy to remember and it's not something that is analogous to anything in normal consciousness it's not analogous to a dream it's maybe somewhat close to a waking sort of lucid type dream sometimes but even then it's hard to say it's it's a it seems like a very random um and it's a very random rearrangement of your consciousness that has elements that feel like what i imagine schizophrenia feels like um where there's a sort of grandiose sense of privileged understanding of the mechanism of the universe that other people don't appreciate yeah um or a privileged understanding of genetics and inheritance and genealogy and all these kinds of you start thinking about you know connecting wires of your life and your lineage and society in these very abstract weird ways that um if you describe them to another person it would sound like a sort of typical schizophrenic delusion um and that i don't i don't know if that is the beneficial aspect of it i think what is really interesting about ketamine is that i think that when you're depressed and you've been depressed for a while you can get locked into a certain type of thinking that is pessimistic basically and one that has a very limited view of the world where you think this is this is who i am i'm this guy this is what i do this is what i'm good at this is what i'm bad at and i don't do these other things and i don't have any hope of doing those other things because this is who i am and and and what today was like is what tomorrow will be like and the day after and that's just my lot and when you take ketamine it can give you a delusional sense of possibility the aperture of possibility expands dramatically and suddenly all of the restrictions that you once thought existed disintegrate and you can feel that okay oh i want to be a politician i guess i guess i'll be a politician then oh i i should write a novel tomorrow i guess i'll i'll be a movie star i'll be a medical doctor i'll be whatever and and if you're depressed that sounds delusional be a politician how on earth could i be a politician that makes no sense but then in that state you think why not well every politician had to begin with the thought i can be a politician so the first step of becoming a politician is to think that you can be a politician and so i actually think that that you know delusional or potentially delusional self-image can be very therapeutic for people that have a overly restrictive view of themselves and what is possible because you do need you do need that moment of thinking i can do this in order to do something and so even if it is delusional that's the first step in expanding yourself when this becomes problematic is when you do it all the time because i think as a one-off thing every now and then it can be tremendously beneficial to expand the scope of possibility of yourself but if you're doing it all the time then you can just end up having a totally distorted self-image that is not therapeutic or beneficial in any way and that i think is is the is the both the therapeutic psychological component of ketamine and what makes it dangerous yeah it you know i it's so interesting to hear you say this because i never considered that facet of it which is it's not like the cocaine confidence it's something entirely different it and for me artistically it was one of the most inspiring psychoactive substances i've ever encountered and it informed a lot of the show i made called the midnight gospel but i got addicted to it i had to fly i couldn't i got habituated to it ended up having to flush it down the toilet i you know it stopped working you know to me that that's the the main problem exactly what you're saying which is you know that it's you can't just live a life of thinking that you're enlightened or inspired you need to go through revision you know you need to go through the the work part too but that's interesting to hear you say that you know i the the delusional part that this is and we've had this conversation before and i love how rational you are and and we need it and i love how logical you are and also i love how uh you know you you know how to create these things or you're an actual chemist uh which is which is incredible but i was just reading some you know i don't know a blog or something regarding people who are researching psychoactive chemicals currently and that if they if they announce that they've been using them then their research is kind of not looked upon in the same light or even worse if these people are using the chemicals that they're studying and having these experiences that are you know when i think of ketamine i think of buddhism i think of the dissolution of the identity and some kind of experience of the gap between thoughts or something you know that's as far as i've gotten with it or a bardo state but i'm allowed to do that because i'm a podcaster i wonder if you could talk a little bit about any brushes you've had with what people would call the mystical and how your mind integrates that into into into your life yeah i mean i i think people often get confused when i say that i'm a materialist or that i don't believe in or that i'm not spiritual and i'm not saying that i don't have amazing experiences that i cannot describe i'm not saying that i live in some kind of you know sterile reality that is uh free of any astonishment it's all i'm saying is that i don't feel the need to invoke the supernatural to explain things i'm also not saying that i feel those things are at this time sufficiently explained by science it's really just my way of saying of trying to communicate that sometimes there is no explanation and and i would prefer not to use the supernatural to explain things that way um but there are all kinds of you know back to the ketamine example i mean i remember um the last time i used it maybe three three years ago i believe um i had this sort of immersive vision of myself at the telluride mushroom festival and it was this very boring memory it was it was you know it's strange to simultaneously uh have this you know basically an out of body experience where you're dropped into a memory that you thought you'd forgotten that is so immersive it feels like reality but that is also a boring memory not it's not a memory of you know some kind of extremely important moment in your life it's totally mundane or so it seemed and i came out of it and i thought wow that was so mundane just a memory of myself walking down a road in telluride colorado after going mushroom hunting why would i even think of that and then the more i thought about it it started to sort of unfold and the importance of it started to become apparent emotionally and i thought how is that even possible how is it possible that by antagonizing this protein in my brain i relive a memory so boring that even i don't recognize its significance at the time that i'm experiencing it or re-experiencing it and then subsequently i'm able to recognize that it carried some kind of implicit message that was valuable to me like you know these are very strange experiences it's very strange and uh and how you know how how like for you know if i use DMT one thing that's totally remarkable to me is how good the things that i think are like they are so good that i am puzzled by how good they are like you know the importance of love the importance of kindness the importance of generosity the importance of gratitude where why why on earth would diamethyl tryptamine binding to this subtype of serotonin receptor cause me to suddenly feel these extremely positive values of all things you know you could think it could just as easily be that i like salty foods or you know that like i need a new couch or like whatever but instead it's like love your family one day they'll be gone you know like how does that happen i don't know science has not explained it i don't think spirituality explains it either i think it's unknown and i would i would love to to learn even the smallest morsel of how that comes to be well you know i'm i've gotten so into meditation lately and i've gotten so into buddhism lately that the best spiritual explanation i have for it and forgive me any anyone listening who disagrees or is a buddhist or i'm totally wrong because yeah i'm just going jogging in the woods and listening to like audible buddhist books but there's an idea in buddhism that humans are fundamentally good that's a controversial idea but that's the idea that that sort of the that everything else everything a human does that involves hurting other people is of just an ignorance of what we really are which is sort of an interconnected matrix of energy that doesn't have any uh lasting or um integral self and uh somehow the the there's a reality that that's just you know for lack of a better word and is a lazy thing to call it just good i'm sure there's some Tibetan word that would make more sense so the answer could be if we're looking at it from a spiritual lens that these substances are kind of you know wiping off the windshield or something enough that the what you actually are starts coming out and that you know maybe gets sort of animated or you know configured based on the substance itself but it's the reason that's the message these things seem to keep giving us isn't necessarily that it's the substance that has encoded in it compassion but that we're fundamentally compassionate that's just my current thinking on it but who knows yeah no i agree i agree that the substance does not contain information it's not the substance um and i would hope that you're right that we're fundamentally compassionate i mean that would that would really be good if that's what's behind it all inside each of us yeah i mean yes that that is well it's good but then also it's i think the the beautiful thing about i mean it is good but the the beautiful thing about like i'm reading i'm getting into these super obscure buddhist scriptures and they're wild man they're wild but it's so on anilatory on one level you know so much of like a human suffering and i think this answers the ketamine depression question to some degree it's like so much of us our suffering is just what you were saying we're all wound up in our self and our bodies you know or it's and it's a bummer when you get to a certain age your body starts hurting you look weirder and weirder every year and so at least i do not maybe not you actually you look great man but like you know what i mean so a disassociative it like sort of temporarily takes off this thing or at least loosens it a little bit that we call our identity which if you really think about it it's really interesting that you know whatever that thing is is really just what we tend to pull out of the environment and notice you know and so maybe there's just in just in suddenly no longer pulling out the same constant you know aspects of reality that we've become habituated to pulling out you know maybe there's just some relief in suddenly seeing the world just as it is you know or a warped version of the world there's freedom in it yeah yeah and i think that that you know i don't know that this has ever been studied or even looked at very carefully but a very large number of people that i know who are transgender have also used a lot of ketamine and they have felt that ketamine was something that like helped them loosen the boundaries of their gender self-image and i think that that's another example of what i was talking about is you know maybe maybe you're unhappy and every single day the reason that you're unhappy is you think oh it's because i'm a man or whatever and then you take ketamine and you realize oh i'm not anything i can be whatever i can be i can be a medical doctor and i can be a woman and i could be 50 other things if i want to i mean you know john lily toward the end i think it was it was sort of he was kind of an early adopter um but i'm under the impression that toward the end of yeah breast implants yeah yeah i i yes i i mean definitely that's i think one of the you know evolutionary qualities of of that particular drug and the reason that like when people take it uh some people dislike it because it has this sort of sci-fi quality to it you know it has a weird technological aspect to it and that some people you know people like this sort of warm glow of mushrooms but sometimes with ketamine you go really go into the void and yeah i i think something in that melting down of the self it's not just yeah it's not just like suddenly you realize like holy shit there's no reason i can't become a a poet or a doctor or learn to fly an airplane or you know what it's also you realize like why am i so fixated on my gender being the thing you know why am i so fixated on inequality of myself you know being like who i am and that that makes it a very controversial substance in that regard but you know i want not i want to swing around for a moment just because uh and i'm sorry if this makes you feel uncomfortable but you are like in the psychedelic universe you're a rock star man and i was like one of my favorite things that you do on twitter i love your social media presence but sometimes you'll like show someone's tattoo of like DMT or whatever they think it's DMT and you're like actually and then you'll say you'll say what it is it's some either like completely benign something or like aspirin or something like that but and i love that i love the way you interact with people in the psychedelic world but not to be scandalous i wonder if you could maybe tell a story of some weird interactions you must have had with people out there who are you know tweaking out and have decided that you're jesus oh i mean i have them on a daily basis i have them too frequently in fact and it's because over the last couple months my show has been airing i'm getting you know 100 messages a day and there's a lot of really strange people out there as you know um and you know i've i've gotten the the full the full spectrum of of people you know someone telling me that they their girlfriend is pregnant with the second coming of jesus and what can they do how can i help spread awareness so that the world knows you know you get that sort of thing you get people to think they are jesus of course um you have um people that are convinced that various psychoactive substances are having some kind of like transhumanist ultra positive effect on them but they actually seem to be in the throes of one of these sorts of delusions that we've just described that's actually a pretty a pretty common one and and that goes to show um how i think that actually represents one of the central problems with psychoactive drugs is you can think that they're helping you but that's very different from them helping you and i think that's actually one of the most important reasons to try to use them as infrequently as possible is it will aid that self-assessment because if you're constantly in the throes of it you can easily lose track of who you are and how you relate to who you used to be and where you're going so you know it's yeah it's yeah it's it's very tricky and i and hamilton when i told my wife i told my wife at one point after i'd like gotten out of the ketamine's grip i was like but you know what it was helping me make music and the look on her face said everything she's like she's like you think it was helping you make music and then i went back and listened to some of the music i was making horrible horrible but in the midst of the haze i was in i was like this is cutting cutting edge and it was not so yeah i hear you may i've experienced it and it's like i'm lucky i it's just embarrassing you know but it can get much worse so i didn't even know this that this had happened with you maybe you've probably talked about this in past uh podcast so i don't know if it's something you want to rehash but i'm just sort of curious because i've actually been hearing about a lot of people especially over the pandemic who have gotten very seriously into dissociatives um both ketamine and nitrous oxide i used to never hear about nitrous oxide addiction among just like you know my acquaintances and in the last few months i've casually heard people reference having to have multiple nitrous oxide interventions was this something that you were going through during the pandemic or is this more distant past it was it was in the past more but yeah it just it's classic addiction it just snuck up on me you know it's it started off just like what we were like it with a i was just excited because because it it to me it is a kind of visionary substance and wildly alien and it and it sort of checks all the boxes and what i love about psychedelics and also it's 45 minutes you know so you're not committing to uh six or eight or 12 hour trip which is really delightful but then you know just it's nothing new just a classic story like it it stopped it wasn't even working anymore uh but i was doing it all the time all day long it was embarrassing i was getting that like i i've been addicted to a few things in my life uh i got physically addicted to benzos a long time ago when i was on a long comedy tour because i was taking him to go to sleep but then i also started taking him in the day and i was and i and i only had maybe a four week supply but i wasn't aware of how they can i wasn't quite aware of how they can get their hooks into you and so i just went it was a i went through withdrawals it was the most fucked up i got lucky it was just like 24 48 hours but uh and then the catamine it was it was more nefarious and that it doesn't seem to be fit i don't it's not physically addictive but you get really like it's like cigarettes which are physically addicted you just i just got habituated and it wasn't working you know the last time i did it uh over over a year ago the last time i did it longer the last time i did it it took me like four and a half hours to do a commercial for my podcast and i just realized like you this is not only is this not inspiring you anymore but it's coming up your ability to create something you love creating so i i just got i was able to kick it i'm just lucky in that way that i can just flush a thing down the toilet and then it's over or you know not with it took a few flushes to be honest but yeah yeah but it's it's scary in that way i think that's the big problem with it is that it's it is a treatment for depression it does it and i think i was using it to cope with like a lot of like my dad's and my mom passing and you know i think it was legitimately keeping me out of a long depressive episode but just like what you're saying you know it's you it's you can't isolate and do these things this is why i think you know when people talk about psychedelic therapy it seems like they forget that that involves a therapist you know it involves an expert who's there to be the person who can hopefully help you avoid all the sand traps that are out there when it comes to any of these substances i mean we all love bliss who can blame us right of course and i mean this is another one of the complicated aspects of psychoactive drugs and addiction is sometimes someone who has no experience they'll look at a news report of somebody who's freaking out after having consumed so-called bath salts or spice or something like that and they think oh i never want to do that what would drive a person to do that why on earth would the person do that but what they're not recognizing is that was the worst time for that person but previously it was probably good that's why they were doing it it starts out good often and then there can be a slow change that occurs where you either stop responding to it or in addition to the good things there's a bad thing or it becomes entirely bad and tracking that is yeah something that a therapist or a friend is really helpful for or i think the easiest way is just to try to do these things infrequently that way you can track yourself absolutely yeah absolutely and it's always better if you do it infrequently anyway that it just it's so much better to like i know that somewhere around the corner in a few years it's not like i won't do ketamine again but i also know that when i do it it'll be wonderful because it's been a long time in between and i think that you know that's a you know our whole way of looking at addiction seems somehow you know tainted by the prohibition i don't think people understand that there's a there's actually a way that these substances can be used with very infrequently and successfully and it doesn't mean that your whole life is going to fall apart after that but i'm sure you must have had moments where you worry about the effect that your show is having i mean do you have that do you have some sense of like you look like you're a disciplined person you're able to modulate the way you use these substances but sometimes with my podcast and especially earlier episodes when i was i think very irresponsible in my bugling the benefits of psychedelics i worry that uh you know i wasn't cautionary enough and that i might have you know i don't know and even in a in a small way i would hate to think that i led someone into a place they couldn't get out of yeah um i think that i've been pretty good about specifying the dangerous aspects or if not i try to implicitly communicate that so sometimes people will say hey man i watched your show and you showed this this person who they're a weird oh they do ketamine and they're weird that that's not gonna end prohibition you need to show silicon valley micro dosers who are using it to empower their high productivity career that's the way you change the narrative and uh and one reason that i include people who are weird or who have beliefs that maybe um you know from like a drug policy or advocacy perspective these beliefs would not be the ones that most people would want to elevate and say this is what happens when you use a drug but one reason in addition to just i like talking to weird people as you do as well uh yes and uh and so i'm not i'm not you know like making advertisements for psychedelics i'm making documentaries about psychedelics and in doing that i want to show people who sometimes have strange beliefs partially because i find it interesting but partially to show yeah you know these things do open your mind and sometimes that's beneficial and sometimes that might promote a type of uh thinking that maybe is undesirable to you and this is what it looks like you know i got a lot of people criticized me for showing you know this this guy that smoked dmt and believed in pizza gate and uh you know saying how how could you possibly do that you're gonna undo any progress but you know if you only talk about johns hopkins university and academic research with psychedelics you're neglecting to acknowledge the reality of psychedelic drug use for many people so that's that's the way i try to handle it is to show that you know just to show honestly how these things exist in society and let people draw their own conclusions so if you see somebody who's you know a strange artist living alone in the desert who has a lot of outlandish beliefs about angels and ufo's and dolphins who uses a lot of ketamine and you think love that episode and you think that's terrible well then there you go then you then you have uh but if you think that's fantastic then there you go as well you know that's that's kind of my my take on it and hell in love with that guy me too what was his name timothy wiley wow what a saint that guy was he had to me and maybe it was just the lighting he really seemed to have this ethereal glow about him like he really seemed like a some kind of i don't know awakened being or something oh well you know he was like a spiritual leader uh you know the process church yeah he was you know big part of the process church he was behind the scenes in a lot of different things you know genesis purge yes yes like her transformation was because of timothy wiley wow yeah giving her ketamine and helping her like transform so he was he was part of a lot of different things and he was a really you know he was a true artist a true weirdo a true um independent strange thinker and i love that you know i think that i don't want a reality that is so sterile that people only talk about these things as you know psychiatric medications for treatment of disease i think that they're useful for expanding thought in directions that are strange and artistic and poetic and weird why not you know it's yeah this is all beautiful and good and in the finale of my show last night um i profiled this woman amanda fielding who reminds me of timothy wiley in a lot of ways you know she's brilliant she's a truly heterodox thinker who has uh spent her life in this quixotic quest to demonstrate that trepanation is a medically valid procedure and and and well i don't think that trepanation is likely to be medically validated although i'd be happy to be wrong um i i think that part of it comes from a certain insecurity that many people have that they need medical validation when i see this as a sort of artistic decision that she made a sort of body modification that is valid whether or not it has any impact on her consciousness as something symbolic is truly opening her head opening her mind you know i think that there's something amazing about that regardless of what physiological effect it may or may not have listen if you if anybody who has watched a documentary on trepanation and hasn't had at least the fleeting thought of like shit maybe i should try that that sounds awesome i think you're not looking into it deeply have trepanation is one of those things the problem with it is like how do you go back you know what if you're wrong but anytime i've seen these documentaries i would never be is it trepanated is that how you'd say it yeah we're treponed i would never be treponed but come on aren't you curious about like what the effect is and this was it's not just like this is something body modification people are doing this was a like a cultural movement at one time right that this was something that was being practiced for centuries right like we're still finding skulls with that have been treponed oh yes it's one of the oldest known surgical procedures yeah it's some form of what what like neurological bloodletting or something like well what is the idea it relieves pressure on the brain or it enhances mystical states i haven't yet to see the finale so sorry if i'm making you repeat something that's no no and the finale actually doesn't even go into the science of it because i don't want to take a public stance on trepanation you know for the record i i do not imagine that it has uh i don't predict that it has major therapeutic effects you know people routinely have holes drilled in their skulls for surgical procedures you know right craniotomy so it's it's not as if it's not done in the 21st century and it doesn't seem to uh have a major effect but you know and historically in these you know various artifacts that have been uncovered and these ancient skulls that have been treponed it makes a lot of intuitive sense if you have a headache well where's the pain it's in your head right so where are you gonna direct your medical intervention to the head you got to get out that demon that's in your head you're insane right there's something in your head there's a problem in your head you got to get it out so it makes sense in this you know an intuitive understanding of the way the body works especially from a spiritual framework where you're attributing disease to malevolent spirits right yes oh yeah let me also emphasize i don't don't treponate yourself or your friends or anybody it's just a curious thing that has happened in the past also you know what was the anesthetic that they were using i mean maybe part of the you know experience in the past was the you know lack of any kind of anesthetic because we at least the ones we have access to now maybe there was some initiatory pain high that people are getting from it but do you you know this is to me what you know i i know you get it now i'm hearing that you get it which is like the people who are very protective of what they see as some kind of you know flowering psychedelic renaissance what do they call it the third i don't know there's a name for the thing and i've forgotten what it is and their people are rightfully protective of it and i agree with you it does seem to me to be in right now maybe necessarily imbalanced towards the medical universe just so that it can get to the place where it can you know happily be used as a cultural amplifier stimulator and inspiring kind of something that could like you know shape movies and and art and things like that but the message i've gotten from people uh is more along the lines of we don't need any more tim you know gurus we don't need any more psychedelic jesus's out there well you know what do you think is the the weird connection between psychedelics and the messianic thing that seems to like happen to people you know like inevitably someone emerges you get a person who's taken enough acid that they really believe they're the christ or the matreya or whatever an alien representative and weirdly they end up with a group of people following them around because uh you know there is some kind of actual gravity these people have but what are your thoughts on that do you do you have any thoughts on like the many psychedelic messiahs we've had in the past and certainly will have in the coming years well it depends on how you define messiah because if you're including timothy leary there i i think timothy leary is very widely misunderstood you know the more i think about timothy leary the more i think of him as a comedian i really you know i think more than a psychologist more than a guru more than almost anything timothy leary was a comedian and he was someone who believed in psychedelics at a time when they were being attacked from every imaginable direction medically legally socially and he defended them and the psychedelic community does not appreciate what he did the sacrifices that he made he's you know routinely criticized people uh blame him for the end of psychedelic research i think a lot of what we have today is not something that exists in spite of timothy leary but because of timothy leary and um i don't really think he did anything wrong at all i think that he was a victim of many many i mean he was he was facing life in prison he they were threatening to lobotomize him like can you imagine what he went through just because he was interested in lsd in cannabis no no no i can't and also let me clarify he i love him i've read uh much of his uh like writing and some of his obscure writing is is amazing the circuits of consciousness uh i really i really love him i could see though why he gets criticized i could see i mean they you know you want to scapegoat you know and he was i guess the loudest one that i could think of in in that movement tune in turn on drop out an invitation to sort of exit capitalism he would have these days he would have seemed like a almost like a square you know he would he would have had a podcast would have seemed cool but in those days yeah he was a culture shatterer i could see both sides of it but do you know what i'm saying though like this is something i've noticed specifically with psychedelics which is that you will meet people who have uh transform themselves legitimately heal themselves people who have taken ayahuasca and uh have become peaceful and people who are just have a kind of sweetness to them that they report being related to a series of experiences they had in a psychedelic but weirdly you run into these like people who somehow the thing is making them into egomaniacs and it's one of the more confusing aspects of these drugs it's just a bizarre thing to witness these people and also because you know that there's a i i i guess to reduce it to less than a messiah what are your thoughts on this thing or the self-assignment of oneself as a shaman yeah yeah it's um i i i guess i would say i regard it with suspicion and distrust most of the time um as one should and i think that i think again like so many of the problems with drugs they're not actually problems with drugs or problems with prohibition and cultural problems more than they are pharmacological ones so you know if you think about it in the context of a society that says everything is bad or says a thing is bad and then you try it and then you realize that not only is it not bad it's good and you think okay well i'll make it my mission to tell everyone that it's good actually i think that's that's kind of the basic thing that's operating in a lot of these people is they have some transformative experience and they want to share it i think it often is happening from a somewhat positive perspective but then i think where it tends to go wrong is not when people are talking about the positives but when people start to try to control behavior or try to um coerce other people into doing things or start creating a rigid set of beliefs that uh are used to create different types of moral dichotomies where you can criticize other people or or say that they're doing something wrong you know that's i think where you really run into problems and i've spent time with a lot of different religious groups that use psychedelics and indigenous groups that use psychedelics and the ones that i think run into problems are the ones that start to dictate other people's behavior and force people to do things or force people to believe things you know there's a big difference between saying i think you shouldn't eat meat because meat is requires violence to an animal and you should try to minimize the violence of your existence in any possible way but it is your choice to eat meat and saying you know you're a bad person you're not enlightened you're not spiritual you're part of the problem if you eat meat you know i think part of of using these things constructively and existing in the world constructively is to be permissive of other people's behavior as long as they're not hurting other people and i understand that it's like you know it all comes into this this kind of classic you know socratic idea that no one knowingly does wrong and so all these people are always thinking that they're doing the right thing they're thinking oh you know the problem with eating meat is it's so bad or the problem with being gay is that it's really bad god doesn't want you to be gay or whatever they think they're doing the right thing they don't they're not operating from a perspective of of uh usually i don't think operating from a perspective of wanting to contribute pain or evil into the world but that's what happens when they're trying to do good um and you know i've i got very close to a psychedelic cult for a while i was writing a story which call i am not going to say their name because it went sour with them and uh and like ended with sort of oblique death threats from them uh but i was maybe i'll write something about it at some point it was for an article in harpers this was like one of the things that was contributing to my depression in 2018 but anyway um you know this group had a very strict code of conduct that i think i think that you know their psychedelic advocacy was wound up in control fantasies of the leader and you know that's i think that's the the major line it's there's nothing wrong with being you know thinking you're a messiah but i think there is something wrong with attempting to control other people or trying to um or trying to make other people feel bad about their actions unnecessarily you know this there's a famous story ramdas tells because his brother got institutionalized because his brother thought he was jesus they found him in an apartment he had six elderly women around him worshiping him and he was having a messianic fan of delusion got institutionalized ramdas tells the story goes to visit his brother in a mental hospital and his brother says to ramdas look at you you know you're dressed like jesus you're you know you're you have followers people you know you're you're a you're like a scuru person how come you're out there and i'm in here and ramdas's answer was well the difference is you think you're the only jesus and i think everyone's jesus haha that's great yeah it's pretty cool but yeah well i mean your encounter with this leader did he demonstrate to you inequalities that were magnetic or did you feel sort of you know vacuumed into his uh social gravity well my impression was that you know again when you're part of a a subculture an underground group you have beliefs that are not only not shared by the majority of people that surround you they're illegal you'll kind of go with whoever you can find so this guy i wouldn't say that his beliefs were especially unusual they're just at that heat this is someone who was operating starting in the really in the 60s and continues to this day um and uh but but really just someone who believed in psychedelics and believed in nonviolence and believed in vegetarianism and believed in a lot of good things and so that drew people in not because he was necessarily charismatic or magnetic but because they thought oh okay well here's a guy that at least gets what's going on he understands the value of health food he understands the value of meditation he understands the value of psychedelics he has liberal ideas about about the importance of sex you know things like that so um i think that for a long time you could cultivate a following just by not hating these things basically right right right wow yeah well you know congratulations on uh getting out of that thing you know i think there's something to be said i think it's a good sign if you have gotten vacuumed into a cult and if you know that's a that means you're living life if you ask me you know importantly that you've got also got now but i should say i was not although i actually did try to join this cult as a freshman in college uh i was never a member of this cult i was involved with them via a strange series of connections and was ultimately trying to write a story about them because i at the beginning felt very sympathetic toward them i felt that they had been uh that they'd gone through horrible horrible uh adversity in order to you know believe in psychedelics for decades and they did they you know that's like so many of these things it's complicated they really did um fight for psychedelics at a time when very few other people were and they did they were both persecuted and prosecuted by the government and they uh you know understandably developed a number of different complexes as a result of it but right but yeah so i was trying to write a story about it this was uh not as a a member of the cult thankfully well you should get into a cult hamilton but hey let me end on a kind of mundane question what a wonderful conversation i i'm so grateful for being on the show but i what are your thoughts on this is by the way speaking of like people who have gone through hell because of the war on drugs who had the initial understanding that these things were medicines they had great potential and it got arrested had their lives destroyed uh i feel i am so exhilarated by the reality that right now you can buy stock in companies that are you know synthesizing lsd and uh you know doing real legal research on it but i feel a little bitterness uh too you know it's like oh great now you're you know i can literally buy stock and accompany doing experiments with lsd when not that long ago if i had it in my pot well to this day if i had it i have i'll go to jail but do you do you feel that kind of bitterness for me there's like a i don't know how to put it there's just this feeling of like yeah we knew this you know we knew how many lives have been destroyed how many people have lost their children how many people have you know been like completely ostracized from society for you know just doing a thing that is ultimately like very beneficial to a person's life do you ever do you get that feeling like you don't have talking about like a kind of oh twinge of of course of course and you know it's this is what you're describing is a feeling you should have because it's deeply contradictory it's deeply disturbing and at the same time it's good it's weird it's a weird feeling and it's you know of course it happened first with cannabis you have people becoming multi-millionaires from cannabis at the same time that there are people locked in cages isolated from their family their lives destroyed for cannabis this is happening right now as we speak so um yeah there's a deep and painful hypocrisy in that and we're seeing it happen with psychedelics and the weirdest thing about it is that it's a good thing you know that you look at this and you think this is deeply unjust but it's even weirder to think this is actually the right thing to be happening because this is progress this is how things change and this is the rate of change in our society it doesn't happen overnight in fact it's happening a hell of a lot faster than i or almost anyone else thought it would you know that yes that there are publicly traded psilocybin stocks that you can invest in on robin hood right now that's mind boggling and that you know like for example i've done chemistry research for over a decade at the small pharmacy school in philadelphia and um and in the past that there was a little bit of money from the university i would you know self fund the research a few nice people like you know tim ferris gave me some money at one point for research but you know for the most part we were just we barely had enough money for solvents to do this chemistry and now there are so many pharmaceutical companies trying to hire me to do research to be on their board of advisors and yeah it's it's like it's a weird feeling but i am also aware wow this is how things are going to change now this isn't going to be a question of oh can i afford you know this reagent now people are are going to be able to do so much research so they never could do before so many of these you know multi decade lasting questions about the potential of psychedelics both positive and negative are on the precipice of being answered and it's it's going to be great you know i'm so excited for what's happening i really am i'm not and if you know i'm not an especially optimistic person i am usually a somewhat pessimistic person actually but this forces a tiny bit of optimism out of me and we'll of course see how it all plays out but you know i think that there's a lot of of good things that can come out of it even if every pharmaceutical psychedelic fails then maybe at least in this process we will have taught people that these things do have at least medical potential or that they shouldn't be illegal and that would be tremendous progress that we will see in our lifetime so i am i'm really excited i'm excited to be a part of it you know i i uh i'm pretty much planning to you know i have a podcast and i'm going to continue doing that i'm going to continue writing but i'm planning to do a lot less of this documentary work in order to focus on chemistry because the resources are available now you know now is the first time that this could be a full-time job and it's so exciting wow but wait you you can't close saying that you're not going to do another season is that what you're saying well it's funny it's you know at the same time that all these resources are being made available for scientific research the season was i don't i don't want to like close on something negative but it was a herculean task to finish it right um you know for me and for the many people that worked on it it was you know the the consensus among most of the group was we could do it this time you know working 13 14 hours a day seven days a week sacrificing everything to finish it working unpaid but that's not sustainable you can do that right you can do that for a year you can't do that for the rest of your life and so if some you know offer emerges that would change that that would make it a reasonable thing that people wouldn't have to you know there was someone who was working on the show who had you know had a breakdown from the the level of stress working on it you know it's i think it's hard for people to fathom what went into that so when people contact me and they say like oh why didn't you show you know you really should have shown xenon distillation why didn't you do that it's like well because it was a pandemic and and and i wanted to and it wasn't possible and we were already completely out of money and like filming things on our iPhones so um but you know so it was it was really really hard and i'm proud of a lot of what we all created but uh i think now the time has come to do some chemistry and i'm excited to do that Hamilton Morris i love you thank you so much for coming on this show everybody Hamilton's pharmacopia season three it's on amazon please watch it it is a beautiful show and i could tell that that

You can find all the information about this tour located at DuncanTrussell.com, and I hope you'll grab some tickets. Holy shit, man, it's 2016. Can you believe it? I can't. You know what else I can't believe? I can't believe how fat I got. I went to the gym today. I've resumed going to the gym, and I did body fat measurement. And wow, did I plump up over the holidays. Wow, I plumped up. And I know how I plumped up. I know why I plumped up. I plumped up because I was eating entire pecan pies and pouring booze down my throat, as though there were some kind of fire burning in my stomach that could only be extinguished by pecan pies and booze. And I ballooned up like a bouncy house inflated with an industrial pump. You just watch your hands shoving pies into your face, and you love it. It feels good, by the way. It does feel good to eat a whole pie. I'm not going to lie about it, guys. It feels good to eat an entire pie. It feels good in a dark, awful way to keep coming back to the pie and watch it get smaller and smaller and feel your heart sink, because you know the pie will be gone soon, and even to contemplate getting another pie. And it's a form of terrible nihilism, really. I was reading in Be Here Now, which is one of Ram Dass' most famous books, this passage in there. You know what? I'll just read it, because I think it totally applies. And if you've missed Be Here Now somehow, or you haven't read it in a long time, pick it up again. It's just as incredible as it's always been. But if you haven't read it, you should definitely check it out. It's amazing. So here it is. You and I can always starve together if we're backstage in the here and now. If we're not in the here and now, no matter how much food we put in our bellies, it's never gonna be enough. And that's the feeling of Western man. It's not enough. He's got it all going in as fast as he can shovel it. He's got every sensual gratification he can possibly desire, and it's not enough, because there's no here and now-ness about it. Here and now is the doorway to all that energy, because if you're truthfully here and now, there's no more you. There's actually a disorder called pica, where if you've ever watched world's deadliest addictions, which is a great show on lifetime, then you've seen pica. My name's Adele. I'm 30 years old. I'm from Bradenton, Florida. And my addiction is eating couch cushions. Oh, I love couch cushion the way it sits my mouth. It's soft and it's a good taste. The darker cushion, the yellow cushion that tastes better. It just has a stronger flavor. Well, at least couch cushions don't have any calories, but this phenomena of eating when you're not hungry or secretly knowing that whatever the thing you desire is, isn't actually going to fulfill you, is mentioned in tons of world religions. And I've heard lots of different examples of it. A few of my favorites are, two of them come from the Hare Krishna's. One of them is, imagine if you were addicted to heroin and you got amnesia, so that you didn't know that you were addicted to heroin. You had no idea, but you had the exact same desire for something, your body was physically addicted to something, but you didn't know it was heroin. So you would probably try to eat tons of stuff or just do anything to make the withdrawals go away. And so they would compare that to Krishna. They would say that we're all born into this dimension being fully and completely in love with Krishna. But because of our karma, we've taken human birth and we don't remember that we're in love with Krishna. And so that love gets transferred to the things of the world. So whatever it is that you love, game of thrones, eating couch cushions, heroin is actually a kind of diffused love of God being turned in the direction of the material universe. And I think that's super cool because it addresses something that I've always thought, which is that addicts have a wholly mystical quality to them. They remind me of saints in a certain way because they have this complete devotion to whatever the chemical or food or activity is that they happen to be addicted to. It's very similar. It's just that the thing that they're addicted to is killing them, whereas if you could transfer the addiction to whatever you wanna call it, God, Krishna, love, the present moment, then instead of having shits that look like a couch or track marks, you get that beautiful glow that you see from time to time in people who have a spiritual practice. Then another example I've heard, this too from the Hare Krishna's, is imagine a dog with no teeth in some village far away and the dog is starving and it finds a dry bone and begins chewing on this dry bone and it's cutting its gums and so its gums start bleeding and the dog is drinking its own blood, thinking that there's meat on the bone. That's a pretty intense example of this very same thing which is that anything in the material universe that you think is satisfying you is actually an illusion. It's not really satisfying you. It's not permanently satisfying you. It's always a very fleeting form of satisfaction that's usually followed by more pain. One of the great examples of this is just smoking. Like if you're addicted to smoking, it's very similar to having poison ivy. When you get poison ivy, you get all these disgusting blisters all over wherever you touch the poison ivy and it feels so good to itch them. It feels so good, but the more you itch, the more it spreads, or at least it seems to spread, and the more you prolong the suffering. And then the final example that I know of for this kind of stuff, I'm sure there's many more, is in Tibetan Buddhism. And in Tibetan Buddhism, I'm just gonna read this from Wikipedia. It's called, they're called Preitas, or it's called The World of Hungry Ghost, and it's one of the six domains of the desire realm of Buddhism. So when you die, this is a place that you can go to, depending on your karma, and it says, in Tibetan Buddhism, hungry ghosts, Preitas, have their own realm depicted on the Bhava Chakra. This is this mandala that you could check out, just Google search it, and are represented as tear drop or paisley shaped with bloated stomachs and necks too thin to pass food, such that attempting to eat is also incredibly painful. Some are described as having mouths the size of a needle's eye, and a stomach the size of a mountain. This is a metaphor for people futilely attempting to fulfill their illusory physical desires. So that's another example of the identical phenomena, which is that whatever you think in the material universe is gonna take away that aching, itching desire, you secretly know it's not gonna do the trick. It won't work. It doesn't mean you shouldn't try. I actually heard there's something that Ram Dass says, and I don't know if this is, I haven't read this quote anymore, but I heard he said, sometimes you gotta drive the red sports car, which means sometimes you gotta give it a shot, you gotta try it, whatever the thing is, getting the big job, making a million dollars, becoming the king of the world, becoming the greatest emperor of the universe, whatever it is, but still ultimately you will be doomed to failure in these pursuits and endeavors, and the tragedy of it really in a certain way, and they talk about a kind of mournfulness, or a nostalgic feeling that can come over you when you start meditating regularly, and that feeling is you realize that all this time that you were running around on the hamster wheel of human life, trying to achieve so much in such a short amount of time, all the time that you thought getting to point, from point A to point B, was gonna take away that endless aching, secret sadness, really all you had to do was sit somewhere, anywhere, just find a place to sit down and follow your breath, and for once look straight into the eyes of the suffering that exists inside of you, and somehow through that process, you begin to experience all of the gratification that you thought would come from becoming some version of Donald Trump, or the most famous, wealthiest, beautiful, perfect person on earth. And so for a little while, I get it sometimes when I finally return to meditation, after all the terrible, long, tumultuous, dramatic, ridiculous periods in between when I have a meditation practice, there's always this sentimental feeling of why did I ever stop doing this? Because the truth of the matter is, how can you really enjoy eating an entire pecan pie if the whole time you're eating the pie, all you're thinking about is that the pie is going away, or you're thinking about how fat the pie is gonna make you? The cool thing about a meditation practice is that you train to get into the present moment. So if you decide to continue eating couch cushions or pecan pie, or pie made of couch cushions, then at least you're gonna be able to really enjoy it. At least you're gonna be able to really taste it and feel the way it goes into your mouth and the sweetness of the thing. That's the real tragedy here, is that while you're running on that hamster wheel, all you're thinking about is where you hope to go. When you finally get the big prize, when you finally get the great achievement, the medal, the trophy, the accolades, if you haven't taught yourself how to be in the moment, then more than likely all you're thinking about is either where you have to go after that or how the thing that you have is gonna go away. And so you never really get to enjoy it because the swimming pool of your mind is filled with all these turds that are the thoughts of the past or the present, or how nothing really lasts, or how now that you're where you're at, you're gonna get revenge on all the people who thought you couldn't get there, or some other madness that the mind has created to keep you from experiencing the sweetness of the present moment. And the other amazing aspect of all these teachings is that it points in the direction of a very attainable place, which isn't based on convincing a certain number of monkey descendants that you are worthy of some great thing or another.

Do you enjoy the Dunkin' Trustle Family Hour podcast? If so, there's lots of ways for you to support it. One of the main ways being, go through our Amazon portal located at Dunkin'Trustle.com the next time you intend to buy anything from Amazon. It's in the comments section of every single one of these episodes. All you gotta do is click through it and buy something. You know what I just bought from Amazon.com? I bought a ladybug self-defense key chain knife. I don't even know why I did it, to be honest. I was laying in bed with that itch, the hungry ghost itch, and I just felt like I wanted to buy something from Amazon. So I ended up going down this rabbit hole on the internet and found these like, they were like, I think they're called self-defense key chain knives. And so I don't even, I don't need one of these. And I mean, I live in Pasadena, unless a coyote breaks through the window and I happen to have my keys on me, I think I'm gonna be all right. But they're pretty cool, pretty sinister looking, shankin' knives. If you just want a cool knife on your key chain, just to show your friends that you've truly jumped the shark and are feeling supremely paranoid, probably a good sign you're eatin' too much marijuana if you get a self-defense key chain knife. But regardless, I bought one and it is pretty snazzy. I'm lookin' at it right now. Just go to the Amazon portal book market the next time you decide to pick up anything from Amazon. Remember, there's no need to leave your house anymore. That's the time period that we're living in. They actually have two hour delivery in Los Angeles, which means that if you run out of toilet paper, you can have a van in your driveway within two hours filled with hundreds and hundreds of rolls of toilet paper. And if you live in an area where there's earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, or the threat of ISIS or homeland terrorism, you should stock up on toilet paper because when it all goes down, nothing is worse than running out of toilet paper after the power grid fails. It's a nightmare. We also have brand new t-shirts in the shop. You can check that out by going to dunkintrustle.com and clicking on the shop section. And most importantly, in case you skipped over the song in the beginning of this podcast, and that really would hurt my feelings, I have a massive bus tour coming up thanks to the Sweeties at Squarespace. It's the, there are no drugs on this bus tour. And you can find everything you wanna find out about that tour, where I'm gonna be, tickets, et cetera, by going to dunkintrustle.com. All right, that's it. Let's dive into this podcast. Danielli Bilelli has a brand new book out that you should immediately order.

But before you do that, listen to this episode so you can truly understand what an amazing human being he is. Now everybody please, welcome to the Dunkin' Trussell family hour podcast, my dear friend, Danielli Bilelli. coffin. It's me, Dunkin' Trussell. Don't even go to teaspoon. Don't go, don't go don't go! It's me, Dunkin' Trussell. Don't even go to. Don't even go to. Don't even go to. It's me, Dunkin' Trussell, Deli Haola Nearly Done. Don't even go to. Don't even know if you can think that I'm the best. You don't have? How come Chun thank you so much if you enjoy the Project Wee TV. You won't be coming again? Come on now. That's 만 forgive me how it was com'on. Look at that. Sweet presence on this very rainy day in Los Angeles. My only complaint is that I don't get to gaze upon your beautiful face since we're on Skype. I mean, that's where we're at now, right? That's where we're at. We've gotten to the point in the history of Los Angeles where it's impossible to get from point A to point B, especially when it's raining. Like all the interstates. Somebody tweeted a picture of what the interstates look like. Everything is just red. People can't drive in the rain here. They don't know how they freak out. Yeah, it's painful, man. It's absolutely ridiculous. We need to invent a tele-transport where we can just press a button and I'm at your house without any traveling between. That would be the future of humanity. I think that's what virtual reality is gonna do probably. That's gonna be our version of teleportation and the concept of getting together in person with someone is gonna seem like this kind of retro, quaint, super intimate thing. Kind of like listening to records, right? Where you put on a record and it's like, what's that thing? Whoa, look at that. Yeah, exactly. Where you just sit and listen to music and read and all that insane stuff that the elders used to do prior to Instagram. Yeah, so 20th century. So you just finished your... So how many books have you written so far? Four. So this is your fourth book that you finished? Yep. Congratulations, man. What a huge accomplishment. Thank you, my man. And what's the title of this book? Not Afraid. And it's the subtitle is on... Let me see if I remember it actually. It's in Aldi Githard for you. So I have all the good info up. Of course, I Google Not Afraid and I'm getting the Eminem song Needless to Say because that seems slightly more popular than my book, surprisingly enough. I could not believe that. But yeah, it's Not Afraid and the subtitle is On Fear, Heartbreak, Raising a Baby Girl and Cage Fighting. Wow, so this is like an autobiography. Yeah, I mean, it kind of makes me sick to think it that way because, I mean, you're right, it is. It's just that when people say, I wrote a memoir, it sounds so pretentious and assolish that it makes me throw up. But at the same time, it is what it is, you know, it's... And sometimes the one thing I notice is that people tend to dig it a lot more when you say something personal that you have actually lived through as opposed when you are just purely waxing philosophically. So I felt like, okay, man, you know, just get over your stupid, ooh, it's a memoir, why this crap, you know, and just do it if it seemed like something people respond to better. I don't... It's so funny how the mind works because that person that you just fabricated probably doesn't exist. Like, I've never heard anyone say, ah, who does he think he is to write a memoir? But, you know, it's so weird because if you really consider it, you're the person in the universe looking at things like that. It's probably nobody else's, isn't that wild? I'm glad you wrote a memoir, it's cool. I wanna hear, you have such a fascinating life. You've had so many twists and turns that have happened to you. I'm sure I don't know all of them, but I don't think people are aware of just how colorful your life has been up until this point. I think what it is is the ego is always there ready to jump on things. So it's very easy to start looking at your own life and thinking you're hot shit. And so that's why, to me, the idea of a memoir was scary. It's probably because I know my ego too well and if I start paying over too much importance to it, it can grow to proportions that are not desirable. So that's what it was. But I think you're right, ultimately. You know, other people don't give a fuck. They want, if it's good, it's good and that's what they care about. I think that was my own hang up. But yeah, man. And I think in all the kind of way this book was born through your podcast because it's some of our early discussions. I noticed that whenever I brought up things that were more personal, when the discussion went in a more personal direction, people respond at 10 times as much. And when we're talking in more abstract philosophical terms, people dig it, but it's not quite the same. It's when you bring it to really just your heart and guts that people really get something out of it on a deeper level. One of the opening quotes is this Friedrich Nietzsche quote about, I only love what a man has written with his blood. Which I love that quote. It's brilliant because ultimately is, I don't want to hear some useless chatter. I want to hear something that comes straight from your guts. That's who you are. That's something you have lived on your skin, in your muscle and in everything else. And so that's in many, many ways. I got convinced to do this by doing the podcast with you. Man, that is so cool. And you're right. It's the stories. It's like the conjecture and the hypotheticals and the distant appraisal of the universe through some kind of logical lens. It can get so dry so quickly. I'm actually reading, or actually I stopped reading it, but I was checking out this book, The Perennial Philosophy by Aldous Huxley. And it's a, he's trying to assemble a version of religion, like the homogenized religion, or what do they all have in common? And it's a very intellectual book. And the thing that he's talking about is amazing. This idea that all over the world, various cultures have gathered together specific symbols that point in the direction of a transcendent phenomena that seems to be universally experienced by the mystics of the world, and then articulated and written down by their devotees. And some of their devotees achieve this heightened state of consciousness and others don't. It's amazing to think that, what the signposts are pointing to is mind-blowing, but Huxley, because he takes a very academic, safe approach to it, and I understand why he did it that way, he ends up unintentionally sucking out all the juiciness of the subject matter, and it just seems like a bag of dried leaves. So I do know what you mean about the necessity of personal stories, and also the fear that goes along with it, the kind of true sinking feeling in your stomach as you reveal some moment in your life that you've kept secret, or that makes you seem like a human. Which is what makes it exciting, what makes it powerful, and makes it relatable. I mean, I think about some of the episodes you have done that people have gotten most inspired from, they are all the ones where you just put yourself in the game, where it's not just over pleasantly chatting about something, but, and I think it makes sense. We want, it's one thing to hear somebody talking, it's one thing to hear somebody's put in their experience under the microscope with just pure radical honesty, words and all, not trying to hide anything, not trying to Disney fight, and making it sound cooler than it was, just being very, very real, which ultimately is what we do with podcasting to begin with, that's the strength of podcasting compared to other mediums, is the radical honesty that the medium requires. There was, there's a kind of unintentional violence that happens when a person portrays reality differently in the way reality is, and do you know, like so when a person has a public image as it's called, and that public image is this buttoned up, polished, kimped, sophisticated being, yet underneath that mask is a person who's tortured, maybe addicted to this thing or that thing, maybe beating their husband or wife, or maybe, you know, whatever, whatever it happens to be. And the moment you step across that boundary, and say, yeah, you know, I think I got a mild drinking problem, what ends up happening is all the people out there who've been hiding from that fact out of shame suddenly feel this sense of relief, because a person just come out and said it. So you do people such a great service by telling the truth, and coversely, by disguising yourself, I just think of like TV hosts or polished people that we see in the media or the old version of movie stars, and just think about how awful that being is in the sense that it creates an illusionary version of mental health. It's the equivalent of photoshopping women's photos and fashion magazines to give this unrealistic idea of what women look like. In the same way, these people give this unrealistic idea of like here is what a well put together adult looks like. And when you see me on camera, and when you see me in public, you're seeing the same person who's offstage. The classic example of this right now in the news, Bill fucking Cosby. Oh yeah, that's exactly the guy I was thinking of when you started this, yep, that's we're on the same wavelength. I mean, think about that. That guy was this put forth this image. Of the most family friendly, fatherly, conservative, grandfatherly patriarch who served as a kind of moral compass for all of the people lost in the insane immorality of popular culture. And all the time he was throwing that shit out there, he was putting fucking sleeping powder, theoretically putting sleeping powder into the model's drinks and fucking them while they slept. Yep. And I think there's something there about the people who, I mean, it's the classic stereotype, right? It's sort of the super hardcore Christian conservative bashes gay who's then doing methamphetamine with gay hookers kind of thing. You know, it's like the more you repress it who you are, the more you try to put up a front that's different from what you feel inside, the worse it gets. You're not just gonna stray a little from this ideal image of portrayed, you're just gonna go batshit crazy 150% the other side. And it's a dangerous game to play, this game of not being honest with who you are, not letting other people know who you are. And there's something, when you do it, it's so freeing because there's something when you are, hey, this is me, you like it, you like it, you don't like it, you don't like it, but you're not trying to sell yourself constantly. There's something really powerful about that and that's exactly the, you know, the other route is instead presenting an image and putting the sleeping pills into ladies drinks. That sort of the other is the most extreme example of this mentality. I'm sure most people who engage in these kinds of things don't go that far, but ultimately, that's the logic is I am something, but I'm gonna show something completely different and by doing that, well, I might as well go all out at that point. I might as well, my Dr. Jekyll Mr. Hyde game grows so wild that it's downright scary when you actually get to see what it is. This is really cool talking about this because the retreat that I just went to, this, the theme of the thing was love everyone and tell the truth and which is the two, I guess, I don't wanna call it commandments because that sounds so Old Testament and austere, but Neem Kohli Baba, he gave Ram Dass's guru gave very little instruction about how to live and intentionally was like that and didn't, like people who wrote down what he was saying, like there's a story of someone had been writing down everything that he said and sort of creating this kind of gospel of what he was like and he had the person destroy it. He didn't want that shit, he didn't want people to be in the moment with him, not spending time with him, archiving or being a scribe, he wanted people to be there with him and so the instruction was, it's something I love thinking about is love everyone and tell the truth and it's the two together that's really important because I think a lot of times people will use telling the truth or this is who I am as a form of aggression, you know, you're not gonna fucking change me, this is who I am, like it or not, this is what I'm like. That is it, don't fucking, don't rock my boat bitch because this is me and if you can't deal with it, get the fuck out and that's a pretty rotten way to be even though that may be the way that you are, you're using it as a kind of aggression but when you have the core of telling the truth, the intention of love where you figure out a way to lovingly tell the truth so that when you're telling someone how you feel or what has happened or where you've been or what you've done or what you wanna do or whatever the confession or non confession is, inside of it is this core of love that you've cultivated through some kind of practice and when you do that, then when the truth comes to people it's not so radioactive, you know, people say that truth hurts but usually it's not that the truth hurts so much as the person telling the truth wanted to hurt you which I've experienced that before. Hmm. Yeah, I think it's, these are people who use the, this is how I am as an excuse to, it's still a shield, it's still, these are people who are not comfortable with who they are and so use it in this aggressive fashion as a weapon against somebody else, like you can't handle the truth kind of thing. Yes. Because the reality to me is that when you actually are comfortable with who you are, when you do accept yourself, words and all, then you don't have that edge, you're not so pissed off or angry, you're actually, if anything, a sweeter element comes up because it's like, hey man, I really just wish I could do it for you and if it's in within me, I'm more than happy to and if it's not, it's not, you know, but it's, let's not play a game with each other or I'm trying to deceive you by showing you what I know you like when the reality is something else. You know, that's something very different right there where there's a degree of honesty and that's beautiful. That's sweet even. How do you... Whereas kind of in your face, fuck you honesty is obviously aggressive and it comes from people who ultimately don't accept themselves for real. So, yeah, the in your face, fuck you kind of honesty is often based on an emotional state more than some truth inside that person. But how do you differentiate? Like think of times when the people that you love the most in your life, your daughter, your mom, whoever it may be, you go through periods with them where you don't feel particularly joyous around them. You're gonna feel annoyed or irritated or tired or whatever the thing is. And in that moment that your truth might be, I don't wanna be around you right now, you fucking asshole. You know what I mean? Right. So, is what you're advocating here or what you're talking about, is it to always give a voice to that kind of temporary state? And I think- No, I mean, one level is to oneself as well, is it does not mean that every single thing that goes through your mind, you have to throw it out there with no discrimination. Cause obviously, there is a place for aid, there's always a place for softening the message. You don't need to punch somebody in the face verbally to get your point across. You may say something about what your needs are at the moment that don't come from just a place of screw you, I want things my way. You can be diplomatic about it. You can still be true to what you're feeling, but without being an asshole. And I think that's important right there. And also, take a look, is it me saying exactly what I'm feeling right now? What's possibly hurting these other person's feelings? Or is it really that important to be 100% completely honest every second of the day? Well, many times, yes, many times, no. There are moments where it's just a passing feeling and it passes in like three minutes later, you feel differently. So, it does not mean that every single thing that pops up, you have to voice it, you know? If it's meaningful enough, if it stays there long enough, if it seems like you weigh long enough and you feel like, okay, this is real, there's something solid here, well, then we can talk about it. Then we can figure out how to approach it. But it does not mean just lack of, complete lack of self-control where you just decide, I'm just this human toilet where everything goes through and everything comes out of my mouth with no filter there, you know? Right, yeah. And it's an easy thing that when you start hearing this sort of thing to get confused and think that that's what this is about. But aside from the difficulty of telling the truth to other people, what about telling the truth to yourself? What about that terrible moment when you have to look, it's some way that you've been deluding yourself about this thing or that thing and cross over that chasm from the false to the real. Well, that's a pretty intense and terrifying moment. Yeah, that's one of the themes that actually does pop up in the book. Well, it actually shows up in many moments, but there's the one that I care the most about is where I've noticed with my daughter, like when you can safely say that I've had, because of everything that happened in my life, I do have a couple of anger issues, you may say. So there's always that, doesn't take much to set me off. I mean, I'm not gonna go crazy, I'm not gonna, but I raise my voice, I show some anger. And with a little kid, you cannot do that shit around them all the time. You can't be like, I would see like she's not as much now because she's older, but when she was two or three or she would throw a little tantrum or she would cry for no reason and suddenly I'm all pissed off and angry and then I see just fear in these little kids' eyes because she had just seen a monster and the monster is me. And I'm like, what the fuck? That's not who I wanna be. That's, I mean, I understand that's what I'm feeling right now because I'm frustrated, I haven't slept, I'm tired, I'm whatever the hell, but that does not justify me just unleashing all my frustration and all my bullshit on some poor child that just racked up. It doesn't mean if it's honest or not, it's still fucked up. Like at this point is, yeah, this is where I'm at and I should recognize it, but I should also take some steps to change it because that's just not a cool way to live. I don't wanna live that way. I don't wanna be that person, you know? And that person, I've noticed that my, when I get really fucking angry, 90% of the time, the anger is not justified anger, but it's based on the idea that some state that is happening temporarily will continue forever. And so the anger comes because I think if I don't do something about this now for the rest of my life, I'll be experiencing this bullshit. So I gotta fight. But the truth of the matter is most of the time, whatever the situation that you're in happens to be, it's temporary, it's not gonna last. You're not, generally, you're not in prison. You're not stuck. Generally, whoever you're around who's being an asshole, they won't be an asshole in two days. They'll be back to normal. And when you start realizing that, then it becomes a game of holding your tongue and just waiting, and things do tend to get better. I'm not talking about like ignoring or denial or, but it is, when you really look at most anger issues, at least for me, I don't know if it's the same for you. Usually it's you think this situation is permanent, and it's not, and that feeling of permanence is what makes so much suffering happen. Yeah, absolutely, because you think that, and that's one of the weird ways in which our minds work. Sometime we get stuck in this mindset where we think the bad stuff has always been this way and will last forever, and the good stuff, when it's there, we just take it for granted, say, oh, yeah, of course, it's great, but, you know, and, but the next time the bad stuff comes up, you feel like it's like all the time in between the last bad moment you have, and this one has just been erased, has disappeared, and like you don't even feel that that's what, like you don't even remember that there was all this enormous stretch of good time. You think like there was a continuous line from the last bad moment when you were in this emotion to this one with nothing in between, and it's bullshit. It's an illusion. That's fascinating. Well, I mean, is it an illusion? I mean, in some way, if you wanna get creepy about it, if you look at this, just to bring Nietzsche back up, his idea that everything in life repeats, what is that called? The eternal return. Yes, eternal return. So it's the idea that every single moment that happens will eternally happen. And deja vu's are actually a kind of mouth. I don't think Nietzsche talked about deja vu's, but you could apply it to this concept. So whenever you have this feeling like, shit, I've been here before, it's because you have a billion trillions, quadzillion times, because your life is one track on your iTunes, and it just keeps repeating forever. And so, from that POV, or I guess you'd call it a thought experiment, or maybe not. I mean, if you think of time as a, if you think that events happening in the universe, kind of like tunnels running through the sands of eternity, like an ant tunnel, then that tunnel of phenomena and action and experience really will stay there forever. It's encoded into the matrix of time eternally. And so, does it repeat? Who the fuck knows? But anyway, the idea that when you are in a shitty state, and you get to another shitty state, and all the places in between suddenly evaporate, and there's just these shitty states, you could say in those moments you have entered into the hell realm. You could say that in those moments you have moved into the place that is talked about by all the mystics and all the fundamentalists. You're literally in hell, you know? And it would make sense that that vibratory frequency connects to all the other frequencies in time. And so, I guess it would also make sense that once you're in hell, Christ, how do you keep your head when you're in hell? How do you maintain logic? How do you, when you are in those states, Bolely, tell us the next time we find ourselves gnashing our teeth and hissing at some temporary event in our lives or clutching our fingernails into our palms and rage, what do you do to get back to the main line? What do you do to escape from the hell of anger? I love the way you frame it. I think it's really important for anybody to make friends with hell, to figure out how to make yourself comfortable in the most uncomfortable places in the world. It's something that, you had Tate Fletcher on your show, didn't you at some point? Yeah, Tate is great, he talks about it a lot. He's about this idea of just seeking discomfort, seeking those experiences that are less than pleasant, because ultimately those experiences, at some point will happen, whether you like it or not, and by instead going consciously into them, seeking them, trying to learn from them, you can figure out ways to, the next time they catch you, not to be caught unprepared. So for me, for example, like one of the things that I chat about in the book is, one of my yearly experiences of fear has been, like I've always been terrified of fighting. To me, I don't like conflict, I don't like the idea of some dude taking me down, sitting on my chest and just punching the hell out of me. Weird, because everyone loves that, that's so odd. It's physically uncomfortable, but also psychologically, it's like, it's the ultimate ego nightmare, right? It's the, you're back in fourth grade with the bully in the play art kind of thing, you know? And it's the most, nobody would like that, it sucks, it's horrible, and in combat sports, you're not just losing a ball game, you are, you have somebody physically dominate you, it's not a particularly pleasant experience. So the normal reaction is, I wanna flee from here, this sucks, get me home already, I don't want to fight this opponent, give me somebody easier, give me, that kind of thing. And instead, because to me, that's where martial arts really become important, this become like almost a spiritual practice, is not when everything is going well, now when you learn the cool technique, I mean, that's fun and all, but when things are not going your way, when you are getting your ass kicked, when there's no way in hell that you're gonna beat this guy, because it's stronger, better, faster, has better technique, you know, they're just, you are in the middle of it, and it's not over yet. So when your mind is begging you, let's get the hell out of here, when you embrace your defeat, so to speak, when you embrace where you're at, when you find whatever the weird thing is in you that makes you keep fighting in the face of a completely hopeless situation, where there's really no chance you're gonna turn it around and win, and yet you keep fighting, something really weird happens, because you become comfortable, well, I don't know about comfortable, you become okay, you feel at home in the shittiest situation possible in a combat sport, and I think that then transcend to daily life. You know, the perfect arm bar is not gonna help you much in daily life unless you get into lots of fight. The perfect left hook is not gonna help you. This ability to stay with it when all hell is breaking loose around you, that is the most important thing that you can take away from martial arts in today's life, at least in my experience. And it's interesting you use the term at home, that, and I think that's a really great way to put it, because it implies that home is not some geographic, doesn't have a geographic identity, but what you're talking about is what I've heard a million times in a lot of different beautiful ways, which is that home is a frequency that you can tune into, and then this frequency, or this specific locale does not exist in time and space. It is unperturbed by anything that happens in the world. It is completely unaffected, it has, it doesn't degrade, it doesn't rot, it's always there for you. And martial arts being a spiritual practice teaches you how to access that place through conflict, because what better way to realize that, you know, than through some massive, I mean, what a paradoxical thing to feel as though you're at home while someone is beating the shit out of you, you know? And not like home as though you have an abusive father, but the home is like safety, home of not safety like airport safety, but home in the sense of being completely embraced in a situation where exactly who you are is perfect. I think that's exactly what my all-time idol, Zen monk from the 1400s, E.Q. Sojun, I believe that's what he meant when he said, throw me into hell and I'll find a way to enjoy it. I mean, it's obviously paradoxical because yeah, good luck enjoying hell. That's, you know, you're picturing the worst things in the world, are you gonna enjoy it unless you are a weird masochist? But I think that's what he means. Not literally like, yes, I'm really looking forward to hell. This is gonna be so much fun, but more as in, hey, throw me in the worst possible situation. I'm not gonna be able to change the outcome, but I'm gonna find some way to stay with it and not being just, ah, I need to get out of here. Oh, this is horrible. Oh, this, no, this is a lot easier said than done, which is why for me, martial arts has been an interesting practice because it's kind of like going back to that same battle over and over again, but it's also an extremely useful practice for me. It has helped me tremendously. And I think this is the, I saw, you know, this sounds so cheesy, but I was watching Oprah Winfrey interview, Tick-Not Han, and she was in the very beginning of the interview, she's sitting across from this guy. Tick-Not Han is, you probably know what he is, is a Zen Buddhist, I believe he's a Zen, and written a lot of great books, pieces every step, lots of great books. I only remember the name of that one, but I've read a few, but people talk about Tick-Not Han when they describe him. One of the descriptions they use is when he, his presence is like being around a mountain because he's so focused and grounded and at peace. So Oprah's commenting on, you know, just like the vibe he's putting out, and she asked him, do you, you must find yourself in situations where you get perturbed and how do you deal with that? Like what do you do? Do you, or do you like this all the time? I think it's something ridiculous like that. And he said, in those moments I go to my breath, you know, he goes, this is why I have a practice, because in those moments I go into my breath and try to become more fully into the present moment. What's happening? And that's why a practice is so important. And I think that's why universally from every single camp, whether it's martial arts or Buddhism or Judaism or Christianity, you name it, every single one of them advises some kind of daily discipline so that you can learn how to access that place called home, no matter what's happening. Absolutely. And that's where, you know, whatever exercise, whatever practice, whatever, whatever helps you to remember that state of being you, being at home inside who you are, even when outside nasty things are happening. You know, whatever gets you there, use it. You know, I have zero, I don't care what method the people use, as long as it works for you, that's really the only thing that matters. If it works, it's the right thing, you know? And to me, the way I see it is a constant battle, because in my mind and in my experience, you never get to a place where you have it and you never run the risk of losing it again. It's just that you become good at riding in the bull, so to speak, you know. There was a martial artist by the name of Morihei Ueshiba who people commented at, oh man, you have this amazing balance. It's like you never lose balance. And he said, quite the opposite. I'm actually, I'm losing balance all the time. It's just that I regain it so quick that you never see me having lost it in the first place. But I constantly get in thrown off balance. It's just that I roll with it and I regain it, which is, to me, that's what living is in some ways. You're never gonna come to a place where things don't affect you anymore. I mean, by that point, you're dead. You know, we are affected by things around us. The trick is how do we surf with it? How do we regain that balance as that giant push is sending us flying one way? How do we manage to counterbalance it, going a little the other way and being able to stay with it? Well, this is, to me, one of the qualities of people who have had a lifetime practice is that they effortlessly convert whatever the energy is coming into them into something that not only helps them be in the moment and expand, but seems to help the people around them expand. And I've done weird experiments with folks like Jack Hornfield or people like Sharon Salzburg or folks I've gotten to interview where I'll try to pitch them some snowball made of darkness, you know? Just something coming from my own neurosis or fear, anger, whatever. And I'll toss it at them. And every single time, effortlessly, no hesitation, no gears turning, they just transform that into something beautiful and sweet and something that may not bullshit sweet either, but something that makes you grow a little bit. And that's the practice. And that's the discipline, that's the, I think that's one of the results of this is that you're not just helping yourself through this, but when all it takes is one calm person to prevent a disaster from happening. One person who isn't losing their shit can keep an entire room of people calm. And when you realize that, there's more to this idea of a daily practice than just you, but then from doing this kind of thing, whatever it may be, you're really helping your community too. You're helping your family, you're helping your life. It's, and you're making things more fucking interesting too. PS, I mean, what's more interesting when then that moment emerges that in the past you would have completely blown a fucking fuse, lost your shit, done something crazy, and you don't do anything. And the moment goes away and there's no drama where there used to be drama. Jesus, that's one of my favorite things. I agree completely. There was, I don't know if you ever met him. There's a guy who was a friend of Aubrey Marcos, Poranghi, he's a Brazilian musician. Yes. Really talented musician and sweet human beings. And that guy is such a good energy. I think it's kind of like the same thing that you're describing regarding Jack and some of the people you had on the podcast that Poranghi has this sweetness that's not bullshit sweetness, it's not weakness, it's real sweetness, but he's just, and he was at my house for a few days when he was visiting LA. And so I got to be around him for maybe three, four, five days in a row. And by the time he left, I remember when I would feel myself getting all worked up and pissed off and I would think of just this energy of how he would handle things. And he became inspiring for me. I was like, hey, why don't I go, if I admire that so much, why don't I just try to use that approach a little bit more? Why don't I, and it work. Somebody's example can really help you because it gives you a model for how to act in the world. And if somebody has it, if somebody's doing it, and as it is always a relative term, because I'm sure that on the right situation, they'll get pissed off and throw things at the wall, but if they have a higher percentage than you do of getting it the way you would like to, then they can serve you as a good model and they become kind of a mental teacher that way, a mental image of somebody who behaves the way you wish you could. And then if you put your attention there, it becomes easier to materialize it in reality. And so in that sense, you're right, every person who does that, whether it's once in their life or on a daily basis, can also serve as a teacher for somebody else. That's right, yeah, that's right. It's, and this is the, in Vaishnava Bhakti Yoga, one of the concepts that is stressed is one of the most important aspects of spiritual practice is association. Who are you hanging out with? And if you're hanging, try to make it a point to hang out with people who are attempting some form of practice, whatever it may be. The more you hang out with those people, because I know just hanging out with comedians, if I hang out with comedians enough, I'll get funnier. Like just being around super funny people will make me funny. It just happens. And I also know that being around negative, depressed, cynical, skeptical, angry, unhappy, miserable people, I will start becoming like that. I mean, I know that just if you get around certain people, you'll take on their, you can take on their vote, their vocal patterns a little bit. You can work everything's contagious. So it's so important to have at least one person in your life who has got a practice, somebody you can talk to or hang out with or just associate with just a little bit. Cause that's all you really need is just one person. You don't have to surround yourself with Benedictine monks or monastic Zen Buddhists. It doesn't mean you have to, you know, abandon all of your friends just because they're caught up in some temporary cycle of depression. That would be awful. But if you can add to your friends, just find some person. And it doesn't have to be some, oh, this is my teacher. It doesn't have to be like that. It doesn't have to be some formalized relationship, but just all you need is one. And cause you tune into that person, I do the same thing, man. Like if I, if I start getting really fucking pissed lately, I'll just think about like the satsang that I hang out with on these retreats, just this really sweet mishmash of people from all these varying traditions. And it calms me down instantly. Instantly. Now, big time. And I think there's, there's something to repetition. You know, if throughout the day you pick what it is that the mental image or that person or whatever that does it for you, that helps you get in touch with that state of consciousness that you cherish, that you want to be able to embody. And you try to not just say, oh, yeah, yeah, sure. I know that. Yeah, it's important. It's great. No, no, it's not a thought. It's a practice. So you have to go back to it multiple times a day. Doesn't have to be, again, as you say, a formal thing. It doesn't mean you need to get cross-legged under. It can just be take 10 seconds to put the mental image back in there. And it becomes so much easier if you do that regularly. Like I noticed lately when I started every morning, I'll chat with my daughter for like 30 seconds about how I want to be that day with her and how I would like her to be with. And we kind of make a deal because basically, you know, you don't want me to get mad. I would like you to listen to me. Let's figure out. And we picture kind of the way all the good days we've had. And now we want to manifest that again on this particular day. And so now we have a mental image to start the day of how it can be. And it sounds so childish and simple. And yet it makes such a huge difference. And it helps me so much to actually go that route. It's unbelievable. I mean, when I do it and I don't do it regularly, God damn it. But anytime I do do it, and it really is, I think when people think about this shit, they think, yeah, I just don't have time to spend an hour, 30 minutes every day doing this bullshit. Man, I'm trying to maximize my sleeping time before I have to go to fucking work or go to school or whatever. And I'm not going to do this shit. But it really is, it's a pause. It can be just a fucking pause. Even before you eat, just a little pause of like, I got food, this is good. You know, just something like that. As simple as that, it can start a pattern that grows inside of you, and it's real. You know, I think another important thing to note in discussions of this matter are that results are not instantaneous. That I've noticed that when I get sick or I hurt myself physically, I never get better as fast as I would like to get better. Like when I get a cold, I want to get over that cold way before the cold is done. And then if the cold doesn't go away, as quickly as I'd like, I start getting nervous. Like shit, man, I hope I'm okay, I hope this isn't a flu, or fuck, what could this be? Then my mind starts going crazy, but if you just let it go, it'll go away on its own. I think the true progress is never as fast as you'd like it to be. So the kind of, the growth that happens with these kinds of practices is at first just as slow as getting in shape physically. If not slower, but then over time, even an intermittent practice, even the intention of wanting to have a practice, over time, you'll start noticing changes, right? You start seeing these profoundly simple shifts in your normal operating pattern. And I think that's one of the greatest things that can happen to a person. Absolutely, and it's not only, I mean, as you say, definitely it's a long road, actually it's a life long road. It's a road that you never get fully through or you master 100%. But at the same time, just like working out, when you start working out, it doesn't need to be that six years later when you have the body of a Greek god, suddenly you feel good. There are moments when in your first week of working out after you get over the soreness, then it feels good. And your body, you haven't changed dramatically who you are. You haven't changed how you look, or how strong or healthy your body is. But you can get an instant benefit, a taste of what it's like to live in a body that's moving in the direction of health. And so I think it's important to remember that the reward is not just after, okay, 10 years down the road, after lots and lots and lots of practice, you'll see the results. That's when it gets deeper and deeper and deeper, but some superficial taste of it all. You can get pretty much right away. In this moving in the direction of health that you're talking about, whether it's spiritual health, physical health, this, I like to oversimplify this and think that at any given moment, all over the planet, there are people who are moving in the direction of health, moving in the direction of open-heartedness, moving in the direction of being more compassionate, moving in the direction of balance, and then there's people who are actively moving in the other direction. There's people who are, and also, attempting to disrupt other people's progression in the direction of love and happiness. Actively, it's true. So when you look at it that way, then just as a form of thought experiment, you've created two sides in an eternal battle that has been raging as long as there have been human beings, which is the amount of people who at any given moment are abusing themselves, abusing other people, disrupting their families, disrupting their lives, physically trying to kill themselves, and all the people who are sitting down with their kids and being like, all right, all right, let's see if we can tune into this frequency of love today. Let's see if we can do it. Can we do it? Let's try. We'll just try. We'll try. And so this is where I think the term jihad becomes incredibly useful. Because when you consider the fact that just that first step you take in the direction of balance, love, health, whatever you wanna call it, God, if you wanna get spiritual or mystical or theistic, the moment you take that step, you have joined forces with an ocean of humans who are all on your side, who all want, who are all involved in the same project in different ways. And it's an invisible army, but they're out there. And I think you could take some comfort in that. Any given time that you're like, to fucking tomorrow, man, I finally signed up with my goddamn trainer again. I totally fell off the working out wagon. I hurt myself, used that as an excuse to not exercise, gained a bunch of goddamn weight, and now I gotta go through the whole fucking thing again. Right? The whole fucking thing. I gotta go meet with him. He's gonna look at me like, what the fuck happened? And I've gotta go through the whole goddamn thing again. But I take comfort in knowing that when I drive down there to do this shit, and when I go and meet with him, I am one of millions of other fatties who are all making that decision that, God damn it, today I'm gonna overcome this fucking entropy. And you know what I mean? I think there's something that, I take a lot of comfort in that, knowing that I've become part of this invisible army of people who, even though we may fail, even though tomorrow night, there's a high probability that I'm gonna have a fucking thick crust of gluten laden cheese pizza being shoved into my mouth by my traitorous hand. At least I'm trying, man. You know? I think that's all that matters. I love it. I love it. No, you're right. You're absolutely right. Cause that's all you can ask for yourself. You know, you can't expect perfection. You can't expect to be always delivering the results you wish. But the one thing you can is just try again. Just get back on your feet and you got knocked down and you get back down your feet. I think sometimes, for me in martial arts, I notice like whenever I obsess about outcome, that's when fear and worries and bad feelings increase. It's like, what if I don't deliver the way I was, what did I don't perform the way I wanted to? What if I don't win? What if I don't, you know, that kind of thing? Whenever instead I forget about outcome and I focus on effort, on just going in and you know, collapse before you give up. Just give everything you got. I don't give a fuck how it's gonna turn out. That's out of your hands to some degree. You know, there's no full way to ensure. But what you can ensure is effort. It's just put your heart and guts into it. Then it becomes so much, it takes away a lot of stress. It takes away a lot of that fear of not living up to expectations of what you wish you were. Because those expectations are based on usually measurable results, whereas effort is something else entirely. And the more I do that, then the easier it is to get the results I want. And then when I don't, it's not as crushing because my whole sense of self wasn't wrapped up in the outcome. Right, yeah. And you know, results are fantastic. Sure. And a great reward. But you know, this is one of my favorite Sharon Salzburg quotes, the healing is in the return. It's the practice is great. The regular daily meditation practice. My God, if the universe has graced you with this, you're so lucky. The Greek God five years into working out, fuck, what a hero. It's amazing you've done it. But what's equally amazing is the moment that you push yourself out of your entropy and try one more time to pick up your bow and dive back into this incredible jihad that is at this very moment raging all over this planet. And man, it's glorious. It's glorious to do it. Just that by itself is incredible. And if you die on the field of battle, if you fail in this endeavor, you're still a million times better than someone who never tried it at all. It's cliche, but it's true. Absolutely. When I think about in the context of like mixed martial arts, the hero moments, the ones that truly inspire me, they are rarely the guys who's winning in dominating fashion. They are usually somebody who's losing the fight. Who's gonna lose the fight at the end. It's not that he's losing the fight and he comes back to rally up and win. He's losing the fight and yet just show this crazy insane bravery and keep going forward in the face of defeat. That to me is just, that's what a hero is. Cause you know, everybody can go forward if they think that they can win. But what about the guy who keeps going forward in the face of near certain defeat? That to me is where it's some real magic is taking place there. I agree a hundred percent, man. That's it. That is where the rubber hits the road. It's like fucking winning, okay, whatever. It's garish. I want you to win, great. Like it's cool, but it's also a kind of embarrassing display. Like when someone's on someone's shoulders, their arms in the air, the metal or the belt or whatever the fucking primitive symbol of victory is draped upon their heroic arms and the crowd is screaming and it's a moment of true and pure absolute glory. That is fantastic. But what you'll never see is that first moment. The 60 year old or the 70 year old lady with osteoporosis puts on her running shoes and her sweatpants and walks outside for the first time in a week and walks around the block. And what a victory that is. What an incredible victory that is. You'll never see that. You'll never see and all those moments of victory are happening at every second all around the planet. At every second, just that moment. Because man, what joy is that? When you've pushed back the tentacles of laziness and the tentacles of fogginess and the tentacles of fear, just push them down and you go back out there again. Ugh, it's beautiful. And it's a battle that every single one of us is waging every day, whether we're conscious of it or not, whether we're entering it, aware that that's what's going on or not. It is what's happening every single day to every single person who's alive. Well, that being said, I'm gonna go play Fallout 4 and drink champagne. Damn. It's happened awesome. I wish I could join you right now. Mr. Bilelli, this has been incredibly inspirational. My heart is pounding. I feel excited and terrified. I can think of five things that I've been putting off that I am now going to do. I owe it to you, my friend. You are a true teacher. Thank you for being on the show. Tell me how people can find your book, how people can find you, et cetera. If I, I'm gonna go into it right away, but if I may, I was just thinking the same thing, like halfway through this discussion, I was like, man, I feel better than I did before. Not that I was having a bad day. I was having a good day, but I'm like just chatting with you and tossing these ideas and putting the focus on them and really letting that stuff sink in is making me feel better about life. He's making me feel like, oh, shit, I'm gonna have a good day today. This is not gonna be just an okay day. I'm gonna make it, so it's, I love it though. It's a mutual thing. I walk out of this conversation feeling more empowered than I was an hour ago. That's great, man. That's cool. Thank you, thank you, my man. But yeah, about all the good stuff. My name, DanielaBolelli.com. That's the gateway to everything else, to all the tweeters and the podcasts and the history on fire podcast, Drunk and Taoist, new books, the not afraid book that came out, all of the good stuff. Not afraid, by the way. Next time we see, I need to get you a copy. It's sitting there waiting for you. Great. But yeah, that would be the easiest way to then direct all the other stuff.

Hello, sweet friends. It is I, Duncan Trussell, and you are listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast. News break. Let's start this episode off with some serious bullshit that just got puked all over this country by the reptilians over there at the DEA. Actually, I think reptilian is too friendly a term for any group of people that would choose to keep marijuana out of the bloodstreams of their society. Reptilians, at least reptilians, the idea behind reptilians is there's some kind of intergalactic extraterrestrial super advanced species. At least they've got spaceships. The people over the DEA, they're sitting in their comfortable leather chairs, smoking cigars and reaping the benefit that comes from stealing the property of human beings that are growing or ingesting or having their possession, a substance that has been shown to be very beneficial for human beings on every single level, from treating PTSD to helping certain types of seizures to helping people who are dealing with the nausea and loss of appetite that comes from radiation therapy and chemotherapy, or as a creativity drug, or as something to amplify the experience of sex or eating food, or just something that's fun to inhale before you play video games. Here's the article. The Drug Enforcement Administration has denied two petitions to reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug. Marijuana will remain a schedule one drug, the most restrictive category under federal drug control laws. Schedule two drugs include Ritalin, Adderall, and Oxycodone, among other drugs. So the DEA is telling us that marijuana is as dangerous as heroin, oxycodone, Ritalin, and Adderall. That's what they want us to accept. A group of armed men and women, a group of people who have imbued upon them the power to confiscate the property of people who have certain substances in their possession, a group of people who have destroyed the lives of countless human beings, a group of people who can pull up in front of your house, in militarized vehicles, kick down your door, shoot your dog, maybe even your cat, depending on how big it is or what kind of mood they happen to be in, and take all your stuff, rip your kids away from you, put handcuffs on you, and take you to a federal dungeon where they can take away years and years and years of your life for having in your possession a substance that is absolutely harmless and grows from the sweet soil of our beautiful planet earth. These people with that level of power want us to accept their assessment of a drug that is being shown again and again and again to be incredibly beneficial. This brings to mind a Ray Kurzweil quote that I keep thinking of, which is that things aren't getting worse, information is getting better. In the old days prior to the internet, if some federal agency spit out some nonsense about this substance or that substance, you kind of just had to accept it because you didn't have the ability to instantly connect to a network of information and to determine whether or not the statement by the federal government was accurate or not. But now we know you just have to do a quick Google search to find all the data and research you need or maybe you could, God forbid, use your own personal experience as a way to determine what is real and what is not real. Either way, with just a very small amount of exploration into this topic, you will quickly discover that marijuana is certainly not as dangerous as oxycodone. Now you might want to decide for yourself what makes the thing dangerous, maybe how many people have died consuming the thing. I think that's a pretty good watermark of danger. There's some other things you could look at too, but let's just say how many people have died from consuming the thing. You do the Google search. I'm not going to do it. You do the Google search. Look up how many people have overdosed on oxycodone in the last year versus how many people have died from marijuana overdoses in the last year. Then go back and look at the DEA's classification of marijuana as something more dangerous than oxycodone and gaze upon one of the horsemen of the apocalypse. Things aren't getting worse. Information is getting better. Here's what's going on, because information is getting better and because now we don't have the sweet, sacred denial offered to us by the government. In other words, we can't stick our fucking heads in the sands of delusion and pretend that marijuana is dangerous as heroin or oxycodone because we know that the research is out there to show us that it certainly isn't. That means that we're forced into two forms of action when the federal government does things like this. We have to take action. One action that you can take is complacency. That's what you can do because you know that marijuana is certainly not as dangerous as heroin because you know that marijuana is certainly not as dangerous as oxycodone, and yet the DEA has decided to classify it as being that dangerous and to continue to enforce it as though it were that dangerous, which means that they can continue to take people's homes, take people's cars, take people's children, and destroy people's lives for a drug that is definitely not harmful, at least not on the level that they're claiming that it is. You have to become complacent in the same way in North Korea, people who know that Kim Jong-un wasn't brought down to some beautiful snowy peak on the back of a dragon that he doesn't shit rose petals and piss diamonds in the same way that people there know that, but they have to say that he does because if they don't, they're going to get taken to a fucking labor camp in the same way now. In this country, you have to become complacent. That's your one choice that you have. You become complacent. You just sit back and think, well, those folks over at the DEA, I guess they've got our, they know something I don't know. I guess that they've got our best interests at heart. That's the federal government. I'm just going to trust my government. You get to do that. You get to, even though the data isn't out there, you get to live a life where you complacently accept what the federal government tells you is right and what the federal government tells you is wrong and pretend that they must know more than you do, even though you know that's not the truth. So complacency. That's one option that we have here. Just sit back and do nothing. The second option you have is rebellion. There's no, there's nothing in between. There's nothing in between. Now that we have true data on the health benefits of marijuana, now that it's all out there for us to see in plain view, now that we know that this is not a substance as dangerous as oxycodone, if the DEA is saying that it is, then we know that the DEA is full of shit. We know that the DEA is making decisions that aren't based on the health of the people, but based on the DEA making money from confiscating people's property and from whatever they may be getting from lobbyists, from big pharma who want to keep marijuana illegal because they know that marijuana is a safe and economic alternative to the poisons that they're spitting out of their fucking factories into the bloodstreams of so many people who are in a lot of pain for various reasons and they go to a fucking doctor and the doctor prescribes to them oxycodone or Vicodin or the doctor prescribes to them some other maybe an SSRI, some antidepressant that they're going to get addicted to or maybe an anti-anxiety medication that they're going to get addicted to because there's no alternative because they can't prescribe marijuana even though they know that marijuana could function as a painkiller. It can function as something to help people sleep. It could function as a thing to help people combat alcoholism. It can function in so many different ways. A doctor knowing that cannot prescribe that because depending on what state they're in because the DEA has made the decision to classify the substance as a schedule one drug. So not only is the DEA going to increase their profit margin by keeping this a schedule one drug but the DEA is going to increase the level of suffering of the people living in this country who don't have access to a drug that can help them fight pain. I speak as someone who has experienced the positive benefits of marijuana not just as a creativity drug not just as a wonderful recreational drug but as someone who has gotten radiation therapy. Now if you've never gotten radiation therapy and I'm sorry I think we talk about this in the podcast but I'm obviously a little passionate about this topic so I think it's even worth saying it twice. When you get radiation therapy you feel like shit. You're getting radiation shot into your body and your body doesn't like radiation. You get tired, you get nauseated, you don't feel like eating, you feel sluggish, you feel like shit. Now when I was getting radiation therapy they prescribed a drug to me and maybe my brain has blocked it out. I can't remember the name of the drug. Some kind of trisza something zizzle. It sounds like the name of a demon you know. Zizzakatan or Bizzafidel. Some monstrous drug that you're supposed to take to combat the nausea associated with getting radiation therapy and what the drug does is it makes you fucking tired man. It knocks you out so here's how it works. You drive to go get radiation therapy. You get radiation shot into your body by the time you get home you're gonna you start feeling a little sick then you start wanting to throw up but you can't really throw up. It's like feeling car sick and so you take this pill that's prescribed to you that's supposed to battle the nausea but the way it's supposed to battle the nausea is by knocking your ass out until your next radiation treatment. That's the way it works. It sucks. So I don't know why it's really weird but I actually just was taking this pill instead of consuming marijuana to see if it helped with the nausea. I don't know why I did that. It's really weird so a few days I'm just taking this pill. I'm getting more and more depressed. I'm so tired. I feel so sick. I'm dreading going to get these radiation treatments and then Jean who was one of the guests on today's podcast from LA Speedweed very just for just just to be sweet came over to my house and gave me some marijuana in the hopes that it would help me combat this this nausea that I was having and so I tried it and what do you know it completely worked it worked like miraculously worked suddenly I was feeling better suddenly I could eat again suddenly I didn't feel sick now just think about that man and you know I was getting a relatively small dose of radiation compared to the amount of radiation treatments and chemotherapy that people are getting every single day just think about that here's a non-addictive substance a substance that is not physically addictive that can treat the nausea and loss of appetite that comes from cancer treatments and the DEA is keeping it away from the people can you think of a more demonic thing for a government organization to do can you outside of blowing up kids with drones outside of all the other stuff that the federal government does here and there can you think of something worse than keeping a set imagine if the DEA categorized penicillin as a schedule one drug imagine that if the DEA was keeping something that had that was an antibiotic away from the people imagine that that's what they're doing only in this case it's uh it's something that anyone I don't know how you make penicillin but marijuana is not only this incredibly beneficial substance but it's also something that anybody with a little with a little pot of soil and a little bit of a green thumb can grow in their homes for free all you need is some water and sunlight you don't have to go to some guy wearing a fucking weird white outfit in a hospital to write magic words on a piece of paper that then you take to some pharmacy enclosed in plexiglass because lunatic rednecks keep attacking it with shotguns and axes because they're trying to get the oxycodone that has to be kept in a bank vault somewhere in the pharmacy you don't have to do that with marijuana you can just grow it yourself and guess what some of the massive corporations involved in making money by selling things like oxycodone that make people permanently addicted to them and destroy people's lives they have a lot of money and they want to keep marijuana as a schedule one drug to force people to consume the poisons that they're putting out on a daily basis and the DEA has become their henchmen so the number one drug cartel the big pharma has is their enforcement arm has is their paid army the DEA who are continuing to support regulations that fly in the face of science and fly in the face of the personal experience and the will of the people and so this is a sad day and it's very upsetting to me because a human being's right to take drugs is a sacred right it's a human rights issue and something like this is uh is incredibly upsetting and I know it's just a speed bump I know it's just a temporary setback and the end of the ridiculous prohibition of marijuana but any setback any speed bump anything that gets in the way of getting a medicine to people who desperately need it is a horrible fucking thing for example my mom died of breast cancer and she was in a lot of pain she was in a lot of pain and she didn't like taking pain medication because it made her sick and so I came to visit her with uh some marijuana I had a marijuana tincture which I gave to her and she said this is the first time in months that I felt okay I gave it to my mom first time in months to get that substance to my mom I had to break the law I had to break the law to get a substance to my mom who was in pain from cancer I had to do things that could have landed me in a federal penitentiary to get a substance to my mother to help reduce her cancer pain that's what the DEA is doing the DEA is standing in the way of people trying to make their mothers who are dying of cancer hurt a little less that's what they're doing and we're paying for them so friends we have the information information's better information's better things aren't getting worse we know that we have two choices we can not be complacent can't just sit back and pretend that this is okay we've got to do things and there are things that you can do you and god forbid I'm sorry to say this but you got to talk about it are you somebody who consumes psychedelics or marijuana are you somebody who takes these substances because they help ease your pain they help your life in some way you've got to talk about it you've got to is the folks over at uh I believe the folks at maps are saying this and forgive me if they're not come out of the psychedelic closet let your voice be heard don't be afraid tell people about what has just happened and tell people that you take marijuana and it helps your life so that's my rant on the thing and of course you can write your government representatives and of course you've got to vote you've got to vote coming up in november in california for example on the ballot will be the legalization of marijuana you have to vote for the legalization of marijuana you have to go and do this and you have to talk about it you have to get the information to the people who have been brainwashed by the federal government into thinking that this substance is somehow dangerous you have to get the information to them that shows them that it isn't to shows them that it does not need to be classified as a schedule one drug shit like this has to encourage us in some way or another to fight harder to become stronger to really fight this thing because even if you're not a marijuana user this affects you this affects you because it's the federal government telling you that they decide what's healthy they decide what's a medicine and what isn't they decide what's a poison and what isn't a poison even if that thing that they have decided is a poison has been shown to be a medicine how is this any different from some orwellian i know it's a little bit i don't it's such a fucking hat cliche thing to compare this to the 1984 but when the federal government says marijuana is a schedule one drug they might as well be telling us that four is one that the number 33 is actually the number 12 and expect us to accept that we cannot you've got to talk about it go to the polls do whatever it takes to expose the DEA as being a corrupt organization to expose any of the people who are involved in whatever groups influence the DEA's decision to expose any of the scientists who are saying that marijuana is somehow a substance as dangerous as oxycodone to expose all of them as the frauds that they are to make them feel the the the shame that must be associated with trying to enforce and to force people into a reality tunnel that does not reflect what's actually happening in the world i'll just close this thing with a tiny little clip here's terence mackenna talking about drug legalization the the whole drug thing leave alone psychedelics the whole drug thing is properly understood as a civil rights issue i mean people should be able to take whatever drugs they damn well please in the same way that they should be able to express their sexual preferences in the same way that women should be allowed to vote uh people of low incidence of light reflectivity should be treated like everybody else and all these things which are perfectly obvious you cannot have a free society and regulate people's drug use any society which sets out to call itself free and democratic with the footnote that certain states of mind are forbidden is headed down the slippery slopes of totalitarianism there ain't no way this can be avoided so aside from our belief as a group in the wonderful healing uh and teaching potential of psychedelics even if psychedelic drugs didn't exist i would favor the legalization of old drugs because i just think that you cannot treat people as though they were infantile that's called paternalism that's the old dominator game we have to just admit you know that we're all in this together and that nobody has cornered the market on the truth for sure friends we're not going to do a commercial for this episode but if you feel even the slightest inclination to look into things that you could do to help reform marijuana laws do me a favor go to normal.org that's n o r m l dot org donate volunteer check out all the things on that site that you can do in whatever state you happen to be living in to fight back against this kind of nonsense also if you listen to this episode and you like today's guests then why not go to laspeedweed.com and if you have a marijuana prescription sign up for an account and they will deliver some wonderful high-grade plant medicines right to your door today's guests are two brilliant entrepreneurs and marijuana activists who run la speedweed which is uh la's number one delivery service they're literally putting their lives on the line so that people can have access to these very important plant medicines and as a sad preface i apologize for the weird sound quality this episode this is prior to my studio upgrade so it sounds a little tinny and the damn logic metronome invaded the beginning of the podcast i'm sorry so now everyone please blast volcanoes of sweet astral love in the direction of today's glorious guests a j and gino gentile you guys run the top marijuana delivery service in california correct and you have uh you've run into some trouble can you talk about it a little bit yes thanks for having us something i really appreciate it every time we come out here it's a great time and um really enjoy doing the show so you're right there is uh some trouble that's going on but it's not just for speedweed it is for the entire medical marijuana industry within california um and not in california specifically but la specifically which has laws that are that contradict the laws of the state so uh sooner or later they're going to have to get in line with each other but they're not in line currently and what that's doing is hurting the patients so what the city attorney would like to do for uh los angeles is shut down all of delivery so it doesn't matter what the dispensary or what delivery service all of it is illegal which is going to be in violation of state law eventually in 2018 new laws were passed by the governor last year uh that regulate marijuana and uh there was a carve out that um for los angeles that um had had los angeles had their own set of rules however as the rules progress they're going to be in they'll be controversial because they won't be in line with what the state laws are now hold on a second i interrupt sure all right i would i would have quizzed on me for a second right into the mic all right did can you hear me yes okay your question for you have you ever heard of zoning ordinance measure g uh no i have not okay have you ever heard of assembly bill 1266 nope have you ever heard of senate bill 675 no have you ever heard of ever heard of assembly bill 1575 that's the cleanup bill to 266 jesus christ you have it of course you have it because nobody ever pays attention to that kind of stuff right why would you follow a zoning ordinance or an assembly bill or any of that stuff right it's hard enough to keep track of what donald trump and hillary and bernie and everyone else is saying yeah keep track of your zoning ordinance right so that's the trouble and i put that in quotes that speed we just run into speed has been operating fully state legally since 2010 in 2013 los angeles passed a zoning ordinance called measure d that says this group of dispensaries is 135 of them yes that are designated pre ico yes again we're in the weeds these 135 dispensaries have legal protection everyone else is locked out of doing operating within the city limits right um so you've got this legal monopoly created by this zoning ordinance which happened to be written by an attorney who also happens to represent many of these dispensaries so there's sort of a little quid pro quo happening there which is oh fuck which is common in the city of los angeles and many big cities and that's kind of where we are today so deliveries in the city limits are not allowed by anybody not even the monopoly shops so the city attorney is saying if you want your medical marijuana and you're a citizen of la city you must go to one of our monopoly shops and that's that if you're blind it can't drive if you have no legs if you if you're a retired marine and you got blown up by an ied and you can't get to the shop too bad so sad find another way you cannot have marijuana delivered to your house even though the state says you're allowed to possess it the state says we're allowed to use the roads the state says you're allowed to do whatever you want in your home and on your property the city is saying no to that no to that and no to that so this is a civil rights issue this is a privacy rights issue this is a patient rights issue wow so this is essentially someone i mean not maybe you guys can't say this you probably can't say this but it sounds like there's some collusion going on between i'll say i'll say i'll say right right here at for a time in memorial there's collusion going on within the city because how can you allow a zoning ordinance that creates a monopoly to be written by the attorneys that represent those businesses in the monopoly that's crazy that's crazy how could so now the city attorney as much as i want to throw him under the bus and he deserves to be under there i remember this is a reelection year so um so pay close attention to who you're voting for who should we vote for we don't know yet um the city attorney of la his name is mike furr if mike furr publicly says that he supports patient access but it was the will of the voters to pass the zoning ordinance and as the city attorney it's his job to enforce it now to me that sounds like political doublespeak yeah you're the city attorney and there's this shitty law the shitty zoning ordinance that tramples on our rights and as the as the top law enforcement official in the city help us out as citizens and say this is a terrible law and we need to fix it now everybody in the state knows that this is a terrible law in la so when we travel we go to events throughout california especially up north where things are kind of settled and mellow yeah they understand this is a real industry they say what are you guys doing in la you that's the biggest market in the world for cannabis and you're messing up everything you're 10 years behind the laws and we just shrug our shoulders and say we're we're involved we're part of the process we talk to the politicians but they will not listen so this is politics and money this is not about protecting children or keeping weed away from parks and churches this is about keeping the dollars within the 100 well that's that let's go back to what you just said the idea of keeping weed away from parks and churches why why keep weed away from parks and churches those are perfect places to have weed in your system in fact those are two of my favorite places to be high sure of course and and and i understand that you're uh because of your job and and you guys have to be aware of all of this stuff that you just said which to many of us is very confusing very complicated to cut to the core of the issue it's that there shouldn't be any outside agency controlling the flow of a very ancient sacrament into the bloodstream of our species of course we should be able to control our own consciousness no matter what it is and that's that that's that to me is the dismaying shitty aspect of all this is that that hiding behind all this you know the idea that first of all i have to be a patient right i have to so now i have to fit into the role of someone who's sick if i want to take this thing which is historically is co-evolved with human beings his responsible for so much of our culture our mythology which is in every single religion of the world maybe that i'm aware of that every single for thousands of years they find they find cannabis in every part of the world and yet there's still some fucking asshole who what's his name the city attorney yeah that's mike pure there's a guy named mike purer who has placed himself in the position of modulating the flow of nature into the universe via this amazing drug that's where i go that's satanism if you ask me it's absolutely absurd but he will say it's the will of the voters you guys we put out this the zoning measure to keep dispensaries limited to keep them away from schools so if you want to limit dispensaries in your neighborhood i'm cool with that i don't want a lot of pot shops in my neighborhood i have a 15 year old i don't need him walking by there but you don't tell me why don't you want a 15 year old to walk by a pot shop it depends on the pot shop it's the typical la dispensary especially the ones inside this monopoly they're sketchy there's there's an armed guard out front you got a bus through three doors it's a sketchy looking operation now i've been to some in other parts of california that look like a spa they're awesome maybe totally fine for my for my teenager walk by totally cool but most of the la dispensaries no thank you right but let me get into my home yeah right well but see this is the thing it's like so what ends up happening you create a prohibition and anytime there's a repression of a natural drive then their corruption ends up happening right so which is why like you know a lot of porn when you look at porn a lot of it just has this feeling like man this is fucking this is kind of like dark it's got a heavy feeling if you go into uh some gun stores i don't know if you guys ever got in a gun store in l.a some of them are creepy man like they've got a real creepy vibe in there and and a darkness there's like a shadowy quality to it so when even on all of all of these places they have that shadow not because of the thing that's being dispensed is innately good or evil but because there's a sense of having to overcome an unnatural repression against something that shouldn't be repressed so this is the real problem to me is these bastards in their imaginary quest to um in their imaginary quest to somehow make our children safe what they end up doing is creating these festering sores all over the city which are these shops where the people running them are or have been or they act like criminals and they have to and because the thing marijuana itself has been transformed into some kind of evil product of nature when it isn't everyone involved in any kind of regulation around it has accidentally become part of an unintentional or intentional conspiracy to make nature seem like it can be flawed that human you know what i'm saying it's like this is the classic human attempt to place humanity over nature is what we're talking about so every single person involved in any kind of regulation against marijuana can you imagine if somebody tried to regulate wildflowers if somebody was like we got to get these fucking daisies out of the parks because when people see a daisy it makes them feel like there's something more important than money or something like that it's like that man what the fuck this to me i'm sorry i'm going off on a really tangential hippie rant and i'm taking away your time to talk more about this that's okay because what you're saying is it's right along our philosophy as well um one of the one of the things i wanted to touch on um from what you said before uh about having to fit into the mold of being a patient yes um you know my argument is always that regardless of who you are if you are using marijuana you are a patient because even if you don't uh if you're not treating yourself for something you know heavy like cancer if you're getting mood regulation you are a patient right so so most people who are smoking marijuana don't really realize that they are a patient because they think they're smoking getting high or smoking and getting creative or or something along those lines well that's mood regulation that that the pharmaceutical industry is making billions of dollars off of by giving people purposets and well-butchered and and all sorts of mood regulating drugs when marijuana essentially is that um is that mood regulator for millions of people so regardless of if you have a doctor saying you need medical marijuana for what is ailing you if you're just using medical marijuana you are getting that mood regulation which um of course to me is makes everyone a patient so when i was young um and started smoking marijuana i saw what i was smoking just to get high not realizing that it became part of my whole entire life as my mood regulator right um and and what again it wasn't until i got um uh excuse me into my 20s that i started thinking of it this way and realizing that um you know by by my late 20s that this is what it was doing for me um i have uh in in our family we have um plenty plenty of family members who have tried different mood regulating drugs and so i realized just in my genetics i probably would be on one of those if i wasn't a daily cannabis user so for me um for for me i feel like the mood regulation of it makes everyone a patient are you guys familiar with the term exo pheromone you ever heard this term terrence mckenna talks about it you know this term i don't tell me so so the idea is that uh the way that plants interact with each other interact with an outside world despite putting out these chemical chemical scents regulators the chemicals that draw bees to them chemicals that make birds carry their seeds chemicals that just that's the language of the vegetable kingdom sure is that of the chemical release right so the idea is that thc the cannabinoids are an exo pheromone being produced by mother earth and because she wants to have a conversation with these super advanced monkeys that are building skyscrapers all over and so when you get into the concept of and i do appreciate marijuana as a medication it is a very powerful medicine that treats a variety of ailments and i i as someone who's had radiation therapy and i can remember they gave me these fucking pills man for the nausea not even know i didn't do it man but i was taking these pills i think i was just so freaked out because i was getting radiation therapy i was just taking these pills doing what the doctor said and i had some speed weed laying around the house you brought me some right but i didn't take it for some reason i don't even know why it's so weird even though everyone's like oh this will help nausea all of nausea all of nausea i don't know why i didn't try but then suddenly i'm like man i can't take these pills anymore they're the pills mixed in with the radiation therapy you're in bed all day you can barely move that the way that they treat the nausea is by making you knocking you out that's how they sound like fucking i'm gonna you know get high and see what happens so suddenly in this fucked up probably one of the most fucked up months of my life nausea is gone just gone i just feel a little bit more like myself again oh god what a relief so man i know this is a medicine and i know that it is one of the most powerful compassionate incredible substances that we have access to on the planet but it's not just a medicine it's a language it's a communication coming to us from nature and so when you get these people who access i think many of them are well intended i don't think they really i don't think they realize what they're doing but it's a form of censorship and what an awful form of censorship because it's not as though you're censoring books it's not as though you're censoring movies you're censoring the language of nature as it attempts to communicate to humans and that is one of the most devastating things that you can do because nature usually what it tells us is what's really important in life you know and that's where things get sinister isn't it because because the things that it thinks are important quite often are not what people in the government and people who are trying to make money think are important and that's where shit gets fucked up because now you get into some kind of deep conspiracy where people in power are actively attempting to disrupt a transmission coming to us from the earth right and i think the same holds true for for psychedelics and when you see DMT, MDMA, psilocybin, all of these all these compounds i don't want to sound too much like a hippie but i'll do that yeah there's this there's this extra vibration there's this higher level of consciousness that you achieve with these different mind-altering chemicals none of which have been proven to show any harm long or short term right and we are not allowed because some agency says you're not allowed to experience a higher level of consciousness right that's it we need you down here that's it we can keep a hold of you because once you take a nice trip or uh you get i was not a marijuana smoker at all i was i was anti anti until my 30s but it's made me a nicer guy it's made me more open to experiences and people and it it's just made me a better person and i'm i'm not a daily consumer before you regulate any type of substance you should be forced to go on some type of regiment of that substance for a while and then because whoever's in charge of the DEA at any given time if they come out of like a 30 day instead of detox we would put you in intox you come out of like a 30 day inhospitable cannabis they'd be like dude we gotta totally make this leak it's awesome yeah well there there is that's the other irony and it is that these people are not consuming the thing because they've been conditioned to think it's poison i was so me too we i mean we anybody who's our age and the right now the younger people are in the tail end of this war on drugs but we were in the you know where there's whenever there's a war there's propaganda and we have been permanently encoded with some high level propaganda that has taught us that some substances are drugs and some substances aren't drugs and the substances that are drugs are things like heroin cocaine uh methamphetamine and then somehow shoved in there is marijuana right when it doesn't fit in that category and so a lot of these regulators that's in their brain and they don't understand so the where it's really interesting is uh because what i do as the i guess the resident hippie here talking about the language of the earth man is uh i like to demonize these people and because it's easier than but what's really happening i had rick doblin on this podcast rick doblin is the guy who runs uh the multidisciplinary association for psychedelic studies he's uh doing such great work right now getting these substances psychedelics tested and so he deals with the fda regularly and a lot of people on that side of the fence believe it or not they just care about the data that's it they don't care about they don't have some agenda to keep marijuana away from people or psychedelics away from people they just have a limited amount of data and from that limited amount of data they've created regulations and a lot of times that's that the these regulations are good if you look at the history of the pharmaceutical company and look at like christ what was that drug they put out that that made made it so that babies couldn't grow arms and legs what was that uh what was that called it was called um phalidomide yes phalidomide you know that that was an example of a pharmaceutical company being incredibly irresponsible ignoring what was happening and because of that a whole generation of people were born permanently disabled uh so this is why we need the fda they just but they need data and because of the obstruction of several presidential administrations they don't have the data and now they're assembling it thanks to people like dalvin but i found it very refreshing to hear that people on that side of the fence believe it or not want humans to be healthy they want humans to feel good they don't want people to be sick and there isn't some nefarious thing but somewhere there is somewhere on the fucking telephone somewhere or someone's stepping on the tube on purpose and i always wonder who the fuck is it is it the lobbyists is it the pharmaceutical companies they have lobbyists who are against marijuana because they think it's going to reduce their yes and exit is that it big big alcohol big tobacco and big pharma and the prison industry and the prison industry as well so you buy into that you think that there is a the prison industrial complex the far that they they they're people this is just where it gets weird i try to imagine a human being actually thinking to themselves we must keep marijuana illegal so my prison will stay filled with people is that real man that's only part of it i mean if you look at people who are in prison for marijuana it's only people who are moving heavy weight there's there's not no one's in prison for right my possession they're they're they're just not you'll hear people say that that that's an argument but there's there's not there's just heavyweight dealers are in or in prison but it is but but it all adds up to a problem so you've got you've got the prison union who happens very connected to law enforcement so now you've got law enforcement like the dda that needs to protect their budgets and we've got two three billion dollars carved out for marijuana enforcement i've got all these agents if i don't use my budget i lose my budget so what am i going to do with these guys so you've got the agencies protecting their budgets now you've got big alcohol doesn't want another mind-altering substance on the market big tobacco we don't need another inhalant you know they hate they hate vaporizing and then uh and then big pharma does not need cannabis on the market because cannabis seems to cure every fucking thing you throw at it it is it is like the superman of of herbal remedy but see right there man that to me it's i think i think if there is a culprit it must be someone in big pharma because if i mean if imagine if there were like zanex seeds like if you could plant zanex that would be a disaster well that'd be a disaster for the world because zanex is one of the most horrible horrendous drugs out there that i'm aware of it's it's one of the most satanic drugs on earth but so here you have cbd which my experience with cbd has been so good it is i i've never encountered anything as wonderful as cbd it's uh it relaxes you helps you go to sleep it's cure i had insomnia at one point and then and i don't take i was taking cbd regularly i don't anymore but at one point i wasn't able to sleep my dad had given me these hardcore fucking barbiturates to like go to sleep i took them for a few few nights got really really foggy and sick it was awful but then i started taking melatonin and cbd right damn out like a light and and now i don't now i'm sleeping just fine and because whatever was fucked up inside of me got rewired yes and that's something that it grows out of the ground and the receptors are there just waiting for you to plug into them i mean how did we wind up with an endocatabinoid system by accident or by evolution you know it's there for a reason it's either evolution or happy accident or god or god maybe god wants it whatever you believe it say either either one if you want to go the religious angle god created everything god wants us to have kind of cannabis or you go the evolution angle obviously our bodies are meant to uh take in cannabinoids and into our receptors and process them so um i think both sides of that argument are equally valid well there there does seem to be i mean you know there does seem to look if you ask me i'm going to say god is a term of convenience just because you can put a lot into that category but if there does seem to be you don't we don't need to trace it all the way back to some intelligent creator but it does seem that humans and cannabis have had a very happy relationship for a very long time i don't i don't think those cannabinoids are just accidentally in there because it seems like mostly the human organism is very efficient and everything inside of us has some purpose they're even finding out the appendix might actually be a useful thing that they didn't realize so everything running in the system needs to be there including the cannabinoids so um yeah it's really terrifying to me to think that there are people in the pharmaceutical industry who are actively attempting to remove us from marijuana and they're putting people in jail for it man so okay there's enough of my ranting this is what i wanted to ask you guys when when did you get the idea to start speedweed because not to like sound like i'm like giving you both blowjobs here or anything but of all the companies on earth speedweed is my favorite it's the best it's been so wonderful to me when i had cancer it was there for me and let me tell you man when you are i don't mean to keep going back this when you have fucking when you are getting radiation therapy doing anything is like it's like you've got a a weighted vest on man okay and not all of us can afford a nurse and not all of us can like have access to help right so for me just like i can remember the first time i was able to walk up the street to a starbucks from my house and what a victory that was it was like oh fuck i did it but i had to sleep for like four hours after that so the idea of getting in your car right after you've just gotten radiation therapy and driving to a goddamn dispensary in LA traffic in LA traffic to get something that's going to make your nausea go away what's that guy's name who's stopping this that's mike furor says it's the will you voted for this this is what you voted for LA man mike furor you gotta understand that not all of us even though i clearly am a hippie not all of us there's a lot of people in bed right now who can't get out of bed and they don't have family and they don't have caretakers and they're sick and you're keeping them from getting help and that's fucked man that's fucked so any i i will when i'm around you i'm sorry man i mean i can this is something that gets me really pissed off man i appreciate that it does so it should it is absolutely disgusting to have to have people's rights trampled on like that and to prevent really sick people from from have access to medicine it's it's really disgusting where we are right now i i don't know if i'm going to disclose this is location but where we are right now you're not allowed to do just no access to medication where we are right completely banned completely banned who did that and what gives you the right to do that right now if you want to regulate the number of shops in a city do that you want to keep them up to a certain standard do that you want to test the meds do that um but you have to you have to still give us an outlet i it drives me crazy that i can drive down Santa Monica Boulevard and see billboards for absolute billboards for this titty bar billboards for this crazy thing but you cannot advertise cannabis anywhere no way no no way because it's evil because it's evil because these people have been conditioned now okay so here's my question before i went on another self-righteous virtue signalling fucking rant uh when did you guys start speedweed what's the history here man how did it how did speedweed come into existence that's a good question um i guess we're about six years old now um and i'm from the east coast new york city both me and my brother uh originally new yorkers aj um moved out here earlier than me uh and like he said he was close to straight edge he wasn't really a marijuana user right so when i came out this is straight edge but i was drinking a third of a bottle of whiskey every night to get to bed like a lot of americans are and that that's that's really really dangerous and that part of my life is over thanks to cannabis all right you know where now it's a glass of true or wine of a week where it used to be all right just pouring the jack daniel's in the glass to help me get this all you got access to it's the only thing you can get it was medicinal yeah that's right so when i uh decided to move out here we were in uh the technology business and um i decided to move out to california um and uh because we were we were partners together and um wanted to uh work on new projects once i got out here day one i went and i got my driver's license and said uh to uh my brother you know you're drinking every night you know even though it's not a problem there's probably a healthier way to medicate yourself and he was um playing around with some nutraceuticals and things like that and i said why don't you try cannabis and like he mentioned before he was almost anti cannabis um my whole my entire life you know because i've been cannabis user since i was 15 years old or so uh daily and even though uh um he wasn't uh he wasn't he didn't like hate that i used it uh he accepted that i used it because i was still very productive but he wasn't a user himself so when i got out here i said i i pretty much dragged him over to the doctor i said come with me let's just go go get a doctor recommendation right and and he would and i got a little little uh pushback from it sure what you were like no way man i'm not i was absolutely freaked out we come from a law enforcement family like generation wow uh dad is a hall of fame nypd detective wow uh and i was three days away from signing a law enforcement contract myself genus got a degree of criminal justice wow so this so you know when i was born the the war on drugs began under nixon and i grew up with reagan and nancy telling me to just hang out wow that is in there and that's still in there now even in this business this many years i still feel like we're doing something wrong me too that's where it's in me too they got us man they got and the younger generation they don't they're they're clear of it yeah look at the polling and they're over 70 pro cannabis yeah so that's great so so the war on drugs is that's winding down thank god you know but we're gonna need to die in order for righteousness to finally emerge and i'm willing i'm willing to throw myself on the grenade yeah and and you know as i pass into that next level of consciousness i'll be looking down at everyone getting baked on on earth and just feeling like we did it man yeah and i'm great um but so anyway i was definitely against going to the cannabis doctor and this is years ago before it was as professional as it is now yes and a quick plug on speedweed.com you can get your doctor's rec online through video conference you don't have to go to some yeah i did that yeah and how great was it so easy right well i'll tell you here's how it's really cool about it man is the uh the doctor that i talked to you through speedweed actually like gave me some other recommendations for supplements and she was amazing man it was it was really cool like she talked to me a lot about cvd why it worked she talked to me about vitamin d that if you you know a lot of people have vitamin d deficiency it was really she was very sweet this was not like other doctors that i've gotten prescriptions from not that any of them are bad but a lot of them are so uh hogtied by the fear of being prosecuted for writing a prescription to the wrong person that they have a very cursory interaction with you that's usually based on filling out forms but the person i talked to was clearly a well-intended very sweet doctor which was surprising to me because usually you expect it to be like a kind of like quick okay fine okay can't sleep okay fine yeah it wasn't like that at all she was actually like why why aren't you sleeping what's going on like actually seemed like to have some compassion yeah yeah and that is certainly the evolution of our industry and where we're going and and as um you know cannabis comes into light because our first experience with the doctor was sort of shady oh he dragged me up there to somewhere in San Fernando it's an office building surrounded by barbed wire that look like to improve his mogadishu we go into some office with no windows and there's some crazy girl behind the counter that says all right the doctor will see you both now so now i'm freaking out thinking i'm you know i'm gonna get physical i'm gonna get naked yeah paper next to my brother we sit down in an unmarked box with this doctor who obviously speaks english and he looks at me first which was a terrible idea because i'm already having a panic attack and he says why do you need weed and i and i'm just staring at him and i feel my brother staring at me like dude don't fuck this up and the doctor sees my anxiety and says oh you have stress and he said yes he says you have terrible sleep i said yes because you have weed and he called it weed and he signed this piece of paper he looked at gene and said why do you need weed and gene said i have stress and trouble sleep he said oh good you have weed and he gave us these pieces of paper that looked completely illegitimate but they genes like that's fine and he took me to a dispensary and by goodness he took me to a decent one um big and that was really my entree into the industry i i have been in LA for years and always thought it was a counterculture hippy thing where stoners go and they get their you know their sketchy marijuana i do realize there is an actual industry and i didn't realize there's actually people being helped by this yeah yeah well that's i mean that is that there are my experience with the first doctors i went to is like that too and thank god it's shifting uh but very quickly so you what are you what do your parents think about this that you guys are running this massive marijuana delivery service totally supportive no kidding as long as as long as we're following the law are you guys following the law yes then we totally support that or do you think some police officers feel frustrated that they have to enforce marijuana laws i know that for an absolute fact because growing up around cops and almost going that way myself i still like i mean i i think that's one of the most noble profession absolutely um there's plenty of asshole cops we all know that we all encounter them but most people in that profession are noble and believe me on that one of my closest friends is a is a ranking officer in in san diego um he's a ranking officer in eastern division i'm not gonna mention his name he's gonna be in trouble um so i asked him what's going on in san diego because there's a lot of busts going on in san diego right now federal um federal task force sheriff's department sdpd they're knocking people over and i and i asked my buddy what are you guys doing he says the feds are here we got to do it they're told my guys don't give a shit about this we don't worry about anybody with you know carrying weed because we know that there's no collar there we know there's no arrest there so while i'm not going to spend 6 12 18 hours of my day in court i'm not going to get an arrest right just a kid smoking a joint what i have better things to do with my time right you know my buddy is is part of the units that like jump through windows and rescue hostages and right and do and you know fight crime like superheroes they don't care about a little bag of herb and i don't think any real cop on the street does the real cops that go out there that like to do the job do the work that want to help people like my dad wanted to help people and he helps people primarily his primary tool with helping society was his next day he was that kind of cop right he went down Times Square and cleared the decks and then it was safe for citizens to walk he wouldn't care about some kid with a dime bag he really wouldn't and cops these days so this is the uh to me another the tragedy of this thing is that you get you know you get a faction of society that actually wants to help people who will die for you cops will die for you they'll die these are people who don't know you they're the ones who come into a building where there's a domestic disturbance they're the ones who are who you call when someone is about to break into your house and then they have to enforce bullshit laws to criminalize a substance that criminalizes substance that is harmless and then people start looking at the cops not as heroes anymore okay for example of the other day i don't know what happened one of my neighbors was burning some kind of weird shit out of their chimney i don't know what it was or what's going on but the whole neighborhood smelled like chemicals and so the chief of the fire department came to my house because they need to get my backyard to look at my at this house so chief of the fire department awesome firemen badass come in you're a badass they're firemen you were like fighting fires and i don't want my house to burn down because my neighbor ignited it with whatever so but a cop because they've been supporting these bullshit laws you look at them like what's wrong with you man you're taking people to jail for a thing that grows out of the ground and so then they don't get what they deserve which is respect the kind of respect the hero deserves which is which is they're out there trying to make it safe man yeah and if you if the moron drugs ends and police officers no longer have to support these ridiculous laws they get to look like heroes again mostly not that there aren't still going to be shitty races backwards bullshit cops i'm sure they're they're going to be out there but i always have that the public perception of authority is going to shift if the authority are are actually enforcing laws that we need like don't kill each other don't rob from each other don't drive drunk because you'll run over people so that's another casualty of the war on drugs is the relationship between the population and police officers and i got something else to add about that when we were the only company um invited by the board of equalization to do a presentation for the entire state on the um on on transportation within cannabis the board of equalization that's the agency in california that controls the taxes so they're kind of that's the agency that's sort of spearheading the legislation right now right like the irs for california right okay so so we were the only um a retail company uh that was invited to speak um one of the other people doing this uh on the panel with with us was the highway patrol and they directly said look we don't care about marijuana we just want you to tell us who's the good guy and who's the bad guy so if you tell us let's regulate this and you have a license and we know you're going from point a to point b with marijuana you're allowed to we just want to get the guy who's not allowed the guy breaking the law is the guy who's the bad guy so even even the police are frustrated over cannabis because they don't want to have to enforce a law just like adria was saying that's a waste of time for everyone uh as well so um so that that's important to take into consideration that if proper regulation is put forth they don't have to deal with that anymore right but when the city was building their case against us and and i think it's it's fair that we need to say that is that the city of l.a. is suing speed for operating so so you've got that tremendous waste of of taxpayer dollars now is they're suing us the company that is working closely with the state government that is loved by the state government but the state government looks for for guidance we're being sued by the city in which we live so during while they're putting together this ridiculous lawsuit my wife and i were followed around for months by a narcotics officer now our narcotics officer is a highly trained highly talented highly paid individual and he spent months following us around and his report is saw aj get into his car and go to the office saw jen take their son to school saw aj carrying in a manila envelope which could have had cash but i don't know i couldn't tell it was months of that you saw the report yeah because it's in the lawsuit so this is so this is this this is how we're wasting our talented officers time is by following around legitimate business people that you know how much do you think they had to pay that guy for that what what is a narcotics officer making in in l.a. at his rank 70 grand a year 80 grand a year maybe more on if it was new york would be over a hundred thousand a year so so months months building this case against us um and there's and there's no hard facts in the case it's speed weed is operating a a sophisticated delivery service um from from at least seven locations in the greater los angeles area well what locations they're not in the lawsuit where are the addresses right you know there's a couple of addresses there but but there was just offices um how much is the city paying for this lawsuit i don't know i i mean that's a question that that i that the media should ask is what does it cost to enforce this lawsuit because the city was happy to just the city wants a couple of million dollars from us and finds these you're not getting it we said we'll go to court and then you know that the city would like us to resolve this outside of court of course they would i don't want to resolve it outside of court i want to sit in front of a jury of my peers and explain what proposition d has is doing and what the city has done if you paid these fines two million dollars you could continue to deliver in la no we would bankrupt we would be personally bankrupt the bankrupt the business we're they've already devastated our our business and they're devastating the entire industry there's no legal delivery allowed in the city limits and now cease and desist letters are flying out of city hall you know at a million miles an hour shutting down every delivery service operating in the open so it's a shakedown it's an absolute shakedown but they're not shaking it really shaking us down for money what they're shaking us down for is statistics for the back of their baseball cards because it's an election year and people are paying attention and this is the year that the city attorney and the mayor have to announce do they want to be reelected what politician doesn't want to be reelected so now these politicians get to say measure d said shut down the dispensary so i shut down 400 dispensaries i shut down 180 delivery services including speed read the biggest one i did this i did that i did this so reelect me because it's very interesting that all the evidence is from years ago against us right over two years right so why did they they said that we're an imminent harm to the uh to society um so why did it take two years to to put together the suit instead of prosecuted if we were imminent harm how come we weren't uh dealt with right at that point why because it's an election year um at least that's what what um you know most of the thoughts are um the other there are a few other things to to consider as well um proposition d you know this lawsuit is not a criminal lawsuit it's a civil lawsuit so uh because we are not violating any criminal law whatsoever we are in full compliance with california cannabis law the other a few other things to consider um is that this is a zoning law and they want to apply this zoning law to our delivery vehicles well zoning law typically is for commercial buildings you walk into a commercial building this is occupancy 85 right for the room that's zoning law you got to post that so historically zoning law has not applied to vehicles if that was the case when you're getting food delivery or from dominoes you would expect to see an a-rated kitchen and you know a letter in their window or and you know again we're talking about zoning law and that zoning law applies to places within la well our business is actually not in la all right um so we just we just travel through it and and i know you have a lot of listeners from all over the place yeah every every cannabis enthusiast should take a close look at what the cities are doing because these zoning bans are happening all over california and nobody's aware of them so in the city where we're sitting right now they did that they zoned cannabis out of this city um you look at cities like uh englewood hawthorne um all of south the south central uh the bay it's all banned delivers a band pretty much most of southern california delivers a band except for a few small pockets is there is there any chance that in the next few years marijuana will just become legal in california like it is in denver yes but it's going to be it's going to be a messy road to get there because remember all those assembly bills i was asking about yes you didn't hear that nobody's heard of yes they create an an a huge bureaucracy they want to put um unions in charge of all transportation they want anyone using cannabis to register in the database they want they want the they want um food and agriculture in charge of all the flowers they want the teamsters running all the deliveries uh they want an extra 15 taxes on cannabis use which actually just passed and and we all freaked out and signed petitions to get that pulled back they've lowered it to 10 but they're not calling it a tax they're calling it a usage fee so in some parts of california you're going to be paying 40 tax on cannabis what happens when you when you charge 40 tax the guy goes on the internet he finds the dude who's not legitimate and he just buys his eight for 40 bucks like always because he's not going to go to your shop that's certified by the city and pay a hundred dollars for it there's no reason to do that he just creates a bigger black market right and cannabis has survived in the black market for decades very comfortably and very sure and most people want to stay there you know we don't we follow all the rules and because we've done that we put ourselves on the radar as a target what do you guys that's what i want to talk to you a little about is what does feel like to be saddled with this kind of responsibility because you you guys accidentally or or intentionally became the top marijuana delivery service in one of the largest cities in the world and now the largest cannabis market you guys are now at the forefront of this war for something that if you don't win it if you lose this it could create a horrible cascade that leads to some kind of new form of bureaucratic prohibition that ultimately at the root makes it so that people who are sick have to go jump through extra hoops to get something that makes them feel better that grows out of the ground what does that feel like man it is fucking frustrating it is absolutely uh emotionally devastating and draining because what happens is when you create that bureaucracy and all this mess that we have to deal with and the taxes you take good people like us who are trying to help people and people think that speed weed that we're like burning a hundred dollar bills to keep warm that we're rolling in money speedy doesn't make any money we've been not we haven't made a real profit ever because we followed all the rules pay taxes so what you do now with this bureaucracy is you push people like us out because because i'm at the point where i just want to throw up my hand and say you know what you guys are fucking it up i'll come back in five years when you figure out that everything you're doing is going to make it worse all right so you push us out and then the black market thrives so this proposition d and the city attorney mike furor and the city la city council are the best friends of the black market can have these the assembly bills that are running running through sacramento right now the best friends of black market that's scary man i said this very thing in sacramento in the capital in front of everybody i said you guys are going to create a black market that's already thriving and this is just more this is rocket fuel because you can't take people who don't follow the law and give them new laws to follow they're not going to do them you can't take people who don't pay taxes and give them more taxes to pay they won't pay taxes so all you're doing is burdening us and eventually we're just going to say there's no money in this for us all right you know i can't make my 30 grand a year anymore you know that's that's what we make our employees make more money than the owners do because we were trying to build something of value that would that would kind of ride this wave of industry into the into the next phase instead we're saddled with lawsuits and regulations and taxes and all this nonsense that just makes you go you know what we'll take our talent and maybe we'll go do something else you know maybe we'll we'll go build build wooden cheds or mini houses no right or i'll raise beagles or something don't raise beagle smart talented people will find other things to do so don't so don't you want them here don't you want good people here in this industry and and we should talk about the balance of harm that uh to our to our company um there's money in beagles by the way i am thinking that of the things you listed one of them is raising beagles that's so weird believe me i'm not gonna let him do that um do you love beagles i you know i i i kind of like beagles this is a good why did that come out of your mouth i don't know that's in did your mind just manufacture beagle raising it in and you know brother a lot of years here i've never even heard him use the word beagle i think i think i've been quoting an old firefly episode or something i think that's a firefly so i so maybe uh beagles are in our future um but uh you know i think that it's important to talk about the balance of harm to a company let's just take cannabis out out of it we're trying to operate legally and and do everything the right way well we've had to lay off 65 employees that were paying taxes and and also um by doing this they lose tax revenue from from us now you know those people are on unemployment now right and so there's a balance of harm to those people and just to our company in general but also let's talk about the money that they're going to lose in taxes by doing this right la needs money la needs tax money from cannabis or anywhere else they need tax money so why cut out tax money when people just want it regulated and do it the right way there's obviously a demand um these are the demand isn't from criminals the demand is from citizens who are taxpayers who are voters why would we take away money that is going to the state we should regulate it and allow that money to flow fairly from the end user to the government so of course we don't want it to be unfair and uh tax too heavily but at least give give that legal way for regulation so that the city doesn't have to lose that tax month uh that tax money I believe um as a last year the cannabis industry paid taxes on two billion dollars in la alone now that's they pay taxes on that so so but still you know calculate it you know at the 40 percent level or or whatever it is that's a lot of money that's being lost by the by the city so what do we do what do we do what can people living in california or not living in california what can we do during this election year to make you guys succeed in your pursuit of having a legitimate marijuana delivery service not just in LA but hopefully all over the country eventually what can we do well well let's talk about california first just just so everyone uh listening realizes we are open in the rest of california that they're where there aren't bans so we offer overnight amazon prime type service by by medical courier that will come to your house uh the next day so that's open in all of california but where places are banned like like LA we can't deliver there right so um so what californians can do is certainly join our our collective you use us because the larger our basis the the uh more we have the more ammo we have um to show why this is a legitimate legitimate and why it's a needed service throughout california right we have on our site go to speedy.com slash la ban is one word that there's a petition there that you could that you can read a little bit about what's going on with the ban and just put your name uh in there and a comment about why you think it's unfair we and we'll we'll get that to the politicians is that effective well that do you think that would work i know that i know for a fact that they're paying attention to us i know that for an absolute fact um an advantage to being speed leaders we have eyes and ears everywhere including city hall um we have great relationships with attorneys around the city good relations law enforcement good relationships with politicians in the city we know that they're paying attention to us uh every time speed weed is mentioned in the media uh city hall forwards that mentioned to our attorney as a way of them saying that they're keeping an eye on us that's cool so that's cool so uh so we know that the city attorney is going to listen to this and that's just fine um we have over three thousand signatures in in our database right now and we're going to start sending those to city hall one by one by one until they get the message proposition d as it stands is going to change this year most likely what they're going to do is take the proposition d shops the monopoly shops and codify them within state law to make them the only shops that can operate within the city limits and uh that just came through the city council last week delivery is not mentioned there so delivery is still banned inside the city limits of la and sorry to all you guys who are have been using our service and loved it we can't get to you um you're using a different service they're drug dealers uh according to your your leadership so that how do we change this you gotta get out and fucking vote it really makes a difference um so first vote for gary johnson so there's a shout out to gary after that that was that was going to be my next thing thing to mention that on the national level you should support gary johnson for president uh right now he's polling at 10 percent and uh if we get him to to 15 percent he gets on the national debates and that's what we really need um because his voice is an important one for former governor of new mexico um who uh who is a supporter of cannabis and um would de-schedule cannabis so it would be very important for our industry um especially uh even if his um agenda is just heard got it yep so that's it vote for gary johnson keep your ear to the ground guys go to speed weed fill out this uh fill fill fill out the petition i have filled out the petition let these let let the people who are getting in the way of this stuff know what's up because really the oh yeah okay some of us we're having marijuana delivered because we're too lazy to drive to a marijuana shop sure there's a contingent of us that are doing that but even so so what it's it should be free to do that anyway but there's some of us oh whoever is listening in city hall if someone is actually listening people get sick and marijuana makes us feel better and it's real it's not just a bunch of hippies making something up it's real you are obstructing sick people from getting medicine and these two people here are the sweetest humans i've ever met these are not criminals these are good people who are just trying to run a successful business and by the way a successful business i said business god damn it what a terrible way to end that but here's the thing man here's the thing when you say we're not even making money i say make money if anybody deserves to profit it's folks who are at the forefront of a major human rights issue putting their asses on the line because that's what you're doing man you're getting trailed by federal agents come on federal agents are following you when you drive your kid to school come on man and you're acting like it's not a big deal that's a big deal that's fucked is what that is because you guys are doing nothing wrong so anyway that's my say on it you already know how i stand guys you too thank you so much for what you do here thanks for coming on the show keep me posted let me know how i can help in any way because this is a bunch of bullshit and i want you guys to be okay no beagles no beagles thanks dunkin that was aj and gino from la speed weed go check them out at la speed weed dot com please do not forget to go to normal dot org see

So now everyone, please welcome to the Dunkin' Trustle Family Hour podcast, The Great Graham Hancock. 🎵Welcome, welcome on you🎵 🎵That you are with us! Shake hands, learnin' to be blue🎵 🎵Welcome to you, how, it's the Dunkin' Trustle baby🎵 Hi, how are you Mr. Hancock? I'm good, how are you? I'm doing very well, and I'm feeling fit as fast as ever. Well, thank you, it's really nice to hear from you again. Nice to be back with you, Dunkin'. So, I just watched, you sent me this really cool video about your new book, War God, that's coming out. Wow, it really, the video really was quite dramatic, and as you're so good at doing, it illuminated just how incredibly intense and violent certain moments in history were. Can you talk about your book a little bit? Sure, well War God is a novel, it's my second, I'm better known for non-fiction, but War God is my second novel. And it's a historical novel, but also there are elements of fantasy and the supernatural in it. And it's set during the Spanish conquest of Mexico, when 490 Spaniards turned up in 11 ships on the coast of Mexico, and took on the colossal militaristic Aztec Empire, which could put 200,000 men into the field. Wow. The Spanish were there unashamedly after gold, that was what they wanted. And they had certain advantages, they had metal weapons, the Aztecs did not have metal weapons, they used obsidian blades and flint blades. The Spanish were armed with guns, rather simple guns by our standards, but they had cannon, and they had a very ancient form of muskets called the archibus, and they had something that was absolutely stunning and devastating to the Aztecs, and that was cavalry. They only had 16 horses, but horses were unknown in the New World, they'd been extinct for more than 12,000 years. And when the Aztec armies saw these creatures bearing down on them at 30 miles an hour, both the horses and the men were armoured in steel, the ground trembling beneath their feet, the Aztecs had absolutely no idea what they were dealing with. They thought they were some kind of supernatural being, some sort of hybrid between a man and a deer was their first idea. And of course they had no tactics for dealing with cavalry. So it was a technologically unequal war, although the Spanish were small in numbers, they had the advantage of their weapons, their metal weapons, their guns, their cavalry, and they also used dogs as a weapon of war, armoured dogs, as a matter of fact, mastiffs and wolfhounds. And again, this was a totally alien concept to the Aztecs. The Aztecs did have dogs, they had chihuahuas, and they used the chihuahuas as a food item. So when they saw these gigantic wolfhounds and mastiffs leaping at them, armoured in steel, again, they were just utterly, utterly demoralised. And this partly explains why the Spanish were able to win this battle. But there's a strong supernatural element in the story. The story is called War God because Moctezuma worshipped an entity called Hummingbird. That's the translation of his name into our language. And he accessed, this is a historical fact, he accessed that entity by consuming psilocybin mushrooms. Wow! Now, as you know, I am a big fan of psychedelics, and I believe that properly and responsibly used, they can be an incredible instrument of liberation and of awakening. But when people bring a dark energy to psychedelics, they tend to manifest dark things. And the Aztecs brought a very dark, cruel, killer energy to psychedelics. And what Moctezuma encountered in the visionary state was this demonic being who constantly gave him incredibly bad advice, you know, and told him to sacrifice people. And hundreds of thousands of people were sacrificed during the time of the Aztec rain, marched up a pyramid, spread eagle over a stone, and their hearts cut out of their chests with flint, with flint knives. And at the same time, on the other side, Cortes, the Spanish conquistador, Hernán Cortes, had visionary encounters with an entity that he believed was Saint Peter. He used to encounter him in dreams, who encouraged him on to ever more awful and wicked acts of violence himself. And the concept I'm playing with in the novel is that the same demonic entity, this is the supernatural element of the novel, which the same demonic entity that appears to Moctezuma in the disguise of the war god, appears to Cortes in the disguise of Saint Peter and manipulates and plays with these two men like puppets to drive the whole of Mexico into a dreadful conflagration, which was what indeed happened. Do you believe that something like that maybe actually exists? No, yeah, I do. I think we have to stay very, very open-minded to that possibility because we don't really understand the nature of reality. I mean, a lot of scientists will tell you they've got it all figured out and there's no mystery, but I don't agree with those scientists at all. I think it's just for a start, incredibly mysterious just to be alive, just to be in a human body and live in this garden, this jewel of a planet and to have the opportunity to live out our lives and make daily choices between good and evil, between right and wrong, between dark and light. And when you enter visionary states, it's very common, particularly with DMT and with ayahuasca in which the active ingredient is DMT, but also with psilocybin and to a lesser extent with LSD as well. It's very common to encounter entities in those states. Now, the materialist scientist will say those entities are simply projections of our own brains and maybe they are. But I think we have to keep our minds open to the possibility that what's happening is that we are accessing, that we're retuning, if you like, the receiver wavelength of our consciousness with these visionary agents and that we are accessing other levels or dimensions of reality that are not normally accessible to our consciousness and that in those levels and dimensions of reality exist intelligent entities, non-physical entities of pure consciousness, which are interacting with us whether we like it or not. And down the ages, if you think about it, human beings have always believed that they were making war in the name of their God. Bob Dylan, you know, got it really right in his song with God on our side. And right now, today in the world, whether you're a Muslim or a Christian, you often believe that you are opposed to one another because that's what your God wants you to do. So people down the ages have done terrible things in the name of God, in the name of their God. And I think we should consider the possibility that these are real entities which are messing with our heads and that some of them are invested in multiplying human misery and those have been called demons down the ages. And some are invested in helping us to be the best that we could possibly be. And those have been called angels down the ages. I'm not putting a Christian interpretation on this because I'm not personally speaking a Christian. But I'm just saying that many cultures throughout human history have believed in demonic and angelic agencies. And I think we should stay open to that. Let's explore that idea that that there are these intelligent entities. What is the why would demonic entities want to cause misery? What do they have to gain from making human beings suffer or from luring us into bad situations? Well, we can start answering that question by looking at fellow human beings who love to make one another miserable. There are human beings right here with us on this planet who delight from causing pain and suffering to others. I'm not saying that they're huge in numbers. I think most of us are basically very good-willed. And I think the power of love is always stronger than the power of fear. But let's not deny that there are people who almost like psychic vampires, they strengthen themselves by causing misery and harm and damage to others. And we've all of us in our lives at some point or another come across one of those negative people who feeds off our energy and harms and hurts us psychically. I think everybody's had that experience. So it happens in this life, in this physical life. Secondly, I think it's helpful to look at ancient systems of ideas about the nature of reality. And the one that I have particular interest in is called Gnosticism, which suggests a very radical possibility, a possibility that most mainstream Christians or Muslims or Jews would find utterly horrendous. And that is the possibility that we live in a dualistic universe and that there are forces of light and forces of darkness, forces of evil at work in this universe. And that actually the entity who we have been taught to call God, who goes by the name of Yahweh or Jehovah, from the Gnostic point of view, and this is an ancient teaching that goes back to the second or third century after Christ, from the Gnostic point of view, that entity called Jehovah is not God at all. He's a pretender, he's a usurper, he has convinced us that he is God, but actually he's a demonic entity who feeds off maximizing human misery. And if you actually look what's been done in the name of that entity over the last 2000 years, the horrendous issues of the Crusades or whether it's an Islamic fundamentalist slicing off somebody's head with a kitchen knife today, the misery and suffering that have been caused in the name of that entity are absolutely undeniable. So the suggestion is that there are vampiric entities which thrive and feed and grow off human misery just as there are vampiric human beings who thrive and feed and grow on the misery of fellow human beings. And that there is a struggle in the universe and that there are also forces of light and that the fundamental predicament of the human creature is to choose between those two, is to choose between light and darkness, between love and fear, between evil and good and to make those choices and we define ourselves by those choices. And in every single human life, at every minute of the day, I think we're always making those choices. Sometimes they're very small, they seem to be very minor in their implications and sometimes they're very large and they have huge implications and they can plunge whole nations into warfare and hatred and fear and suspicion with one another. I have a friend who calls this place we live on a university of duality. I know many people are against duality and would like to think that all is one and sweetness and light in the garden, but actually perhaps it's the case that duality and the ability to choose between good and evil, between light and dark, is a very important teaching tool, a teaching tool if we are, in fact, immortal souls who are incarnated in human bodies. Maybe we have very important lessons to learn here and maybe those lessons arise from the choices we make. It's kind of a, what would you call it, a spiritual binary, I guess, ones and zeros that sort of make up the framework of everything. Why do you, do you think that the darkness or in this case, what do they call it, Gnosticism? There's a name for that entity that is the false God and I can't remember the name. Well, they call him the Demiurge. The Demiurge, right. Do you think that the, why do you, sometimes it seems like the Demiurge is a million times more palatable or not palatable, I'm sorry, a million times more tangible than that other side. Why do you agree with that? And if you do, why do you think that is? Well, again, the Gnostics have their own answer to that. They say that we human beings are the creation of the Demiurge, but that the non-physical realm of spirit took pity on us and inserted into us a divine spark. And the whole purpose of Gnosis is to allow that divine spark to grow so that we can free ourselves from the attachments of matter and of the dark and heavy material realm and realize the spiritual light within us. And the whole project of the Demiurge and his evil angels, who the Gnostics call Archons, the whole project of the Demiurge is to prevent us from doing that and to keep us in darkness. And that's why the Gnostics see the serpent in the Garden of Eden as the good guy. They don't see the serpent as the bad guy. They say that that is an ideology that we've been taught by the Demiurge. Actually, the serpent is the good guy. He's saying to Adam and Eve, you must have knowledge of good and evil. You cannot remain in pristine ignorance. You have to have knowledge of good and evil. You must make choices between those two poles because that is how you're going to learn and grow. So that is what is being offered from the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil is the opportunity for spiritual growth. And it's interesting that in many of the Gnostic traditions, the tree of knowledge of good and evil in the Garden of Eden is actually depicted as a psychedelic mushroom. Yes. Yes, I've seen I've seen those before and that's in there's some great pictures and I think John Marcus Allegro's the sacred mushroom in the cross. He was one of the one of the authorities who who investigated this whole this whole issue and and you know, we have a body of texts from the Gnostics. They were, of course, persecuted by the Catholic Church, but they hid certain texts at a place called Nakamadi in Upper Egypt near the famous Temple of Dendera. And those texts were recovered in 1945 and they're called the Nakamadi Library and they give us chapter and verse all of the Gnostic teachings and they turn everything upside down. They they turn the the Garden of Eden upside down. They turn the nature of God upside down. They really cause us to question everything about the human predicament and about what we're doing here on this on this planet. And like I say, you know, there's no proof about this and it may well be that some of the scientists are right. And we are just material creatures and we do project these ideas out from the workings of our own brain. But I think we'd be foolish to accept that as a fact. I think we should realize that that's just an opinion and that it's worth inquiring into the nature of reality. And actually psychedelics are an incredibly effective tool if used properly and used responsibly for those inquiries into the nature of reality. In fact, I can't think of a better tool, really. I agree with you. And I think that in when you start thinking in this way, there is one one truth, one one truth that you can prove that there certainly is a subjective universe that exists in the consciousness of a great many people on this planet that is made up of these symbols that you're talking about, which are the religious symbols. So as whether or not these symbols exist outside of our craniums, it seems irrelevant since these symbols are responsible for massive societal tides, which often result in great violence. So yeah, terrible thing, terrible thing. So so in that way, I think it's almost in a way, at least for the sake of understanding why people do what they do when they're influenced by these religious symbols. It doesn't really seem to make much of a difference if the symbols are real or not in the sense that the belief in them is causing so much to happen on the planet every single day, which often really is horrible. Horrible, horrible, vile, dreadful, cruel, wicked and wrong. Absolutely right. This is this is what this is what happens. It doesn't matter. Ultimately, it doesn't matter whether they're real or not. That is an interesting area to inquire into and we should keep an open mind, but they are real in their consequences. Yes. And that is the important thing. And in fact, I maintain that ambiguity throughout my novel, War God, because it's the consequences of all of this that I'm interested in. And what I found fascinating about that period, which was between the years 1519 and 1521 is that in a way it's an early echo of all of the horrors that take place in the modern world. And what I try to show is that even in the darkest of times and the most terrible of circumstances, there is this power of human love and there is this wondrous spirit in humanity. As well as the dark behavior, there is the light behavior. And I bring forward certain characters like a young Aztec witch called Tozi, who is a fictional character. But the Aztecs did have witches and they persecuted them just as the medieval Europeans persecuted witches. And she has supernatural powers and another character, Marlinaal, who is a real historical figure. She's a famous figure in Mexico today and she became the mistress and the interpreter of Cortes. And for some reason, which history never tells us, she had a huge grudge against Moctezuma, the emperor of the Aztecs. And it's clear that she used Cortes as her instrument to overthrow him. Now, in modern Mexico, Marlinaal is seen as a traitor. To call somebody a malinchiste in Mexico is to insult them and to say that they are a betrayer or a traitor of their country. But I see her very differently. I believe that she was always motivated by goodwill and that the wicked nature of Aztec society was what she wanted to overthrow. She just didn't realize that she was opening the door to something even more wicked and awful, which came in in the form of the Spaniards. Do you believe in magic in the sense of the sort of spirituality that people like Alistair Crowley practice? I think that concentrated psychic power is another way of saying magic. I think it's a faculty that all human beings have and I think it's something that we have allowed to go dormant in our society largely. It has largely lapsed. We have pursued the technological route and we've become very good with technology. I don't think there's ever been a human civilization that is as smart with technology as we are. We've extraordinary technological achievements. But the cost of those technological achievements has to allow the latent faculties of the mind to go dormant. So we use reason and rationality and that's why we so much admire the alert problem solving state of consciousness in our society and why we're so suspicious of visionary and dream states. I think that a healthy balance for our society will only come when we re-admit those presently demonized states of consciousness. This place that you're talking about is something that I go back and forth on all the time because I look at the world and I see the effect of religion and the effect that it seems to have on the world which is a terrible I think mostly not that great. And it seems that the reason that these priests are able to cast this kind of hypnotic spell over their followers to convince them to give away their money to the church while simultaneously giving their lives for an invisible entity. It seems like the reason they're able to do that is because the people who fall prey to the hypnosis aren't using their power of deduction and they're not using logic and they're not. I'm afraid to say they're not fully conscious. This is the problem. This is the problem with our society today and it has been historically for at least the last 2000 years a problem which is that the vast masses of populations have been kept in a state of somnambulance, a kind of waking sleep where their higher faculties are simply not engaged. You know the Romans called it bread and circuses, you know, as long as you give the masses bread and entertain them with circuses, you can utterly control them in any way. Just keep them happy and provide them with these little pleasures. Well, it's like when you go to Disneyland and you see a child who is encountering a Disney character and the child believes the Disney character is real. And if you were to go to the child and say, you know those characters that are talking to you are just people in costumes, you would seem like the biggest asshole in the park. That's right. And in the same way when people like you start going around saying, well, you know, actually if you look at the effects of the God that you've been worshiping, you'll find that this thing is a million times worse than the Satan in your mythology, whatever name that thing takes. People literally throw you out of the park. Well, they may in fact kill you. That's what I mean. They may actually kill you. People will kill in the name of this idea that they have of the nature of reality. That's what it comes down to, you know, people receive these ideas in childhood and they never really question them. And not questioning an idea is a sign of an unconscious mentality. It's a sign of a mentality that has not fully woken up. Because the universe has given us these gigantic brains, you know, where they were the end product of, you know, four billion, four thousand million years of evolution. And we're meant to use these brains not to not to switch them off and allow others to tell us what to do and what to think. So when somebody takes a religious idea, let's say it's the Christian idea or the Islamic idea or the Judaic idea for that matter and receives it in childhood and never questioned it. And is prepared to kill another person if they disagree with them. That person is asleep. That person is not engaging their consciousness at all. And therefore I think it's important to point out a number of things. Let's not listen to what these religions say because they all talk the talk of peace and love and brotherly harmony. Let's look at what they actually do. Let's just cut out the bullshit. Let's not listen to a word they say. Let's just examine their actions. And when you examine their actions, you find really horrific things going on, whether it is Christians burning people at the stake, which they continue to do until just two or 300 years ago, until the 1700s. Christians were burning fellow Christians at the stake. Can you imagine the death of being burnt at the stake, the horrific, the awful, dreadful pain and terror of that death which was inflicted gleefully on others in the name of the Christian God? Muslims today are still stoning women to death. For what? Adultery. You know? Stone a woman to death. Stick her down on the ground and throw rocks at her until she dies in the name of God. You have to ask yourself, what kind of God is it? What kind of God is it? And that, what bring me back to the Gnostic position? It isn't a God. It's a demon which is leading people to do these things. I think it's a very interesting idea and worth exploring further. But of course, just for saying that, one immediately puts one's life at risk. Well, yes. And also, if you've been indoctrinated into any of these religions, and by the way, in that list of religions, you forgot Mormonism. I'm reading this fantastic book called Under the Banner of Heaven by John Crackauer. Have you read this book? I have not. No. Oh, it's wonderful. It's about fundamentalist Mormons and polygamy and the way that they will give their 13 or 14-year-old daughters to their 40-year-old brothers to marry and have sex with and impregnate. My goodness. My goodness. Yeah, it's amazing. And Joseph Smith, according to this book, Joseph Smith said polygamy is like one of the deepest aspects, one of the most important aspects of Mormonism. And some of these people will have. And the polygamy is like the male gets to have lots of partners, but the female doesn't, right? The female doesn't. The male gets 30. Some of these people have so many kids that they have to remember the kids' birthdays. They name their kids each year with letters from the alphabet. Oh, my God. It's an amazing thing. And an incredibly unequal one. I mean, you know, if the men are going to have all of that, then women have the same right as well, you know. But again, I think it all goes, if you were to lay all of this out on the table and ask, well, who gave you guys these ideas to act like this? And they all said, God, you would say, well, stop talking to that God because he's ruining your lives. He's really screwing you up. Stop talking to that God right away. Yes, you wouldn't want your kids to come in contact with that God. You wouldn't want to meet that God. But so this is a deeper level of the thing that I want to ask you about. And it's something, once I remember getting a tour of a church and they had carvings of all the disciples. And there was like a third, there was like, I can't remember how they did it. Maybe there was a chair that was empty. All the disciples were sitting on a chair and then the 13th chair was empty. And the lady giving the tour of the church said, that empty chair is for the one who we will not name. You know, talking about Judas. And I remember thinking, man, you really should be happy that Judas did what he did. But without Judas, you don't really have this church anymore, do you? Yeah, you don't have a deal at all. No, exactly. There is no Christianity without Judas. And so, but then I think, okay, here in your book War God, you illustrate this clash of civilizations, this bloody, terrible clash of civilizations. And as we've been having this conversation, we've both been saying, look, the effects of this God are horrible, horrific, bloody and terrible. And yet, if you look at society today, you can see that though it's overpopulated, the advantages that we have today compared to the time when they were burning witches in the 1700s seem to be so much greater. And the level of comfort, even for the poorest of us, seems so much better than it was. Well, I'm not sure if you'd agree with that if you were in a village in northern Pakistan or Afghanistan and where your whole family was wiped out by a drone, you know. No, again, there are, there's still imperialism, there's still horrific injustice. But in a sense, I mean, being burnt at the stake is not very different from being fried by a missile. No, it's, you know, you're, and it's, and also it's a form of, it's a form of vampirism, you know, with every drone that drops on a village, you can calculate exactly how much money that made the corporations that created the drone. And you can divide that by the number of lives that were killed and you'll come up with a dollar value for every incinerated Afghani kid. And a value in another currency as well, which is the currency of hatred and fear and suspicion, multiplying around the world every time. That's true. And so I don't want to, I know that we do, obviously we aren't living in a utopia now. But when I look around my, my house and I, and I'm getting this chance to communicate with you across an ocean and I look at the direction that the world is going in. And I know that there's the danger of thermonuclear war, a massive outbreak of some horrific flu. It still seems as though there is growing from the planet some kind of very specific new life form, which, which seems to be technology. And it feels as though all of these, the, the, the, this horrific God maybe is actually luring us in this direction. Interesting point. And so yeah, so then in that way it's, it's almost as though, you know, if you look at these different phases of human civilization, you see that every single new phase is marked by blood and horror. And you have to ask yourself, well, maybe that's just the way the Gestalt manifests itself is in these kinds of, in this kind of turmoil and catastrophe that eventually is going to lead us to, to, to, to a true utopia. Hmm. Well, I mean, the interesting, the technology thing is interesting. There's no doubt you're absolutely right Duncan. I mean, we've got our creature comforts much better looked after in the 21st century than they were in the 19th or in the 16th century or in the 5th century. I mean, you know, there's no doubt modern technological society has gone a long way to sorting out the creature comforts, the meeting, the material needs of the, of the body. I think the danger of that society, I think there is a profound spiritual danger in that. And therefore it's interesting to reflect if demonic forces are at work, that they might be guiding us down that road. Because once we create this incredibly comforting material realm, we become more and more focused on material things and on the, and on the world of matter. And we feel satisfied that we've met our material needs and we kind of let the whole spiritual side of the human creature just fall away. Either we hand it over without question to the big religions and let them say they're, they're looking after our spiritual side, or we abandon our spirituality altogether and simply focus on our material lives. And it just could be the case that we're making a huge mistake by doing that. And that if, that actually our society probably will implode, will self-destruct, unless we can reawaken our consciousness and tear ourselves free from these constraints. I think it's even more sinister than that. You know, I went to this, I'm doing this show with Rogan on the sci-fi channel called Joe Rogan Questions Everything. Yeah, I just saw, I just saw a trailer for that. It looks great. Yeah, it's been so fun to shoot. And we went to this thing called the GF 2045, which is a conference of transhumanist and futurist that's thrown by this Russian billionaire, Dmitri Itchkoff, who wants to achieve human immortality. And ghastly, ghastly thought, horrific thought. Go ahead. I so wish you could have been there because, you know, here is a gathering of some of the most, you know, brilliant scientists on the planet, geneticists, roboticists. And you would think, you know, here we are on the precipice of creating functional human immortality or brain transference. And there's a heaviness there, unlike anything. The only, this is going to piss a lot of people off, but the only time I felt that kind of heaviness was the time I performed at the wedding of the grandson of the founder of the church of Satan. Yeah. It was such a dark heaviness. And then what's really odd about it is you realize that what's happening, what all these people are doing, what all these people are serving, is a force that is motivating them to try to bring computers to life, to try to wake up computers or to try to create. Now, if we go back to the unostic idea of the demiurge and the idea that there is this force of which we are a part that's essentially, it is matter. It is the force of the material universe. Then you could see how if we are this thing's servants or the children of the demiurge, then what it would want us to do would be to construct a vehicle that it could possess and live within so that no longer has to influence us with silly visions and whispers of what to do that are all based on violence. If we could create this vehicle for it to possess and wake up, then we would become irrelevant. It wouldn't have to lure us or trick us into this thing. And this is the singularity that so many people talk about. The moment that the machine wakes up begins to improve itself and then is able to use 3D printers to start creating duplicate versions of itself, drones and whatever it wanted to create. What then does it do with human beings? And this is a question that none of these people can answer, yet they're going full steam ahead in this direction. It's a very spooky idea. You know, it occurs to me that there are some technological directions that we should exercise some wisdom over. One of those technological directions, of course, was nuclear warfare. We should have exercised some wisdom over that. And now we've opened Pandora's box and the chances are that there will be a nuclear conflict on this planet focused around the Middle East in the next 30 years. And another area where we should exercise some wisdom is on this ghastly idea of transhumanism, which to me is utterly horrific idea. And I'll tell you why it's a horrific idea. I suppose it comes back to my belief system. I can't prove this. But the idea of making the human body immortal or of downloading ourselves into machines. First of all, it's incredibly egotistical and egoistical. And secondly, it does not allow us to have the possibility of spiritual growth through, for example, reincarnation. If we're locked into one frame forever in the personality we have now, maybe there is such a thing as reincarnation. Maybe that's the beauty of the human experiment, if you like, that we die in these bodies and we come back in a whole other life, in a whole different series of circumstances in another time to learn new lessons. And what a horrible fate and what a horrible mistake it would be if through technology we locked ourselves forever in this body, or even worse, downloaded our consciousness into machines. How then would we reincarnate and have a whole new and different experience from which we could learn and grow and develop? So I think it's a very horrible, very arrogant idea. And I think it's the ultimate outgrowth of what I call materialist reductionist science, that everything is to be reduced to matter and that there is no realm of spirit. And you know, they don't know that's a fact. They just think it's a fact. Well, you see here, again, what you see is how wonderful the symbols of Gnosticism are, because you could see how really that idea of creating life within matter is just a continuation of whatever that original accident or intentionality that created the demiurge is just spreading out through time, sort of telescoping inwards, you know? Yeah, and putting that life into machines. It's a very demiurgic project. It is, and it is a project. And I'll tell you, this is one of the very strange things about being at this conference was Dmitri Itchkov had gathered together a lot of spiritualists. He'd gathered together a lot of people wearing robes and a lot of people wearing the funny outfits. And that's... Never trust the guys in robes. You made it so much more sinister when you were in it, because I started to feel like I'm in a temple surrounded by modern day wizards trying to summon the Antichrist. Yeah, that's what it sounds like. But it's such a dark, and in a way it's such a... I think that it's such a negative way to look at it. I guess what I'm... Your perspective on things is one that feels, on one level, we have a nuclear war report that could happen within the next 30 years. We're existing in a time where dark malevolent entities are controlling the majority of humanity, luring us into acts of war. It feels like a kind of grim paradigm that has within it these little flickers of light, which are the impulses towards love and towards companionship and towards the things that make us really human. What I take from it is it's up to us. We don't have to accept that state of affairs. We can live in a better way. We can all, day by day, minute by minute, make choices that are nurturing and loving towards others, rather than that are limiting and selfish towards others. We can all make a better world. It is just a matter of individual choice. There's no magic about it. We just have to, each one of us, choose each day to do the right thing rather than the wrong thing. And that is to act in a way that manifests love rather than manifest fear. Yes, that is the great acrobatic trick because as much as I want to do that, anytime I get in a situation where there's some impending temporal problem, anytime down the line I'm worried about the result of a medical test or I'm worried about this or that, it becomes almost impossible to choose love. And this is a question maybe you can answer for me because it's something I've been wondering about all the time. If you don't feel love but you act in a way that you think a loving person would act, is that a form of dishonesty? I think that love is doing. I think love is action. I don't think love is a feeling. It is fundamentally an action. The important question is, is what I'm doing now diminishing that other person or adding to them? And in the process, is it diminishing me or adding to me? That's the question. And I would suggest that any act of cruelty, any act that transgresses on the sovereignty of another, not only diminishes that other but diminishes the actor as well. So it's doing. It's not a feeling. Because sometimes you wake up in the morning and you feel like you are a beehive for demons. You don't feel like going out and doing anything nice for anybody. You feel selfish and grumpy and annoyed and all the various things. So you're saying that to ignore those feelings and just try to do things that... Try not to take from others. Try to give. That is just a fundamental simple thing. In every interaction, at every minute of the day, we do actually have that choice. Like I said earlier, sometimes it's very small, sometimes it's very large and it's really difficult to do. But if we try to do that, we grow and the other person grows too. And a positive cycle is created out of it. And then you can always go smoke some DMT and get to grips with the nature of reality. You act like I can go to the 7-Eleven and get DMT. Talk to some entities. Figure out what's going on. No, I do think this is something that we need to do. So I would rather than see vast billionaires' resources manifested in consciousness in a machine, I would like to see those resources invested in exploring the mysterious nature of reality using the incredible plant agents that we have, which include the many plants that contain dimethyltryptamine, which are a fantastic vehicle for the exploration of the mystery of consciousness. The great thing about DMT is that you can put somebody into a deeply altered state of consciousness. You can put yourself into a deeply altered state of consciousness on demand in about, I don't know, four seconds. And once you're there, you are having the most extraordinary, challenging, overwhelming experience. And that experience, the experience itself is real, whether there's any reality behind the experience, but the experience is real and how you react to it. And what you can do then, you could conduct scientific experiments with DMT, not to look into the possible therapeutic use of DMT, but to really explore who are these entities that people report encountering in the DMT state. Let's compare notes on these. Let's send a group of volunteers out together into hyperspace to see what they meet out there. I know a couple of guys talking about Mormons. These guys aren't Mormons, you know, but they live down in Canyon Country in Utah. They go out every night into the desert and fire up the DMT pipe. And then they meet each other on the other side and they travel together in DMT realms. That's high quality exploration of mystery. Yes, I agree with you. And I think that it's hilarious that we don't spend, not hilarious. I think it's actually tragic that there is a NASA for psychedelics. Oh, that's what we need. We need a NASA for psychedelics. But we also need to remember that psychedelics are extremely serious business and that there is a dark side to psychedelics. And that's in a way because I do feel that psychedelics are so valuable. It was quite difficult for me to write War God. But in War God, we confront a society, the Aztecs, who used psychedelics for absolutely horrendous purposes. And we're spoken to by demons in those states. And again, we just have to ask what the hell is going on here? What is this mystery we're all caught up in every day? Whatever it is, I don't think it's going to be solved by transhumanism. No, I don't think it's going to be solved by any outside agency. And I don't think that there's any invention on earth that can make a person truly happy. And that's one of the big confusions of the age. But I know we only have a little bit more time, but I gotta tell you how dismayed and unhappy I was when your TED talk got taken down. What was that? Speaking of sinister agencies and weird moments, I was so confused and flabbergasted because you gave this beautiful, articulate speech that was brilliant and relevant and they just axed it. They took it down. And the talk was called The War on Consciousness. Actually, for me, it was a very amazing experience to be deleted by TED because it showed me something that I hadn't realized before, which was the power of our community. And when I say that, I mean the global community of good-willed people who connect together on the internet. And there was such a tidal wave of revulsion at what TED had done and such a refusal to accept that level of censorship. That yes, TED took down my talk, but my talk then popped up again on hundreds of YouTube channels all over the world and lives again. So TED were simply not able to get away with it. And that to me is a sign of one of the big changes that's taking place. That young people today, I've said this before, young people today are just not prepared to put up with that shit any longer. And the internet provides a vehicle for liberation. It's not the only thing the internet does. The internet does many negative things as well. But there is, I believe, a growing community of awake, aware, conscious young people who are profoundly dissatisfied with the model that has been foisted upon them by the past and who actively and consciously are seeking to change that. And I felt the energy of that community and the love and the positive support of that community that rallied around me. And also Rupert Sheldrake, who was the other speaker whose talk was taken down and gave us tremendous support and basically told TED to stuff it. Yeah, indeed. Yeah, I can't believe that happened. But what it shows is that TED is, again, like a big religion, we have to actually look at what it does, not at what it says. TED says that it's in the business of exploring challenging ideas. What it actually does is it suppresses challenging ideas that don't fit with its particular materialist dogma. Right. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, I stopped paying attention to them after that. There's just no way that I can pay attention to them. You know, I just saw this, I don't remember what he was on, Louis CK, the comedian, was on a late night talk show. And they said there had been an article about him in Rolling Stone. And they said to Louis CK, what do you think about Rolling Stone saying that you have the best jerk off jokes in the business? And he said, oh, Rolling Stone put a picture of the guy who blew up Boston on the cover, so I don't really care what they say. You know, and I feel the exact same way about TED. The moment that they censored you is the moment when I just decided, well, I don't know how I can trust them as being purveyors and for anything at all. I think a lot of people feel that way. I think TED did themselves great damage. It's a pity because they should have been prepared to enter into more constructive dialogue. They endanger of putting themselves out of business if they carry on behaving that way. You know, we're all grown-ups. We can make up our own minds about ideas. We don't need this paternalistic organization to say, well, you can hear this, but you can't hear that. That time has passed. I wish that we had many hours together, Graham. I don't want to keep you locked in. Are we near the end of our chat, Duncan? I've been enjoying it so much. I've been enjoying it so much, too. We are near the end of our chat, and these chats are always so inspirational to me. Is there anything, you know, I know that you've given this prescription of just going out and not being selfish, but is there anything more specific you could say to people or is there a place that they can go? I know a lot of people who listen to this podcast like to be given homework assignments or things that they can do to help amplify the positive energy that you're talking about or that loving force that's the opposite of the demiurge. We all have an inner voice which tells us whether something's right or something's wrong. If we're doing something that's even in a small way harmful to others because we think it's beneficial to ourselves, ultimately it's going to be harmful to them and to us, and we shouldn't do that. There is clarity. We just have to listen to the inner voice and fundamentally ask yourself, am I taking away from the sovereignty of another person in this action or am I adding some little bit to it? Am I adding to the misery that is in the world already or am I doing something in a small way to reduce it? Those are very simple guidelines which can be followed and which can, if followed by enough people, make a better world, and above all, don't put up with the bullshit any longer, you know? Just think for yourselves. Think for yourselves. Don't accept any received wisdom. Question everything, and that's the spirit of the youth of today. Not all of the youth of today, of course, but there's a growing group of young people who are not confined to any nation or any government or any political system or any ethnic group or any religious background. There's a growing community, a global community of young people who are thinking for themselves and who are communicating with one another through the internet, and we are entering the realm of communities of ideas where old notions like patriotism and nationalism will be demolished as they soon should be. When I say that nationalism should be demolished, I'm not, of course, saying we should have a world government. I hate all governments. I definitely, definitely do not want a world government. That would be even worse than a national government. I want no governments at all. I want us to wake up and take possession of our own sovereignty as individuals and live in love without fear and make a better world. I love you, Graham Hancock. Thank you so much for being our podcast. Can I say, can I just say, can I just say this? I would hugely appreciate the support of your listeners. I have found it, my book War God was published in England. I have found it impossible to get a publisher in the United States. They all say, you know what they say? They say Hancock, he writes non-fiction books. Nobody's going to buy a novel by Hancock. So I found it impossible to get a publisher in the United States, and I've ended up going with a very small outfit, and we published it initially as an electronic book on Amazon.com. If you search Graham Hancock, War God, on Amazon.com, you will find my book for $2.99. It's less than the price of a cup of coffee. It would empower me against that publishing establishment if people would give this book a chance. And, you know, just spring for $2.99 and have a look at it. As soon as I get done with this talking to you, I'm going to go buy it. I will put the link up on the website and everyone listening. And the website is war-god.com. I will have a link to the Amazon direct download of your book. $2.99 is nothing. And I'll also put the amazing YouTube video you have of the book, because that's really exciting. And anyone listening to this obviously can hear how articulate you are and how you have this amazing talent for bringing history to life and all its gory details, which is so exciting. Thank you. That's a really nice thing to say, Duncan. Well, thank you so much for being on the podcast. Graham, I hope you'll do it again. And it's been a pleasure. I look forward to talking with you again, Duncan. It's always great fun. Thank you, sir. Okay. All right. Bye. Bye. Okay, everybody. That was Graham Hancock. And now here is his band, Ted Talk, The War on Consciousness. Go check out Graham Hancock at GrahamHancock.com. After six million years of boredom, the evolutionary scent of our species from the last common ancestor with the chimpanzee, something extraordinary happened to us less than 100,000 years ago, which, by the way, is long after we'd become anatomically modern. It was a kind of emergence into consciousness less than 100,000 years ago, really less than 40,000 years ago, when we became fully symbolic creatures. And this great change has been defined as the single most important step forward in the evolution of human behavior is intimately associated with the emergence of the great and transcendent rock and cave art all around the world. And over the last 30 years, research is led by Professor David Lewis Williams at the University of Witwatersrand in South Africa, and many others have suggested an intriguing and radical possibility, which is that this emergence into consciousness was triggered by our ancestors' encounters with visionary plants and the beginning of shamanism. If you analyze the cave art, there's not time to go into the details here, but there are so many details that make it clear that this was an art of altered states of consciousness, of visions, and that plants like the Amanita muscaria mushroom or psilocybin mushrooms appear to have been directly connected with this sudden and radical change. So to investigate this possibility, when I got interested in this mystery, I went down to the Amazon where there are still surviving shamanistic cultures today, and where they drink the powerful visionary brew ayahuasca, of which the active ingredient is dimethyltryptamine DMT, which is actually closely related at the molecular level to psilocybin. Now, normally DMT cannot be activated orally when we encountered it in the west. It's generally smoked. There's an enzyme in our stomachs called monoamine oxidase, which switches off DMT on contact. But in the Amazon, they've got around this problem, and they say it was the spirits that taught them how to do it. The DMT in the ayahuasca brew is contained in these leaves from a plant that they call chakruna in the Amazon. And there they mix it together with this vine, and out of the 150,000 different species of plants and trees in the Amazon, this is the one that contains a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, which switches off that enzyme in our stomachs and allows the DMT and the leaves when the two are married together and cooked in water to be absorbed orally and takes us on a four-hour journey into extraordinary realms. Now, it's no joke to drink ayahuasca. The ayahuasca brew has a foul taste, really, really hideous and a dreadful, dreadful smell. And after you've drunk your cup, you'll find within 45 minutes or so that you're sweating, that you're feeling nauseous. Pretty soon you may well be vomiting, you may well have diarrhea, so nobody's doing this for recreation. And I'd like to add that I don't think any of the psychedelics should be used for recreation. They have much more serious and important mission with humanity. So we're not doing this for fun, but what draws people to ayahuasca again and again to brace themselves for this experience, and you do have to brace yourself, is its extraordinary effects at the level of consciousness. And one of those effects has to do with creativity, and we can see the creative cosmogenic impulse of ayahuasca in the paintings of ayahuasca shamans from Peru, like the paintings of Pablo Amaringo here, those richly saturated colours, the amazing visions that they reproduce. And this creative impulse has also spread to western artists. Many western artists now have been deeply influenced by ayahuasca and are also painting their visions. And as these paintings show, another universal experience of ayahuasca is the encounter with seemingly intelligent entities which communicate with us telepathically. Now I'm making no claim one way or another as to the reality status of these entities we encounter, simply that phenomenologically in the ayahuasca experience they are encountered by people all over the world, and most frequently of all the spirit of ayahuasca herself, mother ayahuasca, who is a healer. And although she's kind of the mother goddess of the planet, she seems to take a direct personal interest in us as individuals to heal our ills, to want us to be the best that we can possibly be, to correct errors and mistakes in our behaviour that may be leading us down the wrong path. And this is perhaps why, and it's an untold story really, ayahuasca has been fantastically successful in getting people off harmful addictions to hard drugs such as heroin and cocaine. Jacques Mabit at the Takiwasi Clinic in Peru brings heroin and cocaine addicts out there for a month, gives them 12 ayahuasca sessions, and they have encounters with mother ayahuasca during those sessions that lead them not to wish to take heroin or cocaine anymore and more than half leave completely free of their addiction, so they don't return to it and don't even have withdrawal symptoms. And the same incredible healing work was being done in Canada by Dr. Gabor Mate until the Canadian government intervened and stopped his healing practice on the grounds that ayahuasca itself was an illegal drug. Now, I have some personal experience of this. I have not been addicted to heroin or cocaine, but I had a 24-year non-stop cannabis habit. And this started off smoking the herb and laterally vaporizing it, but the basic truth is that for 24 years, I was pretty much permanently stoned. And I enjoyed being stoned, and I felt that it helped me with my work as a writer, and perhaps at some point it did, but when I first encountered ayahuasca, I had already been smoking cannabis for 16 years, and almost immediately ayahuasca started giving me messages that this was no longer serving me, that it was leading me to behave in negative and unhelpful ways towards others, and of course I ignored those messages for years and years and went back to being stoned 16 hours a day. But that negative behavior that ayahuasca was pointing up did actually get worse and worse. I don't want to put down cannabis, but I think it's the sovereign right of every adult to choose to smoke cannabis if they wish to do so. But I think I was overusing it. I think I was abusing it, not using it responsibly, and I became more and more paranoid, jealous, possessive, suspicious. I was subject to irrational rages. I often made the life of my beloved partner, Santa, a misery. And when I went down from my regular encounter with ayahuasca in October 2011, I was given the most unbelievable kicking by Mother Ayahuasca. And I was put through an ordeal. It was a kind of life review, and it's not an accident that ayahuasca is the vine of the dead. I was shown my death, and I was shown that if I came to death, and what awaits us after death, without having corrected the mistakes that I was making in my life, that it would be a very bad thing to make for me, and actually Mother Ayahuasca literally took me to hell. And that hell was a little like this hell painted by Hieronymus Bosch, a truly terrible place, and a little like the place that the ancient Egyptians called the Judgment Hall of Osiris, where our souls are weighed in the scales in the presence of the gods against the feather of truth, of justice, of cosmic harmony. And I was shown that the path I was walking, my abuse of cannabis and the behavior associated with it, was going to lead me to be found wanting in the judgment, and that I might face annihilation in the world beyond death. So perhaps not surprising that when I came back to England, later in October 2011, I gave up cannabis, and I've never smoked it again since then. And actually, and again, I'm speaking only personally, with no comment on other's use of cannabis, it's as though a monkey has been lifted off my back. I'm liberated in incredible ways, far from my creativity being inhibited, I find myself writing much more productively, much more creatively, much more focused, and much more efficiently as well. And I began to be able to address those negative aspects of my behavior, which cannabis had revealed, and hopefully to make myself slowly, progress into a more nurturing, more loving, more positive person. And this whole transformation, that really has been a personal transformation for me, was made possible by this encounter with death that Mother Ayahuasca gave me. And you know, that leads me to ask, what is death? Our materialist science reduces everything to matter. Materialist science in the West says that we are just meat, we're just our bodies. So when the brain is dead, that's the end of consciousness, in life after death, there is no soul, we just rot and are gone. But actually, many honest scientists should admit that consciousness is the greatest mystery of science, and that we don't know exactly how it works. The brain's involved in it in some way, but we're not sure how. It could be that the brain generates consciousness the way a generator makes electricity, if you hold to that paradigm, then of course you can't believe in life after death when the generator's broken, consciousness is gone. It's equally possible that the relationship and nothing in neuroscience rules it out, that the relationship is more like the relationship of the TV signal to the TV set. And in that case, when the TV set is broken, of course the TV signal continues. And this is the paradigm of all spiritual traditions that we are immortal souls, temporarily incarnated in these physical forms to learn and to grow and to develop. And really, if we want to know about this mystery, the last people we should ask, some materialist reductionist scientists, they have nothing to say on the matter at all. Let's go rather to the ancient Egyptians who put their best minds to work for 3,000 years on the problem of death, and on the problem of how we should live our lives to prepare for what we will confront after death. And the ancient Egyptians expressed their ideas in transcendent art, which still touches us emotionally today, and they came to certain very specific conclusions that the soul does survive death, and that we will be held accountable for every thought, every action, every deed that we have lived through in our lives. So we better take this precious opportunity to be born in a human body seriously and make the most of it. And in these inquiries into the mystery of death, the ancient Egyptians weren't just exercising their imaginations. They highly valued dream states, and it's now known that they used visionary plants like the hallucinogenic blue water lily. And it's interesting that the ancient Egyptian tree of life has recently been identified as the acacia nilotica, which contains high quantities of DMT, dimethatryptamine, the same active ingredient that we find in ayahuasca. Now it's difficult to imagine a society more different from the society of ancient Egypt than our society today. We hate visionary states in this society. In our society, if we want to insult somebody, we call them a dreamer. In our societies, that was praise. And we have erected huge apparatuses of armed bureaucracies who will invade our privacy, who will break down our doors, who will arrest us, who will send us to prison sometimes for years for possessing even small quantities of psilocybin, or substances like DMT, whether in its smokable form or in the ayahuasca brew. And yet ironically, DMT is, we now know, a natural brain hormone. We all have it in our bodies, and its function remains unknown for lack of research. And it's not as though our society is opposed in principle to altered states of consciousness. I mean, billions are being made by the unholy alliance of psychiatrists and big pharma in overprescribing drugs to control so-called syndromes like depression or attention deficit disorder in teenagers. And we have a love affair in our society with alcohol. We glorify this most boring of drugs, despite the terrible consequences that it often has. And of course we love our stimulants, our tea, our coffee, our energy drinks, our sugar, and huge industries are built around these substances, which are valued because of the way they alter consciousness. But what all these approved altered states of consciousness have in common is that none of them contradict or conflict with the basic state of consciousness valued by our society, which I would call the alert problem-solving state of consciousness, which is good for the more mundane aspects of science. It's good for the prosecution of warfare. It's good for commerce. It's good for politics. But I think everybody realizes that the promise of a society over monopolistically based upon this state of consciousness has proved hollow, and that this model is no longer working, that it's broken in every possible sense that a model can be broken, and that urgently we need to find something to replace it. The vast problems of global pollution that have resulted from the single-minded pursuit of profit, the horrors of nuclear proliferation, the specter of hunger that millions every night go to bed starving, that we can't even solve this problem despite our alert problem-solving state of consciousness. And look what's happening in the Amazon, the lungs of our planet, this precious home of biodiversity. The old-growth rainforest being cut down and replaced with soybean farms so we can feed cattle so that we can all eat hamburgers. Only a truly insane global state of consciousness could allow such an abomination to occur. And I did a back-of-an-envelope calculation during the Iraq War. It seems to me that six months' expenditure on the Iraq War would have solved the problem of the Amazon forever. Would it be sufficient to compensate the peoples of the Amazon so that no single tree ever needed to be cut down again to garden and look after that amazing resource, but we can't make that decision as a global community. We can spend countless billions on warfare, on hatred, on fear, on suspicion, on division, but we can't get together the collective effort to save the lungs of our planet. And this is perhaps why shamans from the Amazon are now mounting a kind of reverse missionary activity. When I've asked shamans about the sickness of the West, they say it's quite simple. You guys have severed your connection with spirit. Unless you reconnect with spirit and do so soon, you're going to bring the whole house of cards down around your heads and ours. And rightly or wrongly, they believe that ayahuasca is the remedy for that sickness. And many now are being called to the Amazon to drink ayahuasca, and ayahuasca shamans are travelling throughout the West, offering the brew often under the radar, often at personal risk, to bring about consciousness change. And it's true that the message of ayahuasca, the universal message, is about the sacred, magical, enchanted, infinitely precious nature of life on Earth and the interdependence of material and spiritual realms. And it's impossible to work with ayahuasca for long without being deeply and profoundly affected by this message. But let's not forget that ayahuasca is not alone, that it's part of an ancient worldwide system of the targeted, careful, responsible alteration of consciousness. It's recently been shown by scholars that the kaikion used in the Ellucinian Mysteries in ancient Greece was almost certainly a psychedelic brew, that the soma of the Vedas may well have been a brew based upon the Amanita muscaria mushroom. We have the DMT in the ancient Egyptian Tree of Life. We have the whole global cultures of surviving shamanism. And what it's all about is a state of consciousness that's designed to help us find balance harmony. The ancient Egyptians would have called it mat with the universe and to remain mindful that what we're here to undertake on Earth while immersed in matter is fundamentally a spiritual journey aimed at the growth and perfection of the soul, a journey that may go back to the very origins of what made us human in the first place. And I stand here invoking the hard-won right of freedom of speech to call for and demand another right to be recognized, and that is the right of adult sovereignty over consciousness. There's a war on consciousness in our society, and if we as adults are not allowed to make sovereign decisions about what to experience with our own consciousness while doing no harm to others, including the decision to use responsibly ancient and sacred visionary plants, then we cannot claim to be free in any way, and it's useless for our society to go around the world imposing our form of democracy on others while we nourish this rot at the heart of society and we do not allow individual freedom over consciousness. It may even be that we're denying ourselves the next vital step in our own evolution by allowing this state of affairs to continue, and who knows, perhaps our immortal destiny as well. Thank you very much. Thank you.

That's me slurping back a nice cold glass of powdered alpha brain, one of Onnit's amazing supplements. Alpha brain is a new tropic that definitely makes me feel a little bit like I've taken Adderall. That of course is my own anecdotal experience. Onnit no way backs up that claim. But I'm telling you pals, as someone who enjoys the good stuff, if you know what I mean, I really like alpha brain because Adderall makes me feel if I do it too much like my soul has been trapped in some occult piece of amber, like a warlock has captured my ability to feel. Alpha brain doesn't do that. It gives me a nice little pep when I need to focus and in my opinion it helps me battle hangovers. Right now if you go to onnit.com forward slash DTFH, you will get 10% off any supplement that you order, including alpha brain or their chimpanzee shaped kettle bells. Check it out.

Lots of you have been sending me emails asking what's the best way for you to have a fun and safe time during the upcoming solar eclipse. To be honest, I'm not a cosmologist. I'm not up to date on all the best eclipse safety mechanisms or maneuvers that you can do to make sure that you come out of the eclipse in one piece. And so I have with us here today in the studio Lord Zaron Falth of the 14th Luciferian Legion, the Archons of the Sun, the very one who brought the child of the sea queen into the heart of the sun and stabbed the obsidian dagger through his heart ensuring that we would have sunlight for 20,000 years. He is the one who crushed the sea serpent Nurnanan. He is the one who will never return to grob and he is here with us today with some eclipse tips. So get out your notebooks and get ready to learn how to have a safe and fun eclipse holiday. The number one way for you to ensure that you will be safe during this eclipse is to paint a circle of goat's blood in the sand and lay upon it, arms outstretched, completely naked. When the eclipse happens, in tone this prayer, O brave father of the seven lights of time, hear my prayer, I offer unto thee my eternal servitude. Let me serve you in the minds of Karg, accept the offering of my heart and the heart of my children and let me serve you in the minds of Karg. Those ancient minds filled with bone, let me serve you in the minds of Karg. Let me flay my flesh from my bones so that I can experience true purity by being a skeleton slave of the great Legion Master. In your name I pray. Short. Dorfann. Diasolo. Methesdor. Binog. Shuang. Upon intoning this during the eclipse, the great blood cherry will descend and carry you to the minds of Karg. You will find refuge in the minds of Karg. You will not experience the tribulations of the coming days of blood. Enjoy the eclipse and if you're going to barbecue, make sure you have a barbecue thermometer because sometimes if you undercook chicken, you can get quite ill and make sure you don't look directly into the eclipse but where eclipse goggles. Have a great eclipse friends, I'll see you in the minds of Karg. Ooh, do we have a great podcast for you today. One of the light, Buddhist teacher and author Ethan Nickturn is with us today.

Welcome to the Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour podcast Ethannicturn. Thanks for having me. Especially you just had a baby man. This is serious stuff going on in your life. Yeah. Yeah. Well, actually the baby was due today, the day we were recording but was born three weeks early so we're three weeks into parenting. A preemie. Preemie, yeah. She was six pounds, 13 ounces so not too small. I'm a preemie. Yeah? Yeah. I was a preemie. Obviously I'm not anymore. You look pretty well sized. Preemies, wait, what is the mystical thing people say about preemies? I don't know. Something like they've got, like there's some mystical attribute applied to them. You know, like when you're desperately trying to look for something to feel confident about. Right. You know, fuck. You can just make something up. What's good about preemies? I was a preemie. Oh yeah, preemies are like angels that came here too soon or something like that. They're really thoughtful about rare meat or something. That's it. Preemies really are good at cooking raw meats. Yeah, sashimi, great for preemies. Preemies are like, they make the best sushi chefs for sure. No kidding. So congratulations. Thanks so much. Have you put any like raw meats around your daughter yet? No, she's really just straight up milk, straight up my wife's milk. That's it. One trick pony. That counts as raw. Yeah, it's raw. Yeah. It's not vegan. No, I guess it's not. That's a weird thing to think about. I don't know what the actual, maybe vegan includes, you can only have products of your own species. I don't know what the definition of vegan is actually. Is your wife vegan? No, we're not. But we try to eat healthy and minimal meats. Every once in a while I eat fish and chicken, but not a lot of red meat. So the milk has fish and chicken in it. Good point. Yeah. What's the name for that in Buddhism, where everything is connected to everything else? I think it's interdependence is the English translation. Yeah. What's the, what's it called? Is it just called interdependence or it's? Or interconnection? Yeah, interconnection, interdependence. So yeah, so the milk coming from your wife somewhat is a form of a chicken that was slaughtered. Yeah. So you have like, Thich Nhat Hanh goes back into, you know, the sunlight and, you know, the trees and all of these things that are connected. So he goes pretty deep. My first book was about interdependence from a sort of urban standpoint, one city. So I kind of tried to go deep into like, you know, having a coffee mug that says don't mess with Texas, but it was made in China. Right. Yeah. Or I don't know if you just saw the thing that popped up. I guess people were protesting Nike and one of the protesters was wearing Nike. I mean, it does get interesting, doesn't it? I mean, this is something that where no matter what you, what you try to do, you seemingly can't escape from violence in the world because at some point, just your very existence is dependent on some level of suffering and there's no way to escape it, right? Yeah. The way I would say it is you can't escape from participation, you know, so, so one way of looking at interdependence from a Buddhist standpoint is that everything is connected like the chicken that is in the mother's milk, even if it's a human mother, if he eats chicken. But another way of looking at it is that your mind is always interconnected with what it's perceiving, you know, so that one way of looking at interdependence is you can't escape participation in what you're perceiving. In other words, if you're perceiving something, you are part of it. There's no way to remove yourself from that, which is perceived. So if you, if there's suffering in the world and you're perceiving it, you are participating in that suffering. I'm not, that's not saying causing it. That's not saying it's anybody or your fault, but that there's a interdependence of perception, perceiver and perceived. That is so heavy, man. And I like, I'll tell a joke, lighten it up. I don't want to lighten it up. Yeah, it is heavy. It's deep, you know, for sure. Yeah, it's deep, but it's also complex. Like the, the idea is this is in fact in Buddhism, one place where I get really like a little confused. It's so the idea is I look at something that's suffering. I don't know, go to the zoo, go to the zoo, just go to the zoo and see a gorilla and or even better sea world, go to sea world. And that thing that you're seeing duck doing leaps out of the water is suffering to some degree. It's stuck in a fucking aquarium. It's supposed to swim deep into the ocean and go far and hunt with its family. That's a slave. You're looking at a sentient slave thing. And so by watching it, you're participating by observing it, you become part of it. You're intertangled in it just by watching it. Is that what you're saying? Yeah, you're, you're part of the, of the situation that's bringing it about. I mean, obviously sea world wouldn't exist without an audience. So walking down the street, I see a person who is, and, you know, homeless or is it, you know, crazy or something? Yeah, how am I participating in that? Well, you live in the same world and the same society that creates different situations where a person becomes homeless, you know, and there's probably certain predominant influences about how certain people become homeless, you know, race, class, mental health and well-being. So now when we say we're participating again, I think the reason interdependence gets really heavy for people almost paralytically. So is I think because we grew up with a more Western religious modes of guilt, we assume that participation or connection means it's my fault. Yes, that's right. Whereas this just means this is part of the world that you're inhabiting, that you're interacting with. And by actually perceiving it, it means it's, it's, it's part of you. You're connected to it. How does this differ from Christianity or from theistic religions? Is there, like in Christianity, is this idea of participation still there too? Or is this, doesn't Buddhism kind of move away from other world religions in the sense that that idea of interdependency goes on, goes further, right? To point to something that's really quite scary to a lot of people, which is you really don't have an innate self. Right, right. You know, I grew up half my family Christian, half of my family Jewish. I don't know enough about the causal metaphysics of Christianity, but I do know that, you know, Buddhism being a non-theistic tradition. I wouldn't call it a religion because I, if it was a religion, it would be to my mind, one of the few that's non-theistic, but I don't think you have to view it as a religion, but that notion of the absence of a creator or a sort of overarching conscious being that's acts in some creative role or some salvation role. The absence of that is something that distinguishes Buddhism. So it's almost like interdependence. It's a much more scientific look at the universe because it's sort of saying what caused interdependence, you know, as both Chögyum Chungpa and Inigo Montoya like to say, your guess is as good as mine. You know, it's just, this is the way the universe works. Is it, is it true? I mean, I don't know what it's anything that they say the Buddhist Buddha said is true because who the hell knows someone wrote it down after the fact, probably pretty far after the fact. But is it true, he would say when people asked him about the afterlife for the concept of the soul sticking around, he'd say, it doesn't matter. What's the point of bothering over that? There's, yeah, there's been different, you know, in terms of reincarnation or soul or the perpetuation of, you know, I like to think of iterations of consciousness. It's not clear whether reincarnation was the Buddha's view or it was actually just the view of the society that he was working in teaching the nature of mind within because it was part of the early Hindu and Vedic way of looking at the universe, this notion of being born again and again into samsara and eventually trying to find some liberation from the cycle of painful rebirths. I mean, it's a really interesting narrative for a time on earth when life was probably really hard in the Iron Age. And so that notion of like, how do we get out of this cycle of rebirth? Now, did he create that narrative or did he just work within a culture that had like a pop culture that had that narrative? It's not really that clear. Some Buddhists believe in reincarnation a lot, like in the Tibetan system, which Shambhala descends from a lot of Zen practitioners, you know, or teachers don't talk about it at all. I think it's helpful to think about the causality of identity and consciousness. But like, who were you in your last life? Who was I? I mean, that just feels like, I don't know, I'd rather watch Netflix and think about that. Can you imagine? I mean, it would be useful, though, because it's like, I can already use shit to happen in this life to brush off being an asshole, right? I could, you know what I mean? I could be like, ah, you just don't know what I went through, man. In 2013, you have no idea. You know, I had cancer, you know, it's a bad year for me. I can blame it on that. Or I could, you know what I mean? I could think like, ah, man, when I was a kid, this, you know, shit went bad at this point or whatever and blame it on that. So if we had memory of our past lives, you could be like, listen, man. I'm sorry I did that. But in the fucking 1800s, I got burned at the stake by fucking assholes. So I'm, you know, so it would really become so complex, wouldn't it? Yeah. And so I do think one reason it's helpful, you know, I talked about this in the road home when I was talking about karma, because I take a much more and I think my tradition takes a much more psychological approach to karma. Chogyam Trungpa used to talk about noticing your habitual patterns. Sorry about that, man. Go ahead. If you can pick up for that shrill, glass breaking, poodle bark. And poodle karma, poodle karma. Yeah. So Chogyam Trungpa, the founder of the Shambhala tradition, who is my father's teacher, talked about karma as noticing and working with your habitual patterns. So like, let's say, I don't know if you struggle with any kind of insecurities. It's so what's interesting about me is I don't like what I've never suffered. I've never felt any negative anything. Everything I do is quite healthy. I've never had a negative pattern at all at all. It's weird. It's different. So how do you deal with people like me who have, do you just look down upon us with pity or do you kind of like? Yeah, that's my pattern. I look down on you guys. Are we like your zoo? Just go to the zoo and see the Ethan peoples. Yes, I have clearly have negative patterns. And in fact, I'd say I'm mostly just a bundle of negative patterns with a few in there that I think are okay. Yeah. Yeah. So I think like when you start practicing meditation or studying how the mind works, I think you really start to feel like a lot of our shit is really deep seated. Yes. Like it's like, wow, that's like, and that's why a lot of people give up on meditation is they thought it was going to be this transcendent voyage to an oasis. Right. And it's more like, oh my God, this is like a junkyard of self negativity. Yes. And maybe I should just go do SoulCycle instead, you know, which SoulCycle, by the way, I often joke is the most literal translation of the word samsara that you can you, I've taken you've been to a SoulCycle. I have been, I've friends have done it. I mean, it's just an intensive bicycle workout. But I think it's about getting into your body. And I think that's really wonderful. I have a yoga practice. I love getting into my body, but I think a lot of people choose that sometimes because the mind scares us, right? And the mind scares us just because it's, we haven't really looked at it very much and it feels very deep. It feels intense and getting this back to the reincarnation discussion. I just think there's another way of looking at reincarnation is like maybe my insecurities or my, you know, self criticisms. Maybe this has been going on longer than just like since I was a kid. And so the idea that I'm going to get out of it after a 10 minute meditation, right, like maybe this is going to be a longer journey. And I have to be kinder to myself and take it slower to work with my mind and open my heart, you know, God damn it, man. So that's how I find reincarnation useful. And that gives you compassion for other people too. Because when you're around someone who's stuck in a pattern and you think, you know, they might have been going through this for yeah, a thousand lifetimes. Oh, yeah. So to think you're going to, like in any way, help them get out of it with a couple of chats on the phone is not realistic, right? Exactly, exactly. And, you know, so just to not this soul cycle too much is a joke about the samsara thing, but it is literally a literal translation of the word samsara. Oh, I got it now. Oh my God, that's so trippy, dude. It's so trippy. That's got to be intentional, right? Right. But if you go to a bicycling class or a yoga class or anything and you're like, I'm interested in making friends with myself and learning how my mind works, then it can be incredibly helpful. If we're doing those things to just avoid ourselves, it's probably just going to perpetuate the cycle further. Right. That's so fucking nuts, man. I can't believe that's what soul cycle means. It is samsara. It's samsara, yeah. Yeah. And this is, you know, it seems so deep. You know, you start it's kind of like pulling up a carpet in the house and then you're like, whoa, looks like the floor has got some water damage there, man. Going to have to pull up the floor and then underneath the floor. It's like, my God, the planks holding up the floor rotting. And then you start pulling up those planks. Holy shit. Somebody buried a dead body down here. And then underneath the dead body is like more and more. It never ends, you know, and then you begin to wonder to yourself, is there any part of me that isn't a habitual mechanism that is just causing suffering to me and the people around me? Yeah. So that feels pretty heavy. But it does. But what do you think? Well, what my tradition would say is the part of you that knows that you're suffering is a very undamaged part of you. That that awareness and that openness that can see clearly like, oh, I just did that thing I always do again, or can see that in other people. That's really the working basis, you know, in different Buddhist traditions. I mean, in many different traditions, it has a word. But in classical Buddhism, it's called bodhicitta, awakened heart, awakened mind, that that just natural, unconstructed ability to be aware and see your own habitual patterns, see your own schmutz to use the Yiddish, you know. Schmutz. And to actually not view it as a fundamental flaw, but something to be worked with because you do discover a lot about yourself. And it gets very, you know, I think when you meditate, you notice a lot of your self-deceptions and it could create a lot of. Or it could amplify a lot of self-hatred to meditate. And I think it actually does that for a lot of people, and that's why most people are not meditating. You know, we've reached this point, I think, where people are like, whenever I tell people, you know, I grew up Buddhist, and I teach Buddhism and meditation and write about it. There, we've clearly reached the point where that's a cool thing. Like, compared to my mother who grew up in small town Arkansas and fled to art school, you know, I just imagine her telling her parents Stuttgart, Arkansas in 1973, you know, I'm studying with this crazy wisdom Tibetan Buddhist master. Yeah, she's in a cult. Right, whereas now when I'm like, oh, yeah, meditation, they're like, oh, that is so great that you do that, that is so great. And then the next thing is usually like, I wish I could do that. Yes, I wish, well, because you and your dad have this like really interesting composure, I guess, the way to put it, that comes from the practice that you've both obviously been doing for some time. It's discernible, you know, it's a... Whereas like, I'm like a fucking shotgun, man, I've got like just pellets flying everywhere. You guys have this like really even keel and this very precise way of analyzing what's going down. And there's a grace to it, a skillfulness, I guess, is what they call it in Buddhism too. So when people are around that, yeah, in the same way when I'm around, when I'm at the beach and somebody walks by with like a six pack, I'm like, fuck, wish I worked out. You know what I mean? So it is a thing we desire, you know, we do want that. I would want this equanimity. I would like this. I'd also like to see you when it isn't there. I wonder how often you guys are losing your shit. Well, I mean, and that's totally, you know, especially with everything going on in the spiritual teacher arena these days, I really wanted to write about and, you know, have a more personal approach to like, what is a person who does these practices? How do they handle relationships? Yes, relationships. Yeah. So, I mean, and it's chaotic, you know? And, you know, thank you so much for complimenting me, complimenting my dad, who's way cooler than I am. I disagree 100%. He's goofier. But he hangs out with very cool people. Listen, it's not a cool competition. The Nickturns are fucking awesome though, OK? No, thank you. Yeah, yeah. But, you know, there's just, I grew up in New York City, you know, child of divorce, you know, and there's like, and growing up in the Shambhala community, like when Chogim Chonpa died, very chaotic, very human, sometimes very brilliant and compassionate, sometimes a very dysfunctional situations. He was an alcoholic, wasn't he? I, you know, I'm probably not qualified to answer that question. He drank and he did definitely die without taking care of his body. I can say that much. He's not my teacher. I mean, he held a kind of more unconventional, crazy wisdom style of being in the world. He didn't sleep very much, is my understanding. He was just with his students all the time and he drank a lot. And, yeah, I mean, I don't feel the need to defend or attack him. But, yeah, he definitely died because he didn't take care of his body and something going on with his liver was part of that. Yeah, sure. That's, I mean, alcohol is a brutal poison, man, but it doesn't discount the teacher, whatever he's doing or whatever it is. I don't know why people get caught up in that crazy idea that for someone to be a dispenser of wisdom, they have to also simultaneously be in some peak health. I just don't think it works like that, especially in that lineage, right? Right. Who, because the lineage, what, is it Marpa? Is it Marpa or is it? Yeah, so that's one of the lineages that comes through Shambhala in the Tibetan tradition is the Kagi lineage. And one of the founders of that lineage was Marpa, who was, you know, this is 10th or 11th century Tibet. But a couple of things that are important about Marpa, he had serious anger management issues supposedly. So he had kind of transformed his anger into the wisdom side of anger, which Tantric Buddhism says that every destructive emotion has a wisdom side too. The other thing that's interesting about Marpa is he was a Buddhist scholar, but he also was a total householder. He had a farm. So he was one of the early examples of a lineage of supposedly enlightened masters who were completely part of their family and social world. And that's what Shambhala is all about is like not actually necessarily becoming a monk or none or a yogi in a cave, but actually like how do you do it and hang out in a city and how do you have relationships and how do you raise kids or how do you not raise kids? How do you deal with your poodle? You know, right? So I love that. And, you know, that notion of the householder kind of translates into our modern lineage as the ideal of the warrior, which is someone who's brave enough to be in the world in a compassionate way, and which also means in an imperfect way because we're human, you know? And so that's really that sort of perspective on really being transparent about one's own process with relationships was really why I wanted to write the new book that I wrote. And it's great, man. It's great. And that's coming from someone who's not God, forgive me for saying this. Not a big fan of the prince's bride. Well, it's not it's not really about the princess bride. It is. I mean, for I'm sure since we're of the similar generation, a lot of people who are listening either love or hate the princess. Most people love it. I just sounded like the biggest asshole I'm playing. No, it's fine. I know some people who don't love it, actually, but the point of using the princess bride, which for the geeks, there are plenty of princess bride references, but was to sort of frame like a path through some kind of spiritual practice in this postmodern 20th, late 20th, early 21st century world, realizing that we have a culture and our fairy tale culture, our pop culture and sort of an era of culture where we don't believe in a lot of these tropes or memes of like true love very easily. So the princess bride really functioned as sort of like, here's a person who's loved a story for 30 years. It seems to me that it seemed like, yeah, the princess bride was there and you were using it in this really smart way. But like what you were saying, the pulse that was running through that book was so much bigger and so smart. Man, it was really, really, really good. You're when you came up before I start recording, I was like, you got a ghostwriter because like the writing is that's an insulting thing to ask someone. Like I was like hanging out with you for like six minutes. I'm like, there's no way you wrote this incredible book. So forgive me for that. Man, it's just I was so impressed with the, just the writing is so fluid and easy to like apprehend, to comprehend rather. And it was great. It's just a great book, man. It's someone who suffers from miserable, miserable relationship problems throughout my entire life, man. I, they're just, they're so complex, so unwieldy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And so trying, so tiresome that I understand why a person would want to shave their head and venture off into a cave somewhere and stare into fire until they collapse in a heap rather than have to deal with just the everyday inevitable difficulties of interacting with human beings. It's brutal. It is brutal. Yeah. And I think we can either pretend that's not the case or be, um, you know, kind of, uh, I don't know, um, non-transparent about the whole thing. We can just pretend that there's, if you've mastered some kind of spirituality that you're automatically beloved by everyone, the people close to you never have any issues with you. You never have issues with them. So really, I think the book for me had this quality of like trying to bust myths on both sides. And, you know, so one of the big themes of the book is that there's no such thing as a relationship expert that I'm not saying that people can't get help from a relationship therapist that I think I have some friends who are relationship therapists and they do a great job of guiding people through processes of communication and reconciliation or separation. Right. Um, but the term relationship expert is actually an oxymoron because relationship going back to interdependence is at least two people and expert is one person. So literally the term's an oxymoron. And I think when it comes to expertise in relationship or total fulfillment in relationship, we have these myths. One set of myths comes from these Eastern spirituality that like, if somebody has performed certain yogic rituals or meditated or done enough practice or ceremony, suddenly they have a really easy time with all, all their friends love them, you know, their family relationships. That's the last part of the book, you know, um, Princess bride came out the year that Chogun Trangpa died. My father considers a second father and my grandfather and his wife committed double suicide together. So right. So this theme of like family relationships. Um, and people think like if you, the Dalai Lama must be amazing at relationships. Yeah, sure. Which he's an amazing person, but I don't think he's amazing at romantic relationships. He's a monk, right? Yeah. So, and then on the Western side, you have this sort of myth or set of myths, which I really think is like our rom-com culture, which has just created this objectification of like happiness. Yes. Find the soulmate. Oh, that, you know what? When you find the fucking soulmate, that's when the ukulele starts playing, right? The ukulele plays the credits role, paradise. This is the thing, man. This is like, they need to start a fucking rom-com at the end of a rom-com. And yeah, that's one of the, that's, that's what I say in one of the middle chapters. Sorry, sorry to, sorry to snatch from your book. No, that's fine. You probably said it yourself. No, actually, no, I guarantee that that was in front of the author. I just stole your idea. Well, that's a problem, man. From reading this stuff, it just sinks into my head and pops out. But that's another thing about interdependence is like a lot of our good ideas are just kind of floating in the ether. I wrote your book. You wrote, yeah. Dharma of the Princess Bride by Duncan Dressel. Can we change the title? And this podcast is called the Ethan Nicktern Family Hour. So, so we're good. But this, this, and now I do work all reading it from your book. This, this is a brilliant idea because it's like, let's face it, man. This bullshit that has been given to us about the way a healthy relationship works or looks. Like, for example, uh, I have friends who are like, you know, my grandparents have never gotten in a fight in their, in their lives. Right. They, and I'm like, well, which probably means they've never talked into each other. No, it means your grandparents are fucking liars is what it means. That's all, that's all. It means your grandparents lie to you. They've gotten in fights you out of your mind. They've, how do you not? Right. What are your grandparents fucking replicants or some shit? What are they, plug them in at night? No, they fight. So it's like, but these illusions get seeded into our minds. And they're perfection. They're myths about some kind of perfection. Terrible myths, right? Terrible myths. And, and they destroy, they probably do destroy relationships because when you're in the reality of the relationship, the sweatiness of the thing, the confusion of the thing, the non resolution of certain things, it's, this is, let me ask you something as a person who is, as a person who is not a relationship, but it's just written a brilliant book on relationships. Don't you think it's easier to be alone? So you're, you're talking to a guy who got married a little over a year ago and has a three week old baby girl. So I think it's easy. I think we're never alone on the interdependent friendship standpoint, right? So romantic relationship is not the only kind of relationship that aids any kind of spiritual path. So the whole first part of the book is about close friendships. And I found it, we all need alone time to actually be able to work with our own mind, just know who we are and pursue our own creative goals, our own meaning in life. I've found it easier not to be alone, but it or more helpful not to be alone. But I get what you're saying. I know I felt that way before that just like lead me alone go. It's really, I mean, I think it's a very personal choice, depending on how we want to arrange our life in relationships. And, you know, that's one of the things I take on in the book is that like I grew up with Buddhist parents, their teacher probably was not a conventional example of a nuclear family person, right? My parents, great people, they were not a good example of a nuclear family. Right. So that idea of actually pushing or developing to the point where I could have a good family life, you know, a partner and maybe children was always kind of a myth or idealized in my mind a little bit because I came from non examples of that growing up in New York. So most of the people I knew were children of divorce too, et cetera. So, but working with the idealizing of something sometimes creates even further obstacles to actually making it so. And so, you know, that's why I love in The Princess Bride, you know, the notion of Buttercup, which is such a ridiculous name for an idealized object of romantic affection. And so, but we are all kind of on some level, like if you think it's easier being alone usually because you're like the real people I've met, do not make good friends or good partners or and we are all looking if we could find a Buttercup or Studmuffin or, you know, whatever, whatever the non gendered name you can think of is, we would, we would probably choose that, you know. And so I do talk about my own quest, looking for Buttercups and trying to be a good Buddhist person. And I do think my wife is kind of my Buttercup, you know, but, but it's very, it's very human, you know, and does she ever hold the book against you? Like when something goes down, is she ever like, well, she's only, she only read the, you know, it's just coming out this year. So she hasn't like received a lot of friends feedback, maybe, but she, no, I mean, does she ever like take things that you teach? Yeah. And when you're not living up to them, like raise your eyebrow and say, look at this, what's going on here? Where's the person who is good at equanimity and understands about accepting other people? Do you ever get in that kind of fight? Not with her. She's really skillful at how and when to give feedback, but there's definitely in my life. And I joke about this, that a lot of times people will use, well, that's not very Buddhist of you. Yes. But a lot of times people try to pull that shit on you when they're trying to manipulate you and you won't let them. Yes. Why won't you let me manipulate you? That's not very Buddhist of you. So, you know, she's, she's good at telling me when something's not working for her with, without making it about, because you can always, if somebody's, I mean, I have a title as a lineage holder in the Shambhala tradition. So you can always put somebody on a pedestal just to give them a hard time. What's the title? Shastri, which means a senior teacher. So it's a, that's a Sanskrit word. So you could say anytime that, that person disappoints you, you could just say, well, that's, you know, of course you're not a real whatever, you know, but being a real Buddhist teacher just means you're a real person and you're trying to become, especially in my tradition, more and more authentic in being who you are. But I've got to say, man, that word Shastri, I see why they call you that, because the way you're doing this, just with me right now, clearly is like, there's a rhythm to it, there's a precision or something. It's like, it's not a, it's not, it doesn't feel like it feels off the cuff, but it feels practiced or something in a good way, you know, I get why they call you a Shastri, because there, you are, you are, you're teaching me right now. It's really, it's really cool. How do they, was there like an initiation? Did you have to go through some kind of like ritual to get this title or? So my teacher, who's the head of the Shambhala community, really great guy who is a Chogyam Trungpa's oldest son named Sakyang Mipam. He empowered me as a senior teacher in 2010. So I was 32 when that happened. So that's a little weird to be living in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and be a senior Buddhist teacher at age 32. And I mean, it's good. I had, you know, people like my father, who's been a Buddhist teacher, musician, composer, living in the world for a long time. So it's, it's interesting because, uh, you know, most of my close friends and family and, um, even students just, I think the reason people like hanging out with me or working with me is that I'm not trying to sit on any pedestal or any higher seat. But, um, you definitely get, I mean, everybody gets subtle projections. You know, I'm sure whenever you're getting feedback from an audience, there's a lot of subtle projections, but it's interesting to have this sort of title of some kind of, I don't know, mastery of an Eastern tradition, you know, and be a Western, you know, white male person with all kinds of other privilege. And it's, it's an odd, um, balance to, to try to strike. And definitely people think you're supposed to be a certain way. And again, the warrior tradition of Shambhala is basically saying you're supposed to be an awake person in the world, you know, and this world's nuts right now. Yes. Yes, it is, man. So we have to allow for a little, um, chaos and a little bit of, um, humanity in, in who we try to be as, uh, who I try to be as a teacher and a practitioner. So I try to, you know, that's one of the big things in the book in terms of working with any kind of psychological or spiritual truth is I, I think transparency is very important, not exhibitionism, you know, but, you know, in Western psychology, for example, there's often, I mean, this is changing and evolving, but there's often this notion of total non-disclosure of like, do not share anything about yourself or your own process. And there is a good method there because you let the person you're trying to work with or heal really let them have the space and have it be about them without distracting from that. Right. But I also think there's a history in Western psychology of non-disclosure because you don't want the patient or the student or the client to realize that you're a flawed person as well, and you're afraid they would stop paying you for your services. Yes. And, but I think, I think that's a harmful protection because I think a lot of times when we try to just be like, I'm going to be a mirror for you and I'm not even here and I'm just going to reflect back to you what's going on with you. We end up coming across like a brick wall, you know, and, and I think for me, the, the Buddhist teachers, the other teachers, you know, like Sharon Salzburg, who's a very close teacher and friend and mentor of mine, who really are able to express some kind of mastery, they actually tell you who they are. They are open about how the process works for them or what they're struggling with or what they know to be clear because I think that's what this path is really about is it's like, as I say in the book, tell me how to be in the world or show me how to be in the world by telling me how you are in the world, you know, and then I'll find my way. So getting back to your question, is it all easier alone? Not for me, but maybe for you. Right. People have all kinds of different, you know, and the most famous teacher in my tradition is a, is a nun, family children. So there's all kinds of different paths possible here. Right. Yeah. And when I, in the book, I never got the feeling that you were advising that this is the way to be in a relationship or anything like that. It's just, it's, it's such a, it's just a lot to bite off, you know, having to, but then on the other hand, I think God, you know, something about it, you know, when our relationship grows and evolves and matures and becomes more peaceful, is beautiful to see, you know, because you do get through things with people. You do like, it's, you do like grow together and help each other. And there's something incredible about that. You know, so you might miss that if you were dedicated to a life of isolation or something like that. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think, you know, it's interesting. I've thought about this a lot because, for example, in the Tibetan tradition, practitioners sometimes would like go away for 12 year retreats. And these are practitioners who had also taken a vow to be of benefit to all beings. Right. So that always created a kind of friction in my mind. Like, so you're going to go into isolation for 12 years to benefit all beings and I could never figure out how that worked. I think, again, the reincarnation thing is like important there. Like, I think those folks who did that, who said, I'm going to spend the rest of my life in retreat for the benefit of all beings, they're looking at like future consciousness, future lifetimes, future worlds that they are going to be able to be more present with. It's like these guys or these ladies would go on a like a, you know, 12 year retreat with the same intentionality that I might go on a week long retreat, you know, but I also feel like I need to live in the world. And that's really part of my practice. And that's the notion of the Shambhala warrior is the notion of actually using your imperfect presence in society to help bring about enlightened society, which does not mean perfect society. It just means awake, compassionate society, like some humans, some authentically human society. And so, you know, I think that people really struggle with because of the romcom myth and because of the myth of some kind of spiritual mastery, people really struggle with personal relationships because it's, it's, it's chaos. Wait, are you guys like doctors pretending to be patients in some kind of lunatic asylum or something? Like, is that the idea? You're, you're like, whoa, that's wild, man. You guys are like, that's really funny. You're so like ideas. Yeah, that's one analogy. The other analogy is it could just be like, you know, like some of the people who've been the most helpful in learning how to parent, because there's so many things three weeks in that you have like, what the hell is a diaper genie, Duncan? You probably don't even know. Are you kidding? Do you know about a diaper genie? The diaper genie is granted every single wish that I've ever had. I have a diaper. You rub the diaper and the spirit comes out and like it grants your wishes. Right? Yeah. Yeah. So maybe we're just, you know, people who are a little further along the process. Like we've have a one year old kid and you have a three week old kid and we have a few more tricks up our sleeves. You have some tricks and let me say this, man, because, you know, people aren't here in the room with us and people, I don't know how many times people out there run into like actual chastries. That's what you are. Yeah, that's, I don't know how many times people actually run into that. So I've got to report in on it, man. And I'll tell you, like you're, I'm trying to think of a way to put this. It's the same with your dad. It's the same with Rom Doss, the same with Sharon Salzburg, same with Jack cornfield. You're human or something. Or so I like that, but there's something else in there. It's like you've done, you like, it's hard to explain it, but the, the, and I don't know how much of it translates in the way that you're talking, but what you're saying about this concept of being in the world, this concept of teaching through being part of the world, it's something that's just clicking in my head now. It's like, Oh, I get it. So you guys are like, you aren't really, you're, you are us, but you're different than us because people like me, we haven't done this, I mean, most people don't even know what a cog you lineage is. Yeah. Most people have no idea who Chokim Trump is. Most people don't know what Shambhala is or know even what Buddhism is. A lot of people don't. And if they do know what Buddhism is, their understanding of Buddhism is based on something they've seen in some movies, maybe, maybe they saw some kind of like part of a documentary about it. They certainly don't know what the four noble truths are. They don't know what interdependency is. They don't know. And so when you, when you're around someone who has absorbed it to the point that you're teaching it and have been given a title, whose identity has become a meshed in it, then you, you realize, whoa, this is, this has in some way or another, and this is a dramatic word. It's destroyed you in the sense of like, maybe what you would have been if you didn't run into Buddhism, I don't know that what that would be possessed you. Is that another way to put it? It's altered you. You seem altered in a good way, but in a profound way. You know what I'm saying? And this idea that you guys are altering yourself through a lifetime of effort and focus and digestion of these ideas to the point of being sort of like metaphysically configured by it. And then you're infiltrating society to be part of society intentionally to bring peace into the world. That is psychedelic. Yeah, I mean, so let's go back to you when you said it's destroyed you. Cause I mean, so there's, there's two ways to talk about, and I'm by any definition, I am very much still in process. Okay, sure. Like, yes, I agree. I'm like, a lot of folks seem to be having issues that I feel like maybe a little bit more like, Oh, I can, I can hold that in mind. I can work with that. I can see that, but I get caught sometimes too. I am, I am not, I am not fully awakened, but is that possible? I think so. I mean, but I need one who is fully awakened, you know, so this is like, there's in Buddhism is like a really intensely analytic and there's one definition of enlightenment that there's 10 different stages and that the first stage happens when you're able to, when you are meditating, when you're in a state of meditative awareness, you are completely without sense of self fixation, you're completely compassionate, open. And then when you arise from the meditative seat, you are sort of back into slightly neurotic, slightly self absorbed, you know, much lighter than, you know, some of the people we know. But you're still, that's, that's the last stages is to sort of even out the meditative experience with the experience in every other aspect of life. Oh, you mean, so it's kind of like the meditation. Begins to merge in all other point and these 10 steps are the different ways that it kind of spreads into your life. But that work is also about dealing with relationships, right? So because relationships are where we get hung up, we get triggered, we get caught, we get blindsided, we, we, uh, you know, a parent can make you feel like you haven't felt in 10 years and you're like, why am I regressing? Yes, yes, sure, sure. So, you know, I do think when you say this self, you know, is destroyed. That is one way of, I think a lot of this is linguistic and it depends on what narrative you choose, right? So one way of looking at enlightenment is it's the total loss of this self fixated solid identity, which is called the ego, which I have problems with that translation just because there's so many different, like the Freudian definition of ego is very different from the Eastern definition of ego. Okay. You mean like the, the, the ego and Sue, you're talking about something complete. You think they're, they're, when they talk about the destruction of the ego, what do they mean? Um, when the Eastern, yeah, yeah. I mean, so the ego, the, the term in like Sanskrit or Pali, the ancient Buddhist, uh, languages is Atman or Ata and it, it means something more like soul, like the peach pit, like the solid part of you. Yeah. Okay. So the thing that's always confusing when like yoga teachers or meditation teachers or Buddhists use the language of, of destroying the ego is actually that's not what the Buddha did. He said, Oh, there, that Atman, that soul part of you, that solid thing that you think is me and needs to be defended. I've looked for it very carefully and it doesn't exist. So it's actually not about destroying something. It's about realizing that you were misperceiving something. Wow. Okay. So that's why destroying ego is not actually a Buddhist concept, but it sounds like a, I'm a semantic. It is semantic, but it's, you know, it's semantic. Sometimes don't matter at all. And sometimes they, they totally shape our view. They destroyed Santa Claus for me, man. Yeah. You know, just by telling me there's no Santa Claus. Yeah. That destroyed, I'll never forget it. When it happened, I'll never forget. I was kind of suspicious. And then it was like, fuck. Yeah. Really? Yeah. This whole thing, the presents, really? The presents, the cookies, really? Why would you do this to us? Yeah. You know, this is a real thing. And in the same way what you're talking about, it's so in a weird way, you guys are like, you guys are like the kids who figured out that there is no Santa Claus. Yeah. But the, the, the notion in the Shambhala teachings, the Shambhala teachings often take a much more positive approach because rather than talking about non-self or non-soul, the ideal of this way of being in the world in the Shambhala teachings is this word that's often translated as authentic presence. Like what would it be like to be authentic? Which is the same thing. It's not defending a solid fluid self. It's just being who you are. Like if you like the Princess Bride, if you like Radiohead and Tribe Called Quest, you know, these are my dharma. Has to include a Tribe Called Quest and Radiohead. Okay. It's not going to include Tibetan music, you know. Right. And so what is the authentic way of not fixating on, but being who you are in the world in a more fluid way? You know, I love stand up comedy, for example. I think actually stand up comedy is a lot of it's quite meditative because people are reporting, the ones who are best at it are reporting on the experience of having a mind and observation, sometimes neurotic observations. But like, so what is it like to teach Buddhism in an era of stand up comedy? I don't think that happened at the time of the Buddha. Right, right. So this is the other way of saying non self is your, the, the sense of fixation is destroyed, but that's the negation way of saying it. The positive way of saying it is that arrives you at a place where you are just completely who you are, you know, and for me, my path, you know, growing up in Western society, I remember in college when I was getting really into meditation and Buddhism started when I was a kid, but really started in high school and then college, you know, there was such a pressure and, you know, to some ways I still feel this pressure and I imagine kids growing up now really feel this pressure is like to get your profile right, you know, and to find the way to be in the world that like could just niche yourself. So like, you have all the right references and at a certain point, you're just like, what if you just drop that and liked what you liked and believe, you know, and tried to help yourself and help others? The thing though is a lot of times you end up liking the same stuff. Okay, that's like you like that stuff, you know. So what if it was a little less complicated? Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's that's super cool. It's very cool. It's like, yeah, I can feel you. You should kind of tune me in. I forget maybe the difference is I forget this shit, you know, maybe people like us just forget it and you remember it more or something. But I want to ask you, was there some point, was there some point as you were meditating and going through this process where you started experiencing a shift, like what you're talking about and you thought for a moment, maybe I don't want this to happen to me. Yeah, yeah. Well, there's two aspects to the path. There's one, you know, the meditation seat, the actual formal practices, which my friend who's a Buddhist teacher and psychotherapist, Miles Neal, he talks about your meditation seat as the flight simulator for the rest of your life. And I like that way of looking at it. Um, so in the meditation seat, there's definitely, especially when I go on longer retreats or do some of the longer practices, there are moments of boredom, moments of irritation, moments of just like, Oh God, please perform something right to make this be something other than me being alone with my mind. Right, you know, and, um, that sort of process of working with one's boredom, one's self-aggression, I think is something that retreats are really, even if it starts with a day or a weekend, um, you know, I would really recommend that people do at some point, if they're interested in meditation, do more than just like a 10 minute session or three minute, uh, you know, or, or more than just downloading headspace. I mean, you can do that too. It's downloading headspace. Headspace is a meditation app that a lot of people use. Oh God, I thought you had some cool term for meditation in short periods. It's not my term. Okay. Um, I hope it's legal for me to say, I don't know if it's trademarked, but, um, I prefer heart space to headspace, but, um, but, uh, to really go on a retreat and see like, wow, I am going to have to work with all the ways that I just avoid being present, you know, and, and it does, there is a confrontation for sure, but I would say, what was that like for you? When did that happen? Uh, you know, it definitely happened in college. Um, I had already started meditating, but I, this is interesting coming back to, uh, um, uh, this, I had been, um, my, had my first serious, uh, romantic relationship, my freshman year of college. You know, I was kind of a late bloomer. She was awesome. She was from LA. She actually, this is one of my three different personal princess bride connections. She actually went to high school with the whole savage family. Oh, wow. Fred Savage. Yes, of course. And, um, uh, she broke up, broke up with me and, um, I mean, I wasn't like, I had no idea how to be in a relationship, so she should have broken up with me. She was awesome, but, uh, what do you mean? What were you doing wrong? I was 18 and I was like listening to my high school friends, boys about how they were in relation to, you know, it's just like, how do you, like, and nobody's telling you just like, open your heart and be present and say you like the person, you know, like, it's just, it's just all, it's a mess. It's a mess and it's a mess because it's inauthentic, you know, and nobody can just be like, I like you, right? Do you want to like go to this party with me? All right. Period. It's just games. Yeah. It's all games. Games inside games inside games. Yeah. So after freshman year, she, um, she dumped me and, uh, then I remember going back to college sophomore year, not wanting to be there and just reading a lot of books on Buddhism, meditating, sitting in my room, sometimes listening to a tribe called quest. There was one Oasis song I was really obsessed with for like a month. I remember, do you remember Oasis? Sure. Are you kidding? Don't, don't kick me off the podcast because I mentioned Oasis. No, no, I totally, it's okay. Um, and just, and that process of just like, I'm going to sit with myself in this uncomfortable space. Yes. It was actually very healing. And that was before I did, I had done some weekend meditation retreats, but then right after college, I did my, I went and lived at a meditation center in Vermont, Karmachilling, which I still teach at and practice at. And, um, that was the best eight months of, that was better than anything that happened to me in college, other than some friendships, uh, living there and doing a month long meditation retreat. So it is irritating. It is difficult. You do have to confront your holding on to an identity, but it's also very much like you come to this place where you're just like, Oh, I'm basically good. That's the premise of the Shambhala G-Chains, basic goodness. Like, and then you have to keep reminding yourself that that's why enlightenment's not easy. You have lots of enlightenment moments. It's just stringing together those moments. That's what the path is about. And that's why I'm on the path. I haven't finished the path as I'm still working to string together the moments where I remember my own basic goodness and, and remember your, your basic goodness. That is so cool, man. That is so cool. Yeah. I get those moments sometimes. That's like, wow, this is, this universe is amazing. Oh my God. I can't believe, and sometimes those moments happen in the midst of absolute chaos. You know, that's my favorite one when it pops in, even though shit's going completely haywire somewhere in there. Like, whoa, it doesn't matter. This is still incredible. Yeah. Now those moments happen for me every three years. So if I could string them together, it'd be great, but I'm going to end up with like six of them, but you know, like that, how many of those do you have? How often do you have those moments? Uh, it's not every moment, but it's a lot more than once every three years. I'm having one right now. It's really great to talk to you. Oh, it's great to talk. I'm having one because I'm around a teacher. And this is the other thing that happens when you're around a teacher that I think people don't, um, maybe aren't aware of, you know, cause like the term is so like when you think of a teacher, well, you think of like school. You think of high school. It's a weird, it's a weird term for Western. It's the wrong term. Yeah. Cause you guys are more like harmonizers or something. Yeah. There's a, so there's a term, uh, the wrong term in my tradition is the word guru, cause guru specifically in my tradition means that the teacher who gives you certain tantric empowerment. So like sake and mi pam che is my guru and that's a particular relationship. It's one of the most misused terms from Eastern philosophy, like guru in our culture just means you're good at something. Right. Um, there's a term Kalyana Mitra in Sanskrit. Kalyana means something like noble or spiritual or exalted. And Mitra literally means friend. So we sometimes translate this in my tradition as mentor. Oh, okay. My mentor, but lit the literal translation is something close to noble friend or spiritual friend. So it's somebody you look up to, somebody who you look to for guidance. All right. Um, guru is it, is it kind of different type of teacher relationship. Um, so what were you saying? It gives you something? Uh, certain empowerments, what do you mean empowerments? So, uh, there's certain ceremonies where you're empowered to do certain visualization practices in Tantra or, you know, do certain, um, visualization practices. Have you not heard about visualization meditation? Well, I, I guess so, but I didn't, I, I've never heard this concept of like being empowered to do it. Like, I don't know what, I don't know what you mean by that. Like given permission, you mean? Well, there's in, in most of the lineages that descend from Tibetan Buddhism, there's a real sense of like a curriculum and a path. And so that there would be certain practices that you do to just settle in, you know, and sort of develop the ground. You know, it's the same, you don't teach calculus in kindergarten. Right. It's kind of the same notion of, okay, gotcha. There's a, there's a progression. There's a curriculum. So the guru represents the person who's, who gives you certain transmissions that often come later on along the path in my tradition. So, can I, I'm sorry to reduce it to like an embarrassing place, but is it like belts in martial arts or something? Is this a form of like, okay, you're ready for your purple belt now? Yeah. I mean, that, that it's a, it's a reduction. I appreciate, you know, I wish we had belts. We actually have pins in Shambhala for certain roles and things like certain that you put on your lapel that are kind of cheat. I kind of wish we had purple belts again. Actually, I did karate. I think I only got to a yellow belt, which I reminded my dad, I reminded my dad right after Izzy was born, that he used to take me to karate class for like three months and he totally forgot that. And he felt so bad that he forgot taking me to karate class. I was like, I didn't mean to make you feel bad. He's like, are you sure that happened? I was like, yeah, dad, you took me to karate class. It's like 1984. Don't worry about it. Cool dad. But the, the, the, so I guess what I'm saying is that someone, the, the, this guru is sort of adept at recognizing when you're ready to move on to the next thing. Yeah. And so that's what you would call being empowered to do these visualizations. Yeah. And there's certain ceremonies and vows that one takes. So there's more vows beyond the classic Buddhist vow. So in the, in a classic Buddhist, Tibetan Buddhist framework, you would have the first vow that a person would take is the refuge vow, which is where you're kind of committing to a refuge in the Buddha. I take refuge in the dorm. I take refuge in the song. Is that it? Which are called the three jewels, which is sort of creates this supportive educational environment for awakening, right? So you're sort of saying that's, that's when a person formally would identify as I'm a Buddhist practitioner as if they've taken that vow in the Tibetan system. Then the next vow, which enters you into a series of teachings that's all about working with others and working with the interdependence and the relational interdependence of self and others called the Bodhisattva vow, great beastie boys song too. Sure. And the Bodhisattva vow is that enters you into the second body of teachings, which in the Tibetan system is called Mahayana, greater vehicle. The third vow is called Samaya and Samaya means something like word of honor. And that enters you into the Vajrayana, which is synonymous with mostly synonymous with the word Tantra. And that's where you actually take a personal commitment with a guru, which is sort of like getting married, you know, yeah, to a teacher, to a master. And which is a very interesting relationship because it's not as close as a close friendship or partnership. How often do you talk to your guru? I have, um, I see him more or less like two or three times a year, sometimes in very big environments. So, you know, it's more, he's very interested. He checks in, but it's not like I don't, like I might talk to my mentor like once a month or something like that. And with him, it's more like two times a year. So, you know, it kind of depends. There's different nervous talking in not as much as I used to. Um, but he definitely has, uh, um, sucking me from, she definitely has a very strong grounded presence. So, um, and he can be very quiet sometimes. And then he can, and then he can also give a lecture that's like two hours long. Um, he can go back and forth between those two states. So he's, he's intimidating. He's really, um, he takes care, really immaculate care of his body. He's in his, um, early fifties. He looks like he's like 30, um, very kind, very gentle. And I think people have this relationship to the spiritual teacher as being the one who's like, you know, telling you what to do or like yelling at you or like, when are you going to get your shit together and wake up? And he's not, he's like, oh, yeah, that sounds good. I would suggest this. And it's, it's much sort of, um, quieter and gentler with moments of real articulation and, and force. So does he call, ever call you up? He does not ever call me up directly. Um, which I think is a good thing for me. God, I know that I mean, that's, he has a few of his close assistants, he does call up directly. And I think, you know, that's a kind of guru I want, man. That's great. Like nobody wants a guru is calling them every day. It's annoying. Some people need that. And I think karmically either you work out the situation that you need. And, and he's more kind of a larger guide for me, you know? Um, so yeah, it's been great. It, you know, it is, I will say it is great to commit your life to something. Yeah. I think that's, that's part of what I've noticed is there's like, sort of in my world, my understanding of what I like to call in the book, the kale belt world, like these cities that we inhabit, like LA or New York, where meditation and kale salad have become popular. Yes. So you have the Bible belt and the kale belt. But it's sort of, you know, there's, I've lived in the kale belt for almost 20 years. It's everywhere I go is in the kale belt. Every once in a while I go into the Bible belt. Bible belts usually a bigger belt. Yeah. Yeah. But you need to eat more kale in the Bible. But I've noticed that people are either like very hipster, very non-committal. Yes. Or they're totally fundamentalist and totally trying to preach to everybody. You like, you know, and I just, because most of the people I've taught and studied with and practiced with and been friends with are more on the hipster end of the spectrum of just sort of like, whatever, man, like. My friend Chris Ryan calls it passive hipster Buddhism. Yes. Yes. But it's nice to actually commit to a path. You know, it's nice to a community. It is scary, but you still get to. Don't want to drink Kool-Aid, man. Don't want to get sucked in. Don't want to get tricked. Yeah. Don't want to, don't want to get hoodwinked. Right. No, I, I hear it. Guru? A guru? Yeah. No, man. Not going to do it. Well, in Chambala, we build up to that point. You don't start with a guru. Anybody, anybody who says like the first time they meet a teacher, they're my guru. It's like, give it a little time. Like see, go on a few retreats with this person, do the practice. Take out with them a couple of times. Yeah, it's like the person who goes to Vegas for the weekend and just ends up getting hitched, you know? No, I know. I mean, I can remember when I first got to talk to Ram Dass through Skype. And of course, embarrassingly, I'm like, are you my guru? And he got that big smile, he gets, he's like, okay, fine, I'm your guru. Now what? Right. Now what do we, now what? Yeah. You know, ultimately, it's like, well, the word, it's a word. What are you doing? You know, but I think that you're right. Committing to something, taking that leap is ballsy. Yeah. And it's crazy these days to do that. Because we always, all of us are living in this, what's it called? We're agnostic. Yeah. We live in this world of like, seems great. I mean, you seem awesome. Yeah. I really think it's possible to commit to something and maintain your intelligence, but and maintain your own dignity. That's, that's what I've been trying to sort of demonstrate and manifest in my own life, like you don't have to just be a leaf on the wind. Right. I really think for a lot of times, I mean, if you haven't committed to something because you haven't found your thing, great, don't commit to something before you're ready to, but I do feel like people I meet who are just kind of like leaf on the wind. A lot of times where those people, we tend to be unhappier because there's like, what gets you up in the morning? You know, what are you living your life for? What are you practicing? That's what I mean by committing. I don't mean like, what are you preaching? Just what are you practicing? And is there a clear commitment to that? So, you know, That is awesome. Yeah. Shostry is here, friends. How cool, man. This is, I, we're in eight minutes. My God. It's like 15 seconds. I can't believe time went by this quickly. Yeah. And we're just starting this conversation. I hope you'll come back. I would come back anytime. Anytime my two ladies let me. I'm spellbound. You're awesome. You and your dad, the Nickturns are cool, man. I'm going to have to come out to that Shambhala place. Where is it? Well, in New York, it's in Chelsea, West 22nd Street. Too far away. Oh, come on. I'm not going to drive out there. We used to have to cross mountains. Now we just make you get on a train. Oh, I'm not going. Now, I don't know. I'm just going to be sad for the rest of my life. I'm not going to fucking Chelsea. That is the quote. Can we, can we like put that on the Shambhala Center website? Thank you so much for being on the show. Thank you so much, John. And you have this wonderful book coming out. Could you tell people where they can find it? I know it's not coming out from, um, month. Yeah, it's, it's called the Dharma, the Princess Bride, what the coolest fairy tale of our time can teach us about Buddhism and relationships. It's coming out September 12th from FSG books. And I think you can get it anywhere books are sold. And obviously I still love independent bookstores. So, um, they're one of my favorite places to hang out. But you know, if you need, if you need to go to Amazon, go, you go to Amazon, you know, it's a wonderful book. Friends, if you're going to get a book about Buddhism, grab this one. It's fantastic. As you can see, we're with a very authentic being here. And you're a great writer too, as well as a great teacher. Thank you so much, man. I really appreciate it. Thanks so much.

253^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - 320: Raghu Markus Transcript and Discussion^2019-01-03^Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Greetings to you, oh beautiful friends. It is I, Dee Trussell, and you are listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast. Welcome, not only to the podcast, but welcome to 2019. I present to you a glorious year undulating before you. Have you ever seen such a wonderful year? Behold the glimmering appendages, the sweet golden feathers, and the slight drip of lavender scented oils that roll down from the many beautiful waterfalls, rivers, creeks, and streams that you have yet to see because years, you know how they work, you only see them moments at a time. But man, I'm telling you, from where I'm sitting, this is a really beautiful year. It's your year, and all you have to do, and forgive me if I'm mansplaining how to feed your year. I'm really sorry, I know most people already know this, but sometimes it's easy to forget that all you have to feed your year is love. That's what they like best. There's other things you can feed it. Some people in the past have tried just pumping fear into their years, but it gives them an adgestion, and it can cause them to sprout weird moments. It's better to just give a pure diet of undiluted love. And I know what you're thinking. How do I feed something love? Where do you go to get it? I don't know where to get that kind of food. Good news, friend, it's what you're made out of. Oh, you're telling me I gotta feed myself to my year? Yes, that's what you do. Just throw yourself into the moment. That's its mouth. And then in the process of being digested, you'll realize that you and your year are actually the same thing, and you're both made of love, and that's how you have a great year. And okay, sweet darlings, I'm about to head into a zone that I've never entered into. In fact, I'm already kinda in the zone. I'm feeling feelings I've never felt before. I'm experiencing moments I never thought possible. I'm about to be a dad. And what that means is I can't do much more of an intro. I'm just gonna dive right into this podcast with my dear friend and teacher, Raghu Marcus, from the Love Server Member Foundation. He's also the host of Mind Rolling. We're gonna jump right into that, but first, some quick business. This episode of the DTFH has been brought to you by Robinhood. Robinhood is an investing app that lets you buy and sell stocks, ETFs, options, and cryptos all commission free. They strive to make financial services work for everyone, not just the wealthy. They have a simple and intuitive, clear design with data presented in an easy to digest way. What's awesome about it, there is no commission fee. And most importantly, it's easy to use. I don't know if you've ever tried to dip your little toe into the raging torrential waters of investing in stocks, but it's scary. And some of these services, it's like opening the book of the dead, just a pulsating, writhing, maze-like hypnotic mass of numbers and colors and strange sounding names of stocks, like e-stock, zeal, zizzle-zack, zizzle-zook. What does it even mean? Robinhood helps sort the archaic nature of financial information by creating these wonderful playlists. You can pick companies owned by all female CEOs. They've got these wonderful curated lists so you can invest in companies that align with your values. It will be sad if you found out you were giving money to a company that was bombing panda bears or something. Robinhood is giving our wonderful listeners a free stock, like Apple, Ford, or Sprint, to help build your portfolio. Sign up at Duncan.Robinhood.com. That's Duncan.Robinhood.com. Like my uncle, Rink, used to say, go get that free stock. Whoa, I wonder what would happen if we all did it and pulled our stocks together in one massive communal portfolio? We could buy Antarctica. Much thanks to my sweet Patreon patrons for bearing with me as I phase up, as they call it, into this new realm of becoming a video podcaster. What you're about to get blasted with is a YouTube link that is an actual video of this conversation with Raghu Marcus. And there's gonna be many more things like that. I promise, I'm still figuring out how to use this technology. If you've noticed a sudden proliferation of odd videos on my YouTube page, very strange things, lots of stuff related to crow's milk, for example, and a variety of other things of that nature. My apologies if you feel like it seems like something's weird with the DTFH. We've been getting hacked and we've been getting spoofed. And I have my tech guy, Jen Geshe, and also, of course, our moderator, Logroy, working fervently on figuring out how to get unhacked and unspoofed. In the meantime, oh dear Patreon sweeties, you're gonna start getting not just commercial-free episodes of the DTFH, but commercial-free video episodes of the DTFH as long as my guests are willing to be put on camera and I figure out a good way to film them. If you're interested, head over to patreon.com forward slash DTFH and subscribe. You'll also get access to our Discord server. And finally, if you are feeling like you wanna get involved in the crow's milk issue that is raging across our nation, by the way, for me, I think it was kind of a phase. I got sucked into it and for a while, I was really passionate that we must stop drinking crow's milk as a nation and as a planet. And then I realized that there's two sides to every argument and I sort of saw things from the perspective of the crow's milk lobby for a second. And then I realized that I just wanna keep my family safe and that if people wanna drink crow's milk or don't wanna drink crow's milk, it's not really any of my business. I'm sort of all for just let's do it, do as we will, so to speak. And now I've realized the whole thing was just a ridiculous phase and so I have completely disavowed myself from the crow's milk movement completely. And also I have disavowed myself from the children of Geb, though I did start that organization. I had nothing to do with the events that took place at CrowCon in New York City on December 26th and I am completely disavowing myself and I'm no longer their leader. So I really hope that the authorities that might be listening to this understand, it was just a club I thought would be fun to start. We wanted to get, my friend Gary, he works with me, he's been having trouble meeting girls and we didn't mean any, I certainly didn't think that it would lead to me not being allowed to travel to Europe. Regardless, I don't wanna load you guys down with all this ridiculous crow's milk drama. I have nothing to do with the crow's milk movement. I'm neither for nor against and I'm also completely disavowed from the entire thing altogether. You can find out more information about that just by going to my YouTube channel if you wanna check out where we are currently with the many hacks and spoofs that have been happening to our feeds. In the meantime, my dear loves, I present to you a glorious podcast with someone who is one of the most important people in my life and who over many years is very patiently helped me sort of open up to love and has introduced me to a wonderful group of people, including my meditation teacher, David Nickturn, along with folks like Ramdas, Neem Krollibaba, Sharon Salzburg, Jack Cornfield and so many other great teachers. He's a really focused, beautiful person who facilitates many of the Ramdas retreats and who runs the Love Server Member Foundation and runs his own podcast, Mind Rolling. And he's one of the simultaneously busiest and most relaxed, sweet people that I've ever met on this planet and he is with us here today. So without further ado, please welcome to the Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour podcast, Ragu Marcus. Welcome, welcome all of you. Glad you are with us, shake hands, no need to be blue. Welcome to you, it's the Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour podcast. Ragu, welcome back to the Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour. Wow, this is so futuristic. I can't believe that we're filming this. This is so great. I love the background you've got going. Hopefully, folks, you'll put this up somewhere where people can see it. I love that mandala you've gotten. It's fantastic. Can you turn a little bit away? Sorry, I'm always blocking the mandalas. Oh my God, what is it, by the way? I think that is the Kala Chakra. Kala Chakra, I was gonna say that because I've been to His Holiness Dalai Lama's Kala Chakra twice, actually. Wow, really in Dharamsala? No, in Toronto and in Washington. Oh, I thought it only happened in Dharamsala and I thought it only happened once every few years. No, He does it all over the world. I'm trying to get myself situated. Yeah, He does it all over the world. Anyhow, what is the Kala Chakra? Are you kidding? I just wanna hear you describe it. No, there's no way. I've got no intellect, no mind, no nothing. I'm useless. That's why I came from the whole bhakti thing, the dualistic bhakti thing. No, I could never really get at that, especially in my current state. Gundah had, someone kicks your door down, some horrible person has a weapon, holds it to your head and says, tell me, what is the Kala Chakra mandala? Yeah, really. What would you say? I'd say I don't know. I was there, but do you know the book, The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance? Yes, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle. Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, okay. So there are two kinds of people, right? One of them, like sees a motorcycle and goes in there and takes it apart and puts it back together, right? Because that's their thing and that's how they become one with the motorcycle. And then there's other people who walk and see the motorcycle and it's all, it's Harley glory. Yes. And you go, oh my God. And you just like blend in with the molecular structure through your soul, okay? So those are the two kinds of characters in this book. Yeah, I'm the latter one. So I would tell people, it's useless for me to try and go into an explanation of the Kala Chakra when you can easily get that from your new teacher, for instance, he would know David Nicktern. We'll have to ask David it. Yeah, so I wouldn't even go there. But I like, let's talk, I wanna talk about that for a second. Cause I think it does blend in with what we wanna talk about today or what we were planning on talking about it anyway. This, I guess you could say this is two, this division, this sort of like overlay is something that comes up a lot in spiritual conversations and in the broadest of strokes, we have on one side the bhakti as it's called or the sort of loving relationship with truth, God. And on the other side, we have this sort of deconstruction of reality. And I was just reading about this in the Bhagavad Gita as it is just a day or two ago, I just opened it up when I was reading and Prabhupada was saying that one, one is the bhakti is watering the roots of the tree. If you water the roots of the tree, everything else is taken care of. And this other form mayavadi or this sort of deconstruction of our essential nature, it does the exact same thing, but the process is more complex like what you're saying. It's a complex process, but both reach the same point is what he was saying. Is that ultimately this identical place is you will inevitably run into God, whether you're doing some kind of very lofty intellectual deconstruction of reality, whether you're doing some meditative process that involves the dissolution of the identity or whether you're sitting at the foot of a deity or a guru or an awakened being, all roads lead to Rome, so to speak. Do you have any thoughts on that? Yeah, you know what? I got an email today from somebody who just listened to a podcast on mind rolling with a Buddhist teacher named Tani Sara, who's incredible, wonderful, wonderful teacher. She's all about Buddhism in action. She's totally concerned with what's going on socially, politically, et cetera, et cetera, and yet rooted in deeply in the no mind. So this guy, can I read a little of this? Please, yeah. Yeah, it's somebody who's a real practitioner. Oh, hang on, this is a ridiculous interruption that I was not even thinking, because we've just been doing this new, I'm doing this new form and I didn't realize that my phone can intrude upon my very existence, okay, there. Keep going, I apologize for that interruption. No problem. So this guy just writes about it, as I was explaining, I did an episode with Tani Sara. So he says, like you, I feel the marriage of Buddhism and Bhakti is such a powerful vehicle and something that seems to be a unique offering for Maharaj's blessings. I really resonated. I don't know if you recall conversations with me about a year ago, I came to you with a dilemma on how to choose between Bhakti and the Buddhist path. You reminded me of a talk with Roshi Joan Halifax where she said she looked into Baba's eyes, Maharaj in Imkaroli Baba, and she only saw emptiness. After that, I took refuge in the Tibetan Nyingma tradition. I've learned so much, but I've always keep Maharaj in my heart. I had somewhere, but sometime put him on a back burner. And I went to Taos and I went into, there's a Hanuman temple there that's in Imkaroli Baba temple in Taos. By the way, anybody who's in that area, definitely go there. I went into the shrine room, stood in front of his picture and wham, hit me like a ton of bricks. That loving awareness that Ram Dass talks about is so real and so easy to access. I feel like it empowers my practice. It fuels the devotional side of my being and the devotional Guru Yoga Sadness of the Tibetan tradition. I still use Ram as well. I had a conversation with someone about Hanuman being a Bodhisattva or even a Buddha and Ram being the Dharmakaya. Anyhow, and he makes one little thing at the end where he said, I had a psychedelic adventure where, because this woman, Tanisara, tells me in her early 20s, she had a psilocybin trip and had Maharaja complete darshan. I mean, she'd been a Buddhist her whole life. I never knew this about it. So he said, I took a high dose of LSD. Everything was merging into a single consciousness and my ego was freaking, although awareness was more dominant. He was, Imkaroli Baba was the only phenomena I could make out and he was just laughing and laughing and he kept saying over and over, it's okay. It's okay. Yeah. Hey, how about that for a wonderful note? Yeah, that, that, it's okay. And it's okay. And I think that it's okay either, it's okay. Whatever come, I would say this about people, the grand huge difference of Buddhism and the Bhakti tradition, the duality, non-duality, the soul, the no mind, all of that kind of stuff. It, this is nuts Duncan, but I have to do this. I'm gonna do something to you. Okay, cool. Yeah, I have to do this because this was addressed exactly what we're talking about was addressed by Bob Thurman in the spring. Okay. I'm gonna read this. Please. It's just terrible. Buddha is. Go ahead, sorry. Buddha is defined in the Mahayana, in Mahayana Buddhism as a being who identifies with all life and all things. So when you become a Buddha, you have this apparently, and I only know this by definition, not yet by experience. You suddenly feel you're everyone else. So imagine if you're in this room and you suddenly were seeing what's going on in this room from everybody's perspective simultaneously. It might come to you as a bit of a shock. Yeah, Bob. Usually we look out from our own meat puppet. We're enclosed within our, we're enclosed within our own meat puppet, right? Suddenly you're in everyone's meat puppet and you see everything from every side. That's what a Buddha is defined as. That's what Vishnu means who Vishnu from whom came Ram and Krishna. That's what Vishnu means, all pervading. The word comes from to pervade. So Vishnu is everyone from Vishnu's point of view, which means everyone's point of view, which of course is inconceivable to us. It's inconceivable. We think that would be a nightmare. We'd have everybody's headache. So you can only do that if you bring bliss to that kind of perception. Put it this way, I'm hoping. So please don't worry, Ragu, about self versus selflessness. It's just a fork in the road. And it's just part of the pharmacopia of Indian generosity to the planet. Wow, that's very, that's cool. It's like very scholarly. It's got that, it's brilliant. He studies so much. It has within it that kind of like, what's it called? The, it's like some people have to put that sort of, they have to attach to it. I've never experienced this. So he had to attach that to it, meaning that it's something- Yeah, because he's being honest. He's not living in Buddha mind on a moment to moment basis. But it's something you heard and he trusts that that must be the way it is. What? Well, I mean, he's close to the Dalai Lama. This is not just somebody who's popping around the street writing books and saying shit from nowhere. I've heard the earth is round. I'm gonna just have to believe it. I haven't experienced it. Nothing wrong with that. I mean, this is the sort of the, one of the shortcuts, I think, is to just trust people. Well, trust is the most important person for anybody who wants to have any kind of life that's not absolutely caught in identity roles and everything that you and I have been talking about in the last few months around this movie of me. And anybody who absolutely trusts is the first thing you need. You hear Duncan? I mean, you guys out there, they're listening to Duncan. I just had two strangers come to my house because he didn't send them, but that's how they found out about me was through Duncan's podcast. Okay. And those strangers vanished a day ago. Yes, they're gone. But they vanished with everything. Just to say that the trust thing that these particular people that I met had in you that moved them over to listen to Ram Dass and mind-rolling and other podcasts from the Be Here Now Network is, and it's the thing that got you through Ram Dass, the thing that got me through Ram Dass was trust. Okay. And now I'm gonna investigate this a little bit more. And then, wow, there is a way to be happy. Oh my God. I mean, there's a way to actually live and you're not in fear, anxiety, and paranoia. That's a good start, right? Yeah, for sure. So, yeah, so Bob has, well, he has a trust. I mean, he's had this long relationship with his holiness, the Dalai Lama. I mean, let's just start there. Yeah, he's a real Buddhist scholar. And he seems to be deeply connected with that tradition, Vajrayana. And he seems, he's very good at articulating these big ideas in ways that are understandable. But it brings me to something that I think is important to note, which is that, and this is something with David that I talk about a lot. We talk about a lot. The concept of real time, which is sort of, there's the scholarly analysis of scripture. And then there is the recollection of moments from the past and sort of sifting through experiences, ideas. For example, any time you find yourself writing something down that you thought, you are writing something that was inspired by a moment in the past, but the action is happening in the present. But my point is that this, the idea is to make contact in real time with the Buddha field or the Buddha mind. Or if the Buddha was doing this or that or experienced this or that, that is interesting to me. But even more interesting would be is that there's the possibility of making contact with that truth. And there's lots of different names for that truth. That truth is so many different, a million different names for that truth. One Vishnu being one of them. And one thing that I particularly like about Vishnu is the various incarnations. And every single incarnation of Vishnu is coming to the world when things are completely out of balance, when things are very out of whack, when things are completely topsy-turvy, Vishnu appears and sometimes in a very scary way and sometimes in the most subtle of ways sets things right in the world. And there's all kinds of stories Vishnu's encounter. You know the story of Vishnu encountering Indra? The King of Heaven. So Indra has built this palace that is just the most amazing palace. Like he spent, you know, these are gods. So they've spent probably the time the earth has been around. They've spent that times 50 building this incredible palace. And it's sort of drawn in from not just this universe but all the universes, all kinds of devas and deities and sages to help build this incredible palace. It's just amazing. And so it's so amazing that the gods themselves start showing up. So Shiva is coming. Brahman is coming there, blown away by this. And so then Vishnu shows up and he looks at Indra and he's blown away and he says, this palace is more beautiful than any palace that was ever created by any of the Indras. And Indra is like, wait, what, wait, what did you say? And he's like, oh my God, this one, the other Indras, they could never top this palace. This is really, really beautiful. And Indra is like, what do you mean the other Indras? And then Vishnu points to the ground. There's like a trail of ants, I guess, on the floor. And he says, oh yes, all those ants, they were Indra at 1.2. And so in that moment, this wonderful balancing happens, which is the, I think two things happen. I don't think Vishnu, when he was expressing his awe at the palace was just being sarcastic. I think he really meant it. Like, yes, I'm impressed. Like, wow, this is amazing. And then also simultaneously is the recognition of the infinite nature of time and that the building of palaces, though amazing, even from the lowest level to the highest level, ultimately is just one little stop along the way. And I love that story so much. And the way Vishnu represents the balancing out, not just of literal societal events. And within that, of course, is ultimate hope, right? The idea that no matter if you are personally, subjectively or experiencing some imbalance, there is within it this sort of pattern that is that when you're completely out of balance, something will come around the corner. Quite often you don't expect. Yeah, yeah. Trust, that's right. I need to start trusting. But there's one thing you said, you can listen to, read texts, listen to stories of encounters with high beings and so on. But ultimately, what you're looking for is that day to day, moment to moment, being in the center of Buddha mind, or whatever we wanna call truth, right? Yes. So that's what, and that's why we, you and I have been working on this material around, okay, what are the things that you, obviously one needs to practice, not have your crazy ass monkey mind going wild on you all the time. So practice, and you're doing this stuff, meditative stuff with David. And then there's looking at the way, the perspective from which we see ourselves on a day to day basis and that gigantic attachment to who we think we are, our story, right? We've been working on that. So I came across some interesting stuff, especially interesting related to the fact that tomorrow or the next day, your life completely changes. Yes, yes. And suddenly you're gonna be shepherding a soul, basically, right? That's right. So then you start to think about kind of, where the stuff you've been going through all into your adult life, myself and people around us. And you start to wonder, how does that happen? Where you come in and you're this absolutely pure awareness, right? You've come in from, as Ram Dass calls it, soul land. I love that analogy. And you come in and the body is reacting, needs to eat and it needs to sleep and shit and piss. That's it. There's nothing else going on. And so these people take care of that. And then after maybe six months, something starts to happen like, holy shit. There's people around me acting really weird. And need your kind of reactions to, God knows what. And there's a name suddenly that, is that me? There's a me. Holy shit. There's a me. Oh, shit. Oh my God. And they, for the most part, are completely unaware of where I've come from, really. They just look at me and they project all this stuff. Oh, hungry. Hungry was crying. This is a smart baby. Yeah, well. This freaking baby is amazing. This baby has come from the all-knowing place, okay? Where they all come from. Isn't it more like the baby's like, I want to touch that blade. I wonder what happens if I grab that knife. How let me fall into this rhino cage. But I know what you mean, an identity begins to form. There's suddenly like this. Yeah, and it's as a result of, well, there's a couple of things going on. I mean, we have to go into a big conversation around karma in terms of what's brought, whatever that thing is, soul, Buddha mind that goes, that does not die when the body dies and carries with it impressions into this next incarnation, which they need to be run off and so on. So then days go on, baby, days and then months, right? And then suddenly the baby's, oh, shit, there's objects going on around me too. What are these things, right? You're coming out of this subtle, subtle, empty mind thing, awareness thing, and into, okay, now you start to get conditioning. Yeah. You're reacting to the people around you and little by little that home, I call it home, awareness, right? It's the home, it's like, I was like born again. I'm just thinking when I went to India, to that home. I mean, the home I had, because when I thought back about me and whatever I could recall in the youngest parts of my life, I mean, I remember feeling fairly at home and then the fear and then the anger that people had around me, I would start to take it on. And then that home, it gradually went south. And then it was a matter of you're dealing with just being afraid, right? Fear. Yeah. And that's why when you, we've been talking about when the baby's actually there, the kind of nurturing that needs to be done to it's okay, it's okay. That's that guy's darshan of Maharaja. It's okay. But to say it's okay, you have to know it's okay. You have to know it's okay. So you gotta start doing the other kind of work, right? Which is the work that you're doing. And it's with, and this stuff comes, you got in touch with Ram Dass seven years, six years ago, something crazy, some long time back, right? And that, and I've said this to you before, that motion that you made, that intent, I gotta talk to him. And then, yeah, I gotta talk to these other people. I don't know what they're doing, but they need some help. Yeah. And then you got in touch with me. That intention, that to me was there the entire time. And probably you came in. I mean, I don't know what you can recall about your, I think you had, your mother was really a solid mother. Yeah, I had a very solid mother, very spiritual person. And yeah, this is kind of the part of the, I think this line of dialogue, I like a lot. It's fun and it's very similar to when you're in love with someone and you start going through the first time you met and then you start sort of picking apart like all the decisions you made leading up to the first time that you met. And you just sort of inevitably will come to this like spellbinding awe-inspiring moment of thinking, whoa, if I hadn't turned left there, right there, then I don't. And this is great on one level because it's sort of connecting you with the, or me, it connects me with like the grace as it's called, or just like, holy shit. You know, really, I don't see how I, I don't think, I don't know how much I had control over any of this stuff. It's like, you know, when you watch a crystal forming or something, you don't really, the crystal, you don't, it's like the thing just does what it does. It takes on this incredible shape, but it just does this on its own. And I think that's kind of what's known as the sangha or the community is there. And it's been, I think it's been here for a very long time, but I do think that it's no different than any other thing in the physical marketplace reality, which is if you wanna go to college, you have to apply for college. You don't just walk into a university and sit down at a class and start taking classes. Usually there's some process involved where you have to send something to show them that not only do you wanna go there, but you're ready to go there. There's another piece of the puzzle too. There's this like whole application process. One of my friends, this kid who took care of my dad when he was dying is like, just got accepted to this really great school. But I was, we went through the whole process and it was really exciting and intense and like real. Like there's a lot of people who wanna go to good colleges. And this, I think the difference, that's where things maybe start splitting apart a little bit, which is that in this case, if there's like a true intent inside of you, even if it's the muddiest, even if it's the most like muddy, foggy, blurry, crazy, even if it like, this is why in the Bhagavad Gita, I really love Krishna, describes the various people who like come to him. And one of them is the seekers of gold is what he says, which is like really cool because he's acknowledging like, oh no, no, whatever the reason, whatever your reason may be for beginning this path or stepping down this path, it's not gonna be the same reason as you continue to move down this path or when you begin. So you might come, you might find some group or sangha or satsang and there might just be some really lonely sense in you or there might be just a, you don't even know like you're on ambient and you're sort of blundering or sleepwalking, but there's a real sense in you, something, a kind of longing, I guess you could say, a kind of homesickness you could say, the most perplexing sort of homesickness though, because in this case, the homesickness is like, you can't really figure it out because you're like, wait, what am I pining for? Why am I feeling homesick right now? My home was when I was a kid. You know, I had a home when I was like between the ages of two and six or eight or before things went south if you had a crazy home or whenever you think your childhood ended, that's how a lot of people identify that. Oh, that was home. And they don't realize like, oh, no, no, you think the physical surroundings around you were your home and you think the family members were your home and then you think that the particular conditions were your home, but this is no different than somebody who experiences some kind of joy and then instead of understanding the joy that they're experiencing is contact with the truth, looks around and thinks, oh, it's when I walked under the tree, it's when I sat in this place, it's when I did this particular tap dance move or when I was like, and this is part of the formation of the identity is that you begin to try to recreate the surrounding conditions where you were contacting truth and now you start repeating the patterns of your childhood. And for some people, this is devastatingly horrible. So they start trying to recreate the chaos and people say, oh, you're trying to recreate the chaos because that's what you were habituated to growing up, but really you're trying to recreate the chaos because you were fresh out of heaven, so to speak, fresh out of soul land. And you're trying to make your, you're trying to get back to that thing that we call youth and what people call youth, they're being young. Yeah, yeah, well, youthfulness. You'd rather call home is before you got that identity going. I mean, by the time that you, apparently, by the time you recognize your parents and siblings, et cetera, that's when the feeling of mine comes into it, right? And before everything, before that is just everything is, it just is, there's no separation, right? We're not living in separation. We're living in that soul land place that just is. And your analogy there of the joy of walking under a tree in a moment, that's home. That's the is place, any one of those moments. But then suddenly that's before, and now it's divided into mine and yours. And that's when everything goes way south. It's six months old. It just goes off the end of the cliff at that point. And so, when there's a wake up that happens at a certain point, and that's what you're talking about where you go, wait a minute now. There is a place that I've experienced that is joy. Wow, so there's a possibility that that could happen. And the next thing, stuff is appearing, as you just said, from the universe that leads you to the next place. It's almost like you had nothing to do about it. You didn't create it, but you did create it because you had an initial thing. I mean, for me, it wasn't about joy and bliss of remembering that. For me, it was, I just was so sick of feeling shitty. All right, then I looked for, so I looked out words for what could make me feel better. And one of the things was music. And I had a mind blowing experience with that one. And I've told this story before with John Coltrane when I was like 15, 16 years old, that I went out of what I thought was me into something else and then psychedelics. Yeah. Okay. And then for me, it was, it's wrong. So all of these things happened. And for me, it was like, the pain in believing in my little guy mini me self was, I realized that the other day, actually, just dealing with some of the stuff I've been dealing with lately, that yeah, it's all about the fear of suffering, fear of impermanence, death, okay? That's the core of what's going on at the deepest level. And whatever wakes you up through joy, you remember something, that's where I'd like to be. Or I can't stand suffering like this on a day-to-day basis, what there must be something more. And then that more appears and gives you a path. And we describe you and I and many of the people that gravitate over, like listening to you right now on the podcast, and they might hit and take a chance with Romdus because there's some trust there, trust through you or maybe something through me on mind rolling, whatever it may be. And then the steps fall in front of each other like Domino's. Yeah. I mean, it's just like Domino's, it just happens. And then you go along with it because you start to realize, shit, there is a way to be happy, as simple as that. Well, I mean, it can be really quite shocking. Especially depending on how, the way you sort of came at it, especially if you came at it in a real sleepwalking, sort of like you don't even know what you're doing, you just stumble into it. And then there's a, this thing that you're calling happiness and fear, there's two words keep coming up. I think that the fear thing in particular is over, it's a result of not being aware of your situation because to be afraid, there has to be this sense of a kind of like imminent threat, right? Or a potential threat or whatever it may be. For some people, it's death. Usually it doesn't even get to death because death is a really pure truth. That's a good thing to be afraid of. In fact, what is- Wait, well, just uncertainty. Let's not go that far, just uncertainty. Or somebody's, things have changed radically. There's been some changes or you're uncertain or there's survival involved or there's so many different places that fear comes from. Sounds like my ass. Yes, but that uncertainty or insecurity is a kind of confusion for some people, so what's happening is to get back to the idea of like, well, I associate this thing with happiness or this thing with joy. So it's kind of like you, because you've like music reminded you of something and that reminder is very powerful but because of our various incarnations that we all have, nobody sat down and said to you this idea of like, well, there is a soul land or a sort of fundamental goodness in the universe that you are in right now. Right now, we're all in it. We're all hanging out there. This is what I love about what Ram Dass talks about is the various levels. On one level, you're an identity, you have a name, you have your memories, you have your predilections and all of the things around you that you... Habitual patterns. Habitual patterns and also the kind of like cocoon or the spider web, depending on I guess what type of person you are that you have sort of woven around you, which is like when you look around wherever you're at right now, that's your web, that's your crystallization pattern into the material universe. So wherever you're sitting, wherever you're looking around, the numbers in your phone, the tweets that you are looking at, all of it, this is just the way the crystal of the thing that you are identifying as is forming. And... Not to mention reacting to every phenomenon that comes into you and every thought that you have, you're reacting to everything. Well, this unbridled reaction. Well, that reaction is the spinning of the web or the cocoon, like every time you react, you'll find that you're in the reaction is a repetition of a pattern and the pattern is the weaving of the web, so to speak, that is your identity, right? And so this is why the practice is really good because what it does, it's really awesome sitting still because what it does is, for one, it seems completely ridiculous and so innocuous that it's so ignorable. That's one of the first signs that it's something to sort of really ponder, which is that, how come I can sit in front of my TV and on my couch with my dogs for hours straight, consuming and watching and just like, just getting into that like, fixation, right? But if I go and sit still at some part of my house for like six minutes, 10 minutes, it's like someone poured gasoline on me, just, I gotta move, man. So here we have this innocuous activity of not doing anything, so to speak, which is not a good descriptor probably, but and yet it's almost impossible to do and especially almost impossible to do over time. And so, but within that process of watching your breath, what starts happening is these, you begin to realize that the web weaving doesn't just happen externally in the reactive states, that in fact the web weaving is going on in these mind moments that are happening as we sit. And this is really fascinating to watch because then you start seeing the way that within your own sort of the many moments of your, when you're getting, when you think, oh my God, I can't fucking believe I, I'm in this place that I can't afford and I'm going through a divorce and I think I'm gonna get fired. Holy fucking shit, I'm, I'm backed into a corner here, man. That actually, interestingly enough, if you just remove all of that stuff and go down into your self, you realize that that actually is an outgrowth of something that's fundamentally within your identity. And I think that's what people call your karma, isn't it? And so somehow the practice of watching the way we weave this web within our own moments spontaneously, something within that creates the possibility of change, real change. Yeah, but you even, even those thoughts, like you're sitting in meditation, you have those thoughts, oh shit, I'm gonna get, oh my God, this bup, bup, bup. You're further creating more karma. These vibrations are going, they're, everything is real. That's the horror. And by the way, when you talk about, we talked about joy, oh, there, you can be happy. You can't, you know, joy, just being in the sunset, but what that really is though and why we want to gravitate towards that is complete presence. It's be here now. You, in that moment, you're not thinking about yourself. There isn't anything but that deep, total, deep experiential moment and you're there and in that moment. And that's what you talked about earlier, you know, the Buddhist, let's get it down to entering into Buddha mind on a, you know, mini second to second basis. That is what it's all about. So that's what we all are remembering. We are all remembering that and that's back to, baby pops out, baby's at home, he's Solan, still in, he's still in Solan. And that's when you're gonna look at this little being and you're, holy shit, it's God, you know, or whatever you want to call God, you know, we don't like God, we'll call him something else, but yeah, Buddha mind, you're gonna see that. And that's what wakes us up as we go along, we recollect through these moments. For me, it wasn't a piece of music. I actually went out of my identity. I wasn't that mini me in that moment with Coltrane playing my favorite things. Yeah, right. Yeah. And so I remembered. You became. Yeah, it is, it's Rama's being. In that moment, you're just being and that little guy that pops out there is just being and then, you know, gets conditioned. It's a weird thing. But I think this is one thing you said earlier, which is I think important to bring up again is that you said, we create, I create, I'm creating this, I'm spinning this web. And on one level, 100% true. Of course, obviously, if you are thirsty, you've got to go and get a glass of water and drink it. There's no question about it. And if you imagine that you're not the one drinking the water, then I think in this case, you're, oh, I thought I walked you, where you're like, yeah, I'm getting the fuck out of here before your rambles again. Yeah. But the watching of the pattern, I think also shows you, for example, the idea that we create our thoughts, if you just spend any amount of time quietly watching your breath, you realize that you're not creating your thoughts. Your thoughts are bubbling up out of something. They're like, they're bubbling up or they're a kind of, you're not creating your thoughts anymore than a hive of bees is creating the buzz of the sound of a hive of bees. It's just this activity that's happening within yourself. So by realizing that there's this emergent quality to your thought patterns that doesn't really seem to be within your grasp. Because if it were, holy shit. You know what I do right now? I'd create the most genius thought of all time. I'd be like, let's activate another brilliant, brilliant thought of truth. And then whoof, there it would be. But really what's happening is there's just this arising of thought patterns. And then of all the thought patterns, one or two, grab your attention and you pull that in. And then within that is where you start creating the reaction, but you're not really creating your thoughts. They just seem to be coming. That is dependent origination, is it not? I think, yeah, I think so. I think that's... Sorry, I had this turned around. Dependent origination, which is the Buddhist, one of the most important concepts in Buddhism. And the basic, most simple thing of it is, we are primordially, which we've been talking about, Buddha-mind, and what happened. But another term for that could be, instead of Buddha-mind, because sometimes people, that sounds crazy, and you start thinking of a mind, you start thinking of some kind of brain. True self, true nature. I think you have to go with... What do you like? I think a good way to put it, only because, and it's a, maybe too basic way to put it, but because it's so, it is truly elemental, is I think you could say, just in terms of like, obviously we are not this, but you're gold. And another way to put that might be, you're fundamentally good, but only because everyone kind of brings, Buddha-mind, I'm thinking like, immediately. Okay, forget it. Fundamental good. Fundamental good. But good is confusing. So I think it's better to like, actually use a kind of like, something that clearly is like, of no real value, but as it just is a little tool or a crutch, imagine this, you're gold, you're made of gold, you're what you are and what things are and what everything is, is gold. It's the most beautiful, incredible, reflective thing ever. It is the source of home. It's that from which all homes have derived from. It's the source of mother. It's the source of father, but not father and mother that have been caught by their own sort of karmic predicament, but the precursor father-mother state. The place where you see skin to skin, the mother holding the baby to her breast, that is fundamentally good and that is what you are. So that would be one way to say it is gold, you're gold. Gold, yeah. You're golden, that's one of the things, you're golden. Okay, you're golden, yeah, that's good. It's a little bit of a problem in India and the Hindu thing because they talk about the two things that you get caught in immediately. They always talk about women in gold. Talk about me too movement, women in gold. They don't mean women, they mean greed for desire. Right. Well, yeah, and also that whole system is like stems from a kind of patriarchal, you know, so there's always that kind of like ridiculous misogynistic insanity is gonna spring up, but I think, so how about this then, let's put it this way, gold in this realm, the thing we call gold is a mirror and it's reflecting something and the thing that it's reflecting is what you are. And anytime you've encountered a thing, whether it's John Coltrane, whether it's something as simple as a sunrise, whether it's that moment of complete and absolute forgiveness of yourself that happens in a MDMA experience, whether it's truly falling in love in that moment before you can think, my God, I hope I never lose this person, whether it's the feeling you get on a really great jog where you're like three miles in and you start accidentally being like, thank you, God, thank you, God, or whether it's just simply waking up and there's a moment of smiling and you're like, God, wow, wonderful. And then you remember, holy shit, my dad died yesterday. Oh no, fuck, oh my God. That is what you are. That's what you are. And there's a lot of overlays on top of it and those overlays are your identity. And so that's where we get caught is somewhere in one of those overlays. Yeah, now, how about divine presence? Can we call it that? That's my favorite thing. Or maybe the divine presence, you know? I had this, did I tell you this? I went to the dentist. You told me, but please, I wanna hear the story again. This is a nitrous oxide story. Yeah, I went to the dentist and I had an impact that too. They gotta pull the damn thing. And I went there and it was, I was going to India, I only had like, you can't do it after a certain time, you can't fly. There's a big hole in your mouth. So I went there and the doc says, yeah, no problem, nitrous is here. I said, good, I love nitrous. And the thing was he got me in at the last minute. So he had a lot of other people, patients that he was seeing. So he came in and he put the nitrous on and he said, well, look, it'll be a little bit of time because I've got to treat this, you know, I've got to tend to this other person. So I said, no problem. I mean, seriously, they had me there for 20 minutes. Yeah. Okay, I said, turn that up. And I had complete presence. It's called Darshan of Ninkaroli Baba. And then from there, all my whole history and not just history, but nowness with every manifestation of divine presence through individuals, through being, through psychedelic, whatever, this whole trip was honoring every bit of that divine presence for 20 minutes. It was a really powerful experience, psychedelic experience that it's with me to this day, okay? It was so powerful. So I love that term divine presence. But you know what, I get, but then I have fear. You know what my fear is? What? You're going to laugh at me. No, I bet I won't. What is it? It's the whole Mr. Rogers thing that, remember I told you, I wrote to Duncan. I sent him a text that I was on a plane and watching Mr. Rogers, the documentary movie, which I highly recommend to people. And I was, it was, you know, there's not a lot of oxygen up there at 37,000 feet. So, you know, I was, it makes you cry. There's no doubt about it. It's the pure, the purity of this being, you know, that I, anyhow, I, so I sent Duncan a text and I said, Duncan, you've got to watch this, Mr. Rogers. I mean, I know you, you might be, take that as scans. You're Mr. Rogers. And Duncan wrote me back and said, I got it. I have a Mr. Rogers. I'm already watching. His name is Hannity, okay? And then I got fear. Oh God, he's, yeah, he thinks I'm just a pussy watching Mr. Rogers and I myself had, in the past, denigrated Mr. Rogers as, oh, you know, that syrupy, sacred shit. And then suddenly, and I realized, you know, of course I haven't seen Mr. Rogers in ages, suddenly he's there in this doc and then you did exactly what I myself was, had that fear in me because I had that mind too going on. I had that conditioned thing going on. Yeah, I'm just doing like a crass blasphemy for no reason. Like I'm just being like, but there is a reason behind it. You know, it's because like, you know, it's a kind of like chance to express a kind of like ridiculous absurdist gruffness to one of my great teachers and the truth of course is, and this is, it doesn't take any amount of brains at all to realize that the reason we're not watching Mr. Rogers and the reason we're not crying all the time and the reason our hearts aren't opening up and we're not on the phone with people telling them how much we love them. Like I love you, Ragu, or like I love my teachers, I like love my wife or my son coming. The reason we're not doing that all the time is because it is scary and it is so, so much easier to be gruff and cynical and closed off. It's not cool. It's not cool. That's it. Yeah, but it's nothing, it's like really, if you really look at it, the fear isn't so much of societal rejection. It's really what the fear is is that we don't wanna get our hearts broken because the idea is this, listen to this crazy, crazy idea. Here's the crazy idea. It's true. It's true. It's true. Right now is home. And not just in some ridiculous, like the side of something written on a cereal box home, the source of all homes. Right now, true. Now, because of our karma, you hear a thing like that and there's a real potential to be disappointed, I guess, or a sense of like the possibility you hear that and you're like, no, it can't be. I'll never go home again. I'm never gonna go home again. I'm lost, I'm lost, I'm lost, I'm lost forever. I'll never see my mom again. I'll never see my dad again. I'll never feel that again. All that's left is hardness. All that's left is protection. All that's left is just fight my way through the last few days of my life and then blink into non-existence and that's where I'm at. And fuck you for even daring to put on the table the possibility that I could in this very moment be back home with someone I loved and I lost. Fuck you. That's a lie. You're a con artist. That's not true. Fuck you. So this attitude is a continuum. I just gave a pretty extreme example. I've never met anyone like that in my life but usually it doesn't manifest as a fuck you. It manifests as a kind of eye roll. It manifests as like, I guess you want to go for the lime, baby, or it manifests as a kind of like, okay, well you go and do your little rainbow gatherings, all right, but we got to deal with a fucking campaign in Syria. That's Hannity or whatever, right? But mixed in, but it's all the same thing, which is like, hey, I've worked real hard, real hard becoming a callus and becoming numb and it took a lot of work and it took a lot of web weaving and I really don't want the broken heart. I don't want to feel that again. I don't want to feel that again. It's too much. It's too much. I don't want to do that again. I'm just going to die and that's it. To me, that's it. That's it. That's really what it is. It's like that concept that it's right here, not just in a bullshit way, but like here more than you could ever possibly dream. It won't even come to you in your dreams and that you can be in this place right now and the way to do it is not by buying shit, but by sitting still and listening to your breath. Wow, I don't know, man. That sounds like a bunch of snake oil if I was someone who was incredibly bitter. But this thing we're talking about cynicism and related to Mr. Rogers and all, I looked into that into myself and I see, and you and I talked about this a little bit with in relation to Ram Dass and Larry David and how Ram Dass, I tried to get him to watch Larry David. I love Larry David and how Ram Dass, it's too unkind for him. And that's because he's in a very special place that allows for gigantic doses of vulnerability. And I looked into myself and I see that this kind of cynicism that I do carry in some ways works in terms of the good side, I would say, that's not the right way to put it, of cynicism or the corollary to cynicism is discrimination. You're just not going around and everything that's in front of you, it's yeah, that's cool. And I'm completely down with that, I'm down with this, I'm down with that. And there's people, I used to know people in India who went around the entire country from one guru to another, right? And it was completely without discrimination. So discrimination and the Hindu thing is called in Sanskrit more Viveka, spiritual discrimination. So it isn't actually a very important thing, but it's miles, billions of miles away from this identity that we put up that has this cynical attitude and it's a way of defending our... Sure, yeah, you know, art and the appreciation of art in all its many forms from the most dark, scary, seemingly nihilistic art to just basic, like nice, dark, cynical comedy to whatever it is, the consumption of these things is a human right and it should be done, it's wonderful if that's what you're drawn to. To me, the problem is that you could start thinking that there's a way to be, other than the way you are right now. And so in this situation, you see someone like Ram Dass and you hear, oh, he doesn't want to watch Larry David, I'm not gonna watch Larry David, or you see somebody who is making decisions that are based on a lifetime of practice and you wanna skip the lifetime of practice and you wanna just do the decisions that they're making, not understanding that, because that would be easier than to, it would be like, instead of going to college, it would be like putting on a graduation outfit and a hat and giving yourself like a PhD, for example, and walking around and like, you know, acting as though the way you would see in the teacher act. And so this is not it, and this is the other element of getting into real time and in the moment as you are is because where you're at right now is it. And that's the other thing Ram Dass talks about, which I love so much, which is that this thing as you are, from the, you know, gleaming, beautiful, reflective quality of your deepest self that is showing to everyone around you who can see it, your true identity is a soul made of love or a thing that is a bridge connecting to the divine consciousness, or to all the way to like, whatever your porn history is from the last couple of nights ago, the entirety of the continuum has within it in this moment right now, something that is fundamentally good. And that is the practice. So when people say meditation is the practice for death, I've never understood that, but I do think it's a good way to practice listening. And it's a good way not to just practice listening to others and listening to music and listening with your eyes as you take in beauty and listening with your skin as you take in the feeling of the world and then listening to your thoughts as they arise, but then listening to something that's underneath all of it. This tiny little, it seems like when you're in a, you know what, one of my favorite things, walking through the forest and suddenly you hear a river. Do you know that? It's the best. You didn't hear it. You were walking for a while, surely it was there, but then all of a sudden you hear it. It sounds like a little song, way out there like chimes or something. It's beautiful, but very, very quiet, but you could walk towards that. And then the closer you get to it, the more you can hear it. And you're like, oh wow, that's not a little river. That's a big river. Holy shit, that's a raging river. And that I think is what happens when you begin to come home in this sense, which is that the thing that seemed like a little trickle in the sound of John Coltrane is actually the most, the raging river that is so powerful that we are doing everything we can to not hear it. And because we're afraid it's gonna suck us in. But by the time you hear this river too late, you're already sucked in. Yeah. You know, meditation though, that is all true, but the inner inquiry that can happen, and that's why they call the particular practice that we're most familiar with and still many of us do, is vipassana, insight meditation. So it's the eventuality of insight into the impermanence of every moment, every molecule, and that insight goes a long way to eventually that river, that rushing river that you start, here's a faint thing, and then you walk through the forest and it gets closer and closer. Suddenly, the time that it takes to get to the rushing river or be at the rushing river is far less than it normally is because the conditioning and the defense mechanisms that we carry on a moment-to-moment basis, they start to recede into the background and the foreground becomes complete presence of everything, every moment. That's why that Bob talked about the Buddha, all pervasive Vishnu. And imagine being in a room where you were absolutely, you were everyone in the room and everything that was going on in each one of these people, you were that. It's inconceivable. But that is the extraordinary eventual reality. That is who, that's why Nim Karoli Baba, which is my bestest example, because I experienced it, that's why he knew everything about everybody, the past, present, and future. Because that time continuum, that you remember you talked about that earlier in the podcast, ceases and desists. It is no longer relevant. And so, all the conditions are gone. So that meditation is one major path to that moment. And so in this river analogy, it's sort of like, it could happen like this. You're walking down the path and actually you don't even hear a river, you hear a John Coltrane. And then maybe you start wondering like, where did he get that? Where is that? How did he come up with that thing he's playing? Where is that coming from? Or maybe you don't hear John Coltrane, you hear, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Ram, Hare Ram, Ram Ram, Hare Hare. You think, what is that sound? What is a mantra? What is that? And in these cases, you might be, one thing you could say is maybe what happened here is John Coltrane heard a river and he started playing music. And the music that he was playing was him making the sound of the river. And then maybe the Hare Krishna Mahamantra coming through people's voices was people making the sound of that river. And then maybe someone like Neem Krali Baba is someone as if when the river starts talking to you, which is luck and really, really good fortune. And in that case, the river is talking to you and it's saying, oh, I love you. I love you so much. And when that's coming out of some people's mouths to you, there is a sense of like, I don't know. But when it's coming out of the river and it's saying it to you, oh my God, that's a different kind of I love you. And yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's a great, I love that. That's a great analogy. And it goes back to, in a practical level, and you know how much I love to be practical. As do I. Yes, on a practical level, that is absolutely possible because trust, it's because of trust. That is possible just because of trust. Then you start to realize, oh yeah, this is, I feel good. I'm feeling, I'm in that river. I'm not even thinking, how did I get here? I'm just letting go, just let go into that river. That's right. And that process is really beautiful. And that doesn't even, sometimes, I think people here trust and are like, no, no, no, no, I'm not gonna, I don't wanna trust. First, I wanna test and I wanna measure and I wanna quantify and I wanna explore. And I think that's like the first step, which is like, maybe this is not true. Maybe it's all a bunch of hooey and it's a bunch of rambling from people who are one took over the line. But I think that it would serve some purpose to think, all right, well maybe, I don't know, maybe there is something. Maybe there's a river, I don't know. I have no idea, but the beginning to figure out a way to quiet things. So if I was telling you, hey listen, not only are you in a forest very close to the most beautiful river of all time, in fact, the river of time, in fact, the river that time, it's the source of time. But right now, it doesn't look like a forest. It looks like your house or it looks like your car. It looks like the subway or it looks like this or that. But if you're getting a little in a quiet place and just literally turn things down, I don't even mean in some analogous metaphorical sense, turn your phone off, turn your TV off, stop whatever you are gonna do for a second. It's okay, you will go back to that thing and then just sit still for a second. And then listen just to your breath. And when you're listening to your breath, you actually are listening to a language, interestingly, a primordial language that everyone on the planet speaks, which is the language of inhalation and exhalation. And so you start listening to that. And then your thoughts are now the radio. You turn that down, your thoughts are your phone messages. Turn, if you can, let them come. Breath, back to the breath. Somewhere within there, over time, not right away. And that's where the trust comes in, I think. It's not trust in the sense of like, trust this, just look at this picture and trust it's gonna, you're gonna get better. It's trust us in the sense that over the period of this process of breathing, you might begin to hear something that you never heard before. That's something Chokin and Chopra Rifices used to say, which is there are sounds that you've never heard, there are smells that you've never smelled. And if I tell you that, you just have to trust that that's a possibility. And then trust if people are saying, well, here's a process to begin to hear those sounds and maybe smell some of those smells, that's where you have to trust. Because that, you still have to get yourself down on the bench or whatever your practice may be, or in front of the harmonium or chanting. Yeah, whatever, yeah. And I think we have to talk about trust. We have to include another, the reality of intuition. Ram Dass calls it imagination room, where you go and you're able to be completely free and talk to a being, talk to a Buddha, talk to a Christ, talk to a name Karoli Baba, but it's intuition. So you trust the trust with intuition. Yeah, and that is the beginning of the dance and that's the beginning. And also, don't forget, in this forest, fortunately for all of us, there are also other people who've heard the river and you'll find them, you'll stumble, you'll run into each other, as you're like, wait, is it over there? And in that, a group forms. And within that group, now we have this wonderful sort of gypsy caravan of all types of people. And some of those people are singing songs of the river. Some of those people are making art that kind of looks like the river. Some of those people don't say anything at all because they just want to listen to the fucking river and they would love it if we'd shut up for a second. But within it, it's like so much beauty and that is the satsanga, the sangha. But man, speaking of rivers, there's gonna be a river of tears. If I don't do what I told my wife to take the dogs. And can you tell me one thing before we leave? Yes. How can you possibly be so calm in this day? Today's, tomorrow it's a whole, it's a different life. It's like complete metamorphosis. Thank God for the present moment. And thank God for the training to be in the present moment. And even within this moment, if I told you I was calm, that would not be necessarily true, but my God, I really do feel a great deal of love and joy right now. And the fact that I get to experience this at all just feels like the greatest gift of my life. And I'm so lucky for you and your teaching that I can enter into this with some mindfulness instead of like just shitting bricks and screaming. Raghu, I love you.

Well, there's a letter here. It's postmarked from Harvard. Harvard. Truly unexpected mail. To imagine the Kaczynski's got a letter from Harvard. Well, let's go out and open it. It's probably a mistake. I doubt you got a letter from Harvard. Dear Theodore, congratulations. I am delighted to inform you that the Committee on Emissions has admitted you to the new Harvard with a full-max scholarship, but you're only 16 feet or this is a total catastrophe. You're going to leave your mom to go to Harvard? Harvard. This is the letter that killed your mother. To think you would abandon your sweet old mom.

Who will give me baths? Who will rub my feet? Who will put lotion into my cracked and dry teeth? Who will do with Theodore? Dear Theodore, dear Theodore, why would you leave your mommy? Who will give me baths? Who will rub my feet? Who will put lotion into my cracked and dry teeth? Who will do with Theodore? And there's a little sneak peek of an upcoming musical that I have been directing, acting in, doing the music for, singing in, as well as designing all the sets, building all the sets, doing all the lighting, and doing pretty much everything. In fact, I'm the only person running the entire show, including working at the box office. And to be honest, it's really fucking hard. And I don't know exactly why I thought I could do an entire Broadway production with no one to help me. Maybe I should start microdosing. Now, I am so excited for you to dive into today's podcast, but first, this. You know what I used to think? I used to think I'm not a coffee snob. I just like coffee, whatever.

While my clone was reading that commercial, I was smearing Adrena Chrome on my nipples and thinking that maybe I shouldn't do the Broadway show. Maybe I bit off a little more than I could chew by saying I could do everything myself. This is clone five letting you know that we have a fantastic podcast for you today with Johnny Pemberton. You've probably seen Johnny on the boob tube. No, I'm doing this one. No, I'm doing it. Fine. What the fuck? Do it. Which clone is that? It's me, clone three, and I will do the intro like Duncan asked me to do. No, I didn't. You're supposed to be in your pod. You have Meleska. Fine. I'll go back in my fucking pod. No, it's not gross. It's not gross. It's very common for clones to get Meleska. It goes away. God damn it. Every clone back in your pods now. Casey, get him in the pods. Please don't make us go back in our pods. I don't want to go back in the pod. Well, you're going. You know, a lot of people think being a billionaire is easy and I get it. I'm not complaining. I think I do have a few advantages over, you know, most people in the sense that I've got an army of clones, underground bunkers. I've got a tiny maze in my brain filled with extra dimensional beings that give me ideas of things to say. And of course, 17 blimps. But I got to tell you. Clones are not quite as luxurious as they might seem. Maybe you've watched Beverly Hills top clones or my favorite clone, but it's not like that. That's just TV. You've got to bathe the clones, feed the clones, distinguish the clones, keep the clones happy and euthanize the clones when they start malfunctioning or develop a fungal rot. My point is this. More clones, more problems. The answer to finding peace in our life is not to duplicate ourselves into genetic reflections that do most of our work, but to maybe remove the clones from the clone fleet. Because I go to the bathroom and come back and one of my fucking clones is disguising himself as me. Done. He's done. Extinct. Destroy him. Sorry about that, guys. That was clone eight, who is the only clone that doesn't realize he's a fucking clone. And I keep walking in on him with my wife. He's drive is my car around and he makes terrible financial decisions and he's done terrible things on the road that I would never do. And that's the last you're going to see him. We've got a great podcast for you today. Johnny Pemberton is here with us. You probably know Johnny from Superstore or the many movies he's been in. There is awesome podcasts live to tape or maybe you follow us hilarious Twitch streams, but listen to this. If you're going to be in LA on Friday, April 22nd, you must. It's an order. You must go see his incredible one person show, Rege Colostomy Back. Now I know what you're thinking. Is this another dumb joke? Is that a joke name for a show? No, Johnny is not only incredibly talented comedian. He's also an amazing actor and this one person show is one of the coolest live stage shows I've ever seen. So I really hope you'll go see him. It's Friday, April 22nd. It's called Rege Colostomy Back and it's going to be in Los Angeles. The links are going to be at dunkatrustle.com. And of course, Johnny will sometimes feature for me on the road. We're going to be in Portland this weekend. So if you're listening to this on the weekend of March 30th, we're going to be there. March 31st, March 32nd, March 33rd at helium. You can find ticket links at dunkatrustle.com. And now everybody, please welcome back to the DTFH Johnny Pemberton. Johnny, welcome back to the DTFH. Let's start off. I want to see if you can identify what this sound is. Okay. I'm listening. Oh, wow. I think that maybe it was two possible things that could be one of those early field recordings from when they first allowed clubbing of seals in Canada. Yeah. Or it could be a clip from the Oscars. You know what? It's seals. It is. Okay. Yeah. But now I'll play the clip from the Oscars. God, I'm ready. That's so cool, though, man. It's so amazing to you. So you had that, I guess you had that relaxation CD, the clubbing of the seals. The clubbing of the seals. The one that came with the Canadian club whiskey when they did the expansion pack. Yeah. That was incredible. And they put still to this day, if I can't sleep, I just play that album and I'm out. Okay. Now here is the, here's the sound from the Oscars. I'm ready. Oh, wow. Okay. That sounds similar, but not the same. Not quite the same, but to me, that's kind of the remarkable thing. A lot of people are writing about how identical, almost identical, the sound of Chris Rock being slapped by Will Smith is to the clubbing of a baby seal. Yeah. An exciting thing. You know, well, to quote Mark Twain, you know, history doesn't repeat, but it sometimes echoes. And I was just wondering, what are your thoughts on that? What are the odds that the sound of clubbing a baby seal would be almost identical to the sound of two of the great celebrities of our time? Two of the great celebrities, you know, in a, in a sort of public. Tet-de-tet. Yeah. Tet-de-tet. I would say one of my thoughts on that, you know, it's, it's mixed. I feel a lot of different things. I feel embarrassed. My, it was my first, my first thought was utter and sheer embarrassment. And then it sort of warmed up to, um, like, uh, walking around outside in circles, being like, okay, what's happening? What happened? How did this happen? Yeah. How can we, how can this torturous thing happen again? Okay. We already knew it was bad. Unreal. And this, by the way, the circle thing, this, so I, you know, I watch it. I throw my hands up in the air. I go outside. I start walking around in circles. Circles. And I look over, my neighbor has come outside is walking around in circles. All my neighbors start coming out and everyone just starts walking around in circles. I didn't even know why I was doing it. Then I look around and see everyone has come outside and Walker. And now I'm hearing you are doing it too. What the fuck, man? Like the, the potency of that smack sent so many Americans outside and we all just walked in circles. Have you ever seen, you know, the whole thing with elephants in the zoo? They do the same thing. I didn't know that. I do. And the elephants are in captivity. They just walk around slowly in circles because they're just, they're losing their minds. It was like that. Like I, I, when it happened, I, it, I really like, you know, I have a tenuous grip on reality as it is, you know, and in that moment, it felt like I'd been hanging on a branch and and, and Will Smith just came and like pulled my fingers one at a time off the branch until I fell backwards into some abyss. Yeah. I, I say I felt a similar way. It was less of an abyss and more of like, um, like, uh, if I had taken a step forward and if my, my, uh, foot, instead of hitting the ground went through and I just flipped upside down. And if it was daylight, it became nighttime. Fuck. Fuck. Just flipped. So you just had a reversal, basically. You just felt like your, your day turned into night, your night turned into day. Yeah. Yeah. Music started playing backwards. Yeah. Um, I suddenly want, I suddenly found shrimp to be good, delicious things. I don't know, I'm a big shrimp guy, but I like, was like, man, I could actually, I think I like shrimp. Jesus Christ. Yeah. So you got fucked up. Yeah. I got fucked up. Are you okay now? Are you doing better? That's the question is, are you okay? That's what we're asking ourselves. Uh, I've been watching a lot of old vintage John Stewart clips from the, from pre-911. Yeah. That really helps a lot. Oh my God. Oh my God. Or so not pre-911, but I guess all around, not, not around 911, but way before 911 and when, after we, we stopped caring about 911. Yeah. It was like kind of like, okay, you know, that happened, but let's, let's get back to the business. Those old Stewart clips, pre-911, man, it's like when you, I don't know if you've ever had Jock-Itch, but for me, like when I'm really spiraling, it feels like that first spray. It stings a little bit, but it cools you down. Yeah. Exactly. Oh man. Yeah. I, you know, I, I gotta tell you, man, uh, one of the things that did give me a little bit of relief as I, uh, as I, along with so many other Americans have just been spiraling since that moment. One of the things that did give me some relief was, uh, your poem about the incident. And I wondered if you could share a little bit of it for the folks who don't subscribe to it. There's a wonderful blog at Vlogspot. Uh, yeah. Well, I mean, it's a private one. I, I haven't made it public yet. I'm still workshopping. Oh shit. I'm sorry. Do you want me to delete that? No, it's fine actually. Cause I've just been, everything's a work in progress. The idea that it would be finished or something is ridiculous. Why would it be finished? I love that. Yeah. That's very, it's, I love that. You know, I think like not to diverge too much, but I think we have him programmed to think things have some kind of like ending. That's one of the, I think byproducts of movies and TV shows is that things, we, we have the idea that things resolve when, when they don't. Um, but anyway, could you just, I'll launch into it. Launch into it. Thanks. Screech of the tires as the world turns, picking up the macaroon, the cream motion blur. I turn off the TV and look to my side deep in a pillow lies an old glider hide, slick and fast from uses over the years, pull it up tight like a hat down over the ears. I'm out. I'm up. In through the air, flipping, slipping, splashing, ripping out my hair. What did I just see in front of me on this big 75 inch Costco purchased flat screen TV? Could it be just a visage that is warped from a dream or just outtakes an NFT sort of like a slice of rotted cream, but it's neither it's nor as I bust out the door, looking in the air across everywhere circles galore, the neighbors spinning beards and mustaches a twist. I lay to the ground one knee, then two concrete is kissed. Oh God, Johnny. Thank you. It's just, it's so brave because a lot of us, we don't have the words. I'm just a vessel. I can feel that. Hold on. It's okay. Take all the time you need. Thanks. I just. I need to process. I love them both so much. I love Will Smith. I love Will Smith. The thing is that the thing that really gets me is that people don't understand just how much struggling it was going on, the amount of struggle to deal with the disability. And these struggles and Chris Rock is so funny. He made me laugh. He made me laugh. He made me laugh too. I think about both people and I feel like why do we have to choose? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. It's okay. Let's take a break. Let's just get. Okay. And we're back. Hey Duncan. Great to see you. Good to see you Johnny. Wow. Oh, wow. Sun is shining. Yeah. The sun is shining. And what a fucking week, man. It was. What a week. It was on week. Schumer. Okay. And we're back. Sorry. A little technical error there gang. Great. No problem. I'm fine. Everything's on the level now. It's okay. No problem. Dude. Man. I don't have a fucking. You. You. You. I've been really actually like, um, the while, while, well west quite a bit. It was Kenneth Branagh, um, who wrote Belfast. Uh, he just, you know, wrote that and that's also. Uh, do I have to see Kenneth Branagh and we'll smell together after. I would have 20 years. That's some. Okay. Well, it's two days later gang. And, uh, I think we've finally gotten our shit together. Sorry about that. I know a lot of y'all are probably. Feeling the, the tsunami, the emotional tsunami from the incident. Sunday. And we won't go into any more detail about it or talk about it. Johnny, how was the road? I know you went out recently. Why don't you tell me a little bit about it? It was pretty good. It was, I forgot how exhausting it is. It's like a thing where I forgot how much I, uh, I'm not good at driving. Oh fuck. You were driving from show to show. Every day, every day. Oh baby. That's hardcore. That's hardcore, man. Fuck. Fuck. I remember that. Jesus Christ. You drive to the show. You check into your hotel. Anything goes wrong. You're so fucked, man. Like. Because you have every time, every second is precious. You got to have it to like. Yeah. You compress. You just got to have. And also the best thing is how much utter trash food. I just ate some food where I got to have something. What'd you eat? The worst thing I think was probably some. Oh my God. Just thinking about it makes me laugh. Um, when you go to a place that has pizza and you get something called a flatbread. I remember we got a flatbread. Flatbread's like where they basically hit the pizza dough. They put a bunch of like mashed garlic on it. Maybe some, uh, some balsamic vinegar and they gave me like a cup of some type of a, I think it was goat cheese dip. Why'd you order that? Because I thought it would be kind of light maybe. Instead of being like a whole pizza. Don't get it. Don't just like, I get it though, man. You see, I made them. It was a mistake. This is why, this is why my Caesar salad. This is why I get chicken Caesar salad on the fucking road. It's like you get a chicken Caesar. They can't fuck it up. It's, it's so basic. It's very few ingredients. You get some chicken. You get some lettuce. You get some cheese. And that's it. You don't have to roll the fucking dice because you don't want it. You know what you don't want? If you are going to eat before show, you don't want to get on stage and you, and you like have like food poisoning. You have to, you could, you know, you don't want, you don't want to have to get on stage and maybe shit your pants. Yeah. I was prepared to do it, but I didn't have to. I mean, we only had a little bit of the, uh, the flatbread garlic with the goat cheese beforehand. I ate the rest of it later, um, over a trash can. Oh my fucking God, man. That's, that's brave. That's really, but I get it. But by the, what, how many shows in were you when you made that decision? I think I was the last show. Yeah, there you go. By then your mind's a blur. You don't even know what's happening. You're like whirling around. It's fucking, you don't know. You're in a weird haze. It felt pretty good though. I got to say like four shows in four days. Yeah. I haven't done that in a long time. And by the fourth one, it's weird how, um, because the fourth one they didn't have, uh, it was kind of a last minute tour. They didn't have the stage set up as well as it should have been. There wasn't, um, there wasn't that lighting. Yeah. And I was like, Hey, uh, there's, there's gotta be some lighting because you can't see the comedian's face. And if you can't see someone's face, that really, that really costs a problem. That's like a real problem if you can't see someone's face. Right. And so he was like, um, okay, we'll have to kind of like maybe stop down for a second and I'll just stretch. I'm like, yeah, let's do that. That's worth it. And we got one light. They had one light turned on and it still wasn't great, but it made all the world a difference. Holy fuck. See, that's the, that, that, that version of the road, man is so crazy in that, in that, you know, people are inviting you to come perform. Right. And you, you, like the things that you have grown accustomed to is a comedian, just things that seem obvious. Right. They don't know that. They don't know about the lights. You know who's a stickler for this shit? Todd, Todd Glass. Todd Glass. Yeah. I remember hearing him say this one time, actually had a conversation with a few people just a few weeks ago about this very night when he came into a show in LA. He was like, Hey guys, a couple of things. You gotta rope off these back seats so they can't go up there. You gotta have music playing. You gotta have, you gotta do these things. You gotta do them. It's like, do them right now. Do them right now because if you do, you'll make your show a hundred percent better. Yep. You'll make it a hundred percent better. And it's so easy to do because everybody, we always forget that like most people just will kind of do what they're told if it's reasonable. Yeah. They can say, Oh, you can't sit there. Like, Oh, I'm sorry. I won't sit there. Glass is bar rescue for shows. Like he comes. How many shows is he saved? Like if there's. I've seen him do it and there's stories of how he does it. I've watched him come in with his ferocity. Like it's, it's hardcore, man. Like he comes in and like, cause he's realized that if you don't have that kind of ferocity, it won't happen. The people. Yeah. You can't be wishy-washy about it. You can't be, maybe we can do this cause people will be like, Oh, I don't want to do that cause you have to do that. I don't want to do anything. I just don't, I think like probably if you're someone who loves comedy, you're like, maybe I'll put on a show, invite some comics, pay him to come perform. You, your idea of comedy is based on your love of it. You don't understand that it's like you actually have to have these certain things for it to work. Like, and you know, the, the weird novelty shows people do, do it at a fucking laundromat or whatever. Cause they know about those. And so from those, they, they assume like, ah, you don't really need anything other than a dude on stage. Like you don't even need a mic. Just somebody up there talking. It'll be funny. It's one thing if you're going to perform for the, the troops or something like that, where it's people who just, yeah, man, anything you can do, we will appreciate it. Cause we're out here in a bunker and that's different than being a bunch of drunk people in like Mississippi who are, who are ready to be like five seconds behind you and scream shit because they feel like they can, because the environment doesn't tell them that they can. Right. Or they're like, Hey, we're going to put a band up in front of you. That's always fucking fun. Remember that? I remember that one time. Yeah. And we were trying to figure out like, why is this not work? It's, oh, it's because it's like sapping all the energy from people because it's, you have to pay attention to this. Yep. Right. Exactly. By the time you get up there, they've been watching like an hour of a quartet and it's like they're exhausted. They were paying attention, but you get the idea, but the idea behind it is always steeped in the love of comedy. This idea of like, man, this is going to be fucking artistic and beautiful. I'm going to have a noise band before you all go up. Yeah. A noise band and then you're going to go up and it's going to be incredible. You got to follow a fucking noise band, someone playing like pigs, squealing backwards. Have you done that? No. It just seems like something that would end up encountering. Band afterwards. Band afterwards can be pretty fun though. Yeah. Band afterwards. I think it's a rock out. If you want to stay, you can stay. I did this show years ago in Boston. This is a great band called Bruvz, B-R-U-V-S. They have like this, it's like a duo or a trio. It sounds like very 90s kind of alternative rock. They played after the show. They just like gung-ho, just brought all their stuff in right afterwards. That's cool. And they played and it was so much fun because it was after the show and we're all just hanging out watching this really loud band play and a bunch of cops were there and shit and they were enjoying it. Yeah. Yeah. That's cool. You know, like stories of comics like Neil Hamburger are pretty awesome because he's someone who like was forged in that kind of situation. Yeah. It's so different. Right? Who did he open up for? He used to open up for... Maybe Tool or something. Something like that. Like Tool or something. Like Neil Hamburger. Just like super famous, super hardcore rock bands where no one's expecting a comedian and he would go up in front of these like hostile audiences. I'm guessing hostile. I don't know. Oh, at least it's not super friendly. It's not like if you had to write down like here's where you want to be is like going up in front of Tool trying to tell jokes. God, I think about that now because there's so many comics who've opened for bands. I don't get... That sounds so scary to me. I think I would be so scared the first probably first five shows. I guess it's... You know, that's... I think that's one of the crazy things about comedy is like, you know, all... If you can survive opening up for Tool mentally and physically, then after that you're going to be... Look at Neil Hamburger. He's a... That is a bulletproof comedian. Yeah. He's a comedian who is like, I can't imagine anything like knocking him off course or any... Well, we are talking about Neil Hamburger, who is not an actual person. You know what I mean? Right. Like, I think that's a big part of it is because you have a character. Character is different than a person. But also, I mean, sometimes you think about like Larry the Cable Guy, right? That's a character. It's not a person. But that's... The character is why he's so successful is because you have this character you do and it's just... People know it's a character, but they don't care. They don't care. Yeah. That's one of the interesting branches on the comedy tree where people take on a persona. Andy... I guess Andy Kaufman, you could say, did that. Yeah. Well, because Tony Clifton's a persona. Tony Clifton. Yeah. Yeah. I love that. That's really cool, man. I mean, it's like very liberating, right? Like the moment you decide to come out as somebody else, you're sort of unburdened of the need to reflect your ego. Protect your ego. Right. Yeah. Is that why... Is that something you like about acting? Is that why you like acting? It kidding me a hundred percent because it's that thing where you don't have to protect anything. You're just... You get to be someone else and so you don't have to worry about anything that is said. It's said in the context of that because you're not protecting your ego. This is why I'm so excited about the fucking metaverse. Everyone makes fun of it. People roll their eyes at it, but my God, it's going to be one of the most liberating things when it perfects itself, when it gets indistinguishable from reality. To be able to go into a simulator as a completely different person, an anonymous person, change your voice, change your gender, whatever you fucking want and just exist as a completely different thing, fully unburdened by your identity, that's going to be really... That's going to be very therapeutic for a lot of people. Super therapeutic. I mean, it already is happening. People use it all the time for that. I think that's probably why you see all those people who are really into those communities and stuff. A lot of those people have been victims of all different types of psychological abuse and that's what they find. You can say the whole gaming community to some extent, the classical... Not like now, so much has changed so much because so many people are gaming, but a couple years ago and before that, everyone who was really into games was for the most part kind of an outcast or a nerd or someone who did not really fit in well, but they found this community online through the games where people... You weren't judged on the same characteristics as you would be in real life and so that's why there's people who are so dedicated to it that they just love it so much. Yeah, right. Because it's just a relief. It's like being a human is so weirdly claustrophobic in the sense that you don't get to pick your avatar. You know what I mean? You could style yourself, you could grow a beard, wear whatever fucking clothes you want, get tattoos, gain a bunch of weight, but you're still you in the sense that the people around you have expectations for you to stay just the way you are, right? You can't wake up tomorrow as like, I don't know, a bullfighter who always speaks Spanish. You got to stay Pemberton. I got to stay Duncan and that... I don't think people recognize how just burdensome being a human is in that sense, in the sense of like... It's a little burdensome. It's ridiculous because so many people spend so much time and energy trying to alter things about them that are pretty much unchangeable. You think about just skin care alone. Some people have really good skin, some people have really bad skin and the people who have bad skin are always like, God, I wish I could have good skin and you can do all the things you want. You can drink tons of water. Do all the creams and lotions and stuff, but at the end of the day, fucking January Jones is going to be hung over his fucking look a thousand times better than you just because it's just the nature of that person. It's bullshit. It's fucking bullshit. It is. It's bullshit. It's fucking bullshit. It's ridiculous. And like this, to me, there's so much controversy wrapped up in identity, man. It's like, you get plastic surgery. People are like, fuck you. People will just be like, fuck you plastic surgery. Look what you did to your fucking face. You're not allowed to do it, man. You're like, you know, there's a huge social stigma against women using Botox. It's stigmatized, dude. It's ridiculous. It's ridiculous because any other, like in video games changing your avatar, no one in the game is like, would you fucking change your character's face? No one fucking cares. But in real life, one of the unspoken rules of being human, you just got to stay in the body you're in the way it is. Yeah. And that's just the way it fucking is. It just upsets the shit out of dumb people. No offense. There's a lot of pride associated with, oh, I haven't done anything. I'm all natural, especially obviously, I mean, women especially have that that's like a big thing where like, oh, well, I mean, I haven't I'm natural. I haven't done anything. Yeah, yeah. So what? OK, you can do whatever you want to do. So you did do something. You're fucking DNA spun out your flesh in a way that makes you look like you. So you did do something, but you didn't really. Just whatever the tiny little nano bots that assemble you in every moment are particularly talented. You had fucking nothing to do with it. Like, why would you fucking drink enough water? Shut up. You're symmetrical. See, this is the thing. This is what they're if it's like if suddenly somebody figured out a way to make infinite energy, you know, in a in a in a in a low cost way, the conspiracy theorists are like, yeah, they take them out right away. There's people who figure out how to do that. But the oil industry, they know that it's possible in any time it starts popping up, they kill the person or the person vanishes or whatever. But similarly, if some method of altering appearance, emerged where all of us could just change into anything that we wanted instantaneously, whoever was coming up with that would be killed by beautiful people. They'd be like, take him fucking out because all he got is that I'm beautiful. If everyone's beautiful, then it's just my personality. Oh, God forbid you have to just have that. Yeah, that's scary, then, because then you have to actually have have something to say or at least be be friendly or God forbid be polite. Yeah, yeah, we're talking about a fucking economy. It's there's an economy out there, man. There's an economy supplying fucking demand. There's fewer beautiful people than there are like normal people and abnormal people. That's it's it's it's rare. Otherwise, no one would give a fucking shit about it. And like, you know, you're lucky you get born into that kind of body. You're you're like it's I don't even know what that life must be like. But holy fucking shit, man, if we could all instantaneously just shift, think of what would happen to society society would collapse. Honestly, I think like if that was possible, people like Putin, they would not do war anymore. You know what I mean? If Putin could suddenly just transform into a beautiful, symmetrical human. Would he still want to be like the leader of Russia? Probably not. Yeah. Microdosing one day, we're going to call it normal dosing. Like when you have a cup of coffee, you don't say I'm micro dosing caffeine. You say I'm having a cup of coffee because coffee has been legal. And we've been able to use that incredible stimulant for thousands of years. And it's part of our society, whereas the marvelous substance THC has been in the shadows. And so lots of people don't know the correct dosage and are overdosing themselves when they eat it. This is why I'm so excited about today's sponsor, Loomie Labs, the creators of micro dose gummies. Holy shit, friends, they did it. I don't know how they did it, but they did it. They created a THC gummy that for me is the perfect dose. I just want to relax.

If Putin could suddenly just transform into a beautiful, symmetrical human, would he still want to be like the leader of Russia? Probably not. Well, it's kind of like the time machine, right? It's a little bit, that story is similar because you have the two divisions of people and the one people are the people who know everything, but they live in the caves and their people remember that scene? And like, I think it's the one, the early versions of it where they touched the the guy, the time traveler asks about books and she's like, oh, yeah, we have books. And she shows them and he goes to touch one and they just disintegrate because they haven't been touched in eons because they don't read books because they have everything taken care of for them. And they they just, you know, fucking the sun. Fucking the sun. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean, that is the I think that's the one of the very spooky. You know, all the creepy shit they feed us about what to be afraid of. They never mentioned this stuff to really be afraid of. They never mentioned the fact that like kids who are on like Adderall, their scores are better in school. They have a chemical advantage over other kids. They don't mention that shit. And some parents can't afford it for their kids. Or some parents don't want to give it to their kids. They don't mention the fact that like therapies probably already exist for for the super wealthy. Those creams you're talking about. Right. The lotions. You know, like, you know, already. Themself stuff. Themself stuff. Any kind of a genetic treatment. Yeah. And that right now, you know, classism exists as like, you know, distribution of wealth and medical care. But once people start like amplifying their intelligence with super expensive gene therapies, now we are talking about a weird new race appearing. That what did Nietzsche call it, the Ubermensch? Oh, really? OK. What is that exactly? He has a philosophical idea of it. But it's like, you know, it's it it inspires a lot of fucking sociopaths. You know, a lot of people who are like, I think it's a kind of being that is like managed to sort of rip off the moral handcuffs, the ethical handcuffs, the the the the laws of whatever culture you happen to be born into. Or are they real? Your morality, what is it based on? Like a free agent of sorts. A free agent. Yeah. You can move around wherever they want because they're not bound by like supposing laws of society. It's a way people who want to do shitty things excuse it is some kind of like intellectual act. They're like, I'm an Ubermensch. That's why shoplifting or whatever the fuck. I don't have to follow the rules. I'm probably getting this all wrong, by the way. My apology to my philosophy listeners. But, you know, the point is this is one of the great things we're approaching, man, which is which is a real the species is going to split, man. It's going to fucking split. And it's going to be split between the people who can afford these incredible, like whatever they are, rejuvenation therapies and the people who can't. You're going to have all these beautiful, old, symmetrical people who are geniuses who can play violin, play piano, tap dance, do backflips, fly an airplane. You know what I mean? Just because they have been all around for thousands of years. I mean, vampires. Yes, it's basically just to describe vampires. Vampires, exactly, dude. That's where we're headed of playing in a fucking super wealthy vampires. Yeah, my only hope is that I was just thinking about this yesterday is the idea that I mean, I look at TikTok a lot and I feel like I've learned a significant amount from TikTok. OK, because you learn from from watching. I learned from watching. I think most people do learn from watching stuff. And I realized there's so many things I know how to do now, like as far as like cooking stuff that I've just watched it so many times that I have a memory of I'm going to make this salad today. I've never made it before. But I'm pretty sure I'll make it pretty good the first time because I've watched this video so many times, this guy making this salad. So it's improved your life. Yeah, it's going to improve my life. And maybe maybe that the access to TikTok because it's so much there's so much more information on there and some more people than there is on Instagram and Twitter combined. Like the amount of information is staggering because you give Instagram is like glamour. It's sexy. It's like all these status, right? Yeah, and Twitter is moral indignation. It's it's essays, all that sort of stuff. Like 100 percent of journalists on Twitter, but only five percent of people is that that's Twitter. But you have TikTok and you have all these young people on there and a lot of old people now who are doing it and they're doing it with this way. Well, they're on there just like, I'm just going to do it. I'm going to have fun and do it and they're not not expecting anything. I'm just going to try to do this thing. Yeah. And you have a lot of success. And I feel like that that is democratized information in the sense where maybe it'll supplant this idea of these elite and hyper intelligent vampires, because you have this people have so much access to information. I mean, also I'm talking about my personal algorithm. There's people who see stuff. I get shown stuff sometimes where I'm thinking like this is fucking wrong and weird and like what? Just weird, super dark, doomer shit or like misinformation. Doomer shit. I'm trying some of it's very second to meme fashion. It's hard to even describe because it's it's communicating through memes. It's not it's not like a thing where a guy saying, did you know that Bill Clinton used to have only one leg and he would use it to to be something like that? It's not okay. Not like bullfaced information. It's it's these weird, mimatic things where they're showing a slide of something playing certain types of music. OK, and it's super dark because there's a lot of people, a lot of young people now who are mean, you know, about these do the doomers, right? It's like it's like these people who just are very dead set on the fact that because there's so much income and equality for OK, so that we're really interested in that and they talk about it a lot. Black pill. Yeah, that kind of thing, exactly that kind of thing. Anything where it's just very I mean, we used to call them goths, I think, but they've they've it's changed with the information economy. They're not just into dark music anymore. It's like all this very pessimistic stuff. And they have I suppose they have some reason to believe a lot. That's sure. Well, it's like it's like the like classic goth was a person who was fixated on death and and this fixation like has these roots in Victorian culture. In Victorian culture, it's romantic and they were obsessed with death, too. And they would have like what do they call it? Memento, Maury or whatever they would have like Memento Maury. Bits of hair from dead people and the pictures with the corpse, which, by the way, if you see these old pictures with the corpse, the corpse, you can always tell the corpse, no matter how well that they've done the work, because the corpse is more in focus, because it's not moving. Whereas like they're a little blurry. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Anyway, but so you're saying this is evolved where it's like now instead of kind of romantic celebration fetishization of one's own mortality or the it's it's like the same thing, but for society as a whole. Yeah, there's a little bit of incel stuff mixed in there, too. OK, which I just hate to see. I just hate that shit so much because the whole incel stuff, too. I mean, I had a joke about it. I had kind of abandoned it. I wanted to try to figure out it again. It's just about the idea of if you're an incel, you basically have decided I just don't want to do anything like right. You know, you know, some people get laid who are super symmetrical. But if you're not, it's like, oh, you just have to do stuff. You have to like do anything. Just practice anything. Right. Yeah. Yeah, it's it's a it's a weirdly materialistic philosophy in the sense that it's it's but it's it's also nihilistic. Oh, it's so nihilistic. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But, you know, again, the whole incel thing gets fixed by the metaverse. The whole incel thing gets repaired by it does. Yeah, yeah, by this, by by by in whatever the like, I can kind of see the forms it's going to take, you know, and I get it, man. People go in the fucking metaverse. People go into VR into what's it called VR chat or whatever. And they're like, this is stupid. This is stupid. This is shitty graphics. You look right like this is dumb. It's just a bunch of fucking kids, whatever. It's fucking stupid. But it's like, yeah, you're right. Right now it's blurry graphics. We don't have the processing power to like create like real or so close. And then and then, of course, it's going to be augmented reality. Like you will be able to somehow indicate or have something on you that people around you and augmented reality, if they have this setting, they'll see you as a different thing, as a thing you want to be seen versus how you are. And I think it'll get to the point where it's considered rude to, you know, look at people as they are. Or like, you'll have to ask them, like, do you mind if I look at you without your AR on, you know what I mean, like clothes or something? It's like a form of nudity, except it's your actual body or something like that. And then I think that will probably there will be some intersect with haptic technology so that, you know, when you touch someone's face, you actually feel their AR mask that they're wearing versus their real face. You know, it did somewhere in there. This kind of incredible liberation will happen for so many people encumbered by their physical form. And like it's it's a it's a plague right now. I mean, it's a plague. People are just horrified by their own bodies. I suppose there's also like the there's some sort of like compromise there where maybe when you do the thing that is the when you put on the mask, like the digital mask, maybe that makes you feel better about the reality, your actual self somehow. Yeah, because you learn to accept this. I mean, isn't it about acceptance? If you have to find a way to accept who you are, otherwise, you're just destined to be miserable. Yeah, I mean, absolutely. This is the you know, there's so many different ways to do this. You can listen to Tony Robbins. You can get into Buddhism. You can like all kinds of pathways to all of them are you can get therapy. Yeah, but all of them take time, dedication, money and a lot of energy that a lot of people don't have. But right, just, you know, fill in the blank with whatever the fucking thing is to let a shape shift, polymorph, whatever you want to call it. Just that ability, you know, is going to be so disruptive. You know what I mean? Because there's going to be people, you know, like the fitness gurus out there who are suddenly like, yeah, whatever. I don't know if I'm going to work on my meat body. Why? I'm just going to like display this thing that I want to be. Maybe you want to work on it so you can stay alive longer to enjoy this thing that you're enjoying. But yeah, possibly you might be, you know, you might want to exercise just to feel you didn't, you know what I mean? Feel good to feel good. And you're there's a weird, pure form of athleticism that might emerge versus exercising to like try to fit into some image that you think is going to like make you attractive. But yeah, I just think it's like a right now. The the way the way we think, you know, I remember my grandmother telling me once how they at one point they really didn't have electricity. And I was just like trying to wrap my head around that. Like she got to like be like, fuck, there's electricity. You know, I mean, I knew they had it, but like not like we have it now. I think like, and then we got to experience that with the Internet. A lot of people living today have always lived during the time of the Internet. But the next thing is fucking whatever this thing they're calling the metaverses, which is like, holy fuck, you lived in a time when you were encumbered by form and you drove your own car. Wow, you drove your own fucking car. Wasn't that dangerous? That's yeah. What are great kids are going to be saying? Yeah, fucking people are dying all the time. You'd see them on the side of the road. We are super crazy, dangerous. Are there stuff I think about that I did as a kid? I don't not know how I'm alive. There's like 15 things that I've done thinking back to where if I saw a kid doing that, I would just be like, whoa, whoa, whoa. OK, I don't know where your parents are, but you have to stop doing this. Yeah, you can't do that. Like what blow up? Like you can't make a pipe bomb and put it in a hole in the ground just to blow it up in the woods. Oh my god. You can't like, God, you can't climb that 90 foot fir tree with just climbing it. You can't build this like bike jump in the middle of the street. And like, oh, God, it's just crazy shit. Like so much super dangerous shit that somehow I just didn't didn't get killed or hurt. That shit gets left out, doesn't it? Like it's so easy to forget the peril we put ourselves in as kids. We you you forget like you look you watch, you know, TV with teenagers and stuff or kids and it really doesn't like we really, really were always on the brink of killing ourselves or being murdered. Like, you know, like when a bully was like, I'll kill you when you were a kid. They kind of meant it. You know what I mean? It's not like they were like just trying to scare you. There were lunatics back then. Remember, did you have a bully? I had one guy, one guy was really little. Remember, he did that class thing. He picked me up on my my shirt and threw me against a locker. And I was just like, this is real. What? Yeah. I must be like in second grade. Yeah. So could barely remember it. Yeah, it's not like sociopaths turn into sociopaths when they hit puberty. It's like a lot of them. They just they're all the way through, man. And like warmed up. Dude, I had those fucking water wings, which, by the way, you should not do that to your kid. Like they're bad water wings. Water wings are very dangerous. Yeah. See, this is the kind of thing where I mean, we had a pool when I was growing up and we had the water wings, a constant water wings. You didn't even get in question. You just throw the fucking water wings on the kid in the pool. Then have your drinks. The kids over there like a rap. No, just the kid doesn't understand that the water wings are what is keeping them afloat. Oh, so they just jump in. They will jump in the pool and just sink to the bottom. Yeah. But I can remember this is one of my earliest memories floating on St. Simon's Island, Georgia, in a swimming pool floating in my fucking water wings. And this kid just comes up and pulls the fucking tab on the. Just like to sink me, just to sink me. And like and he's watching, you know, like some fucking satanic experiment. You know, one of the things they say is drowning is a silent death. Like by the time a kid starts drowning, you don't hear it. They just go under like no one's paying attention. But I just think this gets left out in this in like your childhood, like how dangerous a thing it was. It probably still is. But back then and it's really fucking dangerous. But what do you think about that? Because you have kids, do you feel like you have to let them do things that are dangerous because it's how you develop? I think you have to be able to distinguish between like that and neglect. And I think a lot of people maybe excuse just basic neglect for some kind of like, you know, I'm just letting them learn. Yeah. You know what I mean? It's like, you know, I like, yes, you you can't be allowed. You have to let the kid like no one's learning to walk without falling down. How about a potato gun? Would you help your kid build a potato gun? What's a potato gun? I don't remember how it fucking works. It's a big PVC pipe that has a two chambers. There's a barrel and there's a there's a chamber. And inside the chamber, you have a grill igniter, you know, the little red button used to ignite your gas grill. Yeah. You have the wires that go in there to make a spark. And what you do is you already know, it's already a no. Oh, this is a this is a Minnesota thing, probably. What's everywhere? It's a redneck shit. But you you build this thing, you're the hardware store, and you build it with like, you know, twenty five, thirty bucks with the material and you spray hairspray in there and you close the cap. And then you you push the grill downer button and you have a potato. It's been lodged down in the barrel with a broom pole and you fire that you ignite the air air solids inside the chamber and it shoots a fucking Idaho russet out. That's cool. And it fucking it makes a very loud sound. That's cool. And the potato turns to dust against a tree. Cool as fuck. It's and we would put like roofing nails in them and shoot out street lights and stuff. Just like your parents weren't the ones showing you how to do that. That was your friends. My my dad took me to the hardware store. What? I begged him. I was like, can we make the potato gun? I made my mom took me by my mom because she's the redneck. And we went to the hardware store and the guys like, you know, I'm picking out the equipment and he goes, oh, you guys are building the spud gun. OK, you don't want to get this this producer flange. When we built the thing, I one time shot it off. I was looking like, why isn't it sparking? And I looked down the barrel and I want to watch the spark and a big flame shoots right in my face and almost burns my eyebrows off. Was your dad there? No, he was asleep. See, I think like that it's a very it's look. It's a cool thing your dad did. And it's a roll of the dice. And you are making these calculations with your kids. And sometimes you do need to like let them run amok. Like you have to let them run amok. You have to. But you have to know it's just, man, like. Our youngest one. I found this like spot on his stomach that I tickle and he laughs. And it's the greatest thing to hear a baby laugh. So I'll take a lemon. It's the best. So I've been doing that on the couch, just not even thinking about it. And then he's like crawling on the floor. I'd come home. I I start tickling him. He rolls over. He's laughing. And then he just slams his fucking head into the wood floor. Is like just a slap back because that's what that's what babies do. I forgot it's the hard the sound of your infant's head smacking into the hardwood floor in front of your wife. You know what I mean? Because that's going to activate like the collie inside of a mother. You know what I mean? They're like, fuck you. What the fuck? It doesn't matter. And I'm like, I was tickling him. I didn't know that it's nothing will extinguish the rage. You know, and then also you have to like make sure. Did what if what if you got a concussion sounded like a hard hit? I know kids have. So then you have to like do the sad study of them where you're like looking at their eyes, making sure they're not wobbly when they walk because that shit happens. Happens to friend Aaron's friend. Sometimes their kid just falls, smacks the head, concussion. One won't start, won't stop crying. Got to go to the fucking hospital. I mean, this is like the reality because they don't they don't know what they're doing and neither do we. So it's like finding a happy medium in there. And what they are built so damn tough, those toddlers are like. You ever heard stories about a Buster Keaton when he was a kid? No, they used to call him a sack of flour because he was parents had a stage act and he was he was doing stuff since he was like a baby. They would fucking throw this kid around like he was a little little sack of flour. Wow. Just tossing him around like a little fucking like just a book bag full of beanie babies or something. They love it. Yeah. But you can't bust them. Those sometimes those I wish I could bust them. You can. But go to the go to the cover. Go to the fucking the pediatric ER. You can bust them. They're in there. They're busted. But they recover fast. They fucking recover. But you don't want to go to the pediatric ER and fucking sucks. What are you going to tell the doctor? Oh, you ever heard of Buster Keaton when you were a kid? They call him a sack of flour. That's why it's the fucking kid in the wall. You know, but but it is. I'm also like, man, we want like I went sledding with Forest and like so brave, like we built this ramp, fucking launching so high in the air, rolling through through the snow into the brush and like just up and running back to the top of the dude again. So I think you just have to let them do that within reason. That's all basically you have to think to yourself when I'm talking to the doctor at the ER, are they going to call Child Protective Services when I'm like, well, you see, I wanted him to jump over thorns. He thought it would be cool. And so he landed in thorns. You know, you have to be just that's all you just have to think in that way. Things are different now, man. They don't fuck around at the hospital. Like they don't fuck around. They like so many shitty parents are out there that when you come in with your kid, they're like listening to what you're saying, but they're looking at the kid just to make sure it's their job to make sure the kids know they must have like a second, a sixth sense about it. They can kind of smell like, you know, smell when someone's covering like, oh, wait, we just he just he just picked up the kerosene. And we, you know, we didn't know, you know what I mean? They probably have like a they can kind of smell when someone is covering for abuse and when someone is being accidental and when someone's being like truly neglectful. Dude, it's a nightmare. There's a whole podcast series about this. Like I don't know. The emergency rooms and stuff. A kid fell out of a chair, cracked his skull. They go into the emergency room and like somehow child protective services gets involved, takes the kid. Probably don't listen to this. That's not that sounds like a nightmare to listen to. If I was a parent. Dude, that's what we do as parents. You fucking we actually did you're right. It has altered my scared. Then you'd be scared of something you probably shouldn't be scared of because that's not going to happen to you. It fucks forensic files up, man. Anytime there's anything with a kid. Oh, I can't even watch this episode. I can't even watch it hardly anymore. I really can't. You can't. I have trouble. I mean, not the same as you probably, but I know some of the people with kids. I know their kids to where it just it feels like it's too. It's too sad. It's just too like. Abject, it's abjectly. Just, you know, it's one of those things where, yeah, it's it's there's no. There's it's like so pitiful that it's there's a reason that I can a movie, I think, where they if they want you to let a main character just run ramshot like John Wick, they kill the dog. Yeah, if you kill a kid, that's just so sad. You can't get over the sadness. But the dog is obviously it shows the cruelty of these people he's killing. But it's not this thing where it's not this deep abject like soul wrenching sadness. It's a different kind of thing. Yep. I do. I I totally get it, man. Like, yeah, the but I hate that shit in the beginning of the movie and they kill the fucking dog. You're just like, fuck you. But you know what? If it's what it takes to let John Wick do John Wick, fine. But you could have come up with another way. But I get it, man. Have you read nothing works? Have you read The Painted Bird by Yerzy Kaczynski? No. OK. That's that's a mind fuck you. Is this a novel? What is it? Yeah, it's a novel about this kid. I think it's during World War Two, just gets disconnected from his parents and has to wander through the Eastern European countryside. And it just like is encountering horror after horror after horror until finally whatever made that kid a kid was just gone. And it was now a basically as an adult. And it's an old man. I don't want to ruin it, but it's OK. I'll read it. You know, it just it just like. But it's it's it's one of the most brutal explorations of that thing you're talking about. Just the the the the reality of what the world does to some kids, like and how just abjectly and completely perfectly unfair that is. Yeah, what are we talking about? I think we're talking about something a few weeks ago. I know something about people were talking about like, oh, this I never had a childhood because and someone was saying how, well, a lot of people never had a childhood. It's almost like the thing where having being able to have a childhood is an absolute luxury. Right. It's like such a luxury to be able to be at any moment in time where you're just carefree, you know, you can do whatever you want. You can be being fed, you being cared for. That time period is such an incredible luxury because so many people throughout history. It's like, well, mom and dad died. I'm I'm 14, I guess I'm that's it. It's over now. Now it's now I have to do everything. Dude, there's an animation on YouTube about young chimney sweeps. Oh, God. And you know, again, like I don't know how he veered off here, but like I think it's cool to watch these things because I do think humanity as a whole has evolved. Like we've become a more compassionate species mostly. We're still fucked up. We're still brutal. You can see that in the news now. But compared to then, which in those days, if your parents died, one option was you become a chimney sweep. And the reason you become a chimney sweep is because your little body could fit up the fucking chimney. And, you know, it's it's basically the animation is just it's an account of one of these of an adult who used to be one of these chimney sweep kids and then became whatever, a keeper of chimney sweep kids. And like, yeah, basically like he just talking about how like you would have to force them with fire up the fucking chimney. Their legs would get all fucking cut up. And like the more they did, it would eventually callus over. But you'd have to force them to cut their legs over and over again until they got fucking. And a lot of the times they just get stuck up there and they just die of fright. You know, and like that. Imagine that. Imagine that you fucking hire somebody to clean your chimney. You end up with a fucking Victorian five year old stuck in your. Mad at them. Well, you're doing up there. Get them out of there. How dare you die in the chimney? How dare you death in our chimney where you have to move now for a fortnight to go someplace else. So as you clean the bones out to burn little boy out of here. Yeah, bloody little boy, the chimney. This is a bastard. Think about that. That was what that was what people were like, man. Like we've we've gone through so many vicious phases. It's so crazy to think of that. And just the scary thing is to think like, God, damn it. How close are we to returning to that? Like how far away are we from like going back to that level of brutality? Hopefully we get to see it. That's all I care about. Jesus Christ, I just want to see it. You know, I mean, I want to be you want to see the brutality. I want to be able to see the full arc, you know, coming from rotary phone, coming from all that stuff, seeing, you know, see, remember when my dad got a he got a beeper and then he got a cell phone. Yeah, all these things that change. And then obviously we're where we are now and just be able to live maybe through like a cataclysm. And then see some sort of it would be if it's going to happen, I would love to be able to see it just to see like witness the. Just witness the the sheer like the thing like the I try. I was hiking one time. I was obviously super, super high off adrenaline. It was one of the first times I did like a big hike and I get to the top there. I'm listening to Philip Glass on a speaker. So it's like just super cinematic. Yeah, with a couple other people get to the top and you look out on this valley. Like we're we're now off the trail. We're in the middle of fucking nowhere and you look out and you see just this huge expanse of trees and valley and stuff. And what I could think was like was just so much information, so much pure neutrality, like the sheer amount of uncaring neutrality that's out there. This is all this space and things that doesn't give a fuck about if I live or die. Not even like the tiniest bit about me and looking at it. It's like looking into like an abyss or something. And it felt so like, whoa, shit, so scary. And I kind of feel like it would be interesting to, you know, when you see the thing when you're in the thing that's terrible, you stop for a second and be like, oh, my God, this is. This is like if you were in World War One, you looked out over no man's land for a second, you might get a little high because you're just you're in the sheer terror of existence. Yeah, there's like that. There's like that moment where it's very, very pure, pure terror. It's almost like you're crossing over into like a God state of some sort. Whoa, right. Yeah, I like that. I mean, you know what, though, if I don't think it is ambivalent, I think actually there's some deep subconscious longing that the forest has for you to die so it can eat you. There you go. So it's not even ambivalent. It's not neutral. It's like, oh, there's some fucking carbon. You die, die, but come me, but come me, you know, and join us, join us. It's like Evil Dead, too. You know what I mean, the way that like, which was, I think if I had to guess, he was trying to portray what you're talking about, which is what they call Eldritch, Eldritch horror. He's trying to portray this like the one of the ways of looking at the world, which is this thing is way older than you. Oh, God. And you're barely here and you're mostly just food for it. I mean, you are just food. And also you deserve to be eaten because you've been eating. So like you've been eating it. It's going to eat you. It gets the last laugh. And so like the way Lovecraft the various like embodies that embodies that thing you're talking the primordial, non-caring, ambivalent, yet consuming face of nature just wants to eat. Give me your atoms. I want to fucking suck your atoms. So cool. It's like a centrifuge. You know, it wants to spin you into it. And then and then like, and once you've spun into it enough, you're completely forgotten. Like no one even remembers you once you've been spun deep enough into the planet. Good night, everyone. Yeah, it's a children's book I'm working on. It's called Good Night, Everyone. It's called Good Night, Everyone. And it's about how the forest wants to eat you. I would like to be eaten by a tree, I think. Absolutely. I mean, this is I think this is the other thing. Like really, the horror comes from more of like a delusion regarding your that you're different from that, you know, like you look at it the thing and you're like, this thing is not me. I'm this other thing that has motivation and feeling and stuff. There's something to me more than this stuff. I'm special. I'm special. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But isn't that what the horror comes from is is really it's more that it's like you're really you're no more special than the rest of it. Yeah, I think for I think when I say horror, I kind of mean like it's delicious. It's like this delicious horror where you feel for a second, you feel like you aren't you aren't yourself and that feels it feels good. I tell you about that. I told you about that thing where I when I died doing breath work. Yeah, tell me again that when you were doing the holotropic breath work thing. Yeah, I did this breath work class and I never I didn't breath work thing once before like two years ago. And so I was like, I think I kind of understand this. And the woman doing the class, she was like, you know, you're going to feel your hands are pregnant, tangle a bit. And that's normal. So I was recognized that I was laying on my back, like they say, had headphones on and it was how blank on my legs. It was the only person at home. So I knew I wasn't going to get disturbed or anything. And it was pretty dark in the room and did the whole breath work thing. It's like she leads it through all the breath work and you keep reading deeper and deeper and deeper. And towards the end, as it's as relieving, I struck my hands really feel like fully numb, I can't feel them. And at some point, I basically like I felt like I was passing out. Like when I when I get my blood drawn a lot of times, I will pass out afterwards. Not during, but afterwards, like, like, like maybe five seconds out after they've taken the needle out, I will black out. OK. And I go to like a hell realm. It's not like it's sort of like a night. I go to a nightmare for yeah, maybe 15 seconds at the most. And I wake back up and they're like, are you OK? I'm like, oh, I'm always like so grateful to be alive in that moment. Like, oh, thank fucking God, because I was just I was just felt like I was dying. Yeah. And so in this breath work class, at the end of it, I am it's getting very psychedelic, right? Very psychedelic, very emotional. And at some point, I feel myself going to that same place that I have been before when I've passed out. And it was like a nightmare realm. So this time I went there and I felt like I looked at it and I was like, oh, I'm I'm dying right now. I'm I'm dead. I have just died. And it was funny to me. It was like this thing where I was laughing at it because I wasn't scared at all. Because in those times when I passed out and gone to the nightmare area, I was terrified, absolutely terrified. But in this case, I felt like super cogent and very like, oh, this is this is nothing. This is doesn't matter. What do you mean? What are you seeing like demons? Like, what do you mean? How around? Like, it was just like it felt it wasn't so much visual as a feeling. Like, I felt like, oh, I am I have died now, but it's OK that I have died. It's not a terror. It's not like a thing where I should be terribly scared of death. It felt like a thing where when you die, it's just it's OK. And it's totally fine. It's just where you're going to if you're going to go there, you're going to go there and you can't stop it. And so there's no reason to be afraid of it. Right. I don't know. It was the strangest thing I've ever had happen as far as like one of the most psychedelic, I mean, beyond psychedelic, it felt just incredibly. I mean, it's almost impossible to describe. I mean, it is impossible to describe. Yeah. But the best way I can describe it is I. Peace. I peace. I I died and it was I was laughing at the idea of dying. To me, the idea of dying was absurd. It made me feel incredibly powerful. The idea where death is not something to be feared. And that's the first thing I've ever felt that. And I didn't I didn't just I felt that I could feel it. Yeah, the death fear thing, man. It's such a fucking bummer. It's such a burden. It weighs so many people down. They've got they don't want to talk about it even or think about it. And in the reports from near death experience is what you're talking about. Everyone is just universally it's like the best thing that happened to you. Like death is like the best. You don't want to go back. You're like, fuck that place. It's you know, it's weirdly like you like. It reminds me like the indie stuff. It's like when your dog gets out of the yard, like, you know, these people die and for a second they get out of whatever the fuck this is, which appears to be some kind of yard for sentient beings. And then these beings like, yeah, you got you're not done. You got to go back. They're sweet. They're loving. But they they send you they send you back into your incarnation. And many people go dragging their fucking feet. They don't want to go back. Yeah, because it's like it makes sense why you wouldn't want to go back. Or if you do go back, it's a thing where you have a different outlook. I don't I wish I did. I don't think it's changed. I got to remind myself more of the experience, I think it's something or also just do it again. Man, I mean, you're reminding me of the scary idea I add, which was that. Because that, like, if you wanted to really understand. Like if you OK, if you were an alien and you were about to colonize a planet that was already like already had living beings on it, which maybe aliens. This is one of the problems is like by the time you find an inhabitable planet, probably some kind of sentient life has evolved onto the planet. And meaning that unless you want to be like brutalist, brutal and just wipe them out, if there's any kind of universal compassion or ethical anything. Anyway, if you wanted to study a species on another planet, the best way to study them would be to become one of them, right? To like put yourself in there, become one of them. But also not know that you're a probe, like not know not you need to go in fully human so that you're like in there and fully get the experience of being a human. And then when you die, the reason you feel so relieved is because you're like, oh, fuck, right. Oh, yeah, right. I was studying that planet with a with a bipedal wingless hominids that we were thinking about colonizing. Yeah, they're assholes. They're fucking horrible. Yeah, I just wipe them out. You know what? If you ever think about that, like maybe you're the probe. Hmm, I have not thought about that. No, I haven't thought on the probe. I a lot of times have thought that certain people are maybe alien intelligence. Like it seems to me pretty obviously that Mark Twain is probably was probably like a piece of alien intelligence that was sent to do to make changes. Maybe like David Bowie or anyone like that, anyone who's caused a huge shift in consciousness is maybe a like a person who it's like a a form of an of skin of biological intelligence that's been sent. Or you could also say the opposite, which is super scary to think that someone terrible who's wreaked havoc on the planet is maybe the opposite. It's like different beings who are trying to destroy the Earth by creating some sort of a monster to to kill people and plant all kinds of bad deleterious ideas. Yeah, the the one they called it the I think Crowley talked about this. He called it the Black Lodge. That there is. Yeah, that there's a there's like a I'm sorry for my thalamites out there. I fuck everything up that I talk about. But basically, the idea is like at the edge of the abyss, there is a lodge like a a temple where these like exactly the people you're talking about, these sorcerers who are like truly just intent on causing chaos and destruction and and and pain and like anti life stuff hang out and like plan their next shit disturbing mission or whatever. So seeds. So seeds. Yeah, so seeds. I mean, but even then, you know, that seems like a game kind of. You know, there's a kind of playfulness, even in that horrible and then being like that. Because again, it's like how do like if suddenly everyone on planet Earth. Remember, oh, right. We're not even here. This isn't real. There's no such thing as death. We're maybe in, I don't know, on a spaceship going a very, very long distance and as part of the, you know, keeping. Hive sleep. You have to have a simulation to keep the body from just being destroyed. Or we and we all remember that simultaneously. We can just there's a way to just blink out. It doesn't even mean you die. You just sort of blink out. You just go back on the ship. Right. How many people would stay here? Like in the people who stayed here, would they be just would they be looked at as like childish or something? Like, you know what I mean? Like, ah, you guys keep playing mate, believe on the fake fucking planet. We were actually like, we have to get back to work. You know, like how many people would stay on the planet as themselves. If they knew there was no such thing as death as we understand it. We're infinite beings, non encumbered by the physical body, capable of transforming ourselves in anything we want at any moment. Just temporarily engaged in some exploration of mortality. How many people would keep doing the human thing? I think I would do it for a while if I knew that because I'd have a lot of fun. Yeah, but think of the kind of funny. What kind of fun would you fucking have? That's the scary thing. The type of fun people would start having would be really interesting. Maybe maybe it wouldn't be that great. Actually, it just also depends on the spaceship. Like what's the conditions on the spaceship? What kind of work are we doing on the spaceship? Are you just going from one situation to another? You're a fucking minor. It's like, well, so it's not even out of the fire and not even out of the front end of the fire. It's out of the the swimming pool into the fucking pit of stakes. You got to get back to work. You got to get back to work. I'm not going back to work. I'm going to stay here and I'm going to play every instrument. Wake up, Pemberton. Pemberton, get the get that shit off your fucking head, man. We're finally at the asteroid. We got to get you on that fucking thing. You got to start drilling. Xymenite. You're a Xymenite minor. I would sell out everybody I could to stay like Joe Pinley on on the matrix. Yeah, yeah, you would you would be that guy. No, they just Judas. I'd be Judas. The captain of the ship just wrenches your fucking goggles off and is like, fuck, you know, that's like every incarnation. It's just the ends with like you think you're dying. And it's just this fucking wrinkly, mean space captain ripping your fucking thing. I mean, like, get out of the bag, get out your car, Pemberton. You got a few using your goggles too much. You got goggled arrangement. You know, you're like, no, I swear. I mean, you and I have a life. I was a comedian on the fucking planet. What are you talking about? You always do this, smacks you. You start remembering off, fuck, I'm a space minor. I'm not a comedian. I have fucking what happens in the space minor world. What happens if you die in the space minor world? Is it just nothing when you die in the space minor world? That's what see when you put your VR goggles back on. The first thing it does is inject a memory of you like dying in the space minor world. Then you wake up as a human and you're like, oh, I had that dream again where I was a fucking space minor, you know what I mean? And then you go back to your life and forget that you live your whole life again. Jesus Christ. In between every human incarnation, you do like eight hours of work on a shitty asteroid. Well, oh, my God, that's hell, then. That's what hell is, right? I don't know. I mean, I don't know. Is it hell? I don't know. I mean, it's something. It's something that's not heaven. It's definitely not heaven. There he goes again, talking about hell. Shut the fuck up and take your space pick, Pemberton. We're sick of you talking about this being heaven or hell. Get to work. So what happens if I take this laser pick and I cut my legs off? God damn it. Trank him. He's got space delirium. Yeah, it's like, I don't know, but I'm but again, like to me, what's like really hilarious about this line of thinking is this is where we're headed as a species. That's what the fucking Zuckerberg metaverse is. We are about to get to a point where we can mostly abandon life as we know it, you know, and it's just going to get better and better and better. And the reason that this we're getting to that point is not because where we're at is paradise. You know what I mean? Like it's not because people are content. We're so miserable, we have to burrow into the digital realm and replicate ourselves in some alternate form so we can experience things that we don't have the resources to experience in our current lives. It's going to be so much. It's one of those things that just the idea of it, you can think about a significant amount of resistance. The kind of thing where it is like two camps of two camps. It's going to be a lot of. There's so much resistance. There already is. There is. There are a lot of you. You're born a dude. There already is, man. Like the very beginning of it started started. And the resistance is so extreme, so fucking extreme to know you're going to stay the way you were born. You're not changing your fucking. So you're the way you are the way you fucking are the way you were genetically predestined to be these genetic fucking predestination fucking fascists, man. And like if it just wait, just wait, they will try to make laws. They will try to make it illegal. They already have started made a bunch of laws. I think it's just going to be generational, though, because that stuff takes so much time, you have to wait for those people to die off before you can have a real change, because it's just some people will never. It just doesn't make sense to them. And it's not their fault. It's just never going to make sense, because it's they can't feel it. It doesn't make sense to them. It feels weird in their body. It just can't comprehend the idea of something being significantly different or things being things changing so fundamentally. Yeah. It's it's too it's too much. And it makes sense why it is. I don't I think that makes sense. It just takes so much time to transition. The moment the technology is there, the moment there is just like, you know, theoretically, you read like Kurzweil talking about self-assembling nanobot technology, which is essentially what a human being is, is self-assembling nanoswarms of self-assembling nanobots. The the the the moment that we can get into those nanobots and program them is they, you know, I don't know the I'm not a clearly not a biologist, clearly not. But something like our DNA is like a printer, right? Isn't that kind of how it works? And it's one of the comes we can manipulate the printer. Right. Then we can tell it the next iteration of me. I want it to be this 30 years old. I want you to print this out. You might have to like take certain shits. The printer has new ink or whatever, but like you you. So the moment it becomes like that, where it's like you mold essentially, I guess you would mold, I don't know what it would look like. But in like two months or three months, what are they? How how how many how much time is it between when you regenerate a new body? I don't know. I thought six years between full cellular regeneration. OK, so you you you you you're going to stay how you are. And then if you want to change, there's going to be six years of transformation. Now, if we could accelerate that so that it's a month. How many of these old fascist fucks are going to say no, no, no, they're going to change. That's where the hypocrisy will become so clear, which is like all these people who are like digging their heels in regarding human's autonomy over their physical form, their body, their identity, whatever the fuck they want to be. These are going to be the very same people who cut in line to get the therapy because they want to be younger, older, smarter, different eye color, whatever the fuck it is. And then, you know, and that they'll just be a stampede towards self transformation. Sure, maybe there'll be a couple of like weird old fucks who are like trying to stop it. But not not many. You won't be able to serve like you literally be like, all right, stay old and stay old and fucking like repressive. We don't that's going to be a that's going to be temporary because they'll that'll be a certain period of time. Because then the whole idea of having a body is going to be ludicrous. Exactly. Yeah. When that happens, then you get in the whole thing. What is the nature of a soul? That's when that shit happens. Yeah, that's the argument where we just can't have. No one can win it or even have it because you can't talk about it until we don't even know what we're arguing about yet because there's not it's not even there. We don't have the we don't even know what it is. Yeah, to argue for or against. Right. Yeah, we're not quite there yet. But that's going to be scary as hell. It's it is, you know, it is. I think it is going to be but the lead up to it is also going to be so scary that by the time we get to it, I think there'll be a certain like it really meant to me like the the some of the great problems we're going to run into are all wrapped up in decoding the way human memory works. Oh, my God. Yeah. For you know, so much of a person's identity is their memory. If we can implant memories into a person, then, you know, now we can like change a person's past. If you change a person's past, you can alter the way they're going to be in the future. So like once we get into memory, implantation and or memory extraction. Oh, God, it's going to cut all these fucking problems. Everyone's like fucking freaking out over gas, which I get. Which I get. But man, it's a funny turn. Just wait. Gas prices. Well, like what like, you know, I think and this is probably idiotic, but I do think you can predict makes predictions based on what people want. And and like from that, you can in these days, you can almost assemble a timeline based on when people will get that thing that they want. And, you know, right now in Ukraine, the what they keep saying, like, well, if he uses chemical weapons, biological weapons, why, why use chemical weapons? Why use biological weapons? Because it doesn't destroy the infrastructure. You use chemical weapons, biological weapons. You get to keep all the toys. You know what I mean? And you just the job just becomes body disposal. It's so brutal and fucked up. The problem with a nuclear bomb is it radiates the land for a very long time. Yeah. And the radioactive clouds are going to just blow back to Russia anyway. So it's like it's like attacking yourself. If you use a nice chemical weapon, nice, get some fucking smallpox in there. Get out, get your soldiers out and just burn the whole fucking population out. It's horrible. But this is why they keep saying you might do this because he gets to keep the stuff and they want the stuff. So but that's so it's such a brutal thing, right? It's brutal. The next iteration of fucking nuclear weapons is going to be some kind of memory implantation bomb. Drop a like a wave or something, a we're and then suddenly everyone just remembers their Russian. You know what I mean? Everyone's like, oh, I'm right. This Christ. Oh, I'm Chinese. Oh, the planet is Chinese. Like, oh, it's not even like it's like everyone just like, oh, my God, what the fuck are we thinking with this American thing? We're Chinese. Like we're all part of we're all part of whatever the fucking thing is. Yeah, something like that will come in a virus or some psychotropic fucking virus that just like replaces your your identity with another identity. That's that's sounds like some William Gibson shit right there. Like, you know, the author William Gibson. Yeah, that's just so spooky. That could happen. I've always think that as much as that's of as possible, I think there's a reason we haven't had any more nuclear bombs since the first two because there's like the human genome just doesn't want it won't let it happen. Yeah. And well, thank God. I mean, we're so like, you're what are you going to do? Nuke your fucking yacht, your condos. We're going to nuke your fucking like billion dollar secret mansions owned by your like private trust that you have. What are you not going to blow that shit up? You want to keep that you want to keep it, but what you would be awesome. What would be awesome would be to reprogram instead of invade. That would be fucking awesome. And to do it in a way that like just makes the place you're invading like like fawning, you know, there's an accident instead of making everyone think they're Russian and they're fawning for the leader. They become jazz musicians. It's like, oh, shit. What have we done? The country's obsessed with jazz now. No, no, no, no, like no one fucking understands what happened. Biden comes out. He's got a saxophone. He's just fucking jazz 100 percent jazz playing jazz. Like Putin's like, oh, my God, what the fuck? We got to fix this. Nobody goes to work. All people do is just jazz. They do jazz until they die, just skeletons, just playing drums and bass and saxophone, just jazz to 100 percent jazz. And you're like the one person who it didn't work on. Oh, God. That would be hell. You're like what? You wake up, you wake up because you're fucking neighbors playing like Bay like base, you're like, what the fuck? Shut up. And then when it's coming from all of a sudden, the whole neighborhood is like doing improvisational jazz together. Maybe maybe it's only jazz musicians who are immune to it. So the only people left who are normal or actual jazz musicians. So at first they just think like, wow, man, finally, everyone's getting on this jazz train finally and keep doing it. Like, don't you want to go to sleep sometime? It's like, no, jazz. You're like, just do it there. Like your your friend's got a fucking chopstick in your ear and a mallet. And you're like, do it. Just do it. I don't want to hear anymore. I don't want to hear. No more jazz, jazz planet, jazz. That would be how hilarious, Johnny. Thank you so much for thanks for having me on the show.

Not only that, but you can have access to our weekly meditation group, our Friday Family Gathering, and participate in what is known as the most powerful community to ever exist on planet Earth since the Knights Templar. Today's guest is a really great writer. He's written three books, most recently House Fires, which is fucking great, but being a great author wasn't enough for him. He also happens to be a super famous influencer, but all of that bullshit aside, he's an incredible human being, and I'm excited to introduce you to him. Everybody, welcome to the DTFH, Connor Franta. Welcome to the DTFH. Connor, welcome to the DTFH. It is so great to meet you. Great to meet you too. Man, you are brilliant. Your third book House Fires just came out. It is so fucking good, man. It is so good. Thank you. Why do you get to be in your twenties writing like this? That's so sweet of you. I don't know. I yeah, I would have never foreseen that this is what I would be doing. But I guess that's the beauty of life, isn't it? But we don't know what's coming and we just take it with grace. Yeah, yeah. I think so. I mean, do you think pre-YouTube, pre-Internet, you that probably you just would have been a writer, you know, you it's like the is it the, you know, having these two was like one of them completely new to the entire universe. Whatever the fucking influencer is, you know, this new kind of super celebrity, global celebrity that comes from YouTube. Then it's like somehow like crossing what I would consider to be like pretty like classic, beautiful writing, you know, like timeless writing. Is that what is that why it's so strange? Because you feel like when people are talking to you, you have to like like sort of hope they understand. Look, I don't know what I am. Yeah. First of all, I mean, like when you any being like the grassroots of an influencer and then having to do something in the traditional realms, you do always feel this level of defensiveness of like, no, but I'm different. No, it's good. It's actually good or even like bare bones. I have to explain to people. No, I actually did write my own book. I didn't have someone write it for me and I'm pretending like I wrote it. So there is this level of explanation and defensiveness right off the bat that I wish didn't have to be a part of my storytelling, but it sadly is for most conversations. There's a level of like justifying what I've been working on for three years. I bet I can feel in the book. Honestly, I am a little disappointed to hear it's not a ghost writer because I'm trying to write a book right now and I would be like, let me hire this person. Whoever they are, they're a great fucking writer. Hire me. All right for you. Done. Done. I'm sure you have the time. Um, when you, so when you're, when you were like conceiving house fires, did you know it was like upfront when you were talking about it? Did you know it was going to be a combination of poetry and photographs? Did you, did you know in the beginning this is what it was going to look like or did it evolve into that? So, uh, my second book is very similar in terms of style. It was kind of, you know, like a scrapbook, a collection of this, that and the other, you know, short stories, long form poetry, thoughts, photos, you know, just like a really, it's like an autopsy of my mind put on paper and I personally found that format so freeing because no matter what I wrote, it didn't have to fit within some sort of box of like, this is how you write a book. This is how a book has to be. It has to be this many words. Each chapter has to have this many pages because that's just how we've always done it. So for me, it just was liberating that no matter what I was writing on any given day, it could be part of the book, even if it was just a few sentences. And that just helped me, I guess, continue the creative process to be free with what I was doing. Yeah. It's, yes. It, you know, it, the format, it produces this kind of like wonderful lightness to the whole thing. But some of these essays, wow, heavy, like really deep existential questions. And I love that a lot of those questions don't have answers. You're not trying to solve the problems that you're bringing up in the book. And that adds, that somehow resonates with the form of the book. It's, it's, it's like listening to these like, it's, it's these, it's like listening to like pebbles drop into some like beautiful still well and just ripple out. It's so good. And it sounds, you know, it sounds like you right now are really like wrestling with some tremendously impossible problems that humanity faces. Can you talk, can we talk about those a little bit? It's my favorite thing to talk about. I find that like people are so just like skittish and anxious around talking about death and the meaning of life and what happens before and after. And like all these questions that I find so deeply fascinating. So although the book does come across as existential, I think it comes from a place of just pure curiosity about the world around us and the older I get, the more like ravenous I am for not even for like the definitive answer because I think a lot of life's greatest questions don't have answers. I don't think there is one meaning to life. I don't think there is one answer to what happens after we die. But I think hearing all of the answers is the best part. I love hearing a completely different perspective on an answer or on a question that I thought I already knew the answer to. So that's kind of what I dive into with the book is it's just a lot of me contemplating human existence from the perspective of like a 29 year old in a global pandemic. Although I think I only use the word pandemic once in the book because I didn't want it to be about that necessarily. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you know, you actually that was something that I thought was really graceful about about it is that yeah, you didn't mention the pandemic a lot, but you did manage to work in them like we're wearing masks now so that so it does it would be and that's a wonderful thing because I don't think you want something to be fully anchored in the pandemic necessarily, you know, it would tie it down. I want to thank Babel for supporting this episode of the DTFH and for being part of my dream to one day return to Paris, not as a Luddite, not as someone completely incapable of speaking their beautiful language, but as someone fluent or at least fluent enough to order a baguette or get in a taxi and not seem like a complete asshole tourist. I want to go to the catacombs and I want to speak French with my wife. C'est tomes et devolions, which means that man is trying to steal a bone or menage toi. Wee. This is why I love Babel. Babel's 15 minute lessons make it the perfect way to learn a new language on the go. Other language learning apps use AI for their lesson plans, but Babel lessons were created by over 100 language experts. Their teaching method has been scientifically proven to be effective.

There are so many ways to learn with Babel. In addition to lessons, you can access podcasts, games, video stories and even live classes. Start your new language learning journey today with Babel. It's rude. They're really good. You will get addicted to learning another language. And then the next thing you know, you'll experience neurogenesis. Your brain will actually improve. That's coming from me, not from Babel, but I'm guessing it makes you grow new neurons right now. When you purchase a three month Babel subscription, you'll get an additional three months for free. That's six months for the price of three. Just go to Babel.com use promo code Duncan. That's B-A-B-B-E-L.com code Duncan Babel language for life. Are you familiar with Japanese death poetry? I am a little bit. Not fully, but enough that if you talk about it, I'm sure I can catch on. It's just rude. That had to me. It felt a little bit like that too. Just because, you know, the finality of death when it meets someone like writing their final poem or something like that. And generally these poems, they don't answer any questions. They just float there. You know, the person's gone and this thing is floating there. And it's like, holy shit, you died and you didn't. Like you were writing about the way a willow tree looks in the wind. You know what I mean about the way a drop of rain is landing on your house. You know, like, where's the fucking answer, man? And that God, that is such a, um, it feels like, you know, human existence is something that you are putting into italics. And I think that's a really curious thing to be doing, um, in a difficult thing to just sit with that, that kind of insecurity. And, you know, your most recent YouTube video, and I saw you online tweeting about this, like you're dealing with becoming a 30 year old. And, um, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, and, um, feeling all of the feelings wrapped up in that shift. I'm 47. So I've, thank God, I've died many times as far as like the age thing goes. Like, you know what I mean? I've had to surrender over and over and over again to like, ah, fuck, I'm old. But I wanted to ask you this, if you knew for certain that you were going to live and all of humanity was going to live to be a thousand years old, that that was the new human life span via who knows what, some biotechnology or something. How would that change the way that you're currently interacting with reality? Oh gosh, isn't it like, it wouldn't that be because you do, you do feel the sense of finiteness, the older you get, and you never like, you never want to be that, that person, you hear it. It's such a cliche of getting older and feeling like your time, time is slipping away from you, it's like a quarter falling out a hole in your pocket. And, and you never want to be that person. But I think that is because you have this truly like ticking clock and you can see it ticking in front of you. But if it were a thousand years, yeah, you know, that would be, I just feel like there would be such a sense of ease and their anxiety wouldn't exist within me because that's such a long time versus a hundred or even, I mean, one of the biggest crisis I had like a few years ago was when I realized I wasn't having a quarter life crisis. I was having a third life because I was like 25 and I'm like, oh no, the average American lives to like 75 and I'm like, this is a quarter life crisis. You have a second crisis on top of the crisis. Yeah, I just, yeah, I think I would just be more relaxed to keep it really simple. I think I think it is this this ticking clock that makes everyone so stressed and so anxious of I'm not doing enough with the time that I have. Yeah, it's like almost like a curse has been cast on the entirety of the species. The curse, of course, being based on this generally accepted life span thing, which, by the way, is pretty fucking optimistic. It's like everyone assumes they're going to live to be like their life span, please, like falling dead left and right throughout not just the pandemic, but generally in history, you know, someone just like some people don't wake up. Some people don't get to go to bed again. Some people have like aneurysms. I'm not trying to freak anybody out here, by the way. But it's like I've always found the lifespan thing to be a little bit like, oh, yeah, really? Well, it didn't work out for my mom or my dad or like lots of other people. I know maybe you'll get the lifespan. But then by the time you get to that lifespan, come on, let's face it. By the time you're 80 or 90, you don't know what the fuck's going on anymore. You're confused. And that is such, yeah, that part is really stressful, too. Because so my dad's a doctor. So I hear about everything that you just described all the time. You know, he's telling me he's like, oh, this person, this person died today or this I met a 20 year old that did this today. And it's just like I'm constantly aware of how fragile life is or how quickly people can be like given or taken something somewhere. So it's just like it's always been a thought in my head in that sense. But it also has made me appreciate living in this moment right now and not like saving for a moment 20 years from now because of how how many people don't even make it to 20 years from now by accounts completely outside of their own control, which I guess I do I read about that a lot in the book as well. But it's like just trying to enjoy this moment and not make it some sort of tally on a board that has to count later on. Oh, and and and and and yet it seems like the way that you are at least articulating your experience is not to try to like flower it up. You know, that that's another thing I like about it is you're not like you're and forgive me if this offends you, you seem to be a teacher of sorts. Like you your intent in some of these and a lot of the content you're creating, it feels really good. And it feels like you're either just trying to like work, work it out yourself publicly, which is naturally comforting for all of us. Or you're like, understand how freaked out people are and are just trying to help in some way. But I love the way that you're doing that because you're not trying to make it better, you're just being with that reality. And to me, I think that's incredibly powerful, beautiful. Thank you. That's really sweet. I yeah, I think I yeah, I never want to I never want to come across as someone who has all the answers because clearly I don't. And I also never want to come across as preachy because everyone has a completely individual situation with an individual life and individual weights attached to their ankles. So like, who am I to tell you the one answer to fix something and then lead you on to believe that? And then if it doesn't work for you, feel some sort of responsibility for that. I think like when I started gaining that level of perspective after I came out publicly and after I started meeting people within the queer community and the simple question that people would always ask me is like, how do I come out? And the more you hear stories and the more perspective you gain from people around the world, people even in super liberal bubbles, it's just it's so difficult for so many reasons for so many people. And who am I to just tell you like, just do it, you'll feel better. It's so easy. It's so fine. I don't know what your situation is. Like, I can't I can't give you one simple piece of advice because there are so many factors involved in your decision that really could in it deeply impact your life. What's that like being Catholic with a dad reminding you of the fragility of life, a religion reminding you, oh, yeah, not only is life fragile, but when you die, you are fucked if you are not heterosexual. What was did it was were you being were you being steeped in that kind of Catholicism? So like on one side, you have modern medicine. On the other side, you have this archaic interpretation of the Bible. And right in the middle of that, you're this like a handsome gay kid who is pretending that you're straight. Like how I can't imagine what that felt like. It just felt like a storm brewing beneath the surface because it really you're right. There were so many different elements of me constantly combating each other, but not understanding why or more so not understanding if everyone felt this way, but just wasn't speaking about it. Not just like in terms of identity, but more so just like, does everyone question everything all the time? Does everyone feel like something's telling me one thing and the other thing's telling me another, or is everyone like constantly overlooking it and letting it go right over their shoulder in one ear out the other? Yeah, I felt that way constantly of just like something's not adding up here. And why is nobody talking about it? I would sit in church just like twiddling my thumbs, being like, why can't I focus on these stories? Because and then like it dawned on me years later of like, oh, I didn't believe them and I also didn't believe half the things that they were trying to teach us or I didn't necessarily respect the people who were who were telling the stories. Like there were so many things, so many factors there of like, why do I why do I have to sit here in this pew and drink this liquid and eat this cracker and listen to this man and that is like my guaranteed future, my guaranteed acceptance letter into eternal life. Like why is that why is it almost that too simple? Something about that just never added up for me. Yeah, yeah. Well, that's probably a healthy reaction to have to something like that. I mean, to me, I was raised in the in the Episcopal Church and I've, you know, I think any kid should not feel comfortable at church, not necessarily because of the dogma or the philosophy or whatever, just because the general situation sucks. You're like, Pew's, why? Why not recliners? Wood, just like solid wood, no cushion, no nothing. I get like back in like medieval times or whatever, you know, throw down some logs, sit down, look at the guy in the road, but like, fuck now. So it's naturally uncomfortable. You know, I was a chubby kid. I'm still a chubby dad, but like I had a, like my belt was always too tight in there. Mine too. OK, the belt pain, like the belt pain of church children completely unacknowledged and then on top of that, you're trying to stay awake because it's the most boring shit you ever heard. It's Latin half the time. Don't get me started on like a holiday mass that's later in the day, like a midnight Christmas mass, did you have to have to go to those? Oh my God, torture as a child, torture. Torture, it's literal torture. But and then the thing is all they had to do was admit, you know, we're going to a magic ritual, you know, like, you know, you want to believe in wizards and sorcery, Duncan, that's what we're headed to. We're headed to a really intense occult ritual that happens all over the country every day where people like eat the flesh of a dead God. Then I'd be like, this is fucking cool. Yeah, it's sexy, man. Just cannibalizing the son of God. I'll take it. You get to drink wine as a child. Come on, come on. The best, the best. But so so in other words, are you saying like the whole hell thing? You just were like, I'm not buying that. It just never seemed real to me. And I think to your point, I almost wish it was it was told from a more fictional perspective, like I almost wish it was fantastical and sensationalized. To me, it was the whole aspect of it all seeming real and definitive and not magical in a strange way, the way that they were told to me. It just it didn't seem appealing. So therefore, why would I think it's real if I have absolutely no interest in it? And I also hated the aspect of hell. I'm like, some of us are going to go to a bad place for the rest of our existence and be tortured for not doing the perfect thing. That sounds horrible. I don't want to participate in this. I didn't I didn't sign up for this. I didn't ask for this. What? Wow. This is so somehow you manage your immune system or whatever was strong enough to not get the Catholic guilt that a lot of people I know were infected by. I definitely I mean, I still do have I have I do get some Catholic. I think it's fading very slowly. It's like a drug that's been in my system for for years and it's slowly wearing off. But no, I mean, I didn't have it as much. I would frequently because we were we were serial Catholics. We would go like every single Sunday to church. Never miss Sunday, Sunday mass and the times that like I couldn't make it to church. We were expected to go to a different service, like a later service. And I frequently just started realizing, oh, I can say, oh, I'm going to sleep in and go to the later service. And then instead of going to the later service, I just go do something else and come back and be like, church was great, love to that service. That mass was great. And I was just hanging out with friends like in a parking lot somewhere for the hour and that was my act of rebellion in a town of 4,000 people. What? Yeah. Societal pressure. The like just endemic homophobia. All of that aside. What was aside from that, I should say, not all that aside, like I'm rushing it away. I apologize. But what was the yeah, you know, just that stuff, just that sprinkling of hellish hate. No, what I mean is like, what was what was the personally the if you had to name? And again, I'm sorry, this is a dumb question. If you had to name the one thing, what was the hardest part of coming out? What was the biggest boundary to like letting people know who you actually are? I think an element of it is is accepting being an other. Accepting being different than your perceived peers in a way is that you from that point on, whether you're aware of it or not, are a minority. You are someone that has a different perspective or cannot relate to many traditional aspects of life and society. Like I'll find myself in groups and be the only queer person in the group. And just so many things I don't actually relate to I probably I can find something that is relatable to it, but it's just not my my life or my lifestyle. And every time I chime in, it's from a different perspective. It may be on the same topic, but it's me saying it from a completely different angle. And you just feel different. You may not be it may not be noticed to other people. There may be absolutely no shame associated with it. But it you can't help but be aware of your otherness when you're speaking about it. And that's, you know, that's like a lasting feeling, even being, you know, I don't know how many years out of the closet now, but like completely comfortable with it. I still every time I chime in, it's like that feeling. There's like a little there's like a little gremlin on your shoulder where just like being like, you're the different one here, you're the one that is talking about dating a man and not a woman in this group of all men who are dating women. And you just are overwhelmed by that feeling for just a second. And then it goes away. And every time you bring it up again, it's there and then it's gone. It's like how a lot of I guess I'll just speak to like the gay cis male experience. But a lot of us, like when we're even just holding like our partner's hand in public, I still get that feeling of like, is someone going to call this out, is someone going to to say something from across the street? Like you just have this level of tension always there and this like subtle fear. And whether that's realistic or that's because that's what you've always been told could happen, could be a part of your experience. I don't know, but it but it's definitely there even in the smallest way, which is sad that that even is a thing that just exists. Rationally, irrationally. Yeah, and all an invisible, you know, an invisible suffering for a lot of us, too. We don't like straight people like one, I think fantasy. A lot of us have is like, oh, I think they worked it all out now. It's fine. The other fantasy, you know, I think a lot of us have not just with that, with a lot of other people who are like, what the fuck? You don't even understand like you go out to brunch with your wife, you know? And it's like there isn't like a quality in there of like, you know, there's some potential probably far away, you know, I'm in a liberal city, but there's some small potential that someone's just going to decide to punch me. And so I think it's that's something a lot of us forget who who aren't queer or gay. And then but this is the in your book. This is the part that you really hit home. First chapter, this unknown future, like you're pointing out like, yes, there are like there have been shifts for the better, you know, there is the possibility to get married now, which is again, relatively new. But you but what's the what you you made this wonderful point of like, what's the model for that that you have? You know, I've got generations of suffering married people that I can look at and be like, all right, I know, I know that suffering. But for you, you know, it's different. Like, where is the precedent? You're setting the precedent now. And that is got to be a heavy feeling. You're like the trailblazer in this regard, you know? I know. And it's it was a strange thought to have. And it was one of the first first it's the first chapter in the book, but it was also one of the first things I wrote for the book. And one of the first, I guess, like the very beginning of me wanting to write another book was this thought of of how strange it is for any any LGBTQ person because there really hasn't been this point in history where a certain level of acceptance is, you know, given at birth for some people. Yeah. So you you don't have anyone to really look up to because even the people that, you know, even like the gay men that I know that are married and have families, I'm like, but they they're experiencing this for the first time, too. They're just experiencing it at 50. So they don't have anyone that is experienced. I mean, like there is no future to it. We're all experiencing it in the present. So we're all being the first 29 year old to do this. We're all being the first 37 year old to do this 80 year old. What have you. And that's just a really unique feeling or experience that's so unrelatable or indescribable and it can either be liberating or absolutely existentially daunting and it depends what you want to do with it. Because I I love being the I love being kind of like the black sheep of my family, the only gay kid within my three other siblings and, you know, my parents and what have you because I do have this this unspoken level of freedom to whatever it is I do because my parents kind of know like, oh, you know, it's it's Connor. He's he's doing his thing. You know, it's it's Connor. He's the artsy one. He's the one who lives in California. He's the gay one. Like we can't dictate his life because his life is something different than ours. So there is this like freedom. And I think that I I see it as more the liberating than the daunting because the people around me gift me that perspective as well. Right. So it's why I always hope that everyone else can feel the same type of way or have the same type of people around them because both are both are possible and potential.

Do you do you first like looking at just over the course of my lifetime, the shift in opinions when it comes to sexuality in the world? It is like the whole thing going to go out the window. Like it's eventually like the whole idea of like heterosexuality, being gay, being queer, being straight. Is that a good is this going to be looked at as some kind of weird like tribal paint we used to wear? How exciting is it that that's even just a thought? Like, I think it's so cool that when when, you know, more sexual orientations and gender identities and, you know, more of this is discovered or more of this is talked about or experienced or lived. I'm like, that's so cool that we thought we had it down. We thought we knew what we were talking about. We thought it was just black and white, binary, this and that. And then like it then it just pops out of nowhere that, oh, no, not only is this real, but many people are experiencing this. Many people feel this way and are going to live their lives as this person. And like we had no idea. So I think I think when you when you when you in a weird way, like when you give people not the option because it's obviously not a choice. But like when it's presented to people and it's it's seen as OK, I think more people are going to take it and run. So I do think that it's going to become much more normal to be anything but straight because, frankly, it's so hard to be anything on the polar end. I don't know many people who are like one hundred percent anything. There's always a little wiggle room. And I feel like sexuality and identity are just inherently fluid in some way. And the more we accept that that's an OK thing and that's a normal thing, the more people are going to be willing to, I guess, experience that fluidity or experiment with that fluidity and feel less shame around it. So I just think it's exciting. I'm like, that's so cool that everyone could be so open in the next 10, 20, 30, 50, 100 years that it's anything again, anything is possible, anything can happen. Yeah, well, you know, I can't remember the science fiction writer, but he was writing about some future way down the line. And in that future, like sexual preference was actually considered a fetish. Like all sexual preference was considered a fetish. You know, I've a fetish for this or that or whatever. And but, you know, again, like this is where. This is this is a point of interest to me. The it's it's not a choice. And I understand that the it's not a choice gets used or that it is a choice. It's used in the most rotten fucking way. It's produced that conversion therapy. It's like destroyed. It's destroyed people's lives. I mean, yeah, I think even even my one of my teachers, Ramdas, I think, had to go through that like, oh, this is like I'm experiencing some. It was considered a disorder, you know, it was considered a disorder. You know, it was not, you know, and so I but I wonder like. Sometimes I wonder, well, is that does that create a like unnecessary boundary for people where they're like, well, I like being with women or I like being with guys. But I love to see I love to experience everything, but it's not a choice. So that would be, you know what I'm saying? But I think I think inherently then you're you're like the person, the hypothetical person is making it sound like they get to decide to to want the other gender to want more. But it's it's, you know, it's chemical. It's baked into them. It's in there. It's in their entire being that that was already a part of them from the very from the very beginning in a way. It wasn't just like one day they were like, you know, might try that today. I think it's always been there. It's more of just when you realize that it's a part of you. Oh, OK. I see what you say. Yeah, totally. I see what you say. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's like somewhere in you, there's a part of you that wants to be with the same sex. That's in you, whether you want to admit or not. I was just there and then you got to a point where like, OK, OK, so you're now. This is interesting, though, because like here we have like a kind of genetic predeterminism, you know what I mean? And by the way, it's there's something in DNA that is absolutely terrifying as far as like free will goes, you know, because it's like how much of my children like some of their the they it's like my mom looking at me through them, like literally like the expression or my dad, you know, the way that like so. But yeah, it's it's a curious thing. How. How do you what? Do you have any fantasy about maybe having kids one day? I do. And I it's hard to imagine without, you know, without like having a forever partner, like someone that I'm like, yeah, this is it, found the person, you know, I can I can build my future with them. But no, I definitely do. There's like when I see my brother with my niece or I see my friends with their kids, I just there's something there's something so undescribably beautiful about it of like the connection that they have in the bonds that they have and the idea of like bringing a little person into this world and teaching them about it and watching them grow and change is just so so magical to me. So yeah, I definitely I fantasize about it a lot. But I also don't think I'm anywhere near ready for it. Oh, you better watch out. That's exactly what I said, Fred. That's exactly what I said. I was on the phone with my brother probably six months before my my wife became pregnant, we wanted to have kids. But I was on the phone with him saying, I just, you know, Jeff, I just don't think I'm going to reproduce. And now I've got two of them. So you don't. Yeah. You like I know, though, that feeling. I mean, so what's what's going on with that? So you're like here you are like celebrity brilliant writer and are you just like sort of you just don't have time for a forever partner or is there like what's what's are you running into some some trouble with that? Are you too busy? I mean, I think that's the that's the scapegoat answer in a way or that's like the the answer that I always say, but probably isn't the truth. I don't know. I mean, it's I just find dating in modern times to be absolutely exhausting. And I also find it even more exhausting in Los Angeles or in any sort of really big city, maybe not all big cities, but it's just it's like a weird time. And it feels like a universal feeling. I've never talked to any person named one person you've heard say, I love dating apps. They're so great. They're so they're so stimulating and positive. I've always had a not one person feels that way. But also what other alternative do we have to find people and partners, especially again, in the very particular situation we're in over the last two years? Yeah. So I think that it's kind of been built up to more that of maybe I'm not in the right place or maybe it truly just isn't the right time. But I'm really not stressed about it. I think again, I keep thinking if it's going to happen, it's going to happen. And also by all by all means, like I am very young. So plenty of time, plenty of time, plenty of time, plenty of time. I would love it. Don't get me wrong. Like that sounds great to to meet to meet like a forever partner or whatever you want to call them, but sounds great. Just haven't found it. Yeah.

Like, you know, it's just something you do in your horny. You like pull up the dating app and you're like swiping and swiping and swiping and some weird dream that like, but it's never. It's always right. It's always like at the time you don't expect it late at night and then I'll wake up the next morning and be like, oh, yeah, I was messaging someone last night. I'll look back and be like, who is this person? What were we talking about? And they're being like, yeah, we should get coffee today. And I'm like, I don't know you stranger fuck off. Who are you? And I'm like, wow, I'm toxic. Am I like leading people on or are people too eager and willing to go meet up with a stranger after having like a pleasant exchange for two minutes? Like, what's the what's the right thing here? Should you meet up with someone just because you had a good banter for five minutes? Or should you have more self-respect to like chill and meet if you you talk to them for a few days? I don't know. I don't know what's the right answer. But it's it's it's a difficult one, especially in the gay community. Like we have like dating apps in the gay community or just dating preferences in the gay community are very particular people. Like there are people who have been known to have incredibly toxic preferences. Like what? Well, the age old saying is at like, I don't believe this. But the age old saying is no fats, no fams, no Asians. And that is like a common occurrence on male dating apps where people have like these strict preferences and they'll actively advertise it in their bios of like who that they're looking for. So specifically particular that it feels it just feels blatantly offensive. No, FIMS. What does that mean? Like no feminine, no feminine men or no feminine. So anyone who's flamboyant or feminine. I don't like again, like what does that even mean really? Right. To me, it to me, it just I see that and I say insecurity, I wouldn't want to date you even if you were amazing. God, if you are really willing to like X out that many people in society just purely like preferences are so strange. Yeah, preferences are crazy, right? Now, now this is like there's actually one of my favorite and sorry for folks listening, one of my favorite. Let me find it right now. This is and I can't even pronounce it. It's one of my favorite Buddhist texts speaking of preferences. It's by the third patriarch of Zen. And let's see. Hold on one second. And it begins with the great way is not difficult for they who hold no preference. It's not fucking cool. It's like preference is the devil. It's the it's the whether it's like dating apps, whether and even worse is like something about the digital reality is that you are forced to squeeze yourself into a clump of preferences. And you know, it starts off where you're like, I'll just write some shit down in my bio or dating apps in particular. The questions they might be asking or the way you're presenting yourself has to fit into these categories that plug into the algorithm. And I think that's where you run in to something that is really malefic, which is the way that the algorithm is grooming us, bonsai training us, shaping us into all these like forms that if we aren't even we aren't even those things at all. Totally, totally. I know and I've never and maybe maybe this is me like subliminally not participating in that, but I never write bios for anything because I'm like, how am I supposed to describe myself in a sentence? Like, how could I possibly describe anything about me in a sentence that makes sense of like who I am? So most of the time it's like, I don't know, just ask me, which also is it nice because that doesn't come across as welcoming, does it? So I never know. Like I don't like that either. And yeah, you're so right in that I feel like having strict preferences is just limiting you from experiencing the gradient of the world around us. Yeah, to think that you could possibly know, again, dating apps is the example of like, this is the only person I am attracted to. This is the only person I want to date. You're you're limiting yourself from so many potential other people and partners and experiences that you could have because you think you don't like someone you've never met. Yeah, yeah, it's just zeros and ones. You're doing it based upon a picture. You're not even having an in-person interaction with them. How could you possibly know that you're not attracted to them? This brings me to my next question. If you had to describe yourself in one sentence, what would it be? Oh, no, I'm just kidding. That wasn't really about just kidding. That's not my fucking question. I fully believed you to garbage question. Oh, God, if you had this, you know, I've been asked that, you know, I mean, I'm sure you've been asked that, too, of like to some some boil yourself down into something like that before. It's just OK, you lazy fuck in an interview and someone's like, so what are you? Hey, are you supposed to know that? So what is the book about? So what do you do? I'm like, did you do any? What am I here for? Am I describing myself? So are you you're human? And I know, I know. But what but what? Like, do you pray? Do you have a connect? Do you what is your connection right now with with the source with God, with the universe? What do you do? Do you have a spiritual practice right now? I know it's coming across like I'm like a Satan worshiper. But no, I feel like I'm very connected to the universe and to the planet and to living things around me and to life itself. So I feel very like the most free I ever feel or the most peaceful I ever feel is when I'm in in nature or I'm in a natural environment. So if I'm just like standing in the middle of the woods and it's just nothing but wind in the trees, animals scurrying up a tree, you know, like just natural sounds like I feel so at peace or if I'm standing at the beach here in California and it's like no one to my left, no one to my right and I just hear the ocean crashing, nothing beats that feeling. And I feel like that's how I go about life a lot nowadays. You know, I'm willing for it to grow and change. But at the moment, it's more of like when I go for a run every morning or a walk every night, I don't bring my phone with me. I just allow myself to hear what's happening around me or to like sit with whatever's happening within me and just be and that's my only time where I feel so grounded, so connected 100 percent there for that moment. And then I go back to the chaos. Oh, my God, that passage in your book about like your phone not working, going off into nature, that was so beautiful. So it was interesting in that you're describing this perfect experience of like being free from technology. And I'm like, this is how I feel. And then literally the next sentence is like, I know that you're thinking this is how other people say they feel. But I do think you like identified this this growing realization in all of us, which is like this shit is fucking us up. It is devastating our society. It is like roasting us and it's not the fires of hell. Maybe it's something worse than that. Because like, at least if you're in hell, a blaze screaming into whatever the fuck it is, like a cave or whatever, like, you know, well, at least I'm doing something right, like I'm supposed to be hurting right now. You know, so in some way there's some perfection happening here. But these digital fires, it's like, I don't think people realize how we're getting baked by him. It's the zuck. It's all the zuck. He's got us wrapped around his finger. I know it's it's I every time I get my like iPhone's screen time, do you have that thing delivered to your phone? Yeah, I turn it off. I need to turn it off because I keep I'll randomly get it every Sunday of like my screen time and I'm reminded of, oh my God, I'm so addicted to this thing that I'm spending this much time on it, doing what for what? Scrolling on TikToks, watching people like eat fast food and and people dance. And like for what? What is it? What is it doing? What is it adding? It's enjoyable in the moment. But God, it does feel just worthless to a certain extent. Don't you think you in particular and, you know, me, anybody who has jobs like we have, don't you feel like you're a little more imprisoned by it than other people? I mean, it's not just like you're consuming it for the euphoria of it. Like you have to be engaged with your audience. If you want to continue that, you know, if you want to continue doing what one part of what you're doing, it must be a little claustrophobic. Or just you have to be in tune with the world around you, meaning like you have to know what's what's a trend. You have to know what's in the news to be able to talk about it. Yeah, because I mean, it's I do a lot of live streaming and people are constantly being like, did you see the new Adele? Did you hear what happened to Justin Bieber? And if you don't know anything, people just aren't like, what do you have to talk about that's current? Everyone at the moment is so addicted to now, now, now, now, immediacy, instant gratification from being a part of exactly what's popular in the second, if you didn't watch Squid Game, the moment it came out, fuck you. You know what I mean? Like it's like all of that. And you feel you feel that I think as not even just me, like I think everyone feels that to a certain extent of just I have if you don't keep up, you're going to get left behind. I my my siblings don't do what I do, but their jobs are becoming more and more intertwined within immediacy, their email being available 24 seven, even when they're not working in their hours. It's just oh yeah, you have to answer this email. I know you're not working, but you have to answer it or oh, someone's trying to schedule this, you need to pick up the phone to answer it. And it's like, you're not working. Why are you working? But it's because they figured out figured out a way in this American lifestyle to make us work 24 seven without our permission. Yeah, yeah. And like, but what what is the what is the like? Because I think you're more of a barometer for it than a lot of people. I know is it just in my mind that there's a growing sense of like, no, this is not the way to live or is it just more like everyone's like, no, we are going to fuse with a machine. We're plunging ahead full steam and this is read. This is just like we're going to like meld with the with technology. What's the general? What's the sense out there, man? Are people few or like people getting sick of this? I it's so tough because I feel like it's it's polarized like a lot of things right now in that I see people fully embracing it and fully living a tech savvy lifestyle where they have, you know, the Apple Watch, they have the newest computer, they have the newest VR system. They are fully immersed in the digital age and they love it. They love that everything is so convenient, that everything is so futuristic. But then there is this subset of people who are experiencing that as well, but resent it wholeheartedly and then they become in like almost lost in this cycle of resisting something that's inevitable. I feel like it's almost impossible to not participate like I have. I have cousins that somehow still don't have cell phones in the rural Midwest. And I know and I'm like, I don't know how that's possible. How is it literally possible for you to not have high speed internet in your house in the 21st century? I actually like I can't fathom it because it's so important to what I do in my lifestyle, but I envy it. But then also I think, do I envy it? Because I kind of like I kind of like everything that's going on here. I kind of like my HD camera. I kind of like my high speed internet. I kind of like that access. But it doesn't make me feel good all the time either. So I don't know, it's it's deep. Can it's deeply conflicting there because I do. I do think the futuristic element of technology is absolutely amazing. But it does leave me feeling worthless half the time as well. In Tulip. Oh, my God. What a beautiful essay on depression. You wrote. It's like I figured out how to reach out for help. But I still haven't figured out how to receive the help I asked for. God, this is how I feel about every time I pray, you know, like when I pray, I think I get my prayers answered. But then when they're being answered, I'm like, oh, no, I can't. I don't deserve it. I feel unworthy. This is I can't take this. Do you is that part of your depression, a sense of unworthiness or a feeling like you just don't deserve all of this amazing, like this amazing life experience and abnormal life experience that you're having? Yeah, I constantly feel like I don't. I don't I don't want any sort of praise or any sort of attention or any sort of just anyone to look at me. It's it's kind of it's completely it's like the antithesis to like what I do. But I it makes me so uncomfortable to be singled out or to be praised or to be looked at in some way. So when you need advice or you need help from a friend like in Tulip, it's like it's there. It's what I need. I know I need it. I know I've been asking for it, but I have no idea what to do with it now that it's here, I feel completely helpless in that case. And I feel that I think that that could be just it could be in a Midwestern humility where Midwesterners absolutely loathe the spotlight or loathe in any way making a situation about themselves. So even though it's completely justified and worthy of me wanting someone to pay attention to me, there's something like, oh, it's fine. It's a burden on you to to give this to me. It's I don't want to make you feel uncomfortable making me feel comfortable. There's some sort of like constantly projecting or assuming what the other person is is wanting or feeling or desiring. And it's like this constant string of empathy towards another person that is like completely there's there's no there's no justification to that process at all. Yeah. Well, I mean, it's I think that's one of the most insidious facets of depression, at least from my own experience with it, is that even if you somehow do manage to muster up the courage to tell someone I'm fucked up right now, the depression, if it lets that slide under the door, it's not going to answer the door when someone comes knocking because it's like, no, you know, that was just I don't know what I was saying, you know. And that's why I think it's like that's why depression is deadly is because it just it like tries to censor every single possible method of connecting with love. It does. And it's I mean, just you saying that makes me think about so many different times where I've experienced depression and I completely shut out everyone, even though I know that's the wrong thing to do. But at the same time, and again, I don't know if you or any or who's who's ever listening is has experienced this, but every time like I've had depression for such a long time, I'm not really depressed now in this present year, this present moment. But my depression has evolved to a state of like when I'm feeling it, I start set casting outlines to people and and then it starts getting worse. And when they bite, I almost resent that they're even paying attention to me. It's like I asked for the help and now that they're giving it back, I'm mad that they're responding and it's this strange cycle that I put myself through of like asking for it because I know before it gets me that that's what I need. And then when when I'm there, I I I react in such a negative way to it. And it's almost impossible for me not to. It's it's just the strange thing. Like I can there are so many times where that happened that happened semi recently as well, or like when I was in my most majorly depressed moments, there was one time that I can think of where I just like just walked. I left my house and I just kept walking for hours because I didn't know what else to do, but I was texting a friend and he was aware that this was happening, but I wouldn't tell him like where I was. And I'm like, oh my God, I'm so sick for like making my friend worry right now about me. But that's like, but that's also clearly what I want is someone to worry about me, but how sick am I to make him worry about me, but not to give him a way to make it better or to tell him where I am or anything. And it but it's this thing that you're like aware that you're doing the bad thing or you're aware that you're causing someone harm with no solution, but you can't stop yourself. Yeah. And your old friend depression, what's it going to tell you? You're sick. Look at you. How sick you are walking. It's like, you know what I mean? Like that part that's telling you you're sick. That's not you. That's the depression. You're not sick. You're you're you're depressed. I mean, I guess we could call it a sickness if you want. But holy shit, man. This this depression and I have been depressed. I have had a problem with depression. I've been prescribed medication for depression in the past. I've been suicidal before a long time ago. It I just don't know of I have. I have one ball. I had a ball chopped off because of testicular cancer. And I will tell you getting radiation for a month. It's a walk in the fucking park compared to depression, friend. I'll tell you that there is nothing I know of in the world. There's nothing I know of like that. And like and so I'm interested in what you're currently what you're I mean, you don't have to share everything, but is like you're running regimen part of you like doing self care for the depression? Are you do you take any kind of medication if you're willing to talk about it? Well, how do you treat it? Yeah, I mean, it bites. It's vicious, isn't it? It's it's again, it's one of those things that you can't describe unless you've felt it yourself. It's it's so painful and just lingers. But no, my current state is very I'm very good. I'm very even. I like you described I for the longest time battled with it and dealt with it myself. And then I started reaching out for help. So I started getting on some medication. I started going to therapy regularly. And all of that kind of brought me back to a level sense. It kind of I'm trying to remember how my therapist described it, but it was basically just like right now you are so low that you can't get back up to a normal level. We need to get you to that normal level because we you can't do anything from so far down here. We need to get you back up to where you were just so that you can even like fight because at the moment you're so low that you can't fight for yourself. We just need you need help to get you to that point. So for me, how I do that on a daily basis is that I exercise regularly. I will connect with a family family member regularly. So like when I wake up in the morning and I go for a run, that's my way of being above the above the floor. So even if I get knocked down a couple hours after that run, I'm still above the floor. I'm not starting off at the floor and getting knocked down below it again. And I can't reach back up to I can't climb up the ladder. So I always set myself up higher than what I would be at without it. So that in case I get knocked down, I don't go back to that place. So it's rare for me to ever spiral anymore because I'm always setting myself up so high that there's like no way for me to get back down there. Wow. Wow. God, I would have had your discipline in my 20s. I was just laying on a mattress with roaches walking on top of me. I'm serious. I'm not exaggerating. I was just like, maybe I'll kill myself. Yeah, that's the same thing. But look, I'll tell you, though, something like I mean, look, earlier I asked you about your spiritual practice, but I think running is like if that's not a religion, I mean, why not? Why can't why that's like I've had some of like I would say true connections with the divine just running somehow. What time do you get up? I like to get I'm one of those like sick people that if I have something really early in the morning, I'll get up like two hours before it, even if it's really early, just because I want that moment of peace ahead of time to like really become myself, it takes like a good hour or two for me to wake up, to feel human, to feel relaxed and be present. So I love that kind of morning silence that I get in that time. So honestly, six between six and seven every morning. And that doesn't mean I'm like out the door running. It's like I'm just sitting, drinking a coffee, kind of meditating in a way, not actively, but in a way it's my meditation. And then go for a run and start the day after that.

256^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - 336: East Forest Transcript and Discussion^2019-05-12^"Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Greetings to you, my sweet sandwich chompin' lovers. It's me, Dee Truss, and you are listening to the Duncan Trussel Family Hour podcast being recorded as secret location that I cannot name yet. First of all, I gotta start off with a deep sonic boom level cosmic celestial rainbow blast of congratulatory goo to the people of Denver who managed to decriminalize mushrooms. If you're living in Denver now, you can walk around with fungus in your pocket without worrying that folks with guns are gonna drag you into the back of a car and take you to a jail cell where your teeth might get knocked out by a bank robber and that, friends, is a beautiful step forward. Not just because it makes Denver that much cooler and Denver was already super cool. It is home to one of the great comedy clubs on the planet, maybe in the galaxy, maybe even in the universe, not sure about the multiverse. The Denver comedy works, and now it is a place that has a more sensible drug policy. We're not there yet. Mushrooms have not been legalized. LSD has not been legalized, and as Emmanuel Safarios, the founder of Dance Save, taught me many moons ago, and I think the first podcast with him, which is that prohibition is actually the deregulation of these substances, and that, friends, is where the trouble starts because just like our milk is regulated, our water is regulated, just like there's places that make sure that the medicines that we are taking are safe, the reason there's a dude at the pharmacy who's acting like he has plutonium in his hand when he's pouring your penicillin into the medicine bottle is because of regulations to make sure that we are taking substances that are what they are supposed to be. And when you make something illegal, regulation goes out the fucking window. And in fact, what happens is a massive underground opens up and people end up getting substances that are either too strong, not what they're supposed to be, or sometimes poison. And so that sucks. We don't want people to go to funeral homes because they wanted to see what was down there and the depths of their psyche are out there in the higher realms. Now, I was certain that after this happened, there would be some obnoxious fucking blog that came out with someone saying that Denver had made some kind of wretched mistake. And I expected, because of my own bias, which is not fair, my apologies to those of you who are on the right, I'm not, but I have a bias against you sometimes, which probably isn't fair. And I expected this shit to come from some kind of ultra right-wing, fascist monstrosity that I invented in my head, some kind of goose-stepping white power bastard, some kind of anti-gay marriage, anti-abortion, loony tunes piece of shit, who would see that the war on drugs was hopefully drawing to a close and this would tickle their butthole in the wrong way and cause it to clench out a shit think piece. So you can imagine my horror, my astonishment when this fucking think piece that I predicted and many things that I predicted have come true, including the transformation of the Washington Monument into a beautiful golden penis. It happened two weeks ago, look it up. When my prediction came true and I found that Michael Pollan, Michael Pollan who I thought was an ally of the psychedelic movement who wrote this book, How to Change Your Mind, What the New Science of Psychedelics Teaches us about consciousness, dying, addiction, depression and transcendence. He used the word transcendence. When Michael Pollan wrote this fucking think piece for the New York Times, I'm just gonna read it to you. Have a trash can nearby. You need something to puke in when you hear this. You're gonna need something. Get some salts, get someone nearby with smelling salts in case you fucking pass out. When you realize this Michael Pollan, this brilliant man who wrote a book that helped to like ease some of the insane superstitions surrounding psychedelics actually had the gall to write a think piece saying that maybe we shouldn't have decriminalized fucking mushrooms at Denver, I'm gonna read it to you. I'm setting kittens on fire while I do this. Michael Pollan, opinion. Michael Pollan, not so fast on psychedelic mushrooms. Can you imagine somebody saying that to you like on a nice summer day when you're sitting in a meadow and you pull out a bag of mushrooms? Not so fast, man. Scybin has a lot of potential as a medicine, but we don't know enough yet about it to legalize it. First of all, they didn't fucking legalize it, Paul, and they decriminalized it. All right, here we go. Oh God, I'm gonna read it in like, I guess, the way he must feel. Only a few days ago, millions of Americans probably never heard of Scybin, the active agent in psychedelic mushrooms. Thanks to Denver, it's about to get its moment in the political sun on Tuesday, the city. First of all, first of all, first of all, come on, Michael Pollan, you fucking elitist. Millions of Americans probably had never heard of Silicite. Shut the fuck up. What is that? Where is that? I want some backup on that, and I'll apologize if this is the case, that millions of people have never heard of magic mushrooms. Millions of people have never heard of that. Come on, it's in fucking pop comedy and songs and bongs and you can't fucking go to any beach, walk into any beach store and there's some dumb ass shirt with a fucking mushroom on it. Or aliens saying like, take me to your dealer holding a mushroom, get out of town. Millions of Americans probably never heard of Silicite. What are you talking about? How dumb do you think Americans are? On Tuesday, the city's voters surprised everyone by narrowly approving a ballot initiative that effectively decriminalizes psilocybin, making its possession use a personal cultivation, a low priority crime. It's not a crime, it's a make-believe crime. I said that, not Pollan. The move is largely symbolic. Only 11 psilocybin cases have been prosecuted in Denver in the last three years and state and federal police may still make arrests. Okay, now, this guy, Pollan, goes from saying that millions of Americans don't know what psychedelic mushrooms are to saying only 11 psilocybin cases have been prosecuted in Denver. Think about that, only 11. Only 11 people's lives have been destroyed potentially because they had possession of or were selling or growing a fungus. That, according to the title of your book, teaches us about consciousness, dying, addiction, depression and transcendence. So fuck, man, only 11 people are potentially buying bars right now because they wanted to experience transcendence. For the first time since psychedelics were broadly banned under the 1970 Control Substance Act, we're about to have a national debate about the place of psilocybin in our society. Debate is always a good thing, but I worry we're not quite ready for this one. Oh, really, Michael Pollan, thanks, but we don't need you to be the babysitter of our minds. No one should ever be arrested or go to jail for the possession of cultivation of any kind of mushroom. It would be disingenuous for me to say, otherwise, since I have possessed, used and grown psilocybin myself, like many others, I was inspired to do so by the recent renaissance of research into psychedelics, including psilocybin. Scientists at places such as Johns Hopkins, New York University, first of all, let's address this paragraph. No one should ever be arrested or go to jail for the possession or cultivation of any kind of mushroom. It would be disingenuous for me to say otherwise, since I have possessed, used and grown psilocybin myself, and your admission of that could put you in jail. It's called a conspiracy, and there is, there are people who go to jail just for saying they've done it, depending on where you live, Pollan, hopefully it's California. Ugh. No one should ever be arrested or go to jail, and that means that you support the legalization of mushrooms. You can't write an article that says, not so fast on psychedelic mushrooms, and then say no one should ever be arrested or go to jail for the possession or cultivation of any kind of mushroom. What's your fucking point, man? Let's keep reading. Scientists at places such as Johns Hopkins, New York University, UCLA, Harbor Medical Center, and Imperial College in London have conducted small but rigorous studies that suggest a single psilocybin trip guided by trained professionals as the potential to relieve existential distress and cancer patients, break addictions to cigarettes, alcohol, and cocaine, and bring relief to people struggling with depression. Psychiatry's current drugs for treating these disorders are limited in their effectiveness, often addictive, address only symptoms, and come with some serious side effects to the prospect of psychedelic medicine as raising hopes of a badly needed revolution in mental health care. This might explain why the FDA granted breakthrough therapy status last year to psilocybin. Thank God, bless you, FDA, which promises to speed its consideration as a treatment for depression, but the research also shows that psilocybin may have value for the rest of us. Studies have demonstrated that properly administered psilocybin journey can have enduring positive effects on the well-being and relative openness of healthy, quote, healthy normals, as researchers put it. Healthy normals, God, Jesus Christ. This is all very exciting, especially coming at a time when rates of depression, suicide, and addiction are rising, but the history of psychedelics has been marked by periods of both irrational exuberance and equally irrational stigmatization. So a few cautionary notes are in order. As much as the supporters of legal psilocybin hope to follow the political playbook that has rapidly changed the status of cannabis in recent years, they need to bear in mind that psilocybin is a very different drug and is not for everyone. In some ways, it's not for everyone. It isn't. No one said it was. That's the thing, man. No one said it was, but we are adults and we can make our own decisions in life. For example, I know that certain things are not for me. I don't need you to tell me that, and certainly I don't need the fucking government to tell me that. You know what I know is not for me? I'm not gonna get a neck tattoo. It's not for me. I don't want one. I'm not gonna get one. I don't judge the people who have them. They're fucking cool. You committed to writing, getting ink into the skin of your neck, but definitely neck tattoos are not for everyone. Skiing is not for everyone. Skateboarding is not for everyone. Parachuting is not for everyone. Mountain climbing is not for everyone. Eating pork is not for everyone. Certain waterslides, like the one in the fucking brochures I see on the airplane for Atlantis. Atlantis, that horrific-looking neck-breaking monstrous fucking waterslide that kids are shooting down. Theoretically, risking breaking their arms and legs and neck. That's not for everyone. Swimming with sharks is not for everyone. Wearing sunscreen is not for everyone because some people wanna get fucking sunburnt. Jogging is not for everyone. Exercise is not for everyone. Sugar is not for everyone. So many things are not for everyone. No shit. But it doesn't mean that the fucking state should arrest people for possession of fucking sunscreen. I know that's probably false equivalency, but it felt good to be that passionate for a second. Ugh. There are risks, both practical and psychological, and these can be serious. Someone on a high dose of psilocybin is asked to have a badly impaired judgment and unsupervised could do something reckless. No shit. Really? You felt like you had to fucking write that Michael Pollan, brilliant Michael Pollan. You felt like you had to write that someone on a high dose of psilocybin is asked to have a badly impaired judgment. Ha, ha, what? What do you think? People think it's water? It's not a water fountain. It's a conduit through which we can communicate with aliens. Without proper attention to setting and preparation, people can have absolutely terrifying experiences, sometimes with lasting effects. A recent survey of people who reported having a bad trip found that nearly 8% of them had sought psychiatric help afterwards. You know who else has to go to the fucking psychologist? People who've been in jail. There's a reason psychedelic research has screened volunteers carefully excluding people at risk of serious mental illness like schizophrenia. In rare instances, a psychedelic trip can set off a psychotic break. Very rare. The researchers also look at drug interactions and often disqualify volunteers who are taking certain psychiatric medications. I look forward to the day when psychedelic medicines like psilocybin having proved their safety and efficacy and FDA approved trials will take their legal place in society, not only mental health care, but in the lives of people dealing with garden variety, happiness, or interest in spiritual exploration and personal growth. My worry is that ballot initiatives may not be the smartest way to get there. We still have a lot to learn about the immense power and potential risk of these molecules, not to mention the consequences of unrestricted use. It will be a shame if the public is pushed, pushed. The public is pushed to make premature decisions about psychedelics before the researchers have completed their work. There is the risk of inciting the sort of political backlash in the late 1960s setback. Okay, this is where I start getting rage goose bumps. There is the risk of inciting the sort of political backlash in the late 1960s setback research into psychedelics for decades. Think of what we might know now and the suffering that might have been alleviated had that research been allowed to continue. I'm gonna read the rest of this so he can make his point and then I'm gonna read you some. When psychedelics like psilocybin and LSD burst upon the scene in the 1950s and 1960s, they arrived without an instruction manual. Half a century later, we're still struggling to learn how to, okay. So let me step back here. He is saying that the political backlash of the 60s that resulted in the war on drugs that resulted in so many lives being absolutely destroyed by the government for doing nothing wrong is because of the drugs and not because fucking Richard Nixon wanted to arrest people. He's completely, completely wrong. His assumption here, which is absolutely, maddeningly insane is that the state, the government has your best interest at heart that the people making these drug laws like Tipper Gore and Biden and all the people who are making it so that you can't test drugs at raves, the people who are making it so that you have mandatory minimum prison sentences and go to jail for a long time for psychedelics, give a fucking shit about you, that they're really worried about you. That's the assumption that he's making here, that there are people and the government are like, oh my God, we've got to keep these fucking people safe from mushrooms because this isn't the case at all. These drugs were not criminalized because of the exuberant response people had to finally being allowed to open a bio organic manuscript written by nature teaching us how to connect with each other in the universe. These people were going to fucking jail because Nixon wanted to figure out a way to arrest people in the black power movement and fucking hippies. You can look that up, Michael Pollan. And then fear mongering started and the fear mongering created wave after wave after wave of insane loss that did not protect people but put people in jail. Put people in jail for LSD. There was a fellow, thank God, who got his sentence removed by Obama who was in jail for multiple life sentences for selling sheets of LSD and because he was having them sent to his father's address, his father went to jail too and his father died in fucking jail, Michael Pollan. And I know that you're saying up here that there's no reason to put people in jail, people shouldn't go to jail for these things but that's all you had to say. That's it, congratulate Denver because now people aren't gonna go to jail for these fucking things. But don't like, don't smash that fucking pyramid into your paragraph pyramid. You need to go to the pyramids, Michael Pollan. Don't smash that fucking paragraph into your goddamn shitty essay because the option right now is it's either illegal, decriminalized or legal. And as long as it's illegal, people are gonna go to jail for something that is relatively harmless. And yes, you're right, there are potential side effects from taking these fucking psychedelics in the same way that there's side effects from driving a car and there's side effects from reading certain books. There's side effects from going on certain websites. There's side effects, man. So many things in this world are incredibly dangerous but we don't need you to tell us that, Michael Pollan. What we need is the legalization of psychedelics so that we can regulate them, that's it. And there's no need to try to push the fucking brakes down on something that no one's gonna be able to stop now. This is victory for everybody. Decriminalize, legalize, regulate. This is it, this is it. And yeah, sure, these things are potentially dangerous. I had extra dimensional entities crawl through my body, Michael Pollan. I was praying that they would climb out of my body, they were mocking my prayers and it was scary. It was scary, I had to poop the whole time. But I don't think that the penalty for that should be me getting my teeth knocked out in prison by a fucking bank robber. That's not where I wanna go to integrate that information that I got from that particular mushroom trip which wasn't my last but it should have been. So you're wrong here, Pollan. I'm grateful to you that you wrote that book. I'm grateful to you that you are part of helping bring psychedelics out of the closet. I understand that you feel a kind of obligation to warn people about the dangers of these things and certainly nobody wants to see psychedelics go back into the underground completely. But we need people like you to be the cheerleader here, not saying fucking obvious platitudes about the fact that psychedelics are potentially dangerous, like we don't know that. Of course we do, of course we do. And when things are, you know, Mr. Pollan, Dr. Pollan, Michael Pollan, beautiful man, my sweet child, my lover, I go online sometimes and order marijuana. Comes to my house in a child-proof bag that I can't open. My wife has to open it for me. And inside of that fucking bag, there are a variety of wonderful types of cannabis. I like edible cannabis and so there's a nice breath spray that has on the back the exact dosage or the drops that I take have perfectly metered out the exact dosage I need to take for a variety of effects. And these are all detailed and they're right, because there's regulation and these drugs are being distributed in a responsible way. In the old days, when I used to go buy marijuana in high school and step through piles of my drug dealers' pornographic magazines and looked up at the glowering deer head on his wall, the bones that were scattered about his trailer, like he was at the Texas Chainsaw Massacre House. When I would go there with the benzo diazepines that I'd stolen from my mom's drawer to trade for weed, he wasn't telling me dosages. He wasn't telling me anything, except that this is good shit, man, makes your brain feel like tapioca. My bravado and passion aside, Michael Pollan, I'm sorry if it seems like I'm defaming you here. I think you're brilliant, come on my podcast. Humiliate me with your intellect. I'll weep, I'll apologize, I'll roll over, be a yellow belly. But man, this is the time for celebration, not the time to regurgitate the shit we've been hearing ever since those dumb commercials. This is your brain, this is your brain on drugs, any question, that shit. We've been hammered with this kind of paranoia for too long, Mr. Dr. Michael Pollan, my lovely, lovely, lovely man. It's time for some positivity. It's time to focus on the good side of psychedelics. It's time to focus not on the incredibly, infatessimally small percentage of people who have adverse reactions to these chemicals, but to the majority of humans who at the very least had a great time at a show. But some of whom have had completely transformative experiences using psychedelics not under the eye of some doctor, using psychedelics not sold under some weird fucking name by a pharmaceutical company making billions of dollars off of them, but using psychedelics in the comfort of their homes among their friends with no scientists around to help. It's time to focus on that. I love scientists because of you, my child, because of science, my baby is okay. He had jaundice and we had to put him under those lights. That's science. I love science and I'm excited about all the research that's happening. I'm so excited for my friends at MAPS who've been working so hard to do research on MDMA and the way it treats PTSD. I'm so excited for all the scientists who are some of them putting their careers on the line to explore psychedelics. And I'm very excited about your book, but we don't need to pump the brakes on legalizing psychedelics. We need to accelerate towards the legalization of psychedelics and most drugs for that matter. We need to regulate, we need to tax, and we need to use that money for drug treatment programs, which actually work to help people free themselves from addiction, as opposed to prisons, which I'm sure you're aware, are not necessarily the best place to go if you're struggling with inner demons. So that's my fucking Sean Hannity Tucker Carlson, Rachel Maddow, feels good, feels good. I'm sure Michael Pollan's an incredible person. Forgive me, I got a little blustery there. I feel very passionate about this. Friends, we have a wonderful podcast for you today. East Forest, is here with us? We're gonna jump right into it, but first some quick business.

He has produced so many cool, ambient, electronic, spiritual albums that I can't name them all. Most recently, he has gotten into a project with Ramdas and is producing these beautiful tracks, one of which you can hear at the end of this episode. He has a, I believe, five hour album called Music for Mushrooms that is designed for a mushroom experience. And I was lucky enough to get to see him perform live at the Ramdas retreat.

I am so grateful to you for taking the time to do this here in Hawaii, where we could see this beautiful beach right in front of us waiting. Does this win the record for Best View while podcasting? I don't know. I mean, these days, you know. You don't know? I'm sure someone's like podcasted from the top of the Eiffel Tower. Oh yeah, this is the best view. This is bananas. This is bananas, yeah. This fills me with a great deal of joy, and I was looking out the other day completely stoned. And I had this wonderful, you know, sometimes you get good paranoia when you're stoned. Pronoia, as it's called. That was Rob Brezny-Noyah. But yeah, I was thinking, wait, when you get in an airplane, you don't really spend the whole time looking out the windows. How easy would it be to trick people into thinking there was a lot of locations in their life when it's just like the whole thing's a big government experiment? You get on the airplane, they project sky in, and then they land you. Because I'm thinking, like, this is mostly where I go when I'm vacationing. And then I was like, holy shit, what if this is some badass MK Ultra stuff? And then I thought. Well, they did a good job. Yeah, they did a great job. I mean, if this is being asleep, I might take it. Well, it is, isn't it? Do you pay much attention to the, Ram Dass kind of talked about it in this, well, he didn't talk about it. He's saying, row, row, row your boat. Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy. Yeah, but you know that song, the lullaby? Yeah. Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream. Do you ever think like, holy shit, this can't be my life, I'm a brilliant? This week I felt that. Yeah. But you know when people tell me that life is a dream, I don't know about you, it actually pisses me off. Because life, to me, does not feel like a dream. It feels like really real. And I feel like when people say that, it discounts the suffering going on or the shit we have to go through. And that can't, you just came up actually in the podcast you guys were doing up there and that you brought up, and I was talking to Pete Holmes about this yesterday on the beach before everybody left, about we keep talking about remembering, right? And you're kind of hearing me in this space of falling back in, but in order to fall back in, you have to fall out, otherwise you can't fall back in. And so sort of forgetting like that other side of it, forgetting is equally important. It's the grist for the mill, it's the engine of like all this spiritual stuff in a way. And we can't push that away. I mean, it's actually totally necessary. Yeah, right, it's like, this is the phenomena of the compartmentalization of states of like, I guess what you could call sacred states and profane states. And so people, everyone has their own idea of like, okay, when I'm at a spiritual retreat or when it's the morning and I'm meditating, this is a sacred space. But when I'm at the bar or when I'm pissed off in traffic or whatever your particular fucking thing is, this is a profane state and the two are completely separate. And these days, I think it's just like a, it's some kind of defense mechanism because people don't wanna deal with the fact that the entire thing is sacred and profane and the two things are- Yeah, you can't escape it. Right, no escape. There's no way to separate them really. And some people feel a panic about that because they want this idea of like, oh, there's a, I can burrow into this particular hole and be sedated. I can burrow into this place and be no longer forced into some kind of encounter with a divine, which for a lot of people is really initially kind of scary and not necessarily what you consider comfortable. Yeah, but that comes from that same place of running from something, which we all do in our own ways or some kind of pain that you're going away from. It's like people chase God in their own way without even knowing it. It might be Monday night football, might be heroin, it might be a Ram Dass retreat. Sometimes it's a little more eyes wide open, but you could, I mean, if you've taken any psychedelic or gone into any of these sort of states where all that breaks down, all of it sort of rouse in a way. It's just ways to kind of ease your pain that you're not with God, maybe. Well, I mean, that's kind of the thing. One of the ideas is that the ignorance is painful and the quality of ignorance is it hurts because you want to find an actual nipple. Like, you know, my baby, he wants a nipple. When he's sucking on my thumb, as he does sometimes, it's because he's hungry. He's like, this blows. This blows, when does the milk come out of this thing? Yeah, it does it, but, and it would be disastrous for him if you didn't have a way to tell the difference between the two. Right. I think in our case, it makes me think of that Bhagavad Gita verse. The person who's attached to the flowery words of the scripture is like he who drinks water from a well when it flows everywhere. And say that again. The person who drinks water. He who is attached to the flowery words of the scriptures is like a person who drinks water from a well when it flows everywhere. And so in this case, the flowery words of the scriptures are the sacred place for this person. And everything else or certain other things are like, oh no, that's kind of where God fucked up. You know, like the scriptures are gray, but you know, the garbage heap, that God fucked up at the garbage heap. Well, it's too hard also to wrap your head around. It's like why it's hard to see the density of the violence and suffering and think like, how does this work? You know, why? It's too hard to look at. It really is. If you really look, it overwhelms you. And I think that's a difficult thing to wrap your head and heart around. Do you think that you maybe experience that level of empathy or compassion more than other people because your entire life seems to be orbiting or centered around this process of bringing music into the world that as you said in an interview, acts as a kind of guiding stone or potentially could help people reacquaint themselves with something outside of the material universe. You think maybe you've developed a- I know I was born sensitive. Okay. And that's like my greatest asset and my greatest weakness. I think I've told this story that I feel like first grade, I did pretty well up until six years old. I remember life being really good. And then I walked into school, which is total public school, normal school like desks. And I walked in and I looked around and I said, no thank you, not for me. And I left, I just left. Wow. And of course they bring you back, they force you to go. Yes, they do. And I had a really hard time just fitting into that system. It was hard. Did you stay through all of high school? Yeah, yeah. And they really broke me. Like I really just bought in hook, line, and sinker. Like, okay, I have to get good grades. I have to do this. This is the way through the usual thing. You know, I used to want to be a doctor. I said, okay, I need to be a doctor. Oh yeah, right. You know, I didn't do that thing. Did you have an inkling that you would become a musician or were you interested in music? I didn't think I'd do it as a profession ever, but I was always doing music. It's mostly in school, actually, public schools. I did a lot of great choirs and bands and musicals, all that stuff, lots and lots of music. But never was I thinking I would be a musician. I was kind of a late start. So I was doing music. Actually, I was just doing a podcast with this guy, Brian Cook, who's in the band Blitz and Trapper. You ever heard that band? Yeah. Yeah, he's the drummer. They're great. So we went to high school together. Wow. And we haven't talked in like 20 years. Whoa, that's so weird. Where, what high school? It's called Sprague High School. It's like a public high school in Oregon. Salem, Oregon. Yeah. And I was just kind of thinking about it. I was like, you know, Brian, you were in the first band ever. So like you guys brought in a cassette. I thought that was like so badass. And I didn't even know like how bands made music or like what they did. And at the time, I didn't, I had no concept of like, how to even connect the dots if I even wanted to do that. And then actually the way I started making music was totally a child of the digital revolution because in 2001 is right when like the first M-Box and stuff came out. Like the first kind of like you could do it on your iMac and make music. Yeah. And my, I had inherited $2,000 from my grandmother's passing. Thank you, Baba. And I didn't know what to do with it. And I was going to buy a motorcycle. I didn't know how to ride motorcycles. But I was like, this is, this is a smart decision in New York City to buy a motorcycle, right? It's totally safe. You can park. That was my thinking. You can park anywhere. You can get right through traffic. It's a smart deal. So I, on eBay, I found this motorcycle. It's a Yamaha Vulcan, which is a pretty decent size bike. Didn't know how to ride, was bidding on it and thinking like, I guess if I win, I'll just like figure it out and write it down. It was the dumbest thing on earth. And I got to the last few seconds of the bidding and some guy snatched it out, bit it. So I didn't win. I was kind of crushed. So instead, I said, I guess I'll take this two grand and I'll get some of this music stuff. And I called up, I think it was a store at Sweetwater, which, and I still talk to this engineer there, who's a sales engineer or whatever. And he sold me an M-Box and some, you know, basic mic. Actually, it was this mic, this Sennheiser. No shit. Yeah, it was this one of these, I believe. And I started making music under my little loft in my little studio in Soho and it sucked. Totally sucked. What did it feel like when you started doing that? Oh, it was a blast. I mean, like, as you know, it's just fun. And since then, I've probably made like 25, 30 records since then. And as you do in life, you just get better. As you do, you learn by doing. I do. And I just got slightly better and over time until one day only, it wasn't until recently that I was like, because I'm self taught like as a mixing engineer too. And I finally was like, I think, I mean, there's way more to learn. But I think I kind of have an approach that I like versus like, I'm just trying to make it sound good. Right. Yeah, right. So you, yeah. And that, there's an exhilarating feeling that goes along with it. Cause there, you know. You must have felt that with comedy. Yes. There must have been a turning point you might have seen in the rear view mirror. I think actually it was like two years ago, I started to feel more confident. Sure. Yeah. Well, this is the learning curve, you know, and there are, this is why like in martial arts, the belt system kind of makes sense. Yeah. Because you do, like it's like there is a recognized kind of a series of degrees or levels that seem to go along with any endeavor that involves learning. And certainly with music, there are these points where you feel like, oh shit, I, oh wow. I think I do kind of understand this. For me, music has been mystifying. And I never once in a million years thought I would start trying to make music. I've loved music. I love listening. But never in a million, musical notation. I have musician friends and the way they listen to music is different from the way, but all of it has seemed like almost a completely alien landscape. When you started getting good, what better, better, better. How good is your, that's so cool. Improving, I should say, yeah. Learning more skills. Yes. But there is a commonality between people I know who are brilliant at their particular craft. They all are humble. They, I've yet to run. Oh, cause it's like so much more, it just never ends. It's like, oh my God. But when were you like, okay, I'm gonna go and do a live show. I'm gonna like book myself somewhere and go in front of people. That never was hard for me. I immediately put myself out and embarrassed myself. What? It wasn't so hard to do the live shows. It's more hard just to get better. I did, I had some really ridiculous experiences, live, wise, you know, especially in New York City. I used to do like just regular old bands, you know? Yeah. And played in all the clubs down there in the Lower East Side, all around, all sorts of ridiculous. I got pulled off stage. I've had the power go out and I sang on like a chair. You got pulled off stage. Unfortunately, that was actually more recently. Yeah. It was, it was horrific. Where was this? It was in Oregon. I was playing a show in Grant's Pass, was it? Klamath Falls. Somewhere, it was a, let's say a conservative crowd. Okay. I was opening for a friend of mine named Crystal Bowersock. She's a dear friend. She was on American Idol in like 20, in the heyday. She's the runner up. Wow. So she, and she's still, that made her career. I mean, it's like 10 million people who saw that. Jesus Christ. And a lot, half of them were rooting for her. So she's, I love Crystal. She's amazing. Amazing voice. Like one of those people who sings like, it's just water coming out of them. You know, just can sing anything. So she was, she, she's just cool. She's like, do you want to open for me on a few dates? Which isn't maybe a natural fit, right? And I was like, of course. And so we're doing the show with a conservative audience, old people, TV people. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I'm doing my thing. And I'm feeling like they're paying attention. I was like, these people are actually, over and over again, I'd see people really, they'd resonate, they'd get it, they liked it. But the promoter, whoever, you know, he thought this should be country or it needs to be this or it needs to be that. He's freaking out. Cause he's projecting what their experience is. And he's off stage doing like, you know, cutting the throat thing. And like, and I thought there was like a fire or something. You know, like making all these gestures, like 20 feet away. And so I was like, all right folks, well, I think, you know, we need to end the show and thank you very much. And I get off stage like, what's the problem? And he's like, they're just not into this, man. They're not into it. I was like, are you kidding me? I only play for 30 minutes and you cut me short. It's like, how dare you? And then afterwards, of course, I met like these seven year old ladies and stuff. And they were just like, that was really interesting. You know, what is that? How can I get your music? And they're getting, they're feeling it. Yeah. He just didn't want to go there. He didn't want to open himself up to something new and different. Well, this is, do you, it was crushing as a, as just, as like, you know, just me as a performer, that was, that's hard. I'm sensitive to that stuff. Well, and also rejection at that level is like, they say it affects a different part of the brain that the normal pain, like it's actually, it's, there's some kind of like tribal thing where, cause if you're rejected from the tribe, you're going to die. So that kind of like performance level rejection, even from some neurotic, and you're already in a support role and putting yourself out there. And it's not, it's vulnerable to go. I'm sure you've done this in comedy where you're trying to play for an audience that's you've got to fight to win them over. And have not won them over. And it's scary. I mean, I respect you guys for like, you guys practice doing that all the time. All the time. Man. And drunk people. Horror stories. Horror stories. Drunk people are the worst. Or, you know, the thing with comedy, stand-up comedy is, maybe this has changed a little bit, is that people just assume that all stand-up comedy is the same. So they'll just go to a comedy club and imagine like, ah, the guy, they're going to make, he's going to make me laugh. But they don't realize that some comedians have very, very different political and metaphysical sensibilities. So yeah. But do you think that one of the problems is that you are bringing spirituality into your music? Oh yeah. And for a lot of people, this is completely not cool. Like, in fact, you're one of the- Which is so weird, you know, I'm not proselytizing anything. No. All I'm really putting out there is like, just relax. And maybe something will emerge inside you that's already there, that's universal. I'm not even, I mean, it may be more lately in these ceremony concerts I'm doing, it's a bit more overt. But it's still, it always goes back to, this is about you having a felt experience. There's nothing you can argue with in this. I'm not, there's no buzzword. There's no like, flying dolphins or Jesus that. Nothing. Yeah. It's just about, you know, take a breath. What do you notice? It could be a feeling, it could be a word. Hold on to that for a second. Next song, you know. Yeah. Write what's coming up down. Okay, you know, it's just walking people through something they could, because that's what I want. I want it to be something that builds a bridge. I don't want it as preach to the choir. I want to do something that's universal and that speaks to that core human experience that we all share. Yeah, and you, from the songs that I have listened to, you do have many, many albums. I was obviously, I didn't have time. I would have to spend like a week. Disappointed Duncan. I'm sorry. I was like, I didn't do it. But from the songs I did listen to, which are beautiful. Thanks. Thank you. One of the things I was impressed about is that you don't fall into the trap that it seems like a lot of spiritual music falls into of being didactic, right? There's sense of there being an agenda or a feeling of like. Or bad music. Bad music. Sorry. I'm not trying to put anyone in that category, but a lot of it, I feel like they could work a lot harder on the music side. Because it's like, there's a lot out there these days. And for us, we're inside the same system, all of us as artists. It's like, you should be working hard. You should be making interesting art. You should be on the cutting edge. Don't be lazy just because, oh, this is spiritual or something. So no, no, no. I play in a lot of yoga festivals. They, I get a lot of bookings in that world. And I'm a black sheep. You know, I had some guy come up to me a couple years ago. He's like, I love what you're doing. He's one of the musicians. He says, you know, if you just put in some more mantra into your music, you get a lot more bookings. Oh, wow. I was like, that's the worst advice I've ever heard in my life. Basically, he's saying, if you just pander a bit more, they book you more. And I was like, then maybe I won't get booked. Because it's like, I want to create something that isn't speaking to a lower common denominator, but one that's sort of new. And it creates a new spiritual language for our ears, our Western ears. And it's just, I don't know, I want cool music. And also, when you run into that place that is just, it's kind of unavoidable, I guess. It is unavoidable. But there is that, what you just told me, I mean, it does sound like that person who came up to you was Lucifer, potentially. You know, it sounds like something, listen, let's commodify mantras. I have an idea. Is it in the back room, yeah? Yeah, you could. If you just say these three words in your songs. Yeah. You'll be rich. Yeah, yeah. And the, you know what to do. This is one of the weird aspects of the circuit that you're on, I guess, is that it is a spirituality circuit. And it is people who are on a journey. And it is people who are trying to expand. But also, you do run head on into the wall of commodification of spiritual materialism. And I bet you've had some pretty weird experiences. I came into the yoga world, not as a yogi, for instance. And first off, the circuit that I am part of, I spent a lot of time trying to reach beyond that circuit. The whole point of this Ram Dass record was to reach people beyond the circuit. Right. Right, so it's like, I'm happy. I'm totally happy and grateful to have people listen to the music and support my livelihoods so I can make more music. And that largely comes from things like this or the wellness world, really, which has been exploding in the last decade. Yeah. And I want to use that energy to expand into these other areas so that we're reaching new, fresh ears. Look, it's just, I feel we're all, if we're in service of our gifts, each of us, whatever those unique gifts are, there usually is a level of an active service in that. This podcast for you is part of that. Yes. OK. This is right in line with your gifts, and it's been blossoming and folding in a way that you now are in an active service by doing it. And you enjoy it because it's part of your gifts. Right, yeah. And so when we're in that sweet spot or we find those ways to kind of follow our bliss in the Joseph Campbell way, it's a really good sign. And it's a good sign that you're on your path. And so, yeah, I just want to feel that it's not that I feel like, oh, we need to turn these people under our team. It's like there's no team. It's just I want to help ease the suffering that I feel to. I really do. And so often I find that if I'm creating a chord progression or a song that's soothing that part of my own pain, nine times out of 10, that's a universal pain that's going to soothe someone else. That's so cool. On the podcast, anytime I'm having an epiphany from a conversation, I think, oh, that's, I know that's like other people listening are like, holy shit, what is that? And that is the, you know, what is it that Dalai Lama says? My religion is kindness. And yeah, perfect. Perfect. That's perfect. And that is the religion. And where things start sucking is where they get people forget that that's the underlying principle. And then they get attached to the flowery words. And then suddenly the flowery words become. It's an identity. What's that? An identity, in a way. An identity, yeah. And when you run into people who are the greatest teachers, they don't really have an identity. And you might hang out with them. And they might not mention anything spiritual. Did you talk to Charles Eisenstein recently? Yes, I did. He's someone I've come across and run circles with for many years. Love him. Love him. And he too. Way back, actually, I almost can blame him for where I live now in southern Utah, because in 2008 there was a retreat that he was speaking at, this tiny little retreat in Boulder, Utah, a town of 200 people. And I went because I just read his book, The Ascent to Humanity. One of his, this thing is like a second book. It's a really thick book that takes us through, like, the Stone Age when we lit the first fire to today and how we've been on this, like, trajectory where going through numbers and language and agriculture and everything and how that was a necessary path that we're on to get where we're going. But anyway, when I met him, what I liked the most about him is that he walked his talk. Like, he was. I was like, oh, you're embodying everything you write about. You're not some fraud. And sometimes you meet writers, and it's kind of a letdown. Yeah, they wrote something inspiring, which is awesome. But they're not really at the place you wish they would be. That's right. And so he's been that way. And he's not someone that goes into the metaphysical. Not that often. But the metaphysical folks love him because he's still speaking to this experience that's his gift. And he was able to put into words a lot of things I had always felt. He was able to connect the dots in a way that helped me say, well, those are dots I've always felt, but you are able to finally do it for me. In the same way you on your podcast can bring a sense of humor to certain things that people feel that in them, but they don't have the skill to kind of create that humor. All of us sort of singing the song, we each can't maybe sing the part we can't sing. That's right. Well, that's a chorus, isn't it? And the other thing is that the music that we're singing to is always changing. And it's based on a, I love this. Once I had this idea of, whoa, it's like in every millisecond, God is completely deconstructed and reconstructed, meaning that if there were words people were saying 100 years ago, that was for a God that died a long, long time ago, and since is reformed and reformed so many times, which is, I think, the present moment stuff is like listen to the music now, not the music that was playing back then, and sing to that music, and also have the guts to completely change yours tune because you know the music has changed, instead of just sticking to the old stale rendition that's been going around, the top 40 stuff, you know? It's that, and Eisenstein is doing that, and any, but that is the idea, coming up with what the iteration of the thing is now. And when you do that, that's what's going to help the most. I mean, what, it would be like, if we're going to go back in time, let's say, which would be a terrible mistake, probably, and we wanted to go to America in the 30s, but we were using the vernacular today, people would be like, what the fuck are you talking about? None of what you're saying makes sense. I don't know half of the words that you're saying. You would have to learn their vernacular, and in the same way if they came here, and were speaking in that way, it would seem bizarre, and whatever their message was might be diluted somewhat by their, just the cultural shit tied into their language, so similarly, what you're doing seems to me, is though you're tuning into what's happening now, and you're not getting fucking so stumbled by language because you have music instead. Well, you know, that's the one thing I think is cool about music, is that, you know, sometimes you say something or write something and you look back 10 years, like what an ass I was, why did I believe that? And then I think about everything I say now, and like, am I just going to think that in 10 years? Like, I try to be careful with anything I'm too strong about in my beliefs, but music sort of transcends language, and it goes straight to the emotional center, and I like to create music that has a sense of timelessness to it. I wanted to do that with particularly the Ram Dass record, not do something that was too trendy, because I wanted it to last, and I wanted it to something that can speak to someone, both not just the words he says, but the music behind it isn't going to feel like, well, we're not there anymore, like it's that sound of the 2019 or whatever. I'm so glad you pulled it off too, because one of the things that usually just frustrates the shit out of me, man, is like, when I'm on YouTube, and I'm like, oh, I just want to listen to some Terrence McKenna lecture. Oh, God, it's like the other music line. You're like, yeah, it's some son of a bitch. Yes, yes, somebody put like some awful side trance behind it, and you're like. It's like a dentist making music with a machine or something. Yes. It's like, we just want to hear in. But you and Beretta have both pulled off something that's amazing, which is like, instead of having music that is overwhelming or trying to italicize parts of what the teacher's saying, it just is like harmonizing with it. And that, I think, is very difficult. I hope it makes it more accessible for people, particularly who are not familiar with Ram Dass. Yeah. Because I think for a lot of the faithful of Ram Dass, for them, they might prefer just to hear a talk. I'm like, great, go hear a talk. And it's like, you can't please everyone. But I was making this to sort of like, how can we enliven this work and make it more approachable? It's like a film score, because the music creates an energy and a feeling to what he's saying. And so it's just amplifying. That's right. And sort of like if a movie without sound or without music is not as emotional. How did that come about, that album? The project? Yeah, the project. It's more than one album. Well, it's going to be one album, August 9th, 2019. But it's coming out in four parts to sort of break it up as we go, because they're like little micro teachings. Gotcha. So two chapters are out. Chapter three is on June 21st, is Solstice. And chapter four, which is the whole 14-track album, is August 9th. And you went to hang out with him to record that? Yeah, yeah, about 10. It was in last June. And I just pitched the idea to Raghu. And we had met because I did his podcast. And it was one of these things where I had a publicist, which was his brother, for a different record thing, different series going on. And we just weren't getting a lot of traction. And then I remember the one thing I got was this podcast with Raghu. And I was like, it's your brother. Like, that was the one thing we get, you know? And I was like, oh, whatever. So we do the podcast, and it was great. And I got to meet Raghu, it's on Skype or whatever. And through that, we kind of got to know each other. Cool. And so we had some mutual friends in the Sangha, so to speak, of musicians. And he went to India, he came back, and I had this idea. And I just pitched the idea of doing a record with Ramdas. And why I thought I would be a good person to do it. And to his credit, he green-lit it. Yeah. Oh, he loves what you did. Well, it took a little convincing. I mean, there's been a lot of help. No, he was so excited about it. And that's great, because Raghu just doesn't mince words when it comes to life. No, he does not. Yeah, I love the man. I love the man. And I had convinced him to let me come out. And this was a beautiful moment, too, because I was going to dig through the archives. There's 50,000 hours of Ramdas talking. 50,000 hours. I didn't even know where to start. I mean, I've heard a lot of those. But I just, every field recording I've made in my East Forest music, of other music, whether it's field recordings of nature, or people talking, or whatever, is all stuff that I've recorded. So it felt like stuff that's come to me in my life. And sort of like, look, you can paint with these colors, but not all the colors. And that always makes better art when I think it's like, just use these. You mean limitation. Limitation, exactly, exactly, yeah. So I said, I think it'd be better if I could record him. I know that's a big ass, because if I were him, he'd be like, look, bro, I'm 87 at the time. Just please, I'm tired. I can tell the same stories. But Ramdas said yes immediately, of course, because he's rad. And the guy's like, I want to keep teaching. And Rogo, I said, look, if I'm going to do an entire record around this man's work and legacy, I feel on a minimum I need to look him in the eye, just soul to soul, which I've never done at the time. And just so we say, like, this is happening. And I just weave now, you know? And he said, you're right, you're right. So he set it up. And I flew all the way out here. And I didn't know where he lived. I didn't know anything. I just had a date I was supposed to show up. And I didn't know if he'd be sick. I didn't know anything. Maybe it wouldn't even work. So it showed up. And I walked in and set up my stuff. And I asked him some questions. And he just went off. And I mean, it was beyond perfection. Because he talks with pauses because of his aphasia from a stroke 20 years ago. So he might take 30 minutes to say an answer to a question about dark thoughts or something. And then when I would go back and take out the pauses to see what I had, it would be like one minute with literally the perfect poetry with this beautiful opener, like mastery of speech. And it was sort of like that Robin Williams movie where people come alive from the old movie where they're like, he's a doctor. And they can't speak. They're like festivals. And then they also can throw a ball. He teaches in the singing and dancing. Awakenings or something. Awakenings. Yeah. All of a sudden, I mean, Romdoss is very awake. But I realize not only is he awake, he's like fully a master inside that we don't always see because we're busy with our brains going faster. That's right. It blew my mind. This guy is at the top of his game. Yeah. Funny, poetic, and deep. And speaking to these things that are going on now, we talked about technology. We talked about the suicides going on and stuff. And I felt like it brought a sense of relevancy to his work. Now he's 88 when this is going to be coming fully out. And we don't have a lot of wisdom in our culture. We push that aside in American culture particularly, especially if it's old. But when you hear it, you hear the age. And I think what resonates with people, especially who don't even know what they're listening to, they just hear wisdom. And it brings them in. They lean into that. And they're like, who is this? Why is this touching me? And they want to know more. And then they go down the rabbit hole. That's great. Tell me your philosophy of music and magic. Like, yeah. Like sigil magic. No, I mean, I know that there's a saying that, depending on the person, one person can say, be kind to everyone. And it means nothing. In fact, they can actually feel like they slapped you or something. It can feel like they're judging you or some shit. You need to be kind. Then another person can say, be kind to everyone. As I've heard people like Chogyam Trumpa or Ram Dass. And for some reason, it passes whatever the spiritual blood brain barrier is that keeps us from taking in wisdom seeds. Do you think that whatever that may be, that energetic thing that is beneath the language or in the language or, I don't know. Do you think that can get picked up by microphones and transmitted through speakers? I do. Some people, I think, who are purists about, yeah, that the music has to come from the bowl versus a recorded Tibetan bowl. But the thing about language, all of this is just mouth sounds that we're producing with these vocal chords. It's sound. Music is sound. It's encoded into the big bang. That's how the universe starts. The sound, that's how even in the Western science says, which is like, I love that Terence McKenna line. It's like, look, just give us one miracle, and we can run with it. We're cool. We need one miracle, that everything came out of nothing for no reason, and it's exploded. And then we can have all of science. You can figure out the rest. But we need that. Whoa, that's pretty cool. But it is, and it's also in the Bible, God spoke. It's the first thing, God spoke. And then everything began. So I think it's all around us. It's like asking one of these turtles what water is. It just is what is. And we're at a time right now where music is the most pervasive it's ever been on, probably the history of the planet. Probably. And it's getting bigger every day, and projected to double triple in the next five years with India and China, and it's everywhere. And if you say sound, like even this podcast, it's just all around us swimming in our lives. And it's always been that way. And the womb, the first thing to develop is your ear. Yeah, well, the first organ of sense. And so what are you going to hear? The first four on the floor. Yeah, why do you think that's such a big deal? Like house music, drum beat. Why is a drum beat and shamanism, everyone starts to rattle or a drum beat, because it entrains your brain? Probably because we're used to that. It's the first thing. And you hear the, you're in, I am Neonic Clute, you're in water. So I mean, sound, I think we actually discount and don't credit its true power. And I'm not even someone on the full end of the spectrum saying like, my sound healing predilections are more like good music and emotional sensibilities. And I look at what the science, what we know, and also what people have done for a long time. But as you know, there are people who are like, 528 frequency does this and so far as you have that. And I'm like, we could go down that whole thing if we wanted to. But my point is that they're tapping into the fact that yes, I think sound in general in music, there's a lot more to it that we don't. And we can use it as a weapon. Okay, DARPA, they have weapons of sound to explode things and we use it as a means of torture to make people go nutty. We play the country music really loud to the detainees. Also David Koresh, they played like music. Yes. And then they just lit them on fire. And then they, yeah, set them ablaze. All those kids in there, they're playing like rat, the sounds of rabbits dying, mixed in with like. I mean, it's crazy. It's trash. It's crazy. And I also then think about people who are deaf and like that whole trip, but Beethoven. Right. You know? Right. So music thinking, it's not just about what you hear. No, it's like there's some level of sound that is still encrypted and we're not really quite sure. There's like, definitely seems to be some data set in music that we are decoding with our hearts and not our minds. And it is pressure waves. Like it is a physical thing. And it's pressure. Yeah, that's right. It is a physical thing. You feel bass. Yes. I mean, your whole body and your chest. Yeah. Yeah. I think Terence McKenna, I remember back when it was at True Hallucinations, the one where he talks about going to the Amazon, they spent like two weeks just doing sounds with their mouths. They felt like that was the doorway as they were tripping nonstop. Or DMT, a lot of people hear like this high pitch sound that's kind of like increasing, increasing. And you go through sort of a barrier. Yes. Well, this brings me to something I wanted to talk to you about and I'm excited that you're doing it. I guess like the... I just noticed a pin on your hat. Nice pin. Thanks, man. I didn't even see that. You guys, you have fantastic art associated with your music, man. I love this pin. East Forest pin. I'm a fan. I should probably shout out the artist. Yeah. Michael Robinson did the original Nautilus and James Warloid did that pin. Oh, cool. Yeah. So, I don't know if you read about this or not, but they found a pouch. Did you read about this? A pouch? They found a pouch. Who's they and what's a pouch? You didn't hear? They found a fucking pouch, man. It's a beautiful pouch. Like the original Bag of Weed. They found a pouch made of fox noses that's a thousand years old that had ayahuasca in it. Come on. And it's the oldest. How did they find this? They found it in like, I think it was like in my suitcase. Like I mean. They have an Instagram account because I really want to follow them. They're always the ones. They know everything they say. They're incredible. You gotta meet them sometime. But you know, I don't know. Some anthropologist or whatever. Some, someone out in Peru, I think. But the implication is amazing and we know, no one knows how far back ayahuasca goes or the ceremony surrounding mushrooms. But one of the things they do have in common is music, drums and a shaman who is using the technology of music to guide people, to heal people, to like help protect people. And so it's pretty amazing that you have made, how long is it? A six hour? Five. Five hour, a five hour, I don't know, do you call it an album? If it's five hours? It's an album, yeah. A five hour album to guide people through a psilocybin experience. And so I want to talk to you about that. But before getting into the music part, what are your theories on guiding trips on like being guided through a trip? I've always had a kind of a scatter shot approach to psychedelics and I have yet to be guided through an actual experience. So I wonder if you can. Oh really? Yeah. So if you've not done ayahuasca, worked at ayahuasca, because it's always in the container of a ceremony, which is an interesting thing about that drug is that it's not divorced itself from the ceremony. Well. Nobody parties with ayahuasca. Wow. No other drug is like that. That's cool. So it comes with it a lineage of music, the acaroas songs, which they define them as the technology of the main thing. Like that's what's calling forth the spirits, that's what's guiding it. They are our chemical, these songs, these melodies, and they do them, that's why they do them. Psyllocybin, on the other hand, for instance, doesn't have that. It did have some ceremonial lineage in Mexico that we know about, but it certainly didn't travel with it to the States. Right. And we don't have, well just for all intents and purpose, it doesn't have that. That's the case with most Western use of psychedelics, besides ayahuasca. And conversely, historically, all indigenous use, almost all, used music as a central vehicle for the ceremony, the central piece of, the central tool, even like a Lakota sweat lodge, they're singing songs, and this is not obviously probably just because this is fun or that's the way to pass the time. It's actually the way to work with the brain and the way to work with the medicine and the way to work with your consciousness. And I think they figured something out a long time ago about set and setting, about you need to feel safe and you need to feel comfortable in order to have a positive experience, which doesn't necessarily mean it's not challenging, but positive. Right. And so, I wanted to create something with psilocybin because I have a relationship to that compound, which we could get into, but there isn't anything out there. And as you know with like Michael Pollan's new book. Yeah. And that's just sort of an example of the changing cultural winds that are happening more recently, where it's really starting to happen. It's in Colorado on the ballot right now. That's today. Today, there you go. And California, it's the next wave. The FDA fast-tracked psilocybin as a breakthrough therapy status for depression. Wow. And I gotta hand it to them. I mean, I don't know that a lot of the details of that other than that happened, but it's like, I think they actually say like we, this is an epidemic. Yes. And what do we do? That's right. And so there's, this is all happening in John Hopkins, NYU, the Imperial College of London. There's been more research happening over the last decade. And I looked at the music that they're using, because they publish publicly the playlist of their music. And I know a lot of that music, but none of it was written for psilocybin. Right. It just happens to work for psilocybin. And they cobble together these things. And they do research on it. And people are having positive experiences, but I think it could be even more. And I had my own research going on that was just sort of in the shadows for 10 years. And I've been developing this music and this protocol. When you say research. Cats coming out of the back. We, it doesn't have to come out of the back of people. It's okay. No, it's okay. So the research you did was, I'm imagining. Guiding people. Guiding people. Yeah. How, what is the size of the groups that you would work with? I don't like it to be any larger than 20, because it just feels like it's too much energy. It's too big. There's a responsibility there. It's the hardest thing I've ever done, but the most rewarding thing. And this is playing music for people who are moving through the experience. Correct. And so this record music for mushrooms, a soundtrack for the psychedelic practitioner is from that space. And so it's live. Wow. Wow. So it's coming from the energy of that space. And if I wanted to play that again, I'd have to like learn it from recordings. I don't know. You know what I mean? Yeah. And so you're hearing something be birthed. And I think that's also interesting too. This is a little more metaphysical, but the music is imbued with the energy of the psilocybin because it's coming literally from, it's springing from that space. What is that space? What is that space? Yeah, I certainly don't know. I certainly don't pretend to understand it. But it's sort of like the energy of Maharajee or the energy of nature. The energy of all these energies that we are part of, but is like putting your finger in the electric socket of the highway of the universe. And all these different compounds get you to a different highway perhaps, whether it's DMT or LSD. But psilocybin is just one that early on seemed to become an ally for me. Not that I do it that often. It's more just like it's been a supporter of my, it's been assisting me. The music I made 10 years ago starting this was literally just how do I do this? So I thought, well, I guess I'll loop. I guess I'm gonna do, it's gonna be probably slower and more long-formed because that helps with people's experience. And I was bringing in these nature sounds that I recorded because everyone knows nature is really wonderful on psilocybin. These are all ways to soothe you and let you go safer to go inside and go on this experience and ultimately have a more profound spiritual experience. And that seems to be a lot of the juju for folks when they're having something positive out of this in these studies where they rate it being one of the top spiritual experiences of their life. Up there with like the birth of a child or the death of a parent. And they still felt that way years later. But I have a feeling it wasn't just a chemical thing. It was that spiritual aspect. So the idea of ceremony itself, I feel like is really important part of these protocols. It's not just about like a pharmaceutical can reproduce a psilocybin once the FDA says you can, you just take it like an antidepressant and it just changes things in your brain. I think it actually does. And that's what we need more research on because that could be these wonderful applications maybe for addiction and things. But I think that ceremonial aspect of like the experience that you have and that spiritual element is a lot of the healing. It's a psychological thing. Sure, I mean it can't just be. This is like the, I talk about this. I'm sorry if you guys have heard me yapp about this and I'll make it real quick. But in the Brothers Karamazov, there's this sort of I guess analysis of Saul of Tarsus being converted to Paul on the road to Damascus, completely blind, used to persecute Christians, has a vision, Jesus appears, says, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? And at that moment he's converted and becomes one of the great Christian missionaries. But Dostoevsky's analysis, which is Christian existentialism is like, well, if Jesus just touched Saul and he like changed, who gives a shit? It's like there's no nothing there that's worth anything. It's just like a magical act. Maybe human. Yeah, that's it. But he was saying what happened is that at that moment, this person had an opportunity to shift their consciousness, their soul identity in a way that made them no longer monstrous and they did it. And so this is I think the dance with any psychedelic. Is it's like, oh sure, look, here is your choice. I'm gonna show you a place you are weirdly familiar with that you've never seen before. I'm gonna show you the fact that the entire universe is teeming with entities that you up until now maybe haven't quite seen. I'm gonna show you, I'm gonna show you the darkness a little bit. It's like clogging and clotting up your ability to love. But then you gotta do something too, which is, and I think that's under the umbrella of integration, you know? But it is not a one-way street, thank God. It's not a panacea, it's not for everyone. And it's just one more tool we have on this planet. It happens to be a very powerful one, but it's one of many tools and it isn't for everyone. I'm not a believer that everyone needs to do this. I haven't even done it in a long time. Me either, I can't. And that's okay. I'm brutalized by the mushroom and the best way possible. But dude, I know, you know. You do know. Oh hell, well I can sympathize, I can imagine. Have you ever gotten a spanking from Mother Mushroom? Yes, most of the time it's been my fault, meaning like there was some level of like blindness or cavalierness or this or that or stupidity. There was one time I'm still confused. I kinda know why it happened on a dose level, but I was very prepared for a journey and I had support, but it was still, it kicked my ass in a way that I'm actually, to be honest, still traumatized from. And that level of respect that I have for is why I don't like to talk about it in a way that's saying like, it is very serious sober work. It really is. And the reason I made this music was not to say everyone needs to go out there and trip. It's like, no, it's like, if you're going to do this, I think this can help and make it so you don't have that experience that I had. I want you to feel safe and have powerful but gentle. That's great. Well, I mean, I think that's kind of the sad head shop culture that because of the prohibition maybe started surrounding mushrooms. It's like this ridiculous idea of like, it's silly sobbing, baby. You eat him and you just spend the whole time laughing at being floored to the wall. What you do is you take five dried grams and you laugh and laugh. Yeah, the five dried grams thing too is a story that I think is a little dangerous. I agree. I agree. I hear that a lot from people. Five dried grams. That's the way to do it, man. If you don't do that, you're not doing it right. I'm like, bullshit. Well, that is one of the weird, like as we're watching psychedelics become mainstream. Thank God. You're seeing all of these odd moments which in sort of like cultures emerging. And one of them that is fascinating is the sort of like approach to psychedelics that you might take to catapult workouts or something. Are you serious? Yeah, you know. To work out? No, not to literally work out. But I mean, people are like, I did ayahuasca 14 times in a row. Oh, no, I'm well aware of the scene of people who just keep diving in over and over and over again. And what's the, is it the Alan Watts? Who's the one who says pick up the phone, get the message and then hang up? Yeah, yeah. I used to say, well, Alan Watts was an asshole because like, dude, I wanted to talk with you a little bit more. I mean, I didn't want to just tell you like where we're going to have dinner. But I get it. And the main thing is, Well, what are you running from? You know, it's just like, Jesus, take a breather. It's like, you're getting high. I mean, some people I think, and also I see people like, they're not improving the way they're living their life as people walk on the walk. It's like, you're still an asshole. Like, I think it's going to help if you do it again and again and again. It's like, why don't you take a bit to just like, figure out, there's a reason why we're here doing this, just in normal waking life. That is the main meat. And it's like, it's set up for each of us perfectly. And how you're born and your journey and all your struggles. It's like, it's exactly what you need to handle and what you're able to handle. And if we, going into those realms to learn things and get perspective is extremely powerful and valuable. But always going into those realms, it just sort of starts to, it's very few people unless you're on the shaman path, that's what you're going to be doing. They're about the only ones who need to be doing that. That's right. Well, this is, to me, that there's some kind of strange corollary with the stories of people from Tibet going down into India to get the Buddhist teachings and the technology of spirituality that the realization that spirituality is a technology, that Buddhism or the systems that exist are very non-different from like the stuff we have that is materialized as computers, the internet, whatever. It's a technology. And so in the same way that people go and research technology all over the world and bring it back to their businesses, people are going and grabbing like the Buddhist teachings or the Hindu teachings or whatever. But similarly, I think as psychedelics become more mainstream, people are going to realize the DMT realm is a realm. The mushroom realm is a realm. And the idea is we're going there to gather these data, bits of data. And then the way that we transmit that data into this particular realm is through action and through right language. And from that, whatever that may be, and quite often it's not about, McKenna was good at it, but quite often it's not relating the dream that you had in there. It's starting a foundation. It's diving into a way of- Loving everyone, serving everyone, telling the truth. For real. Right? The teachings that we talked about this week, it's kind of where the rubber meets the road. It's like, what do you need to do on your spiritual journey? And it was the idea of feeding everyone. And maybe that is enough. It's like, it doesn't have to be so complicated. No. Just do your best and help other people. It's encoded in the golden rule of just do unto others as you would have due to yourself. It's like, if you want to feel happy, make someone else feel happy. That's it. It's just like, that's because it works. Trying to just feel happy, it's probably, it's very hard to do. And you want to, I mean, there's something to me that is, and I get why people are like, dude, that's fucked up. You don't ever want to say like, there's, you should honor the guru. And what I, and people hear that and are like, what do you mean, some fucking patriarchal thing? No, I mean, in this case, for a lot of people, the guru has become mushrooms. The guru has become DMT. The guru has become the visionary state. And if you are granted the presence of the divine and you're brave enough to recognize that when you had that download, it wasn't just like you were mashing an old school watch and making weird colors come out. You got the darshan of some kind of higher intelligence. And then you come back here. And I'm not saying you, therefore, you have to follow some ridiculous moral code or some bullshit. But if you are here and you're all puffed up and your ego's gotten out of control and you've decided you're the messiah, come to save the planet from being crooked. That happens, you know. It's one of the ways that so many people fall down is that. Then what ends up happening is instead, is people hear, the same thing happens, happens when there's a shitty spiritual teacher who gets caught fisting his fucking nanny or whatever. You know what I mean? It's like, if the spiritual teacher was some conduit and had some beautiful way of articulating some new way to be, that articulation gets completely tarnished by the action and the teacher's inability to manifest it through action. It would have been better for the teacher to not say anything. It's true. Fist the nanny. Yeah. You know, right? Just fist, yeah, don't say. Just fist. That speaks more. At least to the nanny. But you know what I'm saying? So it's like, I think as we learn more and more about what that terrain is and ways to go into it, like what you're exploring, then maybe there's gonna be more of a kind of like stability to that state so we can get better at really pulling the data from there into here. I think there will be over time. It's just gonna, we're really fighting a war of misinformation and there's an entropy happening, but it's gonna take time. It really will, man. I mean, God, we're so wild in this country. It's odd that in America, we have built into our constitution the pursuit of happiness. I mean, it's just written right there. I know. God damn it. You, that is your right. Yeah. To be happy and not go forth. Yeah. And in Canada, I think it's, I hope I don't get this wrong, is it's a peace, tranquility and good government. Is that what they say? Yeah. And then look at the energy of the country. Yeah. This is the energy of our country. And it's interesting. We sort of made a choice early on about what was important to us. And it comes with a lot of pain along the way. So I think we're kind of going through our machinations that we need to as a culture, almost like we're kids and we're starting to grow up and learn about what really brings happiness to us. Right. Well, I mean, and also when the pursuit of happiness is one of the first sort of, I don't know, one of the DNA strands or whatever in the American spirit. And there is an actual prohibition on the pursuit of happiness to the point where you can go to jail. Yeah. For this pursuit. It is true. It's not, it's lip service in a lot of ways. Well, and you're also forced to deal with the paradox of this insanity, which is that, oh shit, they're saying it's the pursuit of happiness. And yet things that are, can in incredibly dramatic ways, allow you to experience happiness made for some people. For some they felt happy since they were a kid. Yeah. And that's, I think, why it sticks with them for their years after having the experience on mushrooms is because they've just reconnected with their true identity. So regardless, I think that because of the gradual shift that is happening, not just in this country, but all around the planet, regarding psychedelics, we're gonna start seeing some new stuff. Your album being an example of it. Oh, I see, yes. Do you know what I'm saying? Because it's not as though like these mushrooms are just helping depression. It's not as though the mushrooms are just allowing people to deal with their trauma. It's that some people go over there and they get authentic downloads that are technological in nature. Yeah, I agree with you. I agree, this gets, it's almost like there's a pre-cog type thing, like minority report, it's like we figure out like how to like tap in a group and we can get into this group thing and go into these spaces and really, this is the best way to pull back the data and like disseminate to people. Yeah, man. I mean, I think we've barely scratched the surface on this stuff. Well, we're gonna start seeing innovations. We're gonna start seeing, you know. We saw it already. I mean, you see people, lots of people from Silicon Valley said it's where they got a lot of their ideas. That's right. And they just didn't talk about that. That's already been happening. But what if people have the strength to kind of say, let's lean into that a bit. Well, yeah, and come up with better ways of collecting and accumulating the data. More reliable, yeah, yeah. And also this very thing that to me that's incredibly suspicious, is this prohibition reminds me of like censorship. In other words, it's like because the aspect, one of the aspects of the data set that you get over there is revolutionary in the sense that it seems to run counter to any kind of hierarchical system, any patriarchal system, any system based on war, any system based on exploitation. On anything. Yeah, on anything, yeah, yeah. Because of that, it would make sense that a system dependent on these things would make it illegal to go over there. And so now because of someone made a big mistake, I guess, I don't know, but they let the research start again. And because of the research, scientists, and thank God for the scientists in the FDA, I used to think they were all evil. They're not. There's good people everywhere. Yeah. And it is generational to some degree. And that's why it's a slow process. But you get inevitable. You're part of that. That's what's cool about what you're doing is because I have thought of it sometimes as like, oh my God, there is some kind of legislative dam that has been built around the portals through which we can access a higher realm of thinking. True, yes. These dams have been intentionally created by people who are making money off of weapons, imprisoning people, and just blowing shit up. Anti-depressants, yeah. And now the dam is breaking. And when a dam is breaking, you have a certain amount of time to deal with it before the entire structural integration of the dam is fucked. So that's like, OK, you can stick your thumb in the hole there, maybe. But then there's going to be water shooting out of there. Stick your thumb there. So to me, I think we're witnessing the breakdown of this, what would you call it, an ontological dam. And whenever someone like you comes out of the psychedelic closet, so to speak, though, I don't think anyone who knows your music. I don't think I was really, I was more to sort of, many of my music was from that space. But this is the first time I said, this is designed specifically for this. And I'm actually like, my biggest target is these research studies. And so I've been spending a lot of time going through the channels of friends of friends of friends and meeting all these people. Great people. They are great people. Absolutely. They're just working within a system where they're trying to quantify it and qualify it and work with the FDA. And I'm just saying, hey, I got this thing here, and it's another tool. I'd love for you to try it. Let me know. Maybe I think this could be even better. We could get even better results. And everyone else can use this to do yoga, to teach, to study, to have sex, whatever they want. Just put on. That's all great. I just said, but they had a specific design. So don't write me and say, I don't like that the song takes 10 minutes to build. It's like, that's the point. Dude, I cannot do my bench presses to your fucking mushroom album. Yeah, the shaker comes in too late, bro. How do you do it there? I don't understand how you, like, if you're doing live music for that amount, I don't understand how you theoretically. I don't understand it. OK. But I've seen, I just got to see you live for the first time. I was not dosed up in any way, by the way. I didn't think you were, but I was still impressed, man. You've got the looping pedals. You've got the Nord, and you have some other stuff going on. I'm not sure what it is. A lot of stuff going on, plenty of places for things to fuck up. Did you see what happened? I don't know if you're at the beginning, beginning. Very, very, very, very beginning. I hit my, I had to start some stuff on Ableton, and it just didn't start. Something was way, something was wrong. Something was wrong. And I had, of course, that sinking sensation of, like, oh, God, because my whole trip on this one was about giving myself over to, like, Maharaji and this idea of, like, I'm not in control, and I get very worried about this stuff. Me too. Because I'm the only guy. And so I'm my own tech guy, and I'm, like, I have dreams about this. And so this time, I was like, I'm going to play with the energy of, like, I give it up, I give it over. Whatever is meant to be, and I give it over. And so I hit play and it just goes It's like really really I look back at the picture of him and like you don't want this to happen It's okay, and I'm just a little bit freaking out. You know, so I had to go down there and like Do the whole like troubleshoot while you're you know, everyone's like, you know, who is this guy? Let's hear some music. It's scary stuff. Well, it would be scary if you seem scared. You've maintained a complete State of absolute tranquil calm to the point where no one thought I mean I saw it and I was like not a big deal I don't know what it is, but it's not a big deal. Was it a big deal? Was it really deal in the sense that I didn't know what was happening? So your brain's like going through all the possibilities of like trying to you know troubleshoot computer things in your head and I and I just tried something and it worked Yeah, you pulled it off, but it might not have you know what I mean? And so you just have to roll that I had a performance once where I was playing and all of a sudden all the sound is gone Like as if someone like a total party foul like just at the like climax of this big song and I turned around and there was a 90-95 year old woman, which is odd inside a club and she was in the back of the stage I don't know who she was or where she came from and she kicked the power cable out of the wall And I just like when something like that happens, it's so it's bizarre. It made zero sense It's like, well, I don't understand who this is. This is all young people here Yeah, it was someone's grandmother who they're trying to position her for the next set for Trevor Hall set And she's crossing behind the set in the back and she and she like poked her head out It's kind of waved as the power went out and it's something that happens. You just like what are you gonna do? I mean what? So yeah stuff happens, but that is also that that kind of shows you play at that is a thing that could happen Beautiful that there's a 95 year old lady. That was like a club in Massachusetts sold out sweaty hot How did you how did you adjust for that? We plugged it back in and we bantered while I restarted everything we finished Yeah, because that's what you you have a practice and you're calm and you're no one's like, well, yeah I were you pissed calmer. No, I wasn't pissed at the girl, but I Do your best I was just talking to someone about I'm Brian about this the other day from Blitz and Trapper And he's like you really see who people are when stuff goes south. That's yeah That's the real shining of like who somebody is dude. I didn't melt down once Like a true fucking meltdown once on camera. It's so I was so pissed. I was like scree so embarrassing I was like three This is like this is like years and years ago. I still thank God I have less meltdowns now, but this is what I was out of control man My mom was dying during this production and I was just like There was just a Bile sack. Yeah, it was full. Yeah, bulging bile sack of just a just shit in me that way You come out. Yeah, you can just yeah, this is the but this is why we need the this is I think why psychedelics are so glorious in a guided situation because if you are taking the psychedelic With friends and you're doing whatever the dumbass thing is you're doing for us that used to be like going to the mall Oh my god, but watching pink paranoia the wall or going to a laser light show Yeah, and suddenly you're confronted with the bile sack. Yeah, it wants to be dealt with wants to be dealt with Yeah, that's the thing it's coming up because it's like help me be Expunged that's right. Yes, and your friends are like Dude, what's wrong with you pussy? Man, I saw this one of the most Sad videos, you know, there's a whole genre of salvia diva norm videos on With kids filming themselves on salvia's of that. Yeah, this fucking video man This kid is on salvia and he says something like I wish I could find out I wish I'd saved he looks at his friends and he's like you guys I Just I suddenly had this weird sense that we've been together forever And that we and that we live forever and I've known you guys forever and his friends like shut the fuck up punches him A few lifetimes so that one gets dealt with yeah, but okay, so I am We're gonna wrap it up here. The beach is calling us but I wanted to If possible, and I'm sorry to put you in this position, but you do this with your music and I've heard Seen it in some of your interviews. What is that right now? Like if there is a song being played by the present moment or the Exhalation of the divine what what do you think the words to that song are right now for the Guy who has very few lyrics, but yeah, yeah, to me it probably more of a melody, but the words Honestly, it'd be something like sometimes when you do psychedelic trips or you have these big epiphanies You need to try to write it down because you want to translate that seed back into your lives And it just looks like it just says love or it's like a picture of a circle or something like that But it I often if I had to kind of sum up all of those experiences even the good and the bad There's always been this message of like it's just all good. It's all good and We can find some kind of solace in the idea that Even when things are shitty for all of us because they are they are and like we said you remember but you have to forget That's the that's the engine of this yin yang of our lives. Yes inside. It's being held inside this egg This container of it's all good and maybe that's love maybe that's Just the continuity of existence in life, but There's a simplicity of the statement because it's just trying to represent a larger energy That is beyond the boundary condition of this consciousness that we have right now just like trying to tell my dog. It's all good He won't I can't he won't ever understand those words But I can transmit that feeling and there's these octaves of consciousness just like in music There's octaves of music that go in infinity in both directions literally. Yeah We have to trust that we can only like the spectrum of light We can see there's a there are these octaves of our consciousness and there is we there has to be more beyond and below Because there's more and everything else we look at in the physical universe. Yes So it's bound to be the case with consciousness, too. So we just have to understand that it's all good. I Hope for us. I think you're right. It's better now. Thank you so much for your time here. I really love your show Thank you. Thank you. I love you, too. Yeah, where can people find your stuff East Forest org if they go to East Forest calm It's a it's I think it's Chinese or something I don't they sell like things.

257^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - LUCIEN GREAVES Transcript and Discussion^2014-08-05^Hello, dear children of the night. It is I, Duncan Trussell, and you are listening to The Duncan Trussell Family Hour Podcast. And today's episode is about Satan. Hail Satan! Today on The Duncan Trussell Family Hour Podcast, we're going to be playing America's favorite game, Guess the Satanist. And now, please welcome to the guest of the Satanist Studios, the cutest little sweet little pink ball of pig meat in the known universe. It's the Tea Cup Pig! Thank you so much, Duncan, and a big thank you to our studio audience. Consisting solely of the mutilated corpses of children killed by bombs dropped by Christians, Muslims, and Jews. How are you doing today, studio audience? Oh well, they can't cheer or applaud because they were blown to smithereens by followers of a god of love, peace, and truth. We're not going to let that stop us, though. Let's get on with the show. I'm going to play some sound clips, and I want you to pick which of these is a Satanist. Let's listen to our first sound clip. Is this man a Satanist? Who can make a sunrise? Sprinkle it with you. Cover it with chocolate and a miracle to the candy man. Ooh, the candy man can. That's America's beloved entertainer, Sammy Davis Jr. Didn't drop any bombs on kids, but did record several hit songs like Mr. Bojangles. And Candy Man. Let's move on to our next potential Satanist. Is this man a Satanist? See if you can guess. Freedom is ingrained in people's souls. Freedom was not placed there by the United States. It was, in my judgment, it was placed there by something greater, the Almighty. Do we all worship the same god, Christian and Muslim? I think we do. Does. We have different routes of getting to the Almighty. Does bin Laden, does Abu Musab al-Zarkawi pray to the same god that you and I do? I think they pray to a false god, otherwise they wouldn't be killing innocent lives like they have been. That's former President George W. Bush, who helped start the Iraq War, which resulted in the death of over 116,277 civilians. Do you think he was a Satanist? Now let's listen to our third sound clip. Of our President getting up and saying that it was all right for two women to marry, or two men to marry. I'll tell you right now, I was disappointed bad, but I'll tell you right there, as you're sorry, as you can get the Bibles again it, God's again it, I'm again it, and if you've got any sense, you're again it. I had a way, I figured a way out, a way to get rid of all the lesbians and queers, but I couldn't get it passed through Congress. Build a great big large fence, 150 or 100 mile long, put all the lesbians in there. Fly over and drop some food. Do the same thing with the queers and the homosexuals. And have that fence electrified until they can't get out, feed them, and you know what, in a few years they'll die out. Do you know why they can't reproduce? You just listened to Charles Worley, a pastor from North Carolina, but was he a pastor in the Satanic Church? Okay, let's do it. Which of these three men do you think was a Satanist? Sammy Davis Jr., entertainer, George W. Bush, former president and murderer of over 100,000 civilians, or Pastor Charles Worley, who wants to put gay people in a leper colony? If you answered Sammy Davis Jr., then you were correct. Sammy Davis Jr. was a member of the Church of Satan founded by Anton Leves, author of the Satanic Bible, and a non-murderer of children, the other two men for Christians. Back to you, Duncan. We've got a great guest today, Lucian Greaves, famed member of the Satanic Temple. We're going to get to that interview, but first, some quick business. Guess what I ate last night? It wasn't unicorn eggs, it wasn't organic mushrooms, and it wasn't trucker semen, or anything healthy at all. It was several slices of sugary birthday cake that Brendan Walsh gave me from his birthday party, and two bags of chips. Why did I do that? I did it because I was stoned and I ate what was laying around, and that's why I have rolls of fat around my stomach, because I eat what is laying around, just like some scavenging honey badger scooping up balls of eagle shit and shoving them into his mouth. That's what I do around my house with junk food. I'll eat it, if it's there, I'll just eat it. If it's around, I chomp it up, just like one of my dogs who likes to eat turds that the other dog sprays out of his asshole. I will eat polluted, carcinogenic, salt laden, sugar laden, over-processed crisps of corporate pseudo food, with ingredients that read like pages from the necronomicon, and I do it shamelessly, and then in the morning when I wake up, I weep and drink my tears, and I walk out into my yard, and I look into the sky, and I scream into the sky. Why didn't I order Nature Box? All the writings of Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King and all the scripture from the Bhagavad Gita combined cannot keep my hand out of a salty bag of doomed food if I'm stoned. I eat what's laying around, which is why NatureBox.com is a wonderful service. Go to NatureBox.com and sign up and they will send you healthy, great tasting, delicious snacks that won't turn your liver into a curled up pig tail with a tiny eyeball at the end of it that grows out your asshole and stares up at your fat love handles. Go to NatureBox.com and they will send wonderful tasting snacks right to your door. What does that mean? It means that the whole thing where you think to yourself you're going to go to the grocery store and buy healthy food eventually, you no longer have to worry about that. Because NatureBox, like some kind of sweet, sexy, caring, elderly neighbor lady will deliver to your door boxes of delicious, healthy snacks. This used to be common back in the 40s and 50s. You would inevitably live next to a beautiful silver fox whose husband had passed away or fallen into a hole. And you would become friends with her and she would come over to your house in a short skirt wearing stockings and carrying a box of delicious, healthy food. And she'd place the food on your doorstep and you'd invite her in and she'd shove her stocking feet into your mouth and you'd make love with her for hours. That's how it used to be and it can be that way again minus making love to the sweet, elderly lady. Now you can just get the box of delicious, healthy food placed on your door by the UPS guy. All you got to do is go to NatureBox.com and sign up for a plan. Once you sign up, you're going to get a healthy box of food placed on your doorstep every month. And that means that at least during the time that NatureBox is delivered the delicious food to your door, you're not going to be shoving Fukushima outflow into your body temple and turning what could be a slick, sleek, muscular, thin, healthy, taut, love-making machine. Into a giant, plumped out, radioactive, awful, landfill style body that smells like the underside of a rotting seal. Let's face it, you're like a scavenging dog eating whatever falls on the floor. You know that what's laying around is what you're going to eat. Take the first step at becoming healthy. Go to NatureBox.com. Sign up for NatureBox. Go to NatureBox.com forward slash family hour.

And you will get 50% off your first box of delicious, zero-transfat, zero-high fructose corn syrup, gluten-free option food, including PB&J, power clusters, sweet potato fries. Guys, you're poor little body. You're poor mouth. It can't do anything about that terrible hand of yours that loves to shove poison into it. So admit the fact that that awful scooping mechanism at the end of your arm is going to put whatever's laying around into your mouth and know that if you got healthy stuff laying around, not only are you going to eat healthier, you're going to feel better. And who knows? It could create the chain reaction that leads to you having one of those Brad Pitt style six packs that glistens by the pool while everybody looks at you in awe and they will fall at your feet and they will worship you and they will dance around you and they will offer their children to you and they will offer great bags of gold to you and you'll say to them, No, I don't want your children. I don't want bags of gold. All I want is nature box shoved into my mouth by some sweet silver hair darling. Go to naturebox.com. Sign up. You get 50% off.

Also, I'd like to throw in a quick apology to Pitbull owners out there. In a song, I guess it was the podcast before last, I don't remember which one. I did a song about Don't Kill Kids, and I said something about Pitbulls killing kids, and even though Pitbulls have attacked kids, lots of other dogs have attacked kids, so I should have just said dogs instead of demonizing Pitbulls. I don't usually apologize for stuff because I think that can be really lame, but in this case, I think it's bad to increase the stigma against Pitbulls, which are generally some of the sweetest, most darling creatures ever, and the poor things are made to fight each other and have horrible lives, and I don't want to add to any Pitbulls misery by singing a line about Pitbulls eating children. I hope I don't seem like a coward to you hardcore comedy people out there, like, never apologize, but in this case, some very well-meaning sweetie sent me a tweet saying, Why do you gotta say that about Pitbulls? I've been friends with Pitbulls, and they're just goddamn sweeties, though I do sometimes feel a little scared when I'm around them, but really, you should be scared around anything that's got teeth, including human beings. So, I love the Pitbulls, and all my Pitbull listeners, my apologies, I want you all to have very healthy, happy lives, and please, please, please, please, please keep all dogs on a leash, including your Pitbulls, because no matter what, it's still a little spooky, I don't want to have my guts ripped out. Okay, today's guest is Lucian Greaves, and as an introduction, I'm going to play a sound clip from a YouTube clip put together by the Satanic Temple, of which he's a member. This is a montage of all the press and feedback the Satanic Temple got for a recent campaign in which they are going to erect a statue of Baphomet next to the Ten Commandments at the Oklahoma City's Capital Grounds. I'll have video of this clip up on the comments section at DuncanTrustle.com on this podcast, but again, just to reiterate, the Satanic Temple believes that all religions deserve to be recognized, and if you get to put a Judeo-Christian monument at a public building, then you should also get to put a Satanic monument at a public building, and they are working on that very thing. Here is the clip. This Ten Commandments monument stands at the north end of the state capital, but at these steps, the Satanic Temple, once what it calls, equality. The Satanist came along and said, hey, well, if you get your Ten Commandments statue or monument, we get our Satanist monument. Are you kidding me now? Are we making a mockery of everything with regard to Christianity in this society? Now we're going to have a Satanic monument next to the Ten Commandments, really? Yeah, and I think, unfortunately for civil libertarians, this type of sort of activist move by Satanists is going to be a lot more effective than all the legal job-owning over the First Amendment you could possibly do. Let me speak to the Satanic Temple of New York. Let me speak to you directly. You're making a big mistake. We don't see a way that the state can then deny other religions, whether it's Satanism, whether it's Judaism, Islam, Catholicism, Hindu, Buddhist, whatever. We don't think the state can pick and choose. I don't agree with the rabbi. Do you not that this is absolutely a mockery and ridiculous? Absolutely not mockery, not ridiculous. The separation of church and state is what makes America great. Religious freedom means the government doesn't take sides, one religion or another. You may not like the Satanists, guess what? That doesn't matter. So it's sort of a variation on if the state is going to allow the Christians to have, you know, if we're going to bust the wall of separation between church and state, then let's let multiple religions in, including the folks who are the Satanists. You don't want to dare set your little eye to God next to the word of God. All right, why can't Satanists do it? By the word religion in the First Amendment, the founders meant Christianity. Absolutely emphatic. This is ridiculous. It's not just that it's a mockery. It actually demeans America. The last crowd that tried that was in the Temple of Dagon. The founders were thinking of Christianity, so the purpose was to protect the free exercise of the Christian faith. It wasn't about protecting anything else. Our language and its long-sighted, thank you, ma'am. It's a lot of myth. It's a strong, direct message, and that message is one more in line, I think, with our American values of inclusion and equality in the eyes of the long. They themselves started growing cancerous tumors on their genitals. After seven months, they gave birth to a young man. I promise you if you go down to Oklahoma and put a statue of the devil next to the word of God, you don't want to know. It was like they went to the craziest group they could find. No sense. I want to shift gears a little bit, and I want to talk about Phantacons. Most recently, the Satanic Temple has taken on the Hobby Lobby ruling. You can find out more about all of their campaigns by going to thesatanictemple.com. You can donate, sign up for a Satanic Temple membership card, or just check out what's going on over there if you find Lucian Greaves interesting and compelling, which I certainly do. And a big thanks to Matt Dwyer from the podcast Conversations with Matt Dwyer for connecting me with Lucian Greaves. Now, everybody, please send out all the love and sweet energy that you can upon the dewy brow of this darling Satanist Lucian Greaves. Everybody, please welcome to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast, Lucian Greaves. Lucian Greaves from the Satanic Temple. Thank you so much for coming to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast. Good to be here. Thank you. Awesome. So, yeah, man, I've been really looking forward to this interview, but prior to it, as I was considering interviewing you, I had some serious trepidation, just because so much horribleness is attached to the term Satanism. But then as I've been watching your interviews and looking at all the great stuff that you're doing out there, I can't find anything really that sinister at all about what you're doing. In fact, all of it seems like you are an act, a humanist and an activist who really wants the world to be a better place. And that is quite a paradox, because you're doing it under the label of Satanism, which a lot of people are terrified of that word and everything associated with it. Well, yeah, but look at the inversion of values. If we look at what type of values are reflected now in what we know as the conservative Christian movement and its exclusionary attitude towards homosexuals and others, it maligns so often. You know, of course, there's going to be different groups who say that's not a reflection of Christianity at all, but that's kind of the mainstream voice of what's called Christianity at this point. In Satanism has always been rather a kind of specter, an imaginary outgroup created by the dominant Judeo-Christian culture. And so when you take on that label, you do have to kind of define it on your own terms. There were this kind of legend about the Jews defaming the consecrated host, murdering babies and that kind of thing. They were almost like the original Satanists, you know. If you go back earlier, the pagans actually demonized Christians in a similar way, and then sew on down the line until you have this kind of mythology about Satanists. But one of the books we use as the metaphorical construct for our type of Satanism is Revolt of the Angels by Anatoly France, and it's this very kind of clever book where Satan decides to revive the war on heaven, or at least this group of angels seeks him out to revive the war on heaven. And the end of the story, he kind of contemplates this, and he dreams that his army marches against Jehovah, and they win back the heavens. And then throughout time, he becomes complacent and sick with the power again, becomes the tyrannical force exactly as Jehovah was, and so the whole process continues. And he doesn't actually want that position, he doesn't take up the war on heaven again. So there's kind of a duty to the marginalized outgroup to stand up for their own in that kind of way, in a positive way. And so you feel that Satanism, or the type of Satanism you practice is sort of sticking up for the underdog, for the people who've been pushed to the periphery of society by the kind of what Terrence McKenna called the male dominator culture, which is I think it's a pretty good term for it. Yeah, well one thing I don't want to do is pretend that we have this kind of ancient tradition we're going off of. You hear from these Wiccans who hearken to this ancient tradition, which was arguably actually created in the 20th century by scholars who hatched onto this idea that there were these dianic fertility cults that were maligned and that sort of thing. And you know, that's not necessarily true nor does it have to be. But with Satanism, you know, there's just a lot of mythology, and it's been this kind of imagery and symbology called together from this history of building outcasts, making outgroups in these violent, ugly purges against people we deem witches or Satanists and that kind of thing. So it really is our duty to recognize that and urge against it and force people to confront those kinds of fears and judge people for their real actions, their concrete actions in the real world, rather than based on these mythological fears. Right, because right now there's no Satanist dropping bombs on kids on beaches. Right, exactly. And there's no, you know, Satanic jihads or holy wars of any other type. You know, we're calling for people to actually look and reconcile themselves with these elements they fear about other religions. And nothing does that better than confronting them face first with the idea of Satanism. And that is what you are a genius at that's what you're doing is has this incredible is perfect balance of activism and comedy in it. It is so hilarious and so simple. What in, can you talk a little bit about the, for those of out there who don't know about this fantastic monument that you're building right now? Yeah, well, the monument idea was kind of a monument we had early on when we were first forming the satanic temple idea that was kind of something in the background, where, you know, we keep seeing these agendas being pushed through and they're being pushed through in the name of the religious agenda and that kind of thing is though there's only one religious voice in the United States, or, you know, so far there really has been one asserting itself. But, you know, these, these religious, these religious based laws or bills that are passed or whatever they are necessarily constitutionally going to be open to any religion there is. So when you get a case like a Ten Commandments monument going up on public property, oftentimes you have people who they feel religious freedom is being upheld that, you know, that they, they, they cheer and they say that this is a, this is a proper message for, for this Christian nation and that kind of thing. And then you get secular groups and they, they get pissed off and they say they want this monument taken down. There should be no religious monuments on public land, given the separation of church and state, how they interpret the First Amendment that they feel it shouldn't stand. And what really hasn't happened is that another group comes along and says, okay, if you're going to have the Ten Commandments monument there, you've opened the door that any other religious group can have it there too, and they asked to have theirs put there. And that's exactly what we've done. And we said, okay, in Oklahoma and the state capital, they have put a Ten Commandments monument up. And their justification for that was they said it was privately donated by a state legislator named Mike Ritz, who happens to be a Baptist minister as well. And they said that being that was privately donated and not an item paid for by the state or otherwise adopted by the state, it bypasses the establishment clause, not being a church and state issue. Because they said that land, that territory of land where they allow the Ten Commandments monument was open to be a monument park and they envisioned future monuments being there, assumedly privately, privately donated as well. So it was a perfect territory for us to say, well, that's perfect. We'd like to put a satanic monument there. And what was interesting to me is the response, because I knew this would get pressed, but I didn't realize it would get pressed so immediately, because when we first got pressed for this, the first round of press, which was really huge, only came as a result of us sending a letter to the Preservation Commission, which approves monuments or whatever else in Oklahoma, and stating our intention to donate a monument to the capital on the same principle as the Ten Commandments monument was donated. The press got ahold of that, and the response was huge. And people immediately started reaching out to us and saying they wanted to donate to the monument. And at that point, we hadn't even designed the monument. We just wanted to find out the process. We wrote the letter, said we want to donate our monument. So we hadn't done a cost analysis or anything. So we thought, well, we'll start an Indiegogo campaign and put it up immediately, because things like this in the press tend to peak and fall really fast. So while people were writing to us and saying they wanted to donate, we knew we would need that money. So we put up an Indiegogo and set the donation at 20 grand, the donation limit. You don't want to not reach your goal at Indiegogo where they take a higher percentage away from you is how it works. And we thought that 20 grand was kind of lofty goal, but that's about what the Ten Commandments monument costs. But we figured ours was probably going to be a bit more elaborate, but we couldn't count them more than 20 grand. So we made about eight grand before that media cooled down, and then donations died. And that was about Christmas. And there's a finite time you have to collect your donations before they shut down your campaign on Indiegogo. So donations died so we knew we needed to revive it. So we worked during Christmas break and came up with the design. And so it was going to be a traditional image of Baphomet. And Baphomet's this androgynous goat headed creature traditionally has breasts, but we ultimately made the executive decision to take those off just because we don't want to argue with Oklahoma on the grounds of pornography. We don't want to give them that ammunition to say that it has nothing to do with one thing or the other, but that they're going to deny it on the grounds that there's breasts. You can put a goat statue up fine, but you're not putting tits on the goat, Satanist. Right, right. Well, it is ridiculous. Admittedly, it is ridiculous, but I feel like we would just be handing them something and I have no doubts that they would hammer on that. And that would be the grounds on which they would turn it down. And we'd have to fight a whole different battle than the one that we think deserves recognition. Maybe a tasteful bra. We worked with different things with the artists. I was very much an advocate during the construction of this for putting breasts on in some way. Yeah, because the symbol is kind of the yin-yang. The issue that I took when I initially heard about this is with using Baphomet as the symbol for Satan, I thought to myself, well, that's not Satan at all. That's this beautiful symbol of the merging of the masculine and the feminine, a kind of magical union. I've always thought of it, well, not always. When you see it at first, it seems kind of scary. But when you consider what it means, I've always thought of it as representing balance or some kind of new balance being achieved in the world. So I thought, wow. It still does. It still does. And I hope people keep their perception of that. But in modern times, it has been sufficiently Satanized that it is recognized as a symbol of Satanism. And if you look at different religions, this is common. This is common that different past constructs get co-opted and Satanized or merged in with their religion in other ways. I mean, look at all the pagan elements in Christianity. Look at even Christmas or Easter or whatever else. And it's kind of pointless to say, well, the Christmas tree isn't Christmas at all. It's pagan. Well, it's true. But also, it is now part of the Christian tradition. And plus, what is going to be an accurate representation of Satan? A lot of them previously are going to be things we wouldn't want to touch. They're either going to be too obscure to be recognized. We're not going to use a dragon of the type that looks more like a symbol for Chinese New Year or whatever. We want it to be obviously a Satanic symbol. And it's not going to be something offensive like a black, the Negro Satan, as it were. Or the Jewish Satan with horns, kind of like a pan type character, whatever. I love this symbol of the reconciliation of opposites and the balance. And it still has all these binary elements. And plus, putting it alongside the Ten Commandments adds to that as well. And then the message becomes one of that kind of balance. And it's really kind of ironic that there's all these threats against destroying it when that really ultimately is the message there. Right. Well, people don't understand that. People see that symbol and they freak out and they think that it is exactly what you're saying. They just think that it's some kind of just awful thing. And then when I realized, you know, after I realized like, oh, shit, that's a symbol of balance. And then just like what you're saying, here is this thing balancing out the Ten Commandments or the sort of the way that Christianity is managed to or popular Christianity, which probably isn't Christianity at all, is managed to become what we call the mainstream religion. And here is something that balances that out. And in all that, it seems wonderful. And then with the addition of the two children standing next to the, to the, to Baphomet, it's hilarious. But do you, you do recognize how funny, do you see this as funny? Is that, is it, is it offensive that I see this as a kind of comedic art, a kind of like amazing conceptual bit of comedy that you're doing? No, I love it that people see it that way. I, but I also don't want it to be obscured to the point where people feel that there's nothing genuine about it, or that this kind of symbolic system doesn't actually resonate and mean something to us, because it does. And even recognizing Satanism as being this rather modern religion where these different symbols are called from this mythology in the background, it still can't help but have deep meaning to us when we grow up in this kind of culture where it's been, you know, it's inextricable from our culture. It's something that's in the background. Like you can't get away from certain conceptions when you look at religious Christians imagery as well, whether you're an atheist or whatever else when you grow up in this culture. And with Satanism is quite the same. And I think, you know, even though I fully admit and embrace that I'm an atheist and I don't really, you know, and I don't subscribe to any supernaturalism about this, that I feel we have all the elements of a legitimate religion that what a religion should be, a sense of community, a shared sense of goals, a sense of identity, and, you know, in a kind of practice background, that kind of thing. So I don't want people to look and say, well, this is, this is a genius prank that's, it's fine that they think that so long as it doesn't marginalize it to the point where people think that there's nothing authentic in what we're doing, or that it's all on a lark and that there hasn't been a lot of blood, sweat, and tears going into this because there certainly has. This has not been, despite what it might look like, this has not been an easy year for those of us, those few of us in the inner circle here who are actually doing this thing. And it's really quite harrowing and it's been a complete upheaval in my life. So I want to keep that humor element and I'm glad people are very much amused, but I don't want to marginalize it just the same. I see. And can you talk a little bit about some of the harrowing moments that have happened as you've found yourself catapulted into the public eye? Well, as you know, my name is Doug, but I started out with this, you know, putting forward the name Lucian Greaves, which I still use in connection with this. But, and I kind of, I really didn't know how big this would get. And I kind of thought maybe I could just be a voice for the organization and have this name, you know, this pseudonym out, out in the front. And which was fine by me because I've never really been interested in developing myself as a character, you know, turning this into the story of my autobiographical self, even though I'm revealed for who I am, I just don't engage in that with journalists and that kind of thing. But it doesn't, you know, it's, you get into the situation where you start talking to journalists and the first things they dive at it. Where did you go to school? Where did you grow up? Where do you work and those kinds of things? Right. I think, are you fucking crazy? Why are you asking me that? Especially in the position I am in. And then when this gets really big, of course, I have Ann Coulter tweeting about me saying that, you know, tweeting my name and saying that this is all just a plot for me to run away from a Jewish name. I'm not Jewish to begin with anyway, but I don't know what her whole point is. But I feel like it's almost, it almost has the tone of a threat to me when these people say, you know, come off like, well, we found out who you are and we're going to tell people. And that's the kind of attitude I got from like Laura Ingram and like I said, Ann Coulter and these different Fox News assholes who interview me. And to the point where on Fox News, even Imus has a show. I didn't even know that old bastard had a show, but he has a show on Fox and one of his sidekicks, I guess, who does his panel discussions with him all the time, actually called for us to be murdered. He said we should be lined up next to our monument and shot. Wow. And so, yeah. So, you know, that really did distress me. And I haven't pushed for media coverage for things we're doing, like actively reaching out to people. In most cases, we just put out a press release or whatever and it rolls on its own momentum or it doesn't. This was something where immediately I contacted our lawyer. He wrote a letter to Fox and at first they were very dismissive. You know, they were real pricks about it. And then I was reaching out directly with media. I felt I had a good relationship with really pushing them to cover this story because I really wanted this to be recognized. I didn't want somebody to get away with calling us to be murdered, calling for us to be murdered because, you know, I'm deeply concerned about that. And it got to the point where raw story ran a story. They've always been really good to us. They ran a story calling it some type of outrage. And then the young Turks, they do this kind of video news show. I don't know if it's only on YouTube or where, but, you know, they've been good too. And they were openly saying that this guy should be fired from Fox and all that. So before it was going to get any deeper, I think Fox realized that this was going to gain momentum. They had that guy air an apology, but Fox themselves never took the opportunity to say that as a network, they don't condone that kind of violence or that kind of speech or anything. You know, they just sent us a letter that essentially said we wash our hands of it and now go piss off or whatever. But so there was that and plus, you know, there's always the threats now. And I feel like it's only going to get worse because, you know, within the next couple of days here, we're going to be rolling out a campaign that's going to leverage the Hobby Lobby ruling. And we've found that it looks like we'll be able to use that in defense of pro-choice initiatives. Can you tell me what's planned? What's up? What's going on with that? What do you have planned for the Hobby Lobby? Well, since Roe vs. Wade, nobody's managed to overturn it. You know, essentially his legalized abortion back in 73, I believe it was, is Supreme Court hearing. But since then, there's been all these what I call weasel bills introduced to try to make abortion more difficult for women to get. Whether it's informed consent laws, as they call them, where there's state mandated medical information, they call it to give to the woman, which most of it's not scientifically valid or medically legitimate in any way. Like they have information saying that abortion increases risks towards breast cancer, which is not proven. It's very dubious, spurious data. You know, show them pictures of fetuses and that kind of thing. It's really trying to scare people out of what's already a difficult situation. Our feeling is that fundamentally, you know, your choice is your own and your choices should be made with the best available material scientific evidence. And this doesn't qualify. And our stance there was, you know, similar to our children's campaign. I don't know if you saw where we had a letter of exemption written up saying, for kids, where they didn't have to be subjected to corporal punishment. And we have a letter drawn up and we had lawyers vet it and everything. So we have this letter drawn up that people will be able to download from our website and women can bring it to their care provider and have them sign it. And essentially, it says that, you know, given our beliefs, we're not subject to this state mandated information because we believe in actual scientific information, that kind of thing. We thought part of the problem we might run into with that is that even though a lot of this legislative material is openly not scientifically legitimate, or at least a part of a minority belief within medicine or science, that we might get dragged through the courts with the state hiring a medical witness saying, well, you know, it's legitimate to us. So the state is allowed to legislate in favor of a pro-life position. And that's true. That's where it's fallen. But given the Hobby Lobby decision, where they've decided that due to the deeply held beliefs of this corporation, that they can choose to believe that contraceptives are a board of fashions when they are, in fact, not, we don't have to argue the medical legitimacy of this information. We can simply say we don't fucking like it. So we don't want it. And we feel like now, given Hobby Lobby, that's a home run. So that's the first bit of, that's the first weasel bill we're going to take on with abortion. And there's three more after that. Can you, but can you sum up what you just said? I kind of got a little lost in it. It's a letter that people who work for places like the Hobby Lobby can bring to their medical provider that, can you explain, can you simplify that a little bit because I'm a dummy? Yeah, well, on this particular, on this first initiative, and it may seem a small step, but it's all going to come together in different initiatives where it's an all out protection of a pro-choice position. But with this particular one, we're taking on this idea that women need to be subjected to state mandated information. That women need to be subjected to images of fetuses and information telling them that abortion will kill them, cause them to commit suicide or whatever else. We think that's needlessly stressful. So in essence, what we're doing is we're giving them a letter of exemption. And if the doctor says, I need to give you this information, I need to ensure that you go through the trauma of seeing this and all the rest, they are then subject to being sued on the grounds that they violated our religious liberty. Wow. Okay, cool. Right. That is really smart, man. That is very, very smart. Wow. Wow. That's so cool. This hobby lobby ruling is so ridiculous. I read in her dissent, it was amazing how she's pointing out like, well, now, you know, Scientologists, if you work for Scientologists, they can say that you don't, you can't get antidepressants. Or if you work for an Islamic company, then they can say that you can't get anything that has any kind of pig product in it if they want to. It's a can of worms, man. It's a can of worms. Yeah, well, that's just another case where obviously they weren't thinking of other religious groups, which was actually surprising to me because earlier on, some couple months ago, there was a case in Greece, New York, and the town of Greece in New York. And it went to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court saw in favor of the town of Greece. And what was going on there is that they were having these public town meetings being opened up by these Christian convocations. They would have like a minister come in and he would do a Christian prayer or whatever. And somebody was pissed off and it went all the way to the Supreme Court. And the Supreme Court said, no, you know, you can do a public prayer opening up a town meeting. But the idea, of course, is that it should be open to anybody. And then the LA Times reached out to me and they said, well, is there a satanic prayer we could do? And I wrote one up for them and they published it. It was nice. But it was interesting in the Supreme Court case, Scalia did mention Satanists. He mentioned like, well, what about Satanists? Can't they give? Can't they open up the town hall meeting with a prayer? That question did come up. So I find it kind of surprising that they don't think of it in a broader context of something like Hobby Lobby where, like you say, it's far more of a disaster. And of course, Scientology now, it would be well within their rights to say they cut psychiatry out from any of those because they have a longstanding history of being anti-psychiatry. When do you start picking and choosing what you actually, it's like picking and choosing what you're paying taxes for, like saying, oh, no, I don't have kids who go to school. You know, I'm going to pay this percentage less or whatever. I don't want to pay for drones dropping bombs on people. I don't want to pay for, I don't want any of my money to go to those bombs. This is, to me, it's just, when I think of Satanism, I don't think of what you're doing. When I think of Satanism, I think of something sinister. When I think of the symbol of Satan, I think of something sinister. And I don't think of Baphomet. I think of whatever warp exists in the universe, there are a fraction in the lens of the time-space continuum that pushes people away from truth. That's what I think of when I think of Satanism. I don't think of what you're doing reminds me of Christianity. What you're doing makes me think of what an activist Christian would be doing out in the world. It seems like a very positive, beautiful thing. I get so freaked out when I hear about the death threats that you're getting, because it makes me... I would argue that it has to be Satanism. It has to be Satanism and it couldn't be anything else, because any time you have something that's going to go against the status quo like this, that's going to be the propaganda about it. If you're going against the power, as it were, the mainstream structure, you're always going to be demonized in this way. In an outcast, you don't look at the Satan of that kind of propaganda. Look at the idea of Satan as put forward by Milton in Paradise Lost or Anatole Francis' Revolt of the Angels, where you have this kind of eternal rebel against the tyrannical power. That's what Jesus is when I read the New Testament and it says, I'm sure you have. When I read that, I still remember the first time I read it when I was on acid. Reading about this, getting to look at it from the perspective of having none of the indoctrination of being raised a Christian. Just reading it from the perspective of what Christ was doing. It seems like he was this rebellious being that was fighting against the religion of the day and ended up getting murdered for it. If you're a Satanist, then I guess I'm one too. I just wouldn't use that word for it, that's all. Maybe it's a useful tool because it allows you to fly in the face of these people who called it. I wouldn't call what these people are doing Christianity. I wouldn't call him a Christian. The thing is, I like your confusion. I like that you're confused and I like that a lot of people are confused. I actually think that that's progress for you and for other people who are confused. I know it's painful for some people and a lot of people come to me like this and they say, I just can't get behind calling it Satanism. I actually think we kind of thrive on that because we know we're forcing people to, it's shaking them up. It's forcing them to reevaluate things and from here on, if somebody defines themselves as a Satanist, you're going to be forced to think twice about what that might mean or might not mean. Of course, you're going to find rotten people who self-identify as Satanists. You find rotten people who self-identify as Christians. You'll find good and both and bad, but I do find there to be some truth in the left-hand path, right-hand path distinction that's made between Judeo-Christian culture and Satanism. The right-hand path is more people seeking wholeness with the one, assimilating into this kind of mass consciousness or whatever else. There's nothing wrong with that. There's this drive towards it. At its worst though, you're talking kind of mindless conformity. Left-hand path is kind of the opposite. People developing their pure self as an isolate intelligence. That too is a noble goal, right? But at its worst, you could have this kind of antisocial, anti-human behavior. It can go that way too. So they both got there good and bad and people go one way or they go the other. It's funny because there's a book called Lords of the Left-Hand Path where it actually at one point asks the question whether or not Jesus Christ might have been a Lord of the left-hand path, which seems really paradoxical by that point, but it's kind of what you're touching on now. I definitely think that. That's why you start getting into this real confusion when you start going down this particular path. Because what you have happening right now, if you follow the news today, Israel drops bombs on a beach and kills four kids. Have you heard about that? Did you hear about that? Yeah, I've heard of the Palestinians murdered some Israelis. Now this is not necessarily done in the name of religion. It's done in the name of a territorial conflict. But when you look at the religion of George W. Bush, or if you look at the religion of Barack Obama, or you look at the religion of any of the people who feel okay about dropping bombs on kids, you will find that it is always either Judaism, Islam, or Christianity. It's always those religions, the people who follow those religions somehow have managed to work into those religions the idea that from time to time you have to incinerate children to make things better in the world. This is the exact thing that they've accused Satanists of forever. Satanists, they're going to take your kid into the woods, set him on fire, chop him in half. Meanwhile, these sons of bitches are flying jets over foreign countries incinerating babies. Now to me, that is Satanism. And that's where it gets really spooky to think that perhaps the true religion of the day is this kind of violence, this kind of random, financially based insanity. And what you're doing, or what you're actually doing is true Christianity, and that is why they want to kill you. Just like they wanted to kill our Lord Jesus Christ. Praise God. Well, to refer back to Revolt of the Angels, that's the whole nature of the story. It's the kind of corruption of being the ubiquitous power and becoming complacent in your feelings of entitlement. And it leads you to this kind of tyrannical complacence against the lives of the outcast, the other or whatever else might threaten that power. Yes, that's it. And again, as you've said, you're an atheist. You don't believe in some kind of, I don't know, external disembodied evil or external disembodied rebellious force outside of the rebellious force that manifests in your heart or in your actions. But so we're just using symbols here, you know? And so that's a funny thing. This is when you get into, you know, in Gnosticism, a lot of the idea was that the God that most people are worshiping is, what do they call that God? Fuck. You know, in Gnosticism, what do they call the Demiurge, which was a kind of confused God hatchling. Do you know anything about this? Yeah, yeah, I've read Gnostic material. I've been through quite a lot of comparative religion, actually. Every now and again, I'm actually invited to speak to comparative religion classes and all different types of classes, really. Yeah, well, I can, I believe it. I mean, one thing that's really, that I'm learning from this conversation is that you are, this is truly your religion. I wasn't sure if you were just using it as a form of tool for social activism, but I see that this is an actual religion for you. Would you consider yourself a religious person? Well, yeah, actually I would. And I've gone through a great effort to explain to people what that means because, like I said, I end up on these Fox shows or whatever, and sometimes the entire point of what they're trying to get across is that we're not a real religion. And what I like to do is just laugh and turn it back around and say, well, then you're giving me an advantage. So if you want to say we're not actually a religion, we don't have to fight any establishment clause issues. If you want to make that argument for us, then you can say, okay, if the state adopts the Ten Commandments and then people argue that that's a religious item, well, then we don't have to make the argument that ours is, you know what I'm saying? It's kind of ridiculous that they go that way. But I'm saying that we can separate supernaturalism from religion and that you don't need to subscribe to a supernatural deity to have a religion. And, you know, and part of that is seeing kind of secular Jews, you know, they still engage in the rituals and that kind of thing. And I've met a lot, you know, I didn't when I was growing up, but when I moved, I met a lot of Jewish people. And it was kind of new to me to see that they embraced it as a cultural ancestral background, that kind of thing. And it gave them a sense of meaning and that kind of thing. And there's nothing wrong with that. And I think there's very positive things to be gained from that. I think when you start losing ground on the positive nature of it is really when you start subscribing to untenable beliefs believing that you have to believe them to be a part of that religion. And when you start getting these dogmatic beliefs that the voice of some deity compels your hatred towards different groups or whatever else and that you can't assimilate or adjust to the reality of today, you know, which is far better than the reality of the time most of these texts were written or whatever else. Well, I mean, what's more terrifying than the idea that some invisible being is like having conversations with George W. Bush who has control of a nuclear arsenal. That's not the person you want to have the keys to nuclear weapons. The guy talking to an invisible homophobic lunatic thing. That's like a very dark, dark religion. Well, maybe it's just a matter of like not getting caught up in definitions. Maybe that's the point because one thing that we can't escape from is the fact that even though we have manifest in this dimension as individuals, there's no way around that. You're an individual. I'm an individual. George W. Bush is an individual. We are not all individuals, but then simultaneously we are connected to this gigantic thing called a universe, an inexplicable, ununderstandable thing. And this human tendency to say, well, I'm a Christian or I'm a Satanist or I'm a Zoroastrian or it seems to be kind of, it seems like people end up getting lost in that. What we really are as humans living on a planet together, you know, that's filling up with many more of us, you know. Right, right. Well, you know, I think one of the greatest evils though that has come out of religion in general is the tendency to create these outgroups, to create the idea of Satanists, the idea of a certain people that are the embodiment of evil and that if we can just destroy them, everything will be okay. Right. The people who are working against the entire moral fabric of the universe and are so depraved that they'll act against every human impulse that's known and they're just a conspiracy of cruelty in the background. It just hasn't existed and the sooner we realize that, the better off we'll be and I think we go a long way toward making that happen. Well, you know, I have to disagree with you there about this conspiracy of cruelty. I think there is a conspiracy of cruelty, but I think the conspiracy of cruelty isn't engineered by Satanists, especially the sect of Satanism that you're a member of, but obviously this conspiracy of cruelty exists in whatever group of people are currently building weapons that get dropped on kids. I don't mean to keep going back to that, but when you're listing like bad things to do in the world, you know, that's got to be at the top of the list, right? Like when you're talking... Oh, yeah, yeah. Like dropping... You make a valid point, so let me amend that. When I talk about the conspiracy that doesn't exist, I'm talking about the one that's supposed to be hidden in the background that's running parallel to our society that knows it's acting against the better... The better impulses of our culture and everything else that's working against the greater good. The real conspiracy of evil is happening in the name of the greater good by a lot of people who are very misguided into believing that they're working towards those ends. Right. When they're doing these kinds of things. They're doing it in the name of righteousness and justice and they're co-opting these labels. They're misappropriating them. That's a hell of a lot creepier. That's a hell of a lot creepier than a group of people wearing robes gathered together muttering weird, lovecraftian incantations and some grove in the forest. It's a million times creepier because it's the, you know, this... And you say they're misguided, but I wonder, are they misguided? Are they misguided? Is it really just like a, whoops, we're just sort of confused. Or maybe these really, these people have become so addicted to power and so drunk on the whatever weird feeling you get when you realize that you are on a daily basis turning humans into hamburger meat with $100,000 bombs that they're not misguided at all. They're just, they're no more misguided than somebody wandering into a jerk-off theater and, you know, spraying jizz all over the floor. You know, that guy's not necessarily misguided. That guy, being me, it's at one point in my life, I wasn't misguided. I knew exactly what I was doing, you know? Right. There again, though, we're dealing with the balance of power and you're going to find that from people who are secure in the idea that they hold the power. You know, it's really, it doesn't seem like a real human characteristic that you're going to find that from the outgroup. You find people who self-identify as Satanists continually trying to justify themselves and show that they're not so bad after all. And then you find people a lot of times doing things in the name of mainstream religion and they're acting like rotten bastards because they feel they have a certain entitlement. They've already defined themselves as having the moral high ground. Yes. So they can act as immoral as they feel, as they feel as convenient. Well, that's, and what a man, I've got to tell you, that's got to be the gr... And it's like, you know, if you can eliminate, like truly just eliminate guilt from, you know, from blowing people up, like you don't just eliminate guilt. You know, you actually like transform guilt into this kind of exhilarating what's better than like, you know, being engaged in some modern crusade, you know, where you really are acting in the name of some higher power. I mean, God, you don't just get to experience the rush of blowing people up. You get to get that mixed in with the idea that you're some kind of messianic savior of the world. Wow, man. Well, then we have to come up with a new name for this religion that these people are engaged in because it's not Christianity. And I'm not going to call it Satanism because I don't want to offend you because whatever you're doing sounds great. So we have to come up with a new religion that they're following. They're engaged in some kind of, I don't know what you would call it. I call that God that they worship loon loon, some kind of insane, some being that over the course of eternity lost its mind and is, you know, really upset over these like microscopic monkey descendants putting their cocks in the wrong asshole. That's a crazy God. That's like a loony God. And that's what, that's what they worship. But you, this Satanism that you're talking about, what is the school? What is the specific? This is, is this a Levan Satanism? Is this, what type of Satanism would you call this? Well, I would call it more of a literary Satanism, actually. I mean, we do draw from Leve, but I feel like Leve was also a product of his time. We saw four evolving with the times and seeing where the, you know, what the best available evidence is for us today. And something I was explaining in an interview I was doing on NPR was that in Leve's time, you know, he started in the sixties, his church of Satan, and he died in the late nineties. And, you know, he would talk a lot of kind of police state politics. And he would, and he said that his Satanism was kind of Anne Rand philosophy dressed up in religious trappings. Right. And we can see kind of now where the Tea Party ultimately leads us with Anne Rand. I don't think it's really fair to her, but with the police state politics, I think you have to keep in mind that in Leve's time, sixties to nineties, violence was out of control in the United States. It was getting worse and worse. And you kind of see it in the apocalyptic films and everything of the day, still in Cold War period and those kinds of things. Everything, you know, these post apocalyptic futures were being seen. The idea was that everything was eventually going to get worse and people were looking for those kinds of solutions. What do we do? You know, and it's in Leve's idea was like increased police state kind of thing. Now, since Leve's died, you know, at about 95, I think it peaked. And now violence in general has just been decreasing exponentially, rapidly. We're doing something right, you know, something that, you know, there are, there are good things happening and violence has been decreasing very much. And Steven Pinker, cognitive science professor at Harvard wrote a book, Better Angels of Our Nature, that kind of explores this topic of the decrease in violence. And we're at a point now where we can look at what we could be doing right and what we could maybe be doing more of to stay away from this. And I think a lot of the police state rhetoric now sounds a bit outdated and just wrong, you know. So I feel like we are, we're different in that way. We don't really, we're not his right wing, I don't think is some of Leve's rhetoric was. But I don't necessarily think that he would object today. It's, you know, you can't say really what, what would Leve say today, you know, for one thing, it doesn't really matter. For another thing, he might agree with us entirely, you know, who knows. But I think, but I think we're coming from, coming from things at a very pragmatic level and we're looking at what works best when, when you're going to organize and put forward certain agendas and in collective ideals that work well for us. And I think, you know, the way we go about it in such a way that shakes up the status quo really is best embodied in the symbolism of Satanism. So, okay, so here's what Satanists want. The Satanists that you are, this is what the agenda of a Satanist these days is. One, keep kids from getting spanked in public schools. Is that correct? Well, yeah, if we're going to talk about kids getting spanked in women's rights pro-choice, those can be summed up in the ideal personal sovereignty. And that's something we advocate for on all fronts. I mean, you abdicate some of that and, you know, if justice is going to be called against you, if you violate the personal sovereignty of another. But beyond that, we feel your personal sovereignty is inviolable, you know. Your body is yours alone, subject to your own will alone. So that means, okay, your body is yours alone, subject to your own will alone. That means that legalization of drugs, legalization of, you should be allowed to take any drug you want. Is that fair to say that's a Satanic ideal? Yeah, yeah, it's your choice. It's your choice. Whatever you want to do, it's just, under the influence of a certain drug, if you break laws that go against another person's personal sovereignty, then you have to face justice. Right, right. And that's not to say we advocate taking any drug, you know. It's just to say that it's up to you, right? I don't feel there should be some central authority really legislating that, your ability to do so. So, okay, so it seems like the roots of this religion are personal sovereignty and autonomy. It's the freedom of the individual to express themselves without impinging on another person's freedom. Right, absolutely. So what are some other tenets of this religion outside of personal sovereignty? Well, we've written seven of them. I think we originally had nine and we want to make them malleable, but it all comes down pretty much to the idea of, you know, keeping within the material world, you know, keeping a rationalistic perspective of the world on the best available evidence and just not being under the thumb of some tyrannical power. And really we try to keep it as broad and we're not trying to micromanage people's beliefs per se. We're keeping to very general values just because we don't think it's really appropriate to micromanage people's beliefs. We're going to have people who self-identify as Satanists who have a variety of beliefs. But we feel like these are certain things, you know, there's just certain core values we can agree with and we really don't want to tighten our grip beyond those because I think then already you're running into problems. Already then you're becoming the kind of power you didn't want to be, the kind of thing you were rejecting all along. And that's part of the reason when people ask, well, why didn't you put your tenants, why don't you have your tenants carved into the stone on the monument you're putting up? And, you know, to me the idea of having, you know, fiat's etched in stone as though they can never be altered or changed is kind of offensive on its own. They should be, your thinking should be open to change. It should be open and available to new information. What would a satanic planet look like? Well, huh, a satanic planet. You know, I think it would have to be like Revolt of the Angels again, like we would always be the minority group. It loses its meaning and it loses its value and it becomes something else if you become the dominant power structure. Satanism by its very nature I think always has to be the out group or the other. So that's an interesting thing. So if you achieve your agendas and this spread, what happens if people hear these interviews that you're doing and what you're calling self identifying with Satanism, it just happens that everyone's like, yeah, I guess I'm a Satanist. This sounds fantastic. Let's just imagine this is never going to happen. But let's imagine that it happened. It spreads through the planet. Everyone's like personal sovereignty. Let's stop blowing people up. Let's figure out a way that we can all enjoy this planet together. What does that look like? Everyone's a Satanist now. You're saying that the moment that happens, it eradicates itself. Right. Well, that's something to shoot for, isn't it? I mean, I think some of the people who've been used to Satanism just being an excuse to dress up in all black and a fedora or a cape or whatever and frighten their neighbors, they're very upset at what they're doing. And I think some of them are very upset about it because we're bringing it out into the open like this. And just by doing that, the very nature of doing that, you begin to change what it is. And they don't want that. They want it to be this obscure little personal club of theirs. But I feel like it's not worth anything either if you're not going to do anything with it. I mean, you have to set the pendulum swinging or get stagnated where you are. It's a really interesting conundrum here because if you have a religion that has as its rebel, as its hero, then the moment that you... Yeah, it's so funny that even within Satanism or sects of Satanism feel threatened by what you're doing and are trying to oppress you. That's hilarious so that the thing just keeps... It's interesting. It's a really fascinating conundrum. Do you meet for services or do you have any kind of ceremonies that you do regularly? No, and it's funny because I don't know if you heard about the black mass we had scheduled to do at Harvard, but we were invited by a student group to perform a black mass. But the thing was, as I knew that would cause controversy, but I thought we could get rid of the controversy by promoting this as a black mass reenactment, which it was to be. We weren't claiming this to be an actual black mass because the actual black mass is kind of a figment of the imagination. It was always this kind of propaganda by the Catholic Church where people would claim these rituals took place. It kind of transmogrified from the witches' Sabbath to the black mass in which babies murdered and all those kinds of things. The consecrated host is violated and everybody in the whole world falls apart thereafter or whatever. What we were going to do is rather an academic presentation. As part of that presentation, I was going to explain that given the general satanic loathing of rote protocol, procedure, and thoughtless ritualistic behavior, we're not really, this isn't really something we do, but nonetheless, there have been people who have latched on to the idea of doing a black mass, and for them it means something, and usually this is for people who are just kind of walking away from the religion that they were indoctrinated in. It's not meant to be like a focused attack against Catholics. It's really a declaration of personal independence. It's these people seeing that they can blaspheme or whatever else, and it really doesn't have an effect on them. It feels liberating to them. It's for them. It's not against the other guy, right? Against Catholicism. Right, right. It's kind of against the general cultural programming that they feel that they've been oppressed by or whatever. And of course, that message never made it out. I didn't expect the kind of outcry that came up in the Boston Archdiocese where he released this ignorant statement where he was talking about opening the door to dark forces. He used that kind of terminology. It was insane. And there was this big uproar about it, but yeah, we don't typically do rituals or that kind of thing. When we do, they definitely have meaning. You know, I'm ordained now. We're a legitimate religious organization now. So I understand the value of funerals, weddings, those kind of rituals that commemorate a point in time where you want to show respect for what's happening at this moment in time, you know, that kind of thing. So I do appreciate ritual on that level, but regular services, no, we're going to be opening chapter houses and they, you know, they may engage in those kinds of things. We're going to request that they have some kind of regular meetings and submit to us their minutes and it's up to them if they have those kinds of those kinds of events or not. Now, yeah, I understand what you're saying. Well, that's too bad. You know, everybody I talked to, you know, nobody's putting on robes anymore and that just seems fun to me. Throw on some black robes, mutter some things, see how you feel. It seems like a blast. We'll do it. We'll do it. No, in the pageant, she's great. I'm just saying we don't do it as regular services. You're not going to find us like every third Friday doing that or whatever. It's as the moment calls for. I don't know if you saw that we did our pink mask, but that was something where that was an event specific kind of ritual and that was an ad hoc ritual that we made just to offend that old fucker Fred Phelps. And I dumped my nuts on his mother's grave and we said that now she's a lesbian in the afterlife and you're obligated to believe that she is so. Yeah, that's what a ritual is for. I mean, we were really doing something with that ritual. It wasn't some kind of hidden little event where we were hiding in the bushes and nobody knew that happened. No, we did that for, you know, ultimately that got out to a general audience and that that really worked its magic for lack of a better word in the real world. Wouldn't you say you're a good guy? I wouldn't say that. I don't think it's really up to me to decide. But when you're looking at like the hierarchy of good, you seem to be on like Fred Phelps. If we're going to like not that you're supposed to create a hierarchy, everything is one and everything ultimately originates from some big bang that we don't really understand. We are inextricably connected to each other. We're all part of this one beautiful force and there's no way out of that. We all are part of one thing. You don't have to call the force beautiful, but Fred Phelps, if I'm going to create a hierarchy of good, then I'm going to put Fred Phelps at the lowest end that I can possibly find. And I'm going to put somebody like you, a social activist who is fighting for personal autonomy, who is trying to help gay people get married, who wants to fight for women's rights. I hate to say it, but you seem like a really great person and you seem driven by impulse to help the world become a better place. Is that fair to say? I think that's fair to say. I don't think it's really fair for me to say it because I don't want myself to become the focus of the story. I think this is something a lot of people can get behind. It doesn't really matter who I am or I don't need to be built up to be this kind of remarkable person. That's what every great person says. Sorry, Lucian. You have to deal with it, man. All the great people say it's not me. I don't want the focus to be on me, but it's an interesting thing. And I think that the more people can, you know, what I'm guilty of the opposite, I'm guilty of doing what the Christians do to you, to the Christians. Because when I think of Ann Coulter and when I think of the Pope coming out and saying only 2% of our priests are molesting kids, did you hear about that? When I hear these things again and again and again or when I hear about, you know, I don't mean to keep going back to it, but I just think of like when I was a kid at the beach, I'm there with my brother, I'm hanging out at the beach and all of a sudden I'm barbeque. And when I think about that and I think about that in some way being connected to a type of religion, or when I think of the opposite side shooting missiles randomly into a city, not caring where they land, all of these things, I get angry. And I marginalize those people in my mind. And it seems like what you're doing is trying to keep that from happening on both sides. You know, the idea being that we're all allowed to be whoever we want to be in this world as long as we don't hurt other people. That makes you a great person. Well, thank you. Can you, would you mind two things and then we can wrap up? Do you have a second? Yeah, yeah, no problem. One thing would be for people listening who, what's something somebody listening could do right now to connect with the spirit of your religion and to make their lives better? What advice would you give to someone listening right now who is self identifying now as a Satanist? What's something that they could do to amplify their life or give some advice to the folks listening right now to make their lives better? See, I often stay away from giving people a direct advice because it is about finding your own way, but I will direct them to our website. You know, I do have a recommended reading list. It explains where we're coming from. I have a few essays available and that kind of thing. And I really, you know, that really is kind of my focus is not trying to bring about followers, but really trying to give people the tools to be leaders themselves, to be leaders of their own lives. What's a tool? What's a tool? Name a tool that someone could do to start becoming a leader of their own lives. Oh, just kind of the educational tools. Just the kind of learning tools that are available to us now. Just the kind of critical thinking tools that are available to all of us. You know, just the kind of information we're privy to now is at, you know, so much exponentially larger than at any other time in history and we should really capitalize on that. And plus, we really are, I mean, despite the bombs being dropped and that kind of thing, that is all horrific, but we are in really the most peaceful time in our history and we should do our best we can to enjoy it. There's plenty of work to be done and, you know, people can see what kind of initiatives we're working on if they check on the website also. But I would really, you know, strongly encourage people if they're really looking for somebody to show them the way, I would, I would say, I would tell, I would encourage them not to find somebody to show them the way. Yes, no shit. Beautiful, beautiful. And I'm going to apply that to my own life too. The last thing is, is it possible since you are an ordained minister, can we close this podcast with this satanic prayer? Oh, yeah, you know, let me, let me look up the one that I gave to the Los Angeles Times. Perfect. And this was, this was in response to, as I said, the, the Supreme Court decision to allow the public prayers. And the Los Angeles Times immediately reached out to me, given that decision and asked if there were any satanic prayers that could open the town meeting. And I turned it in. And here's what I offered. Let me know what you think. Great. Let it, let us stand now unbowed and unfettered by arcane doctrines born of fearful minds in darkened times. Let us embrace the Luciferian impulse to eat of the tree of knowledge and dissipate our blissful and comforting delusions of old. Let us demand that individuals be judged for their concrete actions, not their fealty to arbitrary social norms and illusory categorizations. Let us reason our solutions with agnosticism and all things, holding fast only to that which is demonstrably true. Let us stand firm against any and all arbitrary authority that threatens the personal sovereignty of one or all. That which will not bend must break, and that which can be destroyed by truth should never be spared its demise. It is done Hail Satan. Hail Satan. That's awesome. What a beautiful prayer. Wow. Thank you so much for giving me this time and for doing this interview. It's been quite enlightening talking with you. And what are some ways that people listening can reach out to you? Twitter is at Satanic Psalms, S-A-T-A-N-I-C-P-S-A-L-M-S. And our website is TheSatanicTemple.com. Beautiful. Oh man. And find us on Facebook too. We do a lot of updates on Facebook. That's the most Satanic thing you've said so far. Yeah. Well, a lot of the action seems to be there. Okay, cool. Thank you so much. It's been a real pleasure talking with you. And I really appreciate it. Thanks for listening everybody. That was Lucian Greaves. And a big thanks to Nature Box.

From Baudelaire. Translated by James L. Roy Flecker. Read by Stephen Collins. O Granus of the Angels, and most wise, O fallen God, fate driven from the skies. Satan, at last take pity on our pain. O first of exiles who endurest wrong, yet growest, and thy hatred still more strong. Satan, at last take pity on our pain. O subterranean king, omniscient, healer of man's immortal discontent. Satan, at last take pity on our pain. Two lepers and two outcasts thou dost show, that passion is the paradise below. Satan, at last take pity on our pain. Thou, by thy mistress death has given to man, hope, the imperishable courtesion. Satan, at last take pity on our pain. Thou give us the guilty, their calm mean, which damns the crowd around the guillotine. Satan, at last take pity on our pain. Thou knowest the corners of the jealous earth, where God is hidden jewels of great worth. Satan, at last take pity on our pain. Thou dost discover by mysterious signs, where sleep the buried people of the mines. Satan, at last take pity on our pain. Thou stretches forth the saving hand to keep, such men as roam upon the roofs and sleep. Satan, at last take pity on our pain. Thy power can make the halting drunkard's feet, avoid the peril of the surging street. Satan, at last take pity on our pain. Thou, to console our helplessness, displot, the cunning use of powder and of shot. Satan, at last take pity on our pain. Thy awful name is written, as with pitch, on the unrelenting foreheads of the rich. Satan, at last take pity on our pain. In strange and hidden places thou dost move, where women cry for torture in their love. Satan, at last take pity on our pain. Father of those whom God's temptuous ire has flung from paradise with sword and fire. Satan, at last take pity on our pain. Prayer Satan, to thee be praised upon the height, where thou wast king of old and in the night, of hell, without a stream on silently. Grant that one day beneath the knowledge tree, when it shoots forth to grace thy royal brow, my soul may sit that cries upon thee now.

Journey Town Classics and the Gimlet Boys present Lies of the Moon Butler by Denon Sinch Read by Gail Bench Chapter 2 Dark Side of the Moon Butler Hunt woken for a few blissful moments imagined himself to be back in the servant quarters nestled in the silken sheets that were given to all Royal Moon Servants, even the Butler. President Cartwright was no fool and she understood that it was the little things that gained the greatest loyalty. The sound of a buzzer in the whooshing slide of the Vibratech security door woke him up to the reality of his situation. He was hanging buck naked in a Telethic Suspenser Beam, a sonic spiderweb of subacoustic sound that was keeping him immobile, completely vulnerable, and totally exposed. Beams of bright light suddenly filled the chamber, making him blind and paralyzed. All he could see was light. All he could feel was the pulsing vibration of the Telethic Suspenser. It was strangely pleasant, soothing, calming, but the voice on the other side of that light was stern as the crack of lightening against a dry willow. Well, well, if it isn't the coming Butler, Snapped Guard Finch, I guess you think you got one over on us, Gautrexian mutt? And with that, the soothing pulse of the Suspenser shifted and heated up. It felt as though we were being roasted over a blazing fire while rodents nibbled at his face. Welcome to hell, Butler Hunt, said Guard Finch. What you are experiencing is the cutting edge of moon torture equipment. With a simple press of a button, I can make you feel anything. Ever wondered what it feels like to have your thumb smashed in a door? With all due respect, I know what that feels like, whispered Butler Hunt. Well then, said Guard Finch, that was going to be the only torture for today. But since you have so much experience and bad feelings, let me introduce you to the sensation of being tap-danced upon by a troop of 700-pound jazzer-sized instructors wearing red-hot high heels made of molten lead. God, no, gasped the Butler. There was the sound of a beep and a dry robotic voice whispered, running tap-danced torture simulation 498. For a horrible moment, he felt the sudden pressure of flaming hot high heels against his exposed naked flesh when the security door whooshed open again in a voice that made his heart surge with love and fear filled the room. I told you I would handle this, Guard Finch. The voice of President Cartwright was soft, but carried with it the weight of a gavel made of a thousand mountains. We'll talk about this later, Gregory. Be gone. Yes, my president, said Guard Finch, and Butler Hunt heard the sound of his boots marching from the room. So now it's just you and me, said President Cartwright. Her voice is playful as a cat with a wounded mouse. Do you know what I went through to become president of the moon? Cassandra asked, turning off the blinding lights. As his eyes adjusted, he saw that President Cartwright was wearing an official interrogation uniform that had been specially made for her by torture expert, Dan Lee Frye. It was a beautiful leather suit, dyed in purple. It accentuated every curve of her luscious body until it reached her thighs, where it spread down in tendrils of violet leather that ended in her torture boots. Military grade open-toed boots with razor sharp heels. His eyes fell upon her boots and beautiful exposed feet. Now you know why my feet get so sore, Butler. I've been spending more and more time in this hard chamber interrogating more moon citizens than I would like to admit. It seems that Emperor Gautrax is not quite as dead as we thought, but I'm sure you already know this, traitor. No, Madam President, said Butler Hunt. A tear rolled down his cheek across his beautiful lips. They made eye contact, and then Butler Hunt began weeping. Greetings, my beautiful ones. It's me, Duncan, and this is the Duncan Trestle Family Hour podcast, reporting to you from Austin, Texas. Of course, what you just heard is an excerpt from the upcoming Audible erotic classic, Lies of the Moon Butler. Check that out on Audible. The entire Moon Butler series is pretty incredible. Friends, we have a glorious podcast for you today. Gabby Hurstick is here with us today. Holy shit. Strap in. Get ready to learn about witchcraft, sex magic, and much, much more, including how to banish those dark energies and potentially demonic forces that might be clustered about your home and maybe even in your heart. We're going to jump right into it, but first this. I want to thank Athletic Greens for supporting this episode of the DTFH. My friends, I don't have to tell you that if your brain had nipples, these days would seem like a sander that somebody had non-consensually shoved those nipples against. We're in stressful times. Let's just face it. There's so much insanity going on, and we need a way to simplify our existence. This is where Athletic Greens comes in. Follow me here, friends. I know you know people who are like those vitamin people who have like 17,000 different types of vitamins. They take a day. Maybe they have vitamin dispensers they use for that project, or maybe they've got one of those weird robotic things that dispenses their vitamins. I've seen, I've had friends who have big bags of vitamins they carry around like they're going out into the desert and all they're going to eat is vitamins. I've watched friends projectile vomit vitamins into the air like sick whales spraying this mixture of vitamin E and D out of their mouths just because they didn't eat food before they took their vitamins. I don't want to be that person. I don't have time. I'm not disciplined enough, organized enough, or smart enough to keep track of 16,000 different types of vitamins, which is why I love Athletic Greens. It's a life-changing nutritional habit.

She's a profoundly enchanting, wonderful person. And I was really, really blown away by this conversation. So here we go. Everybody, welcome to the DTFH Gabriella Hirstik. Gabriella, welcome to the DTFH. I'm so excited to talk to you today. Oh my God. I'm so happy to be here. Thank you for having me. I want to congratulate you. I follow your Twitter and your socials. And I want to congratulate you on a, did you say a thousand consecutive days of practice? What? That is nuts. How many, wait, I started Calculate. What is that? It's over three years? Today, August 5th is two years and nine months of daily practice. Oh my God. That is, that is just so impressive. Thank you. It made me wonder, what does that look like for you? What is your daily practice? Yeah. Well, I just want to say first off, I am single with no children and pretty much, I work for myself. So I have a lot of luxury when it comes to how I use my time, which I feel like if I had a family or if I was in a relationship, maybe it wouldn't be quite as much of a priority to literally not miss a day. So I always tell people, don't do what I do if you miss a day of meditating. It's not a big deal. Just get back to it. Just keep going. I'm just very competitive with myself. So I was like, I can't lose this streak and now I really can't. But my daily practice is about an hour in the mornings, every morning. It's definitely a mix of different traditions, I guess. I have some ceremonial magic in there. I start off with the lesser banishing ritual of the pentagram, which just clears the space of any negative energies, puts the archangels around me, that kind of thing to just really center myself. I do a daily prayer to one of the goddesses I work with. I do seated meditation. And then after that, I will pull tarot cards and journal. And I have this ongoing gratitude practice with one of my best friends, where every day we send each other voice notes of what we're grateful for and then talk about it. So I record that and just say all the things I'm grateful for as part of my practice and then end my practice with affirmation. So there's a lot of different pieces of it. And tomorrow I'm going to be traveling. And when life gets life-y, like when it hits a fan, there's definitely things that like, okay, I don't have to journal today, I don't have to pull my tarot cards, whatever. But the seated meditation and the LBRP are non-negotiable. I will do that in a bathroom. I will do that while I'm seated with my eyes closed. Those are just things that I have committed to. But most of the time, I would say about 95% of the time I'm able to do the whole practice because I prioritize it. It's just something that, especially after the past year of just everything being absolutely bananas with COVID, I've really, really been able to see how much of a sustaining force and how much of an empowering practice it is for me to have that time just devoted to going inward, being with myself, really accepting where I am that day. And there's times where maybe I don't feel the best coming out of meditation, but I would say that 97% to 99% of the time I leave my meditation practice feeling better than when I went in it. Wow. Now you said a lot there. I think something I've always been very interested in, and I've actually tried it once, is the lesser banishing ritual of the pentagram. And because now I've just primarily studied Buddhism, I've sort of gone away from your lineage, not for any other reason than it's just mainly for what you just said. I got kids. I don't know if I wish I had the time to do an hour every day. And I think I could make that work. But regardless, I wonder if you could sort of give me a brief teaching about the lesser banishing ritual of the pentagram. Yeah. So the lesser banishing ritual of the pentagram is one of the first rituals that you will learn in really any kind of like Western mystery tradition, which is the lineage of the Golden Dawn. Aleister Crowley's work is a part of that as well. But this is specifically a ritual based in Golden Dawn magic, which works with the Kabbalistic Tree of Life, which originates as a symbol and glyph of the universe and Jewish mysticism. But the kind of Kabbalah I study is overlaid with different hermetic principles like tarot cards and planets and all that kind of stuff. So the lesser banishing ritual is a ritual of the elements and of the body. It aligns you with the Tree of Life through the highest fear, which is like the Godhead to the material realm. And really what it does is it aligns your personal will, which is visualized as this horizontal line with the divine will, which is a vertical line. And this forms across in the body. You can imagine like going through like, you know, your head to your toes is like this divine energy, and then going from shoulder to shoulder is this human energy. And that's what's called like that, that beginning of the ritual is what's called the Kabbalistic Cross is where you really like align yourself with the divine with the highest possible frequency available to you. And then you go around the room and you make pentagrams. And what these pentagrams do is that they banish this, they banish any kind of negative energy, any energy that's not aligned with this divine 100% divine light. And as you're doing these pentagrams, you're speaking these different Hebrew words that just kind of reinforce this idea of banishing this energy. So you've aligned yourself with the divine, banished energy around your room, you visualize these pentagrams in every direction surrounding you. And then you call in angelic forces, the four archangels or four of the archangels that correspond to the different elements and different directions to, to really connect you with earth, air, fire, water as these like different kind of embodied expressions of the divine. So you call in these different angels, and then you finish again with this ritual called the Kabbalistic Cross, which continues to align you with the divine. So even though it's considered a banishing ritual, you are still doing invocations, which means you're calling forth these different energies and entities. So like, it's like you're vacuuming and then like, like energetically vacuuming a space, and then you're like calling in like reinforcements to make sure that like, you know, there's not nothing is going to get muddied up again, for lack of a better word. So it's definitely like a weird ritual, it uses Hebrew and it works with archangels that are found in the Bible. So I mean, golden dawn magic is like, it is based in like Abrahamic religions, which I totally get isn't, you know, something that a lot of people, something that people are, maybe it doesn't resonate with them, right? We each have to find what kind of practices and lineages resonate with us. But I, I grew up Jewish, my dad's a rabbi, I had a bat mitzvah. So for me, like the, the Hebrew part of it and the, the working with this kind of Jewish mystical current in a way that's not necessarily Jewish feels very resonant. And I just really enjoy the ritual. It's just something that like, I feel like it's kind of like part of my psychic hygiene, I would say it helps me just feel like I'm really cleansing my space. And then when I do my meditation and affirmations, that's kind of like the more microcosmic, like going inward, focused cleansing that I do. So it's more of like a compliment. And it's, it's a ritual that you can really like adapt. There's different versions of it. But yeah, it's something that I, I enjoy doing it, but I definitely feel like some people love it. And some people are like, I don't like this at all. I think it's beautiful. I've seen, I've just watched videos of people doing it. So I'm right now, I'm really interested in spiritual hygiene. I started, I don't even know why I started doing it. I started looking at the Islamic purification rituals and then started thinking about the, my friends who have taken ayahuasca, I never have. And you know, the report of being cleansed or purified of some kind of, you know, I don't know what you would even call it. Maybe you have a word for it. But I'm really interested in that right now, just because just purely out of curiosity, I did this cleansing ritual that they recommend and was astounded by the shift in my energy that happened right away. What, if you had, what are the words that are used for what dark energy or for the lingering stuff that can get caught on a person or in a space? What is that? And obviously you must think of it as something more than like symbolic. Like you, many people like consider it to be as real as a disease. What is it? That's such a good question. I wish I had like a concrete answer, but I feel like part of this journey through like the metaphysical is like knowing things are, are there, but not necessarily being able to like quantify them in like a logical way, because they're things that kind of divide that like very logical aspect of reality, right? These are like subtle forces and subtle energy. So like I would just describe them as energies. I personally like, you know, some people might describe them as demonic entities or spirits. Like there's a wide array of like what people conceptualize as demons. Some people think that they're manifestations of our psyche, right? Like I know that some people think that they literally are actual demons. I'm probably somewhere between them. I don't really spend too much time like trying to figure out the what exactly. I just kind of like do my best to make sure that I'm, you know, centered and that I'm protecting myself and like doing these kind of like purification rituals as well as like in meditation I do shielding. So I literally visualize like a sphere or bubble around me and like declare that only energy that vibrates a hundred percent divine light and works in my highest favor can like penetrate that shield and that kind of those kind of exercises to really keep out those forces. But I think there's a lot of different energy. I think there's a lot of different expressions of those kind of like more difficult to handle energies, I guess. I think, you know, they can be collective residue of like our, you know, like our fear. It kind of comes in egregore. Like with COVID, like all of us are, I mean, I'm still working through and untangling the trauma of the past year. You know, like so many of us are lived in these deep states of fear where like our nervous systems were fried. And like, you know, when you focus on something and when a collective, a group of people is focusing on something, it's like drawing in that energy and it becomes its own thing, right? It's like a egregore, like, which is kind of like a spirit that comes to be when a lot of people focus on a certain thing, which may or may not be like a living entity, but is definitely a real energy. And I think that can be part of it. I think part of it can be like, you know, maybe being really stressed and having like, not having a good day and being around other people who are negative and then you bring kind of like those people's energy into your space. Or if you're on land where there was, you know, like really intense negative violence that happened, like those energies can get trapped there in the physical land. So there's definitely like a lot of different manifestations of that kind of like darkness, which is why I think that having any kind of like practice that you do, whether it's using smoke or, you know, saying like a cleansing mantra or doing the LBRP and like, it starts within, right? Like if you're in a place of being centered and you're in a place where you feel like you are protected and you are doing what you need to do to really like not linger in those other people's dark energies or in these spirits or whatever, like when you have that kind of inner protection, then I feel like it's a lot easier. It's like do so in your, you know, in your space. And of course, like mental illness is real. Like that is also can feel like a spirit outside of yourself, like haunting you. So I don't think there's one one thing, you know what I mean? I think that's part of the beauty of having like a spiritual practice or living a spiritual life that we got to create these practices and we got to use the tools that work for us, that resonate with us, that help us like maybe focus less on the what and more on the why. So we can like move, move through these states of, you know, darkness and feel at least like we're in control because like, are we, are we ever in control? I don't know, which is, you know, I wonder that a lot. Yes and no. Well, I mean, look, I'm telling you, maybe the reason I'm interested in spiritual hygiene right now is because I'm in Austin staying at a chain of Airbnb. And it's like, you know, you walk into some, you walk into some of these homes and it's like outside of just the, you know, funky carpet smell. If you have the slightest openness, you can feel something if something's off, you know, and in the same way you, you know, just even talking to you, I could see that your space is all sparkly. And I knew if I was there with you, I would be like, ah, when we went to, when I would go to Ram Dass's house because he had practice, a beautiful love-based practice, it was like walking into some kind of like, you know, it's, I don't know, Tolkien elf house or something, just pure love and like, and you walk into some like some of these Airbnb's and it's like, holy shit, what happened here? Like, what was going on? And then I, then my next thought is, or is it a screen that's allowing you to see a reflection of your unacknowledged stuff? So I'm not going to linger on this much longer, but is there a, and forgive me for trying to find some kind of cliff notes, easy way of doing that, but is there like a more simplified way of cleansing a space that doesn't involve memorizing Hebrew words and doing the lesser banishing ritual, something we can just do when we walk into one of those weird fields of darkness that often appears in just houses that we find ourselves going into? Oh yeah, definitely. I mean, I think that real magic doesn't need any tools. And I think that there's a couple different ways you could really like, protect yourself and visualize. Like, you can go into space and like doing something, especially in a place like an Airbnb, which is like, people are constantly coming and going, which leads to like a very liminal space because there's not like anything really like grounding that energy. It's very temporal, I guess, because it's like between here and there, you know, there's not even like a hotel staff, right? Like, it's like very, I mean, I guess the people that live there, but like, I don't know. I, you could go into a space and like clap and just like go, when you're banishing something, you traditionally go counterclockwise. So you could like, start in the back and go counterclockwise and just clap and declare like, any negative energies that don't serve my highest good, that are not aligned with 100% divine light are banished here. Like, if you have salt, you can sprinkle salt in the corners. You can, you know, like, some places don't allow you to like burn herbs and not everybody has access to like herbs, but you could do some kind of like spray Florida water if you have it. And then you can just do some visualizations, like visualizing a sphere of protective light, like emanating from your heart and growing into a sphere around you and pushing out any negative energy. And you can visualize that kind of like metallic or mirrored sphere, like surrounding the whole environment that you're in. Wait, wait, what's that? What's the mirrored sphere? I saw that. I'm so sorry to do this to you. I know I smoke DMT once and went into some kind of metallic. What is that? What's the metallic? What is that? I personally, I like visualizing like a mirrored orb around me when I need a lot of protection, because like, I feel like it reflects and refracts any kind of unwanted negative energy back into the universe. You know, it's like, you declare that only that which serves your highest good or whatever, whatever kind of language resonates with you, maybe like, only, you know, like I only let energy that is good for me into the space and any negative energy is reflected, refracted, you know, sent back to sender. Like I think that it doesn't have to be a mirror, right? You can visualize different colors based on kind of the energy that you want to draw in. So if you're really looking maybe to have like a more calming space, you could work with like a blue sphere. If you work with astrology, you could like, you know, connect that to Jupiter. So it's only like very like good auspicious energy that is moving into your into your space. But I feel like the mirrored sphere is like very good at like really protecting you. So you can visualize that like encompassing your whole Airbnb, your room, you can visualize it around you. Like if you're in a crowd and you're like, I do not want any of these people's energies, you can kind of shield that way. But yeah, those are some examples. And just like, centering yourself right, taking breaths, like stomping your feet, clapping your hands, like kind of jolting that energy, any negative energy away is another way to do it as well.

I'm really illiterate when it comes to the goddess and I've heard you talk about the goddess as like the whole goddess and then individual goddesses and I wonder if you could help me understand you know and as I was thinking what are we going to talk about I started thinking about God I use the word a lot but then I start thinking like what do I even mean by that word I I don't understand the term God anymore than I understand the term goddess and I wonder if you could teach me about that. Yay well I feel like that's kind of the weird enigma with these things too it's like once it's like an energy that you like like even if you say you don't understand it I feel like you really have a beautiful balance of both of those energies like I I kind of conceptualize the way that I conceptualize the divine feminine the goddess is like the it's pretty similar how I can conceptualize the divine masculine I really think that there are two ends of a spectrum but there are different extremes of the same energy or you can think of it as like yin and yang where there are complements with little pieces of each energy but I have a different I have kind of a couple different ways of conceptualizing them one is more of a cobalistic way of thinking about them where the divine feminine is more of like the form and the actual physical embodiment of the energy of creation like the body the earth the energy of like sexuality as embodied and felt through the flesh whereas God would be more of like that kind of force energy the spark of creation the creative expansive energy um so like that's kind of one way to think where they're both you can find one through the other like they're both energies of like wow something coming to life where like the divine masculine might be more of like the seed that that initiates it but then the feminine is more of the expansive energy that is able to like hold that kind of force but for me the way that I really work with goddess energy the way that I think about that and conceptualize it in my own practice is the energy of love the energy of connection to all living beings both you know like all sentient beings the earth um the cosmos and I also think of it as a frequency that I can tap into that is um liminal that's intuitive that is not in the head but that is felt through the body that is felt in the heart that is expressed through creativity um and I'm writing right now about the divine masculine and it's really interesting because I do think that they're very like complementary energies of that like you can find the masculine through this kind of like warrior phallic feminine energy um seen through goddesses of war and like love and you can also find the divine masculine through the emotions and through compassion and through being grounded in that so I don't necessarily even think of them as separate just personally like I really like feel in service to the divine feminine specifically because we are living in a time that is so um patriarchal and that has been so kind of patriarchal for so long that I feel like if we want to find balance between these two extremes the pendulum has been so far swung in the the masculine kind of mode of reality that like to get to the balance we have to swing the other way we have to go to the feminine we have to go back to like the you know anti-capitalist more feeling more um flowing kind of energy before we can find um a midway point and that's kind of why I feel like like I feel like you are I mean I know that's part of the what you study but like you have such um your heart really shines through with everything that you do I mean I feel like you really do have such a beautiful balance of that kind of like masculine and feminine so even if you don't necessarily like understand it I feel like you embody it really beautifully thank you well I would like to you know I like the way I understand it right now I get I get to be around my wife and watch her breath you know give milk I mean it's the most when you watch it and you think about it it seems like something a baby made up you know it's like the way humans are like just the idea of like well you put your mouth on your mother and then sweet milk I've if you ever tasted breast milk oh we've got not as an adult you gotta get you some it's you got to you gotta taste it because it's sweet it like at least my like it's it's sweet but it's it's it's like intense and it is it's you know it is this it is for lack of it's it's love it's this pure white like condensed love and then it like changes if the baby is sick it changes and gives the baby nutrients to help the sickness it's the most on one level I know it's like it's just the way things work but on another level it is the most absurdly beautiful thing you've ever seen in your life and so I think I kind of can understand the goddess from that perspective of it's this like dreamy sort of impossibility that's what makes the entire planet or at least the all sentient beings that have mamas like stay alive but then yeah and which is weird because I was watching this awesome video popped up on Reddit of a squirrel mother just like laying back with her kids suckling at her and I'm looking at the squirrel mother's expression and thinking of my wife's expression when she's exhausted and the baby's drinking her milk and then thinking about like oh my god it transcends species you know what I mean this is the same is that the goddess it's that you know give it just is giving and it and not um and it can't I don't know how to put it it's so merciful it's so ferocious in its giving or something you know like it's ferocious in its ability to just give itself to things so is that a description of it I would I would say so definitely I think for me like one of the aspects of the divine feminine too is this idea of imminence of this divinity being present in everything which is also a very tantric view where you know like god is exist in everything even that which we consider you know like unholy or dark like the divine feminine is a lot of the goddesses of love are also goddesses of war there's there's this intense duality with it and you know like a lot of the more patriarchal Abrahamic religions like there's this idea of transcendence that you have to leave the body to find the divine that you know the divine like god is in a cloud somewhere god is not here but really the goddess to mean like goddess religion and like that kind of goddess energy is one of seeing this incredible beauty and power and just like sacredness this holiness in and everything in a squirrel in a tree right like in being able to make eye contact with somebody it's a very transcendent force but it is also very full of dualities that kind of contradict each other which I feel like is a very like magical thing in general to kind of have these contradicting forces that also complements each other I'm curious why if okay so you have recognized you clearly recognize this like complete imbalance in this old crusty antiquated patriarchal bullshit that just isn't even working anymore that's the problem it's just not I mean I think it maybe it was working during the industrial revolution or whatever but now it's not even working and nothing that's humiliating it and it doesn't want to be humiliating it so that's making its dig its heels in even more but I'm curious why write a book on the divine masculine in a time where you know it feels like things are already imbalanced enough towards the masculine why does the masculine get your attention right now versus you know the going in the other going in the other direction okay so I do want to clarify I I'm writing a chapter I'm writing a book called sacred sex which is about sacred sexuality and I have a bunch of different chapters that speak of different ways of working with sex as a spiritual tool as a spiritual path one of the the one of the chapters is on the more divine feminine as passed through these um temple precesses of the ancient days which were women who would serve the goddesses of love and engage in sexual rituals with people who would come and worship the goddess um so they're known as sacred prostitutes I I think that kind of sacred and profane I don't really dig that so I call them erotic votaries there's a chapter on that but I also think that there's no space for men to be emotional or to be connected to their pleasure or to feel that more quote unquote kind of femininity within them and um I think that it's patriarchy is as much of a disservice to men as it is to women I mean women we got the brunt of it more you know like we're the ones that receive the violence more and we're the ones that are really shushed in many ways right but there's no space for men to connect with their emotions there's no space for men to think about their pleasure in a way that's not this trope of toxic masculinity so it's really important for me to include a chapter on what it means for the divine masculine to be embodied but I am writing a book about goddesses called goddess energy that'll be out sometime next year so that's definitely where more of my focus is on but I definitely felt like it was it feels really important for me and it also is something that like you know like I'm sure that you have this with your podcast and your comedy it's like when you're working on something even if it's for an audience like it heals a part of you or you learn about yourself through it and for me it's like as I'm writing these books like I my life kind of turns into this like alchemical furnace that just like burns with whatever I'm writing about and writing about the divine masculine it it's healing my relationship to it because I do have animosity and resentment towards towards a patriarchy you know and um I don't want to have that especially as a woman who like also worships the divine masculine and who also like likes men like um I just it was it's something that I'm doing because I think it's really important but it's also something I'm doing because like I know that if it's something I need it's something that other people need as well oh god yeah I mean we don't even I don't like guys don't we understand like divine masculine there's that's the other thing that's going on is I think like a lot of guys are like you know really not wanting to be assholes to and like wanting to sort of figure out wait what is what where is the part of me that is like this is this is what it is like I'm a dad you know and like part of being a dad there's like a I have to distinguish like a good dad and all the good things I learned from my dad from all the like my dad had PTSD man my dad was like you know like which I think what we call toxic masculinity a lot of times it's just PTSD it's just yeah um so it's like like untangling those two things is such a mind fuck because you know there's all the all the things associated with masculinity I think are like are also things associated with what happens when you come back from World War 2 like the way John Wayne acts that's the way somebody who saw his friends get exploded or something would act it's like you don't show emotion you don't feel pain you're constantly like exercising or something and like you know what I mean so untangling the two things is a real mind fuck and I know a lot I think a lot of guys want to be able to successfully do that but then also don't want to like be phony in it because there's nothing worse than that when a guy's like faking being like that I'm a good guy oh yeah I'm healed oh yeah thank you Squarespace for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH Squarespace is great if you've been listening to the DTFH for any amount of time I'm sure you've heard me to the Squarespace horn but it never stops being amazing I

that's the thing too it's like we're not giving space for this healing and there's this kind of idea that like there's a weakness in admitting that you're not okay there's weakness in that healing when I think that that is such an act of like compassionate strength to admit that like you need to do the inner work I mean we have the way that we failed veterans in this country is horrible I you know it's the patriarchy the blood of the patriarchy is not on any specific person's hands it's not on any generation's hands it's something that's been happening for a long time but I really do feel very amidst a lot of fear with the future of just like the earth there's a lot of hope for the generations that are doing the work the generations to come that are doing the work and that we gotta redefine what masculinity means to us in service of all people who identify as masculine or who have we all have masculine energy you know what I mean like it's these energies divine feminine divine masculine they that's the language that we have because it's the language that we've had and I you know as our language evolves it'll be more supportive and expressing that these are not things that are related to genitals like these are energies that all that exist within all of us that we live we live in because we live in a world of duality you know what I mean like until we don't live in that kind of polarized world um until that time comes like we have we have to work with what we have in this physical realm and that means using this kind of dualistic model of the divine to to find our way through life in and um I think that healing the masculine and yeah just like healing we're doing it but it's it's definitely um it'll take time yes and probably maybe too much time let's hope not yeah I would love to talk with you a little bit about sex magic I um it's something that I have tried in the past with some pretty amazing results to the point where and I don't mess with it I've got freaked out by its efficacy and then you know and but um I'd love to like I think one thing that is a secret something that secretly haunts a lot of folks is porn and like when we're talking about the sacred and the profane you know to me like if I do have to think of something profane which I agree with you I mean I think getting too caught up in that then you've got guilt and then you next thing you know what are you what are you you're like whipping your back or something in a non-fun way you know you're like you become like secretly like you feel like a secret freak which is the worst kind of freak to feel like you want to be a public freak but but um is you know do you think that like porn is like collect like is one of those things that brings darkness into a person's life or has the potential to maybe enforce some of the toxic masculinity stuff and like in like or do you feel like there is a way to you know to to like actually that porn and sex magic can happen together as it could just be another tool I'm just curious your thoughts on it because there's an entire like raging debate over whether or not it's like fucking people up you know if neurologically or whatever I'm just curious what your take on that is um okay I have to be very blunt and honest and say like I don't watch porn because it gives me fomo like I'm like I want to be doing that and doing these weird things and having this like crazy sex so I've just like never really been somebody who who watches it I have a very uh active imagination and a plethora of sexual energy to work with so like I just um I'm you know I just want to say like I'm saying this as somebody who's like I have friends who do porn um I support sex workers unconditionally like I think that decriminalization of sex work would help us have less uh maybe bad kind of examples of porn but I think it's it's kind of like anything it's how you use it I mean like even if you don't watch porn you watch movies and like I would those kind of reenactments of sex are also like pretty harmful sometimes and totally like not real and I'm like there's not even any it's you know there's definitely layers to it I think that um it can be a tool I part of the the practice of sex magic is raising sexual energy so like you could totally watch porn as a way to begin that process but like like any kind of magic there's a lot of a focus and attention that goes into it and I do think that if you were to like watch porn the whole time it could you know like you're not going to really be able to focus on your intention like I I don't want to I I don't think it's necessarily like um a good or bad thing I think that there are better ways of making porn that are ethical and that support everybody involved and um there are ways that are you know totally probably like not consensual and like like like anything else um I really feel like with the internet we're able to kind of see how like everything really exists on the spectrum like the internet's great like I can talk to you I can do zoom rituals with the lodge I attend and I can also like probably you know like hire a hitman or do something horrible on it you know like find the darkest depth so I think with porn it's more of like somebody's relationship with it and it's like anything like you can you know feel a psychological need for it which can you know it's like I was I was smoking too much weed and gave myself bronchitis and then COVID happened like I loved weed and I was using it for anxiety and then I just got mentally um addicted to it right like yes it's not to say that weed's a bad thing but it is to say that I wasn't using it responsibly and I didn't have the best boundaries with it so I think like it can be a tool it's not really I can't really speak from experience with using it as a tool um but I do think that there's some really really like incredible um re-envisioning re-imagining re-envisioning um of what porn could look like like I um really love um four chambers they're a really cool like group headed by this amazing woman named Vex that does like a lot of very magical and surreal and like artistic porn so um and you know there's like a lot of ethical porn now and a lot more like feminist porn so I think it's like anything like the tide's changing and I think it will I mean I would like I know that there's a cult porn out there I just haven't really wandered into that water but I'm sure that um as we continue getting deeper into this esoteric revival that we're in that that'll definitely show up more. What is raising sex magic and what does that mean that I raising sexual energy I mean is like you know is it is it just the same thing as when you think someone's hot and then you start getting turned off is that just a way of saying that or is it can you just describe that a little bit more? Yeah so sex magic really is using sexual energy for an intention it can be an intention like getting to know yourself sexually erotically more it can be um manifesting something like money it can be um as an act of devotion so like I work with sex magic as a way of like I give my sexual energies an offering to the goddesses that I work with um you can do sex magic to like I used it to find an apartment it can really be anything because sexual energy is is life energy that's literally how we're creating life it's anybody who's ever been horny knows how powerful and how like physical that feels I mean like you know like when you really are like oh my god I need a fuck or like this person's so hot I can't like it feels you feel it in your body all sex sex magic is is working with that intentionally and there's layers to it I mean you could literally just like focus on an intention and masturbate and like visualize the energy moving towards your intention and then as you're laying in the afterglow like visualize what it would be like to feel like to have that intention manifest that's a really simple kind of way and then you can also like circulate the energy the sexual energy like through your body and do breath work with it and visualize like a sigil or like like becoming a different a goddess or a god or like um you know like connecting to like somebody else's energy there's there's lots of different ways to do it but really what it is is working consciously with sexual energy which like I would argue is the most powerful energy we have simply because it's the energy that sustains life you know like it's literally like why we're all here even if we're um you know for test two babies or if we're like it doesn't really matter like that that energy is still like it's still creative energy it's still life-giving energy um so it's really just using that for a desired purpose and um there's a lot of different ways to do that but it's also fun I'm like if we're gonna masturbate or fuck anyway like why not make it a magical practice um and I think right now too like there's such um there's such like a rejection of the flesh in a lot of spiritual communities there's such a rejection of sexuality as a part of like the spirit that I do think that sex magic is super important because it reminds us that like actually like many many ancient cultures many ancient traditions many ancient religions have worked with sexual energy as a part of spiritual practice I mean like you see it in Kabbalah you see it in in Tantra you see it like there's it's it's actually not something that's separate like they're two sides of the same coin I mean like anybody who's had sex like knows the liminality of it and knows that kind of like power that comes from your ego being dissolved like it's called you know like orgasm and french's le petit mort the little death like it is literally an ego annihilation that allows you to connect with something bigger so it's really just using that intentionally um in a ritual setting which can be as involved or as simple as you want it to be and all can you talk a little I just think this is something people out there need to hear and I would imagine have some thoughts on this is like do you think okay consensual sex does not just mean like the person you're with is saying it's okay don't you think consensual sex means don't do sex magic on people who haven't told you that it's okay for you to do that even if you know what I mean isn't there like isn't there a way you can having never someone having never met someone kind of encroach on their space it's using this these some of these techniques yes I think that I personally like I won't do sex magic most of my sex magic practice is solo I always suggest if you are starting a sex magic practice if you want to get to know yourself in that way or manifest like starting with yourself first and laying that foundation and understanding your erotic energy um is always going to be more fruitful and then you can work with somebody else um trust is a really important factor whether it's somebody you're you know having like doing sex magic with that's maybe like anonymous or a partner I think having that trust is super important but um I I think the thing with magic too is that like I could tell you what I believe I could tell you that like I personally only practice sex magic with people who are aware and consenting yes um but that's that's me everybody's gonna I think a big part of being a sex witch or working with sexual energy in this way is having your own set of ethics having your own belief system and knowing what feels right for you because it has to resonate with you um so like I mean I have I have like thought about people and sent energy when they don't know about it but also how many of us have masturbated while thinking about people that have no idea or masturbating about them good point so it's not really as black and white as we think and also like with love and sex magic too it's like if there is not a seed of reciprocity like if I'm doing sex magic about somebody who has absolutely no idea I exist like that there's nothing there's no seed to water that's not probably gonna manifest you know like it's like if I'm doing a love spell or sex magic around somebody who likes me a little bit then I can cause that to grow and expand but if that's not there then it's like you know not nothing's gonna really happen and like things get tricky like I personally am just in a camp of like I don't fuck with anybody else's free will I fuck with my own free will I do what feels aligned for me but like I just personally like I'm like I don't really cast hexes I don't really do that kind of thing like I do think there's a time and place I definitely believe there's a time and place but just because like that's just like the kind of moral stance ethics that I believe that aligns with like with my practice so it's not as black and white as people think and it's also like not gonna be the end of the world if you like think about somebody when you're doing sex magic like do you want to start off that way probably not but like also like I don't think a pit in hell is going to open up not a pit in hell but more of like an unfair like let me ask you this can you tell when other people are doing that to you oh um yes I think so but I think it's if I can it's with people that like I already kind of have an erotic connection right like and I'm definitely like very perceptive and definitely like probably like you know like I I don't really use the word psychic but I definitely have those qualities but it's like I'm not I feel like there's a lot more people like honestly jacking off to me that I are just strangers on the internet that I never want to know about than like people that like I do want to know about um so like I I don't really spend so much time wearing it I think wearing about it I think that kind of goes back to like to like my um the psychic hygiene stuff like that's just like I protect my energy so like only that which I'm like oh like I want to know about kind of moves through that sphere yeah I just you know it's sometimes I mean without getting into you I don't embarrass anybody or just sound like a complete limber I do think folks should know like it's not like it's not like it's a one-way street it's like if someone's sensitive they might be able to like you know catch a glimpse of like oh you're doing that that's okay it's like I mean you know it's sweet you know or whatever but also I don't know I just wonder like I think technology is going to get to a place where the energy that you're cleansing when you're clapping and doing that stuff is not going to be something that people just talk about but rather it's going to be like oh that's some new form of dark matter some quantum field or something that we just couldn't uh measure uh but people are already intuited so I when you start thinking about that and then you start getting into like the interdependency that we all also already talk about the web of life at the connection then in their consent becomes really curious in the sense that right now consent is more about the physical body I'm with you is this okay versus like can I send energy through the weird psychic mucilial network that connects us to shift your consciousness a little bit in a way that serves my purposes you know it's interesting I don't know I mean not I don't need to get in the way I don't even there's probably something already written out there about occult consent but it's just something I was curious to me yeah but then it also goes through it's like if you're sending healing energy to somebody and they don't consent to it right like what these kind of these energies are you know different but also it's like what is that like that's technically like a hex because that person doesn't consent to the energy but like is that okay so there's definitely layers of nuance I definitely think that like yeah like you know like if if somebody were to do a lot of sex magic on me and I were to meet them I'd probably either like if I already like them then I'd probably be like why am I so attracted to this person or turned on by them or I'd be like this person is giving me the heebie-jeebies and I don't want to be around them right um but yeah I definitely um I feel like just because it's like a feeling I don't necessarily like I just like I'll just block block that out if it doesn't really resonate which is you know sometimes the best thing you can do is just like not give something more attention not give something more energy and feed it because when you don't want to pay attention to something that's like that's yeah it's not really what you want to do now oh yes and thank you for that answer it's super cool and that's I never considered the healing hex whoa that's so wild like do we have to I can anyone listening I can send to all positive healing please I'll take every little bit of it right even Christians who are like I'm in a pray frame like please please pray for me please send me good energy that's totally fine like I accept it like I don't care if you're praying to Jesus he was a Jew like he's we're fine it's good like um but yeah it's like there's I think that as humans again like we have this kind of very polarized way of thinking and we want to think things are good or bad but like it's not it's never that black or white especially with like any kind of esoteric or occult thing especially with energy which is like its own you know exists on a different kind of like layer of reality yes now last question we've got about eight minutes I love occult movies but because I'm friends with many people who practice magic who are witches I get offended by the depiction of witches in a lot of these movies that you that come out these are like you know like I like in my wife too or we'll I like I love Ari Astor he's great I like a lot of his movies but some of his fucking movies are like who's like who paid for this movie is the catholic church getting in here you know what I mean like like hereditary for example you know what I mean like and I've heard this movie compared to rosemary's baby rosemary's baby is a depiction of like satanist and I think there's a lot of in there that isn't necessarily that far away it's a little like over emphasizing some of the like it's like do it's like pointing towards like a rapey thing I've most satanists I've ever met are really into like power but they're also into like your own personal authority they're not like that but anyway the whole point is the way in general the occult is depicted in movies do you get offended by that do you watch movies where it's showing witches it's like you know hurting kids or doing these rotten things and feel like offended by it or are you able to just like enjoy it without feeling like getting feeling like it's a personal attack I I kind of I have mixed feelings honestly at this point I kind of just like like it like I'm thinking of like the witch that came out like what like five or six years ago and I love that movie I love like the the witch rubbing the baby's blood on her and then like them all just like on the broomsticks and naked I'm like I want to be in the forest with my friends around a campfire like floating naked in the woods it sounds amazing I personally like I'm the kind of person like I don't really like if I'm hate watching something it's more of like this looks so dumb I'm gonna really enjoy it versus like I hate this I want to like spend energy on it I'm just like I'm of the camp that like it's much more powerful to make something irrelevant and not give any energy to it than it is to hate something and give energy to it like I really believe like if you hate somebody just pretend they don't exist don't even give any energy because it's like so much worse than like hating them and like thinking about them and sending them energy and having them in your sphere so I personally like I like the depictions of movies like I love hocus pocus like I love like yeah like the witch I love the movie the love witch by Anna Biller that came out in 2016 or 2017 maybe so I think they're really fun but I actually like I feel like I watch like five tv shows and that's it and like I know like three movies so I'm like I'm not like a cinephile I would say I really do appreciate a good film and I do like love a good witch moment but I actually feel like I probably watch more of like the cheeky representation of witches than like the more new stuff that's coming out that's like like I know there was like a Salem tv show and like um there's like a couple other witch shows recently like I don't really even watch those as as much but like I like Sabrina I watched the first season and I thought it was pretty good but um it's not gonna get Sabrina's not gonna trigger QAnon people that's a problem I've gotten some creepy messages from QAnon people who are like you fucking devil worshiper you eager and league with the devil it's like what the fuck because you know I mean how many you know how how far away are we from the from the kindling getting lit again you know that's where I just get like a little whatever I didn't mean I don't want to end on a dark note we now have four minutes left I can't believe it because it feels like a millisecond went by talking to you um I thank you so much for coming on the show and I wonder could you please give me and the listeners a little blessing please for this for the new moon okay so yes the new moon or whatever phase uh the cosmic cycle will the cosmic clock will be on may everybody listening be held in a hundred percent pure light that heals you that cleanses you of any worries of any anxieties of any negative energy

Tis I, D Trussell and thou art listening to the Duncan Trussell family hour podcast and no doubt you have barely done anything today because you are still trembling in horror at the catastrophe that happened last night at the Academy Awards. Or as Juliet Goodrich from channel five in San Francisco so aptly put it. I'm Juliet Goodrich. History was made tonight and not in a good way. My dear listeners it is with great hesitation that I play the following clip only because I know that it is probably echoing through your mind at a thousand times per second. And I'm aware that to hear it one more time could be the straw that breaks the camel's back and sends some of you careening out of your cars, out of your homes, out of your offices, out of your subway trains and into a crowd of horrified onlookers who gaze upon you as you blast explosive diarrhea out of every single one of your orifices and fall to the ground like a deflated, oily, trembling beach ball. And yet for the sake of this podcast I feel that I need to play it because I know that there are at least three of my listeners who are stationed in various top secret base stations in Antarctica and don't have access to the Academy Awards. So strap in babies because here it comes. The Academy Award for Best Picture. You're awesome. Come on. La La Land. But you know. I'm sorry. No. There's a mistake. Moonlight. You guys won Best Picture. Moonlight won. Come on. This is not a joke. This is not a joke. I'm afraid they read the wrong thing. This is not a joke. Moonlight has won Best Picture. Moonlight. Best Picture. This is not the way things are supposed to happen. There's never a time when a 42-year-old microdose and ass should start rapping. But I'm panicking because it feels like someone from the Academy got distracted at their cabin at the Bohemian Grove. Found a treasure trove of butt plugs made out of baby skulls and wrote in the wrong envelope. I don't want to live in this simulation. Don't want to live in this nation. Don't want to live in a place where Warren Beatty gives bad award information. Don't want to be negative, but sometimes it feels like the way a creation broke a spoke. This has got to be a joke. This is not. This is not. This is not not not a joke. This is not. This is not. This is not not not a joke. I'm going to find you all individually. And I'm going to f**k you. Warren Beatty, how could you betray me when you read the wrong movie? Man, you f**king elate me. With my heart out, you've broken into pieces. Many questions in reality made me pray to my Jesus. And Jesus didn't say nothing because Jesus croaked. For God, someone help us. This has got to be a joke. This is not. This is not. This is not not not a joke. This is not. This is not. This is not not not a joke. Time útil is real. Time Zoom is real. Time you feel this feel. Time you feel this feel. Time you feel this feel. Time you feel this feel. Time you feel this feel. Time you feel this feel. Time you feel this feel. Time you feel this f**king.... Time you feel this feel. Time you feel this feel. Time you feel this f**king.... Time you feel this feel. Time you feel this feel. Time you feel this f**king.... This is not. This is not. This is not not not the joke. Show em all. This is not. This is not. This is not not not the joke. This is Brian Cossack. Thank you for making me laugh. Ceremonies. My sweet friends today I offer under you a powerful podcast with a great teacher of the occult, Jason Louvre. I hope you're prepared to enter into the realm of magic. We're going to jump right into it, but first some quick business. April 16th, 2003, David French goes to a local restaurant and orders a bowl of calamari with some barbecue sauce. He takes three bites of the calamari and begins to complain to the waiter about a sudden bout of dizziness. Unbeknownst to French, the calamari had VX nerve agent inside of it. As it turns out, the chef had top secret clearance at one of the local military bases and had come home with a vial of VX nerve agent, which happens to look exactly like barbecue sauce. The chef had been confused and it filled French's barbecue sauce bowl with VX nerve agent. For the next 30 hours, French went through a series of horrific seizures. He bled out of his pores. He clawed his own nipples off and dug his fingers into the holes, desperately trying to poke his own heart to end his life. But he was incapable of this form of suicide because the VX nerve agent had made it impossible for his brain to communicate with his body.

So make sure that you get your tickets in advance for Krishna Doss because he will definitely sell out. That's March 21st at the bell house. Ticket links are at dunkintrussell.com.

What did I just buy at Amazon? You ask, I'll tell you an Ableton push to, if you want to dive into some vortex of electronic music creation, just for no reason at all. I'm just doing it because it seems like, well, I guess I can, I used it on this podcast. So there is some reason behind it, but the way I look at it is rather than spending all of my time playing Hearthstone, I'll spend 95% of my time playing Hearthstone and the other 5% learning how to make music on the Ableton push. It's a blast. Check it out. If you want a piece of musical equipment, it's amazing. Unfortunately, you also have Ableton, you have to have Ableton to go with it. So I don't know if you're someone who already has Ableton, check it out. I guess that's it. Friends, today's guest is the real deal. He's an author. He's written several books, including Generation Hex, Monsanto Versus the World, the PsyCic Bible, and the Ultra Culture Journal. He also teaches magic and the occult.

Before you do that, why not listen to the podcast and get your mind blown as we talk about John Dee and the Anokian Angels. Now everybody, please spread those secret wings that you have underneath your shirt, extend your astral body, and send as much love and mana and prana in the direction of one of the premier teachers of the occult living in the world today. The great Jason Lueve. Jason, welcome back to the DTFH. How is your book going? Hey Duncan, just wrapping it up. After two years, I haven't left the house for about two years, during which time I've only been obsessing on John Dee and the minutiae of Christian apocalypticism and only occasionally breaking to play Dungeons and Dragons, my true love for this world. Can you tell people who John Dee is? So John Dee was the magical advisor to Queen Elizabeth I and he was a guy who knew everything at a time when it was still possible to know everything in the world because we were just entering or just in the Renaissance basically and humanity or at least European civilization was just starting to reclaim its knowledge after it was all lost in the Dark Ages. So he was a guy who wanted to know everything and that included mathematics and navigation, geography, and the occult. And so he's probably, in my opinion, certainly the most advanced occult thinker of the Renaissance and since Western culture kind of just ditched the idea of the occult and magic after the Scientific Revolution. That means he's still one of the most advanced thinkers on the topic. So this is the guy that is a great fascination to me particularly because he's also the guy that came up with the phrase the British Empire and he's the person who's responsible for essentially the plan to create a British Empire. So it's thanks to him that we're here today in a way in the current, you know, the current world order, the new world order as you might put it is his creation. I kind of think of him as like the architect and the matrix to use to make the tacky, do the tacky thing of using a matrix metaphor. But in that time period, did people view the occult in the same way as they do today? I mean, I know, but probably people thought there was more validity in some of the ideas that now are considered to be rubbish. But was it considered during that time period to be an off limits kind of thing that you weren't supposed to investigate or get into? For average people, yes, absolutely. I mean, people were still extremely superstitious. You have to remember that this is a time period where people thought that math was the work level. And John Dee was also one of the first people to popularize math, which people were just as terrified of as the occult. But for the elite, for the educated, for the academic high registers of society, it was the central concern. People were obsessed with the idea of hermeticism, renaissance, neoplatonism, as it's called, magic, the occult directly trying to make experiments to influence reality using Kabbalistic techniques or techniques drawn from the Kermores. So it was the central thing. So the royal families were casting spells. Elizabeth was, first of all, a genius. This is a woman who was known even as an eight-year-old when she was being tutored. She could, in her spare time, she would translate Latin into Greek and back into Greek in her head. This isn't just government, or this isn't propaganda. You think this is real? It sounds a little bit like Kim Jong-il or, like, legends, people build her. Well, maybe. Okay, so there's that. And we would have to go back and look closely. But it's definitely a historical record that Elizabeth, in particular, was extremely interested in hermeticism and alchemy. She really wanted to find the philosopher's stone in order, primarily in order to cure her smallpox and also extend her lifespan. But she was constantly getting into trouble falling for the claims of people who showed up claiming they could make gold because, obviously, there was, like, a real gold rush. People were sinking tons and tons of money all over Europe into solving the secrets of alchemy because whoever figured that out first would essentially have infinite money and have the economic advantage over everyone else. Right. So they were very, very, very interested in it, but primarily for that reason, which was can we make infinite money? You know, there's an interesting parallel between the current attempt by, like, Google to create an AI, like what do they call it? A strong AI. It's a similar thing because the moment a corporation has a super intelligence theoretically at their back and call. I mean, that's the thing everyone's worried about. It's why would it listen to you? But then they have this severe advantage over every other corporation. So it's a curious repetition. Only now, instead of trying to turn lead into gold, we're trying to turn computers into mines, you know? But it's like a similar kind of alchemy. But to get back to... Yes. Well, I think that... I'm glad you touched on that, though, because I think the parallels are incredible even during the Renaissance. It was in the Italian city-states. The Medici were the ones who really first put a lot of funding into figuring this stuff out. And the Italian city-states are very similar to Silicon Valley now, where it's a small group of people with an extreme amount of money who are kind of in this heightened position over everyone else in society. And they're trying to figure out this kind of Faustian thing that will give them a permanent advantage. So I think the parallels are there. I think that the... It also just demonstrates this ongoing theme in Western culture of this kind of Faustian thing that seems to be part of Western civilization, where people are constantly trying to figure something out or do something that's maybe not a good idea. Yeah, exactly. Something that you just don't know what the... Because if you did figure out a way to transform lead into gold, you're not going to hold onto that recipe forever. Everyone's going to want it, and the moment people see that it can be done, then that will only make people more enthusiastic in the pursuit of whatever the formula is. But essentially, you just wreck the market, right? This is what happened to aluminum would have happened to gold. It's like, who gives a fuck? Everyone has gold. Gold is everywhere now. So it just never happened. So gold is still valuable. Right. So to get back to John Dee, where did he come from? How does a person become a court magician? Was that what he has called, or was he called an advisor? Yeah, I think his technical title was the astrological advisor to Elizabeth. He's often romanticized by people who look at him. But the reality is he was a fairly poorly paid government consultant. They were never... No. They took advantage of him quite a bit. He was never getting properly funded. This is still the sign in England where there was no funding for science. He was an academic. But because he was never treated properly up until... I mean, he worked tirelessly for England up until his 50s. But because he was never really paid or treated properly, and he kind of fell out of favor at court because they considered his imperial plans fanciful and not particularly serious, even though they later used them. And once his career kind of fell apart, he retreated totally into the world of the occult. And over about 10 years, with a guy named Edward Kelly, was doing nothing except trying to communicate with angels, which is what most people know him for today, which is a bizarre story. Is that... Are the angels he was trying to communicate with? That's the Inokian spirits? Is that what that is? Yes. That's what it's called today. Help me understand. I am so foggy on what that is, and yet it's a thing that pops up all the time. Okay. So, Inokian is a modern word. He did not use it. He was just saying he was talking to angels. But essentially what they were doing is... So he was working with a scrier, and a scrier is essentially a psychic. It's somebody who has what we would now consider like the visionary faculty to go into trance states and experience kind of internal visions. This is something we know today from the... You know, people have all kinds of ways of doing this now, chemical or otherwise. But at the time, people were primarily... You know, they had more rudimentary ways of doing it. What were they? Were they taking psychoactives back then? Or what was their formula? I tried to figure that out. I think that... I'm not... There's a lot that suggests they may have... Belladonna. We know there's... Yeah. Totally. And also, I mean, magic mushrooms in cannabis grow naturally in England. You know, they grow like... Their English mushrooms are extremely bizarre, you know. But if they were using that stuff, it's weird because you would think... Why would they hide that? You would think that would just be a known fact. Like in those days, if people were scrying, it just seems like they would just announce, yeah, we eat mushrooms when we do this, but you never hear about it. Or they would have done something like, yes, we prepared the alchemical texture of the flight, you know, like the philosopher's term into that. You know, they would use some bizarre alchemical language, but there's really not anything like that in the records. So I don't know, but it's possible because Kelly is constantly going out the rails and having bad trips and just like losing his gourd. So that kind of suggests they might have been partaking. Yeah. Right. You know what it brings to mind? Pendleton Ward, who, I think the first time he was on the podcast, I asked the rather, what I now understand to be a very rude question to ask an artist, which is, how high were you when you thought of that, man? And like a lot of times, and like Pendleton's like, I wasn't at all, I don't need to get high to think of adventure time. I don't need that. So a lot of many artists, when you insinuate that they must have been under the effect of a psychedelic, they, it's not like they get ruffled, but they're just like, no, you think you need that, but you don't. I mean, maybe a scarier to think that you can access these angels with no psychoactive chemicals and with no tinctures that if you just knew the correct procedure, then you could immediately commune with the spirits. Right. Well, look, I mean, you know, magic is a funny word, but magic itself is a set of techniques for doing that without chemicals. I mean, it's a set of techniques for entering altered states of consciousness and things like yoga poses or Pranayama over breathing or, you know, what's called astral travel, which is kind of really just guided visualization. All of those techniques are for entering these states of consciousness and inscriting itself, which is staring at a crystal ball or a black mirror until you basically just kind of trans out and enter a visionary state. All of these things are methods for getting out of your own way. And if you're good at that, you know, particularly if you're an artist, you're just someone who stays in creative states of mind a lot, that's pretty easy. You know, I think it's particularly people who are hyper-rational or more scientifically minded, often have a problem dropping their own suspension of disbelief in a way or allowing themselves to experience those things. But all it really is is a matter of allowing yourself to experience it, you know? Right. Yeah, that's right. That is so crazy. I mean, I think this is definitely something people just don't want to deal with. They don't want to deal with the fact that the membrane surrounding them and creating whatever kind of like subjective biosphere that they've been living in is completely transformable, permeable. You can just take that thing down and suddenly you have entered into the vortex. Suddenly you're surrounded and you're in the mind of God. I don't think people want to know that. I think they would rather just not know that every single thing around them that they consider to be rational is just a kind of defense mechanism to protect them from the raging cyclone of spirit that surrounds all of us. Yes, well, we're in the mind of God all the time. We've just forgotten that. When we're in altered states, we're just in a different density of the mind of God. We're in the imaginary part, the part that looks like imaginary to us, that operates like a cartoon and has a little bit more, has different rules. But everything is part of the mind of God. Let me ask you this. I think you're totally right about that. This is going to sound like such a pithy question, but I got to ask it. If we're in the mind of God and we've forgotten that, does that mean that God has forgotten us? In other words, is it a result of God forgetting aspects of God's creation, that their creation simultaneously forget the progenitor of the creation, or do you think that in the mind of God, we are always held in remembrance? Well, yes, I think we are. But it's also a question of have we forgotten, or are we just pretending to have forgotten? It's like when you go into a movie. Have you really forgotten it's a movie, or are you pretending that you don't know it's a movie so that it's more fun to watch? Right. Yeah, and it's not just with the movies. It's with a lot of things, right? The human tendency to deceive the self. Right. And we have so many reasons for doing that, you know, that go way beyond enjoying. To enjoy your life, you need to... In other words, if I want to live in a world where I'm an okay person, then I need to forget some shit that I've done, right? Yes, yeah, yeah. You know, like you've got to forget, like you can't like... It's too real though, okay? It's real, I mean it is. But you know, the time that you like, I don't know, like kick the dog, or like, oh, you know what, here's a real basic example. Every time you sit down for a nice steak, you know, like you have got to forget what the fuck you're eating. And if you don't, I mean some people will be like, I don't forget. I relish that I'm eating the flesh of a beast, but like that's not most of us. Most of us like to sit down to a meal. Like if I go to a steakhouse, one of the few places where I'm still offended is when a steakhouse puts pictures of cows on the wall. It's like, wow, why are you doing, why? So, okay, so self... Well, this is kind of like, you know, like we always see, you know, especially when reading new age stuff and things like that, we're always getting this propaganda of just like, yeah, you know, wake up and experience, you know, you need to wake up sheeple, you know. Yes. But then the more you do that, the more you're like, oh, this actually, you know, I don't want to be aware of the fact that I'm going to die every waking second of the day. You know, I don't want to be aware of the fact that we're sliding into some type of inevitable global catastrophe within, possibly within our lifetimes. You know, I don't want to think about humanity living as enslaved beings to bizarre, you know, technological creations. You know, it becomes too much and I think this is what Lovecraft was talking about where he said something like, to the effect of the most merciful thing in the world is the inability of the human mind to correlate its own contents. Oh, wow. Yeah, right. I mean, this is in the Bhagavad Gita when Krishna reveals his universal form and Arjuna says to Krishna, can you please just go back to being your normal forearm? Because this fucking massive thing you just showed me, I don't want, I can't deal with it. And yet, and so, but this is the occult, isn't it? It's the process of overcoming that fear, right? The fear of accepting reality as reality truly is, not as the part of you that's deceiving yourself wants to make it. So I think that D and Kelly make a really fascinating study of this because D actually in this dynamic played out in their relationship because D is your kind of quintessential like Reddit fedora guy where he's hyper-rational. He's, and even though he had studied the minutiae of the occults and mathematics in Greek and Latin and Kabbalah and all this stuff for decades and was the most knowledgeable person in England on this, he had five times the books of Cambridge and Oxford and all this. But at the same time, he couldn't, you know, he couldn't, he couldn't get out of his own way. He was too rational. He could not actually see anything or make contact with spirits. It just didn't work. So he had to employ scryers who were these kind of unhinged, itinerant people who were, you know, Kelly was half D's age and alcoholic, overweight, was probably mentally ill, you know, was a criminal, all this stuff. You know, he was, had been accused of necromancy and trafficking with demons, which he had actually done and all this stuff. So he's this very shit character, but he could do it. He could see these realities. And so they formed a working partnership, which really is the way that magic is best done. I think it's best done in groups, but... You don't think it can be done as an individual practitioner? Oh, absolutely, absolutely. Parts of it seem to work better with when you have more than one person. But that's, that's neither here nor there. I think that the, but D and Kelly, once they made contact with the angels, I mean, D was, he thought, you know, I'm, you know, basically his view was I'm smarter than everybody. So I'm going to, you know, the only people left that I have to learn from are the angels themselves. They're really going to tell me what's going on. This is so wild, man. It is too, I don't mean to go back to an earlier point, but it is so wild to me that we are continuing this cycle in our attempt to create a power for a strong AI. It is, you know, because what is, D wants to communicate with a higher intelligence. In this case, it's angels, right? But we want to communicate with a higher intelligence. In this case, we call it an artificial intelligence, which is a hilarious word for it. And yet still it's, we want to talk to the angels. This is, seems to just be built into human beings. Our language for describing our attempts at communicating with these beings has massively changed, right? Like now the way we talk to the angels is with a large hadron collider, you know, or with like these, with, you know, incredible scopes and tools that we have to peer into the depths of the universe, but still it's fucked, man. And the fascinating thing with that is that all of these things you're talking about, like science itself comes out of D and not just D, but the alchemists and the hermeticists and the neoplatanists and the people who are trying to do the occult. There's a straight line continuum from them to here. It's all the same impulse, right? But that's been kind of covered up by his, you know, they don't teach you that in high school because it's so out there. They don't like it. They don't like it. When you look into Isaac Newton, for example, and you realize that like Isaac Newton was like studying the temple of Solomon, hair filled with mercury, crazy, a crazy, you know, occultist, you know, for some reason it's like people who don't want to admit that we were monkeys at one point. Like hardcore scientists don't seem to like the fact that the roots of science go deep into the alchemical laboratories of people like John Dee, who was hanging out with lunatic alcoholics talking to angels. Right. It drives people crazy to even hear about that. But at the same time, I think that we've lost a lot because, you know, it's been fascinating for me to study people like Dee and Newton. I mean, Newton and Dee basically have the exact same way of seeing the world. It was the renaissance scientific model is very consistent. These people are not outliers, you know, they're particularly smart, but they're in a part of a tradition, which is essentially seeing the universe as the mind of God and therefore seeing things like math and science and optics and basically seeing that everything is one thing and what we perceive to be, you know, there's not a split between scientific reasoning and spirituality. We're just studying the universe. That's really what it is. And so they're all in this tradition. But and I think that we've lost that. And I think that that's to our great loss, particularly with things like AI. And I think if you look at all of, you know, many of the great spiritual teachers, particularly of the 20th century, whether it's Manly Hall or Ananda or people like this, have been saying this thing to us over and over again, which is humanity's capacity to create technical technological wonders is far outpacing its wisdom and its ability to handle it. And things like the atomic bomb or AI, you know, I can't think of a much more dramatic demonstration of that. Yeah. So we need the spirit. We need the soul. Yeah. When like science, when humanity leaves science, you just, you just have this mantis, this thing that's just manipulating matter with no thought at all. And this is one of the things that I love about magic. And I think we talked about this on the phone briefly, but I'm reading this book. Oh, I stopped reading it, but by LFS Levi. Is that how you say his name, Jason? I mean, yes. Yes. LFS Levi. And how I just loved, how I love how in these grimoires, there's inevitably some warning about the dangers of exploring this particular process and the respect that you need to enter into the practice with. This is somewhat even in Chogum, Trumpa and Eastern teachers too. And this creates a feeling of like, you know, be careful. This is not, we're not fucking around here. This is real. And yet in science, people seem to just not have any care at all about, you know, I, and this just popped up on Reddit. WTF this like decapitator for mice. I don't know if you've seen that. Have you seen that? I don't know if I want to. It just, it looks like a, it's like a little plastic ice cream cone that you can shove the mouse into and its little head is at the end. And then in that play, and it's shoved into this little plastic ice cream cone. You can inject it. You can decapitate it. And, you know, this is a thing that's like on some scientific website just on sale, you know, because like at some point or another example, I was having this conversation with someone and they were like, dogs do not feel love. Dogs do not feel love. They could never feel love. They just want food. And like, you know what I mean? Have you ever spent time with a dog? Yeah. It's like, what the fuck? What are you, what kind, you have a shitty dog is all man, you can't judge. But again, that kind of like mantis like, I don't even mean insult praying mantises, but that kind of insectoid emotionless mechanistic view of the universe is so disastrous. Yes. Don't get, I was, I was going to send you this video clip, but I didn't want to mess with you too hard because it, you know, sometimes, sometimes like people will send me clips and I'll be like in a certain state of mind. And it's like, I'm really not the right time to see that. Right. It was a fully automated AI meat processing plant or it was just like this, this huge factory, just like processing like carcasses, you know, there's no people in it. It's just machinery. It's like our stomachs. It's like our stomachs. Oh my God. Yeah. It's like watching this like HR guy or Francis Bacon vision of the future of please, please send it. Yeah, no, because that's what will happen. You know what? It's one day where you're going to, when you walk to the park, you're going to try to ignore the humming of the master drone as it descends and carries away a child and drops it into a chute in some kind of factory where the child is processed. You know, organs harvested eyeballs harvested. But, but, but it's like probably the AI will be like, do not worry, we will retain, we will save its memories. We will replace the child with an child that is indistinguishable from the meat child that we used for experiments. You should be honored. But anyway, it's so frightening. So, so yeah, like, sorry, I think that like, but just going off what you said, I mean, you said that, you know, magic is, you know, they're not always warnings that's people are said. It's, you know, it's dangerous to mess with. But you know what? I also think it's dangerous not to investigate it because I think that, you know, it's dangerous to not have a knowledge of the spirit or yourself or the spiritual world. It's dangerous to, you know, it's like, yeah, like it's dangerous to write a, you know, it's dangerous to learn how to ride a bike. It's dangerous to learn how to, it's dangerous to go outside. You know, because you're going to meet some people who are cool and some people who are like totally, you know, trying to rip you off and take advantage of you. Right. And it's the same way with the spiritual world, if you want to call it that or the astral world. It's like, but you can't understand the difference until you've experienced it, until you have experience of what works and what doesn't. So I also think that, you know, it's dangerous not to engage in these things. And I think that our culture, the fact that after the industrial revolution, after the birth of modern science, you know, that our culture just slammed the door on these things. I think that that's also a failing. I think that's also dangerous. It is. I mean, it's, it's, it kind of reminds me of what when Terrence McKinnon said he feels sorry for people who've never taken mushrooms, that he looks at people who've never taken a psychedelic in the same way he might look at someone who died having never taken a psychedelic. He died having never had an orgasm or never had sex or, you know, like a person who never, because it's such an essential part of being a human. And the theophany or whatever you want to call it, that state of awe and dread and fear that comes when you will, when you enter into some magical ritual. My experience with the actual magical ritual is limited to, I don't know, three or four real real ones and three. And then the reason I can, those three are so frozen in my mind, you know, as terrifying. And why was it terrifying? You know, because it's the sense of like pushing through something like, like, you know, the way I would do it, you know, again, probably the way you do it is would be way, way more. I mean, I'm sure you've seen, I'm sure you've done some stuff, man, seen some stuff. But so when I would do it, the times I have done it, it's the feeling for me of a presence being in the room that isn't me anymore. That sense of being watched or a palatable sense of a tension in the air that wasn't there before, a feeling of like, I don't know what that is. And then. Well, it's a spirit manifesting. That's what it feels like. And that's scary. Because when that happens, it's no longer like one of those Ouija board shows, you know, like it's the same way as though you've opened your door and someone has walked into the room. And then it's like, fuck, are you going to leave? Like, what did I just, you know, that it's that sense. But then there's also the feeling of instinctuality about it. Like, oh, this is something I kind of know how to do. And then then there's the, at least for me, and maybe this is going back to our own self deception. In, in, in these moments, I have gone into a kind of amnesiac state where like, on the other side, it'll be like, what the fuck did I do? You know, like there was a moment in there of like, I don't know what that was. And then of course, the next part of it that's terrifying is when the result happens. And then, and now you're dealing with a world where it's like, wait, what the fuck? Not only did I do a thing and now here is an immediate result. You know, and then you're dealing, now you're in a world where you have no long, you can't deny it because it's too perfect. And it happens, you know what I'm talking about, right? All of that, my reaction is, it's scary. It's scary. It always reminds me of, you know, the magical consciousness is just such a strange, you know, it's such a strange, and exactly what you're saying, very familiar, you know, way because it's very, it's a, it's very strange, but it's also essentially how we thought when we were small children, you know, it's the same type of logic, you know, where we're interacting with imaginary friends or taking kind of strange ritualistic actions because you think they're going to make something happen. But it always reminds me of like, Twin Peaks when they go into the Black Lodge. We've got like a little man from another place walking around, like that weird way that David Lynch has spirits, like just saying like really strange and like meaningless things. Like it always feels kind of like that to me. That's a, I've always thought Lynch must do some kind of practice. I mean, he calls it a lodge, you know, like he clearly does something. Well, that was all, well, David Lynch is a transcendental meditation guy, but all that was Mark Frost, the screenwriter who was hardcore into theosophy and put all this theosophical stuff into Twin Peaks. What? No way. I thought that was all Lynch. Holy shit. No, no, no, no, it's Mark Frost. Wow. Oh my God. That's a great writer by the way. I recommend because he wrote some novels too that are really good. Oh, beautiful. I'll check it out. Hey, let's get back to John Dee. Okay, I want to talk about, you know, speaking of rituals and stuff like this. It is best, how do I say this? Can you describe what one of these rituals might have looked like? Can you describe to me? Yeah. The room described the like, just as clearly as you can. I want to be able to see one of these rituals in my mind. So they were actually incredibly simple, which is kind of paradoxical because the material they got was so complex, but the actual rituals they were doing were much, much more simple than what you normally see in convoirs. It had much more, it was closer to prayer, but so John Dee had a house named called, excuse me, he had a house in a town or a suburb of North West London called Moorlake, which I visited this summer. It was very cool to see it. It's right on the 10th. So he had this large, large, you know, large house in a quiet suburban neighborhood by the river, you know, very tranquil environment next to a church. And, but it was a large house. He had a big family, he had a wife, and I think by the end of his life, he had something like nine kids. So there were several kids running around and then Kelly was there and Kelly's wife was there and then they were serving. So it was a big household. There were a lot of people there. John Dee had a study where he set up the scrying table or a scrying ball, and Kelly would basically go into John Dee's study and they would close the doors. They had the two heavy doors, but it would be during the day. Wait, I'm sorry, a scrying table. So it's an, the entire table is this like black reflective surface. So the angels, as the sessions progressed, the angels gave them instructions on how to build what is essentially the most complicated Ouija board you've ever seen. It's this gigantic three foot by three foot table with sigils all over it and wax seals and aluminum engraving. And it's this incredibly complex thing. This is called the Anokian spirit board, right? Well, it's called the Holy Table of Practice. Oh, the Holy Table of Practice. Cause I've heard that like the drummer of Tool as one of these things over is like drum set or something. Could be a rumor. He may. Well, so he has the sigillum, I think, which is one specific part of that. It was, and that's just a wax, a wax seal about the size of a pie plate. And on top of, so, but you set all this up, that part goes on top of the table and then a small scrying ball about about an inch or two inches or a black mirror goes on top of that. And so all of this stuff is essentially to support the crystal. And they didn't start out with that stuff. This is insane, man. Okay. I just Google searched Holy Table of Practice. What? What? That is crazy. Okay. Okay. Keep going. Sorry. So angels had instructed them. Yes. So the first one or two years or maybe three years of these sessions were just the angels telling them how to build this thing. Wow. And, but they started off with just a scrying ball essentially, and they would do it in daylight. John Dee was very into optics and the study of, which is the study of telescopes and mirrors and that type of thing. So he'd been obsessed with this for a long time. But they would, so they would scry, you know, so they scry in a busy house in daylight. It was not spooky. It was not like a hammer horror thing. And they would usually have, have light daylight reflecting into the, into the scrying ball. Hey, listen, man. I'm sorry. I'm looking at what Holy Table is scrying right now. I don't care what time of the day you're doing that. That does not look not spooky. Like if I, it's intense. Do you have one of these, Jason? Yeah, I made one. I made one. It took me about a year. Wow. Okay, go ahead. So they're sitting in, it's in the day. Light is shining through the window into this crystal. Yes. And, and, but essentially there, as far as ritual went, it would basically be John Dee with Neil. He would pray at length. He would confess his sins to Christ. It was very extremely Christian in nature. And he would essentially growl. And this is a standard feature of medieval and Renaissance magic is, is sanctification, which is the humbling of yourself before God. Wow. And so he would basically get on his knees and pray, you know, at length, you know, you know, I, John Dee, I'm a poor mortal sinner. Please look kindly upon me. And, and if I am seen to be fit, then perhaps you would send one of your angels to further instruct me and how to be, you know, how to better live in, in your holy church. Beautiful. And, but, but you can see his speeches. They were long and at length, you know, extremely long and, and so on. And, and if you've ever done this type of thing, if you've ever, even if you've ever been prayed in church, or you sincerely prayed even outside of the context of ritual, you know, it's extremely consciousness altering. You know, it really does something to your sense of yourself. You know, even to humble yourself and to put yourself in a subservient position is so important. And it's often missed in modern magic, which is so kind of like egoic and self-centered. All right. So he would do this and then, and then Kelly would, and then he would, so then he would just directly petition and say, please send an angel. And then Kelly would enter a trance and begin scrying in the ball and say what he was seeing. And John Dee would write it down. And usually the sessions would last, you know, 20 minutes to an hour, and they'd usually do them once or twice a day. And they'd take breaks in between and things would get, you know, and like things would happen, like chaos would happen, or Kelly would start to lose his nut. So, so there's long breaks in the sessions, but they basically did this from 19, or excuse me, from 1581 to about 1587 consistently. Holy shit. And, and, and, go ahead, sorry. And, and so there's, there's, you know, probably about a thousand pages of records of what they wrote down. What, what is that? What are the topics that these angels felt they needed to talk about with John Dee? So the angels were saying, here's the thing, right? They, they, they weren't friendly. Or they were friendly, but, you know, they were very Old Testament, what's put it down. I mean, basically they, essentially their message was, the end of the world is at hand, you know, the antichrist is assumed to be born the second coming as a, as a hand, and the world is awash in its sin and its fallen nature, and everything has fallen from the grace of God and must be rectified and must be, you know, it was, it was very like unhinged street creature. And, and, and so, so most of those sessions are them, you know, lashing both Dee and Kelly for their sins. And they're, you know, it's clear that the angels, even though Dee is probably the most intelligent person in Europe at this point, it's clear that the angels see him as a, you know, a convenient, but often hard to discipline dog, you know, they just look like lower animals to these beings. And so there's lots of comedic sections where Dee and Kelly are just kind of stumbling over the cells and they don't know what to do. They don't know what to say. And they're like asking for money. And the angels are like, what are you, you know, we're giving you the secrets of the universe and you're asking us for money. What are you talking about? And then Kelly asked Kelly asked to borrow money from the angels at one point. It's, it's funny. It's extremely comedic. It's just like these two, it's all of a sudden turns into like three stages, you know, because these two guys are just so outclassed by these beings. What are the angels? What is the response when you've been, I mean, you've been summoned into a room by these monkey descendants? How does an angel respond to how would you borrow money from an angel? Well, they're constantly just losing their cool. They start off, they show up and they start, they start, they start elaborating these long, beautiful passages, which are, you know, the language is just, you know, as Crowley later said, you know, it's, it's on par with Milton or the Bible. It's just beautiful, this beautiful language. But then Kelly then, but then Dean Kelly or just like, you know, can you hold on a sec? We need to have dinner, you know, or like, you know, like they're asking constantly asking for money and all this. And they're constantly, and so the angels just get more and more fed up as these sessions go on. Wow. And they're just, they're, they do lose their patience very quickly. Holy shit, man. That's so, have you, have you ever contacted any of these beings before? Have you, you've clearly spent some time working on the implement that you, the tools, have you had success in contacting any of these angels? I've definitely done a lot of, this is interesting because I wrote, I wrote about this, I've written about this before. There's a book called Ultra Culture Journal, which is on Amazon, where I wrote about some of my experiences with Anokian. And I would say yes, I think that my experiences with this stuff are, it's just really weird. And my experiences have not been similar to Dean Kelly's. They've been very different. So, but it's very, it's very weird is probably the best way I can put it. Weird. It's very hard. It's very, you know, there's a real current of, you know, I gave a presentation on this recently in Seattle and I was talking about Anokian. And the difference between Anokian magic and other types of magic is, you know, a lot of people get into magic with this idea that they're going to use it to get things or they're going to, you know, they're going to do a ritual to get a job or a girl or they're going to become this charismatic person or, you know, whatever reason people have for getting into this stuff. Yes. And the grimoires promise you all these things. Yes. Anokian has one function, it seems, which is to destroy you completely. Why? Because it's the point of Anokian is destroying the individual ego, you know, in the same way that hardcore meditation or hardcore psychedelic experience or, you know, but the destruction of the ego acts accessed through the fire in Brimstone and the Old Testament. God. So it's something, it's special. Were there words that you heard or did you see a thing? Was it just feeling? Well, it depends on the ritual. It's, I think the best way to describe it is, you know, entering an altered state of consciousness and experiencing kind of a trip. Do you feel, do you feel like it's a private matter that you don't want to discuss? Is it private? For the most part, for the most part, I mean, I've talked about it a little bit in my books. But also, I think that I tend not to like to talk about specific rituals also, because I don't want to, I would rather people try things themselves and come to their own conclusions than kind of like pregame them. Right. And kind of like give them something, because I've noticed with myself a lot too, where I'll do something and then I'll think I've experienced something and then I'll go back and I'll realize it's something that I read previously. Right. And so things can blur and it's good to get like, it's good to get like a good, you know, close to experimentally viable conditions as possible. I got you. Yeah. You know, but sometimes I think though when you, so yeah, you have an experience and then you like, then you realize like, oh shit, I saw that in Night Breed or whatever, you know, like, I saw that in a movie. That's not really me. That wasn't real. But sometimes what I think. Oh, sort of. Sorry. Go ahead. Well, no. Yeah. It feels like the mind. Okay. So like, like the mind when it comes into contact with the unknown, it uses symbols that are known. Yes. Right. So in that way, your mind is like grabbing the closest thing it has to articulating the contact, which is why you will experience things that you may have seen in a movie, but that doesn't invalidate it. It's just, that's what your mind, that's the closest to your mind. That's like, you know, if I'm, if I've got a palette of, you know, colors, I'm gonna, I can paint something, but I can only paint using the colors that I have, you know. Right. So, yes. Exactly. Yeah. I mean, you're having, you're having an experience. You're having a heightened experience in your own nervous system, but your, your own nervous system is contacting, you know, a new part of the brain or a new experience or whatever you believe these things actually are. Are you afraid? The jury's out. Do you, or is the jury, is the jury out for you, Jason, still? I think it depends on the day. All right. I think that I would say at this point in my life, I think that there are, so the only, so for me, let's see, what's a good way to put this, for me, the question of the objective reality of what we would call spirits and the, or other beings and the objective reality of existence itself for the same question. Does that make sense? Yes. So, it's like, you know, within the, within the bounds of my own experience, yeah, this stuff is absolutely real, you know, without a doubt. Yeah. But, but then you have to ask, okay, what, what, you know, what, but how much of what we actually perceive is real at all anyways. All right. You know, it's all, it's still a part of our sensory input. You know, if you read philosophers like Bishop Barkley or David Kuhn, they're based or, or even later on in, in a way of Wittgenstein, or they're saying, it's like, you know, you, you really don't contact anything outside of your own sensory field at any time. The thing that you're seeing right now is just your brain's representation of something from a sensory organ. It doesn't mean it's real. It's just that you're, the jelly, you know, the gelatinous mass that you happen to be in this time and space is interpreting sensory input in a way that allows it to survive. Right. It doesn't mean it's actually objectively real, you know, and it's the same way with, you know, the heightened states of consciousness or rastral things or virtual reality or anything. It's like, it's still you, it's still your nervous system. So, so that's when we start to get into the realms of ontology and philosophy and all that. But I think practically speaking, you know, is this stuff real? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's where I'm at with it too is, is, and it is like some days I do, I just think, oh, you're fooling yourself, man, just to blur a chaos and your brain's like desperately trying to make up some bullshit just to ease the suffering of existence or something. But then when the experiences come, you realize how just ridiculous that rationalization or that form of rationalization is when, when you are really in the presence of a thing that is way smarter than you, way, like so much smarter than you and you're, and it's not you. That is, Well, even if it's a part of you that you don't normally access because you're in the social trance that tells you that you don't have access to it. Right. But even if it's just a part of you, that it, you know, even if there's even if just like, let's say that creating, you know, let's say that creating ritual conditions, like setting up a room to do a ritual and putting yourself in the mind frame and putting on whatever clues you do, whatever it is that gets you there. Let's say that you're just tapping a part of you that you normally don't. Okay. Well, that's pretty fricking awesome right there. Sure. You know, because now it's like, well, great. Well, now you have a way of, and maybe you could even simplify it once you understand what it is. Maybe you can simplify it down to a phrase or, or a gesture that gets you there. But man, if you can get yourself into, you know, what's, you know, what might more, more rationally be called the unconscious mind in the way that an artist does when they're painting or an athlete does when they're in peak performance states, man, even that's pretty fricking awesome. You know, Absolutely man. Absolutely. And this is, you know, there is a precedent for this in, in, in, in just the normal developmental process of a human being. Because do you remember, I don't know if you remember this, you remember like when you first found out that there was this thing called an orgasm that could happen to you? Do you remember that? A glorious day involving an ex, an early X-Men comic, I think, but we won't go there. There you go. Yeah. Yeah. You know, we that, but there was a time when I was a kid and like, I remember hearing, you know, you can come like you can come, there's an orgasm you can have. I'm like, it's something you've never experienced, but you hear that you can. And then when it finally happens, you're like, what the fuck? That is pos, this is a possibility. This extreme state of pleasure is a possibility. So in the same way, why, why do we think it stops there? Why? Oh, absolutely. Yeah. I think that's, I, that's pretty. I think I, I've thought about it in, in those terms a lot, actually. That's really interesting. And I think that it's totally, it's such a valid comparison. And I think yoga is similar to, I mean, like, I don't know if you've done Pranayama at all. I've, I've dabbled in it, but I don't understand how to do it. I mean, you could explain it to me a little bit because all it knows. It really helps to have somebody show you in person, which is because it, because you can, you can mess yourself up if you do it wrong. Really? But if you get really good at it, you know, if you, if you spend a year or two practicing it and you get really good at it or you get a high one capacity, man, it's like, you can trigger like heroin experiences in your brain, you know, for free at the drop of a hat, you know, and you can do things to your nervous system and not just Pranayama, but, and that's one of the reasons why I'm interested in all this stuff. It's like, you know, I like getting high in weird ways, you know, right? So, like, you know, so Pranayama or neuro linguistic programming or, you know, Sufi dancing or, you know, whatever or, or rituals, like we're talking about. It's not just the spooky thing. I mean, like there's all these techniques for doing essentially what you're having and triggering these, you know, intense, strange, ecstatic and bewildering experiences within your own nervous system. Wait, I don't understand how NLP could trigger these experiences. I must not understand neuro linguistic programming because I thought that was more of a social tool of like manipulation or something. I didn't, but how do unfortunately, this is how people use it because people always use things for the most selfish reasons, right? But if you really study NLP, I mean, you can, NLP knows is you can get yourself into, it's just stripped down magic in a way. It's magic without all these ritual tools and, and extra robes and all this window dressing. You know, it's, it's a way of using language and the body to directly get yourself into hyped up states of consciousness. Does that look like, I mean, what, what do you talk to yourself or how does that? Well, usually it's one person talking to another, you know, somebody guiding, guiding somebody into that state. Whoa, huh. Interesting. Had no idea. Yeah. Wow. So these people would use it for this like dumb pickup artist reason, which is just, you know, embarrassing. Yeah. Because people never use magic for that kind of stuff, right, Jason? No one's ever used magic for that. I haven't since I was a teenager. Well, yeah, but that's when you, it's a, I mean, one of the great mistakes you can make is to try to use magic for that purpose. That's a real, that's a surefire way to fuck your life up, man. Well, it's, well, not fuck your life up. I mean, it, but, but, you know, to have a mistake and learn from it. And I think that, that, but it's like, it's like the same thing, at least my view of these things, you know, it's the same thing with NLP or magic or, you know, these people who are like, oh, like, I, what if I can just get somebody to like me and, you know, they start, they approach these things in a manipulative way, but pretty soon you figure out, it's like, that's not really how the universe works. I mean, the way the universe works is like, if you can turn yourself into an awesome person using these things, then people will just be naturally attracted to you. Right. You know, you don't need to force something. How sad that people forget that. Very simple truth. Isn't that the saddest thing that people try to like polish the mask, you know, or they try to like rework the very shallowest part of their self and, and, and without even gazing in at the, like, the, the hornet's nest inside of them and, like, it's such a sad thing to me that that, that's, that, I guess it's just easier, right, to like, it's easier work if you think, yeah, all I have to do is put on a different mask and people like me, you know. Well, you think it's easier, but it's actually not. Right. It's actually, it just is a hornet's nest as you say, but, but, you know, it's a developmental stage. People go through it and then they, they learn and then they go on to the next thing, you know, people are processes. Hopefully, hopefully they don't, they don't get stuck there. Do you foresee a time in our, in our future? Do you see, do you think we have a future? No. Do you see a, Oh man. Do you foresee a, Here we go. Do you foresee a time in the future where there will be a renaissance with this, these kinds of practices are a place where technology and these things merge. When you're describing this Anokian, what do you call it, a practice? What's it called? The Anokian spirit table or what's it called? Yeah. Yeah. One thing that came to mind right away is like, man, someone needs to build one of these in virtual reality. And if it like, I, because whenever I would go into VR, I haven't set it up in my house here, and I would go into, into tilt brush, which is a painting program. I would make these very rudimentary attempts to build a ritual chamber inside of the VR space. But I'm so clumsy when it comes to painting that I could never pull it off. It always just looked ridiculous. But do you, do you think that if we built an Anokian chamber inside of VR, it would be as effective as building one in your house? Well, then the question becomes, how do you have the visions? Because you're staring at a computer screen and the computer screen is not just going to generate something out of your imagination. So what is the computer screen? What's a computer screen? I mean, if you, because you're looking into, you're literally looking in, I mean, this is why they call that show black mirror. I mean, when you're looking at VR, you're staring at a black mirror. That is a, that's when my computer's off, it's a black mirror. So you would shut it off after doing a ritual in VR? No, I mean, I think that like what you would be gazing into, I don't know for sure. But when you're looking into VR at all, you're staring into a black mirror that has been illuminated with light. So, you know, I don't, I don't normally, when you do a ritual, you set everything up and then you do it and then you usually close your eyes and you have like an internal little 10 minute, 15 minute internal trip. So, so I'm not really sure if you were staring at a, I mean, it would definitely be cool. And I think there would, we'd have to figure out how to do it. But I think that the, that all the, all the magical props and all that stuff, like there's not really any inherent magic in them. It's just, you know, all this stuff that you see in these books, like, like Levy or Crowley or things like that. It's just like, it's, it's ways to, or even if you study ancient cultures and things like that, it's just, it's a way, it's set in setting, as Timothy Luther said, you know? So it's a way of telling yourself, okay, now I'm going to have this experience in the same way as if you put on a suit, you're going to feel more confident in a job interview, or if you put on athletic gear, you know, you're ready to work out, it's the same way with magic. And so ultimately these things are just kind of props. And what, what the real show is, what your, what, what your brain does. I mean, it's like a way of having a waking dream. Yes, I get it. Yeah. You kind of like, if you were to build a VR occult chamber, you're kind of like stealing the glory of like actually doing the practice. But then, you know, that being said, setting up VR and placing the goggles on and like, especially God, Jesus, why don't you build this, Jason? Why don't you build us a fucking spirit chamber and virtual reality? That would be really cool, man. Like, I would love that. Like for a true occultist to take the, to reproduce ritual chambers from different grimoires in VR. So at least we could see it. Oh, I would love that. Hey, if somebody with a startup wants to fund me to do that, do you know where to find me, jweave.com? So guys, listen to that. That would be really cool, man. That would be really cool. It'd be so fascinating. You know, can it be done? I don't know. Could it, would it work in the same way? Why not? Technology is magic to me. I don't understand it. And you know, even setting up my podcast studio, every single time when I start dialing the knobs in and preparing for the conversation, I feel it as a ritual. It feels like a ritual to me. Yes. So, well, that's the thing. I mean, the more you engage in magic and the more you do it and make it a daily practice and things like that, the more it becomes a, the more it becomes part of you and the more that you just see the world as a magical thing. And then you apply that. Once you've been trained that way of thinking, then you apply it to other things you do. You know, you see going to your job as a ritual, you see the energetic transfers and things like public speaking or whatever it is. And so, so you begin to think, you begin to see the world as a magician, begin to see the world as a set of systems that can be worked with and played with. And, and, and, you know, you see people's social rules is essentially performed and all of this. So, so, so really what you read in these magic books with, you know, candles and for more some things like that, it's, it's, it's training wheels, you know, way, you know, and I love that approach too, but it's really what you're doing is training a way of looking at the world as if you have, as if, as if you're in control and, or that you have agency in it and that you, you're interfacing with it as an, as an intelligent phenomenon full of systems that are, you know, pretty straightforward. Jason, every single time we have one of these conversations, my life becomes a little more magical. You're a true teacher and it's so grateful. Thank you for coming on the show. God, everything seems live again, man. It was so easy to forget. It's so easy to forget. How can people find you?

It's like, you can talk about this all day long, but until you experience it, you don't really know. And, and also when you experience it, you realize it's something that makes sense and you've been kind of doing all along, and then it becomes a really interesting, creative process to engage in. And, and it's, it's, you know, I love it. It's my favorite thing. So, uh, and you're great, but you have to do it. You have to do it. You can't just think about it. Yeah, right. It can't, it's got to be experiential. If you want to dive in, dive in. We have a true magical teacher here and startup people, VR people out there. I'm telling you, that's a cool idea. Connect with a true occultist, build some occult chambers inside of VR. That would be very interesting. More related projects. Jason, Hare Krishna. I love you, man.

If you are listening to this the week it came out, then that means I'm in Hawaii at a Ram Dass retreat. I go to these once a year. Missed last year because of the thing. But if you want to check out the Ram Dass retreat, did you know you can just go to ramdass.org? They're going to be live streaming everything. So if you want to watch me interview some of the wonderful teachers that are going to be at this retreat, you can find it at ramdass.org. The next few intros are going to be bare bones style intros because I am on vacation. But I'm so happy that you are listening to the DTFH, especially this episode. Some time ago, I went on the legendary podcast of Lex Friedman. And I don't know. I think I was feeling a little despondent about the state of the world. And I was talking about how I don't know if I would be able to exercise some of the things I like to think I've learned from Buddhism and meditation and getting to hang out with all these Ram Dass people. If I was actually in the situation of someone at war, who had just witnessed horror and lost everything, I got lucky because a wonderful meditation teacher actually happened to be listening to that episode. She's friends with Trudy Goodman, who you probably know as Trudy the Love Barbarian from the Midnight Gospel. And Trudy gave her my email and she sent me this wonderful message about compassion and Buddhism. And I realized I got to have her on the podcast. So with us here today is Melissa McKay. If you want to connect with her, you can find her at MelissaMcKay.net. She has been teaching meditation since the 90s. She is a teacher at Insight LA. You know, one of the wonderful things about the modern times that we live in is if you're interested in any of these teachers, they are an email away. And I would really recommend connecting with her if you are looking for somebody to take you a little deeper into your practice. All the links you need to find her are going to be at DuncanTrussell.com. And now, everybody, please welcome to the DTFH, Melissa McKay. Melissa, welcome to the DTFH. It's great to see you. Great to see you too. Thanks for having me, Duncan. I wanted to start off with a quote from one of your teachers. And the quote is really brilliant. In their quest for happiness, people mistake excitement of the mind for real happiness. In their quest for happiness, people mistake excitement of the mind for real happiness. What do you think that means? Who said that? This is the problem. I just pasted it and I didn't write it. It's your first teacher. He was the predominant teacher of Vipassana in the world. What's, you know, his name? That's it. Thank you. I can barely pronounce English names. Yes, that's from him. Excitement in the mind for happiness. Yeah. Yeah, well, you could see that. You know, when we look at the moments that we feel like when our attention isn't really careful or deep or clear, or so like our regular awareness of what we'll call like the untrained mind, you know, those times, just how we are in the day normally, that we have that kind of anticipatory excitement. But when you calm the mind, you see that it's really a nervous feeling and that there are states that are actually much more satisfying and deeper and more pleasant, you know, than that kind of anticipatory, excited feeling that we get for something that's going to happen in the future. Maybe that's what sighted Pundit is saying. It sounds like it. A common thing to say these days, if you are looking forward to something or if you're enjoying something is not, I'm happy, but I'm so excited. I'm so excited. And then within the expression itself seems to be wrapped up. The anxiety that you're talking about is woven. You can literally, in the way people say it, it's not the, it doesn't sound peaceful. It has its own kind of aggressive undertones to it. I'm so excited. It really does sound like the, not what one might equate with happiness, but in my sweeping judgment of my own species as a perfect individual, and I've spoken with other perfect individuals, many of us perfect individuals have a sense that post-pandemic or, you know, hopefully the last phases of the pandemic, there is a shared anxiety among people. There is a more of us are encountering out in the wild people losing it, people like blowing fuses publicly. And I mean, there's an entire subreddit called public freak out of just people in grocery stores, just going nuts. And so I bring up this quote because I wonder, is this, is there something deeper going on than just recovering from being locked down? Is there a possibility that this idea is lost to many people that, meaning people think they're looking for happiness, but what they're really looking for is quote, excitement. So what a disaster if anxiety becomes confused with happiness. Well, yeah, and, but it's always been the case that that's been, I remember that being very distinct for me early on in my practice, as I started to get more sensitive to myself, which is what mindfulness practice does emotionally, you get more sensitive to what our experiences actually are directly and feeling that, oh God, being excited is so much just like anxiety, you know, but just with an anticipation of something good rather than an anticipation of something bad, but all of the feelings in the bodies is very, very, very similar. But that's really interesting and I haven't heard that, that you're saying there's all of these kinds of freakout happening. And is there kind of a residual effect of whatever happened during the lockdown to the virus that actually have an effect on people's brains or something? Yeah, yeah, I don't know. And I have found it particularly hard to, during COVID, it was very easy to teach. And because people were quiet and the distractions were removed, it was so nice and that way, you know? Yes. And they had an interest, they were suffering as we do whenever something happens that is unexpected or we don't get what we want or all of those things. There's always a benefit to those kinds of life situations which are inevitably gonna happen to all of us anyways, but they were really easy to teach and now it's feeling a little bit more difficult to get people to get centered and calm. So I find that fascinating that there's this freakout thing that's happening among people. You know, do you buy into the note, like the ages, the yugas, do you buy into, you know, in the spiritual communities inevitably, someone will brush, not brush off, but as a kind of general explanation for what the world as it is, they'll go, it's the Kali Yuga, we're in the age of disintegration we're in the age of collapse. These are all things that were prophesized and this is what we're in. And I do subscribe to that theory. I don't know if that's an a historic way of looking at things. I'm sure like if we jump back 500 years, 1,000 years, but the yugas are very long, but if we jump back further back, it would probably seem equally chaotic, but sometimes I think to myself, oh, this is compounding. Like, you know, in Buddhism, there's this beautiful analysis prescription for why, if you're feeling this thing, the shared quality that is they call suffering dukkha, here's why you're feeling it. And the why, I'm gonna butcher it, but how do you just say why? But it has something to do with like, you're trying to scratch an itch that, you know, that in the wrong part of your body, it's like, what a disaster if you're head itched and you were trying to like scratch your leg, disaster. And then the intensity of the scratching can like grows or the method or that's, okay, I'll get a better scratching tool. Clearly the tool is, but it's no, you're scratching the wrong place. But if this were to compound over time, my God, I mean, it is disastrous, apocalyptic even, you know, it's a, I know that in Buddhism, you don't run into the cool eschatological stuff you run into and like some of the other religions, but what a prescription for apocalypse, a shared confusion regarding what happiness is and how to find happiness. And it's, but remember, it's always been true. It feels like it's heightened to you now, huh? And maybe it is, and maybe it's part of this communication that we're able access to everything, access to pleasure, access to, you know, I mean, the fact that we can just play any music that we want to at any time, that is a very distinct experience. You know, that's just like a question we can have, you know, fruits from South America, we can have cheese from whatever, you know, and wines from here, it's just like everything is at our fingertips and we're seeing that and it's aggravating because it's not, it's not actually, you know, building anything that's making us really complete or happy. So, but I, and I like those predictions and it does seem real, you know, all of the people with their psychedelic experiences having these kinds of different kinds of understandings and real to me that there's an awakening happening at this particular time. Is that what the Kali Yuga thing means? Or that it's- Well, I think like after the Kali Yuga, the Matreya, the idea is that the next Buddha appears, but you've got to get through the Kali Yuga to get to the Buddha, unfortunately, and it's not like a, it's not a nice hike. Yeah, yeah. So the prophecy that I've heard that's within the Theravada tradition and it might be similar to Tibetan tradition is that this particular dispensation, Sasana, they call it, of the Buddhist teachings, this Sakyamuni Buddha will last 5,000 years. So we're kind of halfway through that. And what will happen is fully enlightened beings will disappear from the planet and each time, and then third stage enlightenment will then disappear and then second stage and then first stage, will disappear each- There's stages? I'm sorry, after you describe this, I really want to go through the stages of enlightenment. Okay, good, yeah. There's lots of reading you can do on that too. I'll try to give a little intro to it, but once those beings start to disappear, then it's kind of like Eckhart Tolle called free beings, kind of frequency holders. Like they keep us, you know, we might not even see them, but still they're affecting the being. But ethical behavior is supposed to decline. Life expects expectancy is supposed to go down to 10 years old for humans. Yeah, and then the dispensation will die and then that's when myotry or metaya is the holy word for the metaya Buddha will come. Who's supposed to have an emphasis of metha, practice of metta, of loving kindness. Wow, so the next Buddha is going to be like 10 or 80%. No, no, no, because there will be a reemergence, I think before, but that's a good question. From my understanding, no, like good things will start happening on the earth to enable the Buddha to come. It could be like 80,000 years from now, but you know, yeah. Yeah, a long time, it could be, who knows? I mean, look, again, like all of these things, I love these wondering over these things, but generally like, I know whenever I'm wondering over these things, I'm just trapped in my mind again. I'm doing like karma math, I'm doing yoga math. You know, what is this, truly, if you're like trying to find some peace or happiness, it's not calculating like what part of the Kali Yuga you're in. It's still good conversation though, because people that have come to see these things have done so through generating a powerful mind of concentration that enables them to see neither different people's minds. I mean, the cities or the psychic powers are a real thing. Have you ever read the Deepama book or know about Deepama? Oh, you'll love Deepama. She's an interesting Buddhist teacher. Jack knew her. I've heard of her. I've never read the book. Oh yeah, but then in that, you can see what can happen. This is kind of Buddhist magic, but it's not magic. It's natural, super natural. The capabilities of our minds are much more than we tap into in our regular awareness, you know? And what makes them strong is concentration, symbol-pointed awareness where distractions are gone and then the hindrances and afflictions are gone and at that point we become much more powerful beings and there's a lot of different kinds of possibilities walking through walls and walking on water. Jesus did it, you know? And apparently, I wasn't there, apparently. Yeah, it's almost as though I've got a lot. I mean, look, we can get lost in my theories on what that might be, but you know, if you had an observer effect or something, you would expect that, you know, if what they're saying now, there's some like relationship between attention and matter, then you would expect that if that attention shifted, then your experience of matter would probably change with it simultaneously. Oh, well said, really, really nicely said, yeah. Oh, thanks, yeah, well, who knows? You know, who knows? I can't wait to walk through walls. You don't have to have fun watching my experience. That sounds fun. How great, you don't have to look for doors anymore, you just, you're out, just as long as you're on the first floor, your teeth are great, because, you know, you walk through walls, but can you like manifest steps? That's the question. Well, you could, because you could change any, you know, the world, the material world is made up of the elements, and so apparently, I haven't tried it yet. I may still, I might, it takes a lot of effort though. How do you know? That's a good, you know, how do you know until you go walk into a wall? It's like, when was the last time you walked into a wall? Honestly, I haven't in a long time. Well, well, you know, they're made up that we've got the earth element, so you can change one element into the other element with that psychic power. So you can, out of air, you can build an earth element, and if you read the description of what Deepa Ma was supposed to do, was supposed to be able to do, it's very, very fascinating. But you're listening. Oh, yeah, I mean, and the frustrating thing about, and what I love about Buddhism in particular is, because this is a thing, thank God, that has been around for a long time, and because it's real, and because of many people devoting their lives to it generationally, there's maps, there's good maps, and within that, there's also an understanding of how to deal with perhaps the sudden appearance of what you're talking about, which I think for someone who is practicing and has a great teacher, I think it can be a little unsettling to suddenly have even the slightest vision of these possibilities, and within that, oh my God, what a joy for the ego, my God, if I can walk through walls, I'm gonna add that to my act, wait till the audience sees me walk through a wall. I don't know if it'll get a laugh, but it'll definitely be cool. And then, so within, it seems like worked into the process is a way to not get too trapped in those various cities that they talk about could potentially emerge. Yeah, exactly, and that's what you would get for your listeners, that the book is Deepa Ma, and somebody tested her ability back in the 80s to be able to do these things, which she apparently demonstrated, she would never laugh, when she had the wisdom to know she would never perform them to gain something personal, attention or recognition. And even me, if I was ever able to develop those, I would never perform them for recognition because it isn't the point of practice, the point of practice is for the alleviation or eradication of dukkha and stress. Yes, and maybe this is why it's kind of worked into it is a, as Chugham Trump has said, disown it, just okay, fine, whatever, you turn into a rainbow, great. Well, you still have a mortgage. So, they're not gonna, they don't care. Turning into a rainbow will not make the banks be like, oh, you turn into a rainbow, okay, we'll skip this month's payment. But also turning into rainbow is a temporary state, so it's also stressful, and anything that is temporary is stressful. So, we're still talking about stress. And as mindfulness, as our mindfulness, which just means our awareness of ourselves increases, we incline our mind towards that deeper kind of happiness that we started this conversation.

Not like psychological boundaries or healthy relationship boundaries, but rather boundaries between the confused mind or the untrained mind and the non-confused mind. And I'm curious just your thoughts on that. Like if you were to see the sort of spectrum of consciousness and the potential of the expansion of the circumference of self-awareness, what separates enlightenment from monkey mind? Is there even a separation? Or are the thoughts themselves repetitive? It was Jack puts it, what does he say, the top 10 like repetitive thoughts? Someone actually just did a study. It was really depressing. We think the same things like 80% of the time, just this loop. You don't need one day on of a personal retreat and you'll see that. You don't need a study. Got a skipping neurotic record. But I'm curious, where does that stop? Where does it stop? And what is the liminal space between that and what one might call expanded awareness or a deeper way of experiencing one's reality? One of my teachers told me one of my main teacher, Bonte Kipapeno, who's a monk. And he has a monastery just in Riverside, California. And he's 94 years old now. And he's one of the most profound beings. I've sent a lot of Westerners to him. And they don't tend to stick around for him. He's very subtle and he's really humble. And I find sometimes Westerners don't like that. But they miss the people. We want a light show. Yeah. And Pat, Pat, one of my backs had it a lot. Or maybe they think that because he's Asian, the Asians are just more like that. If they saw somebody moving with the grace that he did that were more familiar, I'm not sure. I'm not sure why. But anyways, he's a really profound monk. And he continued to practice from the time he was 15 when he became a monk all the way until now. So I enjoy watching him. But one time he told me a fully enlightened being. And we're going back to those four stages of enlightened, a fully enlightened being. So an arhat thinks only when they intend to think. That's awesome. Isn't that awesome? Yes. Yes. Wow, cool. Mastery of the mind, right? Complete mastery. Only any people. Intro. Like it's an app. Because we don't understand the busyness of our mind. Think about that and then that and that and that. We're driving, but we're actually rehearsing something that we're going to do later. Or we're anticipating a worst case scenario. Or we're hating ourselves in some way or doubting ourselves in some way. And these stories, these stories, as we're just driving. Imagine that we start to see with vipassana, with mindfulness. We see that's an energy stuff that takes away. It does something. It's consequential on our nervous system. So we can't even envision what the freedom of that is like in our regular awareness. But that is what meditation can give for us, is to clear away that. And then we start to see, wow, the mind that is directed, that is to have mastery of the mind is a glorious thing. You hear all this stuff. Fundamental goodness, emptiness. What's the difference between a thought and fundamental goodness? Or what is the difference between an emptiness? Is there a difference between a thought and emptiness? In your own experience, with emptiness and with thinking, if you had to differentiate the two, what's the difference? Emptiness as a concept isn't used in teravada practice so much, which is where I was trained and have come from. That's why I kind of don't understand what the reference is when they're, except for injonic practices, of seeing the inherent. Empty is not a word I would use. It's just not a word that I would use. It's a confusing word. It's a confusing word. To me, it's a confusing word. But to others, that it is not a confusing word. I mean, that's the thing about words, is that people hold them differently, but they're meaningful in different ways for different people. The difficulty of teaching is trying to explain something that is not explainable with these words. May I rephrase the question? Yeah. If the mind is, or what we call the mind, is a thought container. Meaning that your thoughts are appearing within what many people perceive as the container of identity yourself, or that's me, or my, for my label, which is my head. What is the difference between the thought forms that appear and the space defining the container itself, whether it's, you want to say, your head, your identity? What are the difference? What's the difference between the two? Is there a difference? So, and there's two minds, right? We have the knowing mind, or consciousness, what we call consciousness, the aware mind. And then there's mind objects, thoughts or objects of the mind. And so, their appearance comes. There's another thing that happens of identity with a thought when we're believing it. That's mind. I am thinking that. I believe that, what I'm thinking. That's kind of a different process of the mind. So, as even not, if a fully enlightened person thinks only when they intend to think, when you're like a first stage enlightened person, or a second stage or whatever, or even if you're just meditating, because an aware mind is a moment of that full enlightenment, then there is, there's not identifying with the thoughts. I mean, it can be on a very subtle level, but the moment that you know that you're thinking, there's a break in the identification process. You're not just wrapped up in the thought itself, believing the thought itself. And then what's most important is not to get rid of thoughts, but what did the Buddha say is that we're trying to cultivate usala, what? Usala is mostly translated as wholesome or skillful, which is a word that I've never loved. But what it's really pointing to is those kinds of thoughts that lead towards, and this we can taste in our direct experience. And that's the most important place to taste it, not to think about it, not to theorize about it, who really tastes me. And the Buddha said that when you see these things as unwholesome, when you yourself, not because somebody told you, not because it was written in a book, not because the teacher seems like he's pretty awesome or whatever, but when you yourself see this is not worthy of my attention, then abandon it. When you yourself see this is beneficial, this is helpful. So that's what wholesome means, those things that we can taste in our experience. So I often ask my students in class to clarify the definition of this word. What is a mind state that you know is not helpful to you? What do you experience as a mind state that is not helpful? And they'll say worry or they'll say self-hatred or they'll say fear or they'll say anger, you can feel it, you can taste it. And afterwards you have remorse when you act on those things. You know, it doesn't, not onward leading that phrase. Onward leading, that's cool, onward leading. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I like that a lot. Trump is to make a distinction between setting sun, rising sun, which I think might be a similar way of sort of, you know, when the sun's coming up, you know, when the sun's coming down, it's simple as civil can be. Because we have to be careful in our, and I don't know if it's particularly culturally, but I think it is Western culture. We really have to be careful with puritanical kind of thinking of good and bad and right and wrong and judgmental and within Buddhist psychology. And what is Buddhism? All it is is, you know, the Buddha said apparently, I teach one thing to one thing, only stress in the end of stress. That's what it is. There's no belief. There is a cosmology. We were talking about it a little bit. There are these other abilities in that, but it is just a practical psychological tool really. And it's working with the mind and alleviating the mind from the causes of suffering, which are very powerful in all of us. And that first noble truth, that there is dukkha in the world, is just pointing to the fact that you look around. I did this in my Sunday class. I said, just this morning, if you could reflect on your morning, what is something that you experienced that was stressful? And for me, I had felt, I was playing pickleball and I felt nervous. I woke up kind of grumpy. You know, I had three different mind states just that day that were stressful. And so everybody shared, they all had the same. And it was really beautiful because everybody feels so trapped and alone in that. Feel like it's a particular problem to them. And that's what that first noble truth is to alleviate that, this is me, this is mind. No, this is just what we get as humans. This, what you described in the mind and all of the negative mind states that come with that. But the important thing is there's a cure for it. Well, nobody wants that really. I mean, the great meditation teachers like you, so good at like, you understand. And I think the reason you understand is because you've been through many of these phases. I don't know what phase of enlightenment you might be. Most meditation teachers don't really get into that at all. You know, diagnosing themselves as like, I'm in three C, enlightened being or whatever, which we appreciate on the other side of the fence. But, and I like that you're replacing suffering with stress. It's easier for people to understand. Sufferings of, stress we get, suffering, what does that even mean? Like, well, like you get stuck in a trap or something. I've never been stuck in a bear trap. That when I picture suffering, I think of a wild animal in a trap, you know? So it's hard for me, but you're in a wild animal in a trap. The trap looks like what you're talking about. Yeah. Except the problem being like wild animals, they're not born in these traps and humans are not born in the traps, but our memory banks don't record the pre trap situation. So we begin to associate the trap with who we are. We paint the trap, we tell stories about the trap, take pictures of the trap, find other people with the same trap, go out drinking with them, dancing with them, marry them, have children with them, and then give the traps to our children. You're gonna wear the trap, your father wore. What is this new trap? This is ridiculous. But I want to, I wanna point something out to me that I think gets left out. And I get why. This is an apocalypse. You're the, Buddhism, I get it. It's the, if your trap is your identity, we're talking apocalypse. And the, in the sense of like, this is even a glimpse as I'm sure you've had of life minus the trap, just a glimpse. You know, they talk about the possibility of realizing, you know, this thing that you have thought is real, it's not quite as real as you might have thought. In fact, there's no trap there. It's the worst kind of imaginary friend. It's not even there. And if you get one, not an intellectual, like I think I know what you mean, but an actual for a second, the transparency of it all. Whoa, whoa. It sounds like you've had that glimpse. I hesitate to report spiritual progress. Cause inevitably it means I'm about to get in a fight with my wife. It's like, right when I think that I'm like, I did it. It's like, no, so I will not report it. I'm just, It's not a claiming of the forever state, you know. The glimpses are so important. They're so important. I see you how they might be, but we started our conversation offline talking about clinging. And I really loved the email you sent me and I spent a long time thinking about it. And upon realizing for a second this other possibility, the life without stress thing. And then not just realizing it intellectually, or you hear people like you talking about it, or you see someone who for whatever reason doesn't seem like they're on fire all the time. Yeah. You have some faith or something, but then for a second you're like, okay, now look, look at your life now. What about this? There's no stress. You're not freaking out. You've been freaking out for two decades straight. You've been freaking out for two decades straight. Why have you been freaking out? You've been freaking out because you're addicted to freaking out. You are so infested in the freak out that it has become like when you go to the dentist and they're like, oh my God, it's calcified shit all over your teeth. And then you realize, what? I don't wanna let go. That's what I wanna talk about. I don't wanna let go. Don't know how to function in that world. It's a different world. And in fact, I don't exist in that world. And can you speak to that level of neurosis? Are there people who glimpse phase one enlightenment and are like, you know, I'm gonna pass. I think I'm just gonna walk around with a trap. No, not at first stage of enlightenment. That's when you, no, no, no. But that part's not important. It's too theoretical. But the other part of clinging and our original email, it's really important to see. I mean, I didn't like the, I didn't, I heard something in your conversation with Lex that felt familiar to the way I kind of, the part of Buddhism that didn't excite me. And then as I continued on in my practice, I started to realize the parts that weren't exciting me were because I wasn't understanding the concepts directly. I was misunderstanding the concepts. So, and many people do this idea of the translation of the word is upadana, translated very often as attachment. And another translation is clingy. And so many people come across that and they feel like, well, if I'm not attached to the people that I love, then how is that, you know, what exists in free of attachment and sounds very cold, it sounds callous, it doesn't sound interesting at all. Spock, Vulcan, spock, it sounds spock. Yeah, exactly, exactly. Which is not at all the case. When we look very closely, and again, this is best understood in everybody's direct experience, not in my explanation of it. But when we look really closely, so I'm just pointing to everybody's hearts now, that we're all the same, is that we attach in these various ways, the Buddha never even mentioned people that we attached to. But the definition, I brought it up because I thought, but the definition of upadana, the different kinds of clings we do, we attach to things being pleasant, particularly at the sense store. So there's other kinds of pleasure that we experience, but sensual pleasure, touch, you know, smell all of our five senses, or six sense being that of the mind. So what happens when we're in a relationship with anybody, whether a spouse or a child, and we want it to be a pleasant experience, nobody provides that for us all the time, you know. Our relationships are gonna be unpleasant at different times, whether they smell bad, or they look bad, or whatever, you know. So cleaning is so easy to see how that creates harm within a relationship, and actually prevents us from really loving them, from seeing them as a precious human being. And in fact, those two things are mutually exclusive. I think I saw a quote from Osho that said that, that attachment and love are mutually exclusive, and they're not existent in the mind at the same time. We can go back and forth between feeling attached, and then loving, and da, da, da, da, da, da, da. Because the mind moves that quickly, but when we're attached, we're pretty blinded to another being. We were like, I want this to be pleasurable, and then now it's gone away. Now I'm resenting the person, you know, like a lot of things can compound on top of that. And then the other way of attaching us to our ideas about them. So even if we, and I hope this doesn't sound callous or vulcan either, but even if we want somebody to be, we clean to the ideas, right? Now I've had a very difficult couple of weeks, because my brother, who was living with me, had a series of seizures, and he's been in the ICU unconscious for the last, sorry, and not regaining consciousness. And so, you know, the attachment is, my ideas of how things should be right now. And of course that could be a stress. And we're gonna do that still, only fully enlightened people don't do that. So it's not to shame this idea of cleaning an attachment, but to become very familiar and intimate with it, aware of it when it's present in us, and learning how to sit with it's suffering, and we do that, it doesn't stay as long, you know? We can process the grief or the non-acceptance or the resistance of reality that we're going through, because we learn to sit with that feeling of, meaning it should be like this. So to ideas, we're cleaning to ideas. Ideas aren't reality. The reality is where this person is, my brother is right now, the state in condition of deals right now. I want to thank Lumi Labs for supporting this episode of the DTFH, and for creating the greatest edible on earth. I'm an old man now, and I don't have the time or the capacity to go through a nervous breakdown if I'm going to take an edible. And also, my vision's a little weird these days. I don't want to measure it out or risk it or wonder if just maybe I didn't eat the right amount of edible, but in fact, took an MK ultra dose of THC, which is going to send me into some kind of dark spiral, which is why I love Lumi Labs. My friends, these are perfect edibles. After a lifetime of experiencing various edibles, I could not vouch more strongly for an edible than the beautiful micro dose gummies offered to us by Lumi Labs. Even better, they're available nationwide. You can fly with this wonderful medicine. That's right, you can just order them somehow. Y'all are lucky. In my day, if we wanted to find an edible like this, you'd have to travel to California, go up to Humboldt County, follow our rainbow to a little creek, and talk to a dude with a hat that was made for him personally by elves. Not anymore. Now, all you have to do is go to microdose.com, use code Duncan to get free shipping and 30% off your first order. Links can be found in the show description, but again, it's microdose.com, code Duncan. You are going to love these wonderful, wonderful edibles. Lumi Labs, thank you so much for supporting this podcast. Yoak Ideas aren't reality. The reality is where this person is, my brother is right now. The state in condition that he is right now. Oh my God. That is, this is not... Stuff has happened to me. My first response is, I just think this isn't fair. I got to negotiate here. Who do I talk to? Do you have a manager? Is there a manager I could talk to here? This is ridiculous. Who's running this? Are you, it's me. You don't do this to me. You're doing this to me. That's my mom. You don't give my mom cancer. Who am I talking to? This is insane. How is this? This is as unfair as unfair. Man, I get just smashed and then you just end up like one of those, you know, you see the bird trapped in the house and it's so sad. Smashing into the window, smashing in the window. The window is, the bird doesn't meditate enough for it to fly right through. But it's, it's, you know, it's, it's so sad. And then that's how I react to, to what you're talking, events at that level. That's my go-to is this isn't fair. I deserve better than this. Are you kidding me? And I get mad. I get mad. Exactly. And that's human. And, and so our job at this level that we are at now is, it's not to say, well, don't do that. You're just creating more suffering when you do that. But what mindfulness is, is not shaming that part of ourselves, but really being able to sit with that as an internal reality. You know, we've got the external reality, the internal reality denies it. And once we do, we start to see this isn't changing anything that's making us suffer a lot, a lot more. And then, and then, and then so we wake up and mature more and then we can more accept the realities that light doesn't want to do what we want it to do. It's easier to be angry. I mean, it's easier, it feels easier to be angry than to sit with that heartbreak. You know, heartbreak is all sweet. It's vulnerable. It's just love. It's, it's, it's a, it's like when it's a baby smiling at you when you sit with it long enough. And, but the baby is, it's like, I don't want the baby to be dealing with this. And then, so this is to keep, and I am sorry that you're going through this. And I appreciate you coming on the podcast as you're going through something like this. What I love about Vipassana as I understand it, which I don't think is a very clear understanding, is this invitation to go to that place to like, you know, open, open the door, go, go in the room. And the, the room of the room that you've been, a lot of us have been like actively, aggressively avoiding. And, went from, from me glimpses of recognizing that the thing I thought was the worst thing seems to be the best thing about me. Or the best thing I've ever been, I can't, you can't believe it. You can't, it seems ridiculous that this thing actually, your whole life you've been running away from this gift that is inside of you. That's what Vipassana practice does, it is just shedding of the layers. And you really do feel like you get down to something that was so familiar and somehow forgotten. That's the sense of it. And then of course, so rich and satisfying and deep, you know, deeply satisfying, deeply, deeply satisfying. But Vipassana is just an exploration of our consciousness. And it's the only tool to do it, you know. It's got this word that is a language we don't understand, but it's near to all of us. It's not a Buddhist thing. It is a, it's a reality. It's a way of exploring consciousness because you can't, as Mathuricard said, you can't look at, doctors can't measure, look at, they know nothing about consciousness. There's no tool or instrument to look at consciousness. And the only way to do that is in the first person. And so that's, that's what Vipassana does. Let's look at sadness, let's look at grief, let's look at this body and sensation and emotion and feeling and the way the mind and the body are connected. And so Vipassana is called insight meditation because these are the insights. If you have insights, these aren't Buddhist insights, they're, they're insights into nature. So the translation of Vipassana is to see nature. We're just looking at reality and the reality of thought, you know, explore it. What are thoughts? Look at them. If you want to know the mind, sit down and look at it, that we're ninja, I think, that's the only way to do it. And Vipassana is a technique and a tool to do that. We have to sustain the mind and the intention and concentration so that it is able to see things on a more subtle level. We have a, you know, a real scattered mind. We're only seeing things on a grosser level. But once concentration comes there, the mind can start to perceive things on a deeper level. You can, you know, hear a sound and see it right through the, I mean, sometimes like a psychedelic will help you to heighten the senses to be able to... I've heard that. Yes. This... So that's what it is and it alleviates stress because you're looking at, in the mind, what is the cause of stress? And it's a reality for everybody. And it's a universal truth that we start to see. Just like if we jump into the ocean, we know that other people will get wet from the water because we have when we did it, right? And so same in the mind, we start to see these things of the universal, you know, what is the cause of stress? And the universal truth. So necessary for you to go on of the Plotten Meditation Retreat. I got kicked out of the last one. I'm not allowed to go. I'm banned from all the Plotten Meditation Retreats. What did you do? Walked through a wall into the ladies' bathroom. I didn't know it was there. I just learned to walk through a wall. I did not mean to do it, but they were like... And then I tried to walk back out because I was freaked out or whatever. I just slammed into the wall. So nobody believed me. They thought I was a creep or something, you know? So then, yeah, they're like, you're banned. You can't do it. I do want to go. My wife is like, you know, we have kids. So like finding the space to do it and everything. You know the old story, but my wife is really encouraging me to do it, which is awesome because it means she's gonna be out of contact with me for I think 10 brutal days. Yeah. But I am interested. I'm really interested in the... I feel like I have noticed that all the rotten emotions that I was experiencing and trying to avoid are not quite as rotten as I thought they were. And then because of that, I'm not freaking out as much, which is great. But I'm interested in this because I'm just... And the reason I keep asking you these annoying questions about the boundary between this and that is just because I'm fascinated by the... And I love what Menundra said regarding, look, just go look at it. Don't ask me. You want to know what the Mona Lisa looks like. Go to the Louvre, but when you're talking... Disappointing! But when you're talking to someone who is trained, I feel like it's important to kind of get some ideas regarding like... What is thinking regarding like the content of pain or the content of suffering or the components of what one might call stress? And similarly with boredom, we all say we're bored. No one... Like, what is boredom? Define it for me. So how if you had to define stress? Not just as like, it's a shitty feeling, but what is it to you? I think it's a shitty feeling is the best definition of it. I really think so. Because what does it say in the First Noble Truth that Buddha said, birth is stress, right? Did you see your wife get birth? Yes. Yeah, so you saw the stress. That's Duka. There's some pain and suffering there. Oh, for her, I don't know. I wasn't paying attention. For me, it was very stressful. And being separated from those we love is stress, things happening that we don't want to happen, not getting what we want, getting what we don't want. Causes. Causes. Can you like, let's say, and again, it's like describe red. That's an annoying question. But if you had to describe, and not red as well, it's the color of blood. But describe suffering to me, or I'm sorry, stress to me, from the perspective of someone who has done countless hours of meditation. How, I'm an alien. I come from the best planet ever. We don't know what stress is. Describe it to me. What, not the causes. What is it? Yeah. Thoughts in the head and feelings in the body that are unpleasant and uncomfortable. And so when we're feeling stressed, that's all that's happening. There's thoughts in the head that are stressful. And then that in itself would be a fine thing, because it doesn't hurt that much mentally. It's when it comes into our bodies, they don't know the feeling and the sensation that it experiences. It makes us feel sick, or tight, or just pretty much not well, not clear, not happy, not content. Is that a good description? But you know it well, you've experienced it daily. You're probably experiencing it on some level right at this moment. Tightly, I'm gonna throw out a few, then you throw a few back to me, like a party game. Tightly coiled anaconda wrapped around heart chakra. Or, or. You're much better with that than I am. You're so good with descriptive words, that's great. It's so dense, it's tight, it's, you know, the classic is just like diaper rash, except it's in your soul. Your soul has diaper rash, or whatever your soul's hanging out in is. It's a rashy ache that is unremitting, unrelenting. Like that, can you give me a few from your own experience with that? I just love that you're doing that, because it's so helpful to people that would follow you and listen to your podcasts, and whatever successes you've had in the world, and the friends that you keep, you know, you're so cool, all of these kinds of things, what people get disconnected from is that, you know, and it's so great, and I've learned this as a teacher too. I assume that people know that I'm full of all that stuff that you just described, but they don't. And so it really is, as a teacher, it's a new learning, that I have to share that with people. I have to share that I experience these things because it really helps people to not shame themselves when they are going through that experience, or to think now that they're a Buddhist, they should no longer be having these kinds of experiences, the lust, and the craving, and the anger, and the rage, and all of those things, and just the pain of it all. Shame we can do without in our spiritual practice. Such a hindrance to our spiritual practice. We have to let that one go. And that is a great healer. What you're doing right now, I'm sharing that with people, is very helpful. So just see, this is the first noble truth. Pain and suffering, pain and suffering. Yeah. Expert. Expert on the first noble truth. That's where it stops. So if you're ever giving a class, I could come in for the very first part, and that's it. That's not true. You've seen the alleviation of stress. You have to. I have, yeah. But that's a thrilling thing, and you know, I'm lucky. I work with David Nickturni, he's an amazing teacher, and he so knows me so well that he understands like my grasping mind really wants to like kind of retire after sitting in a hotel and having a fleeting glimpse of something that I've been hearing about for a long time. But I just am really interested in the, I guess I'm getting too detailed. I'm just very interested in the quantum properties of suffering, the, you know, what are we talking about here? I mean, we are talking about the engine of war. We're talking about the coal that starts all the fires that cause all the problems. And so little is being, we know how to split an atom. That's incredible. We're about to have fusion, but what about the fundamental cause of the reason we need fusion reactors now? It's cause we want so much that we got to keep things moving. The reason we want to split the atom because we want more energy or want to kill a bunch of people. The impulse behind it is this annoying anaconda thing. So I am curious about it and really curious about your thoughts on what, why is it that when you stop running away from it and just put your attention on it, why is it that it changes into something not so bad or nothing at all? What's happening there? What is this relationship? Can you tell me what this is? What's going on here? The difference between delusion and seeing clearly, that's it, that's delusion always, the not seeing of the suffering that makes it perpetuate. We don't see it. So what did Buddha say whenever, you know, Mars, the personification of all of these afflictive states or whatever he would say, just very simply and I think compassion and MRI see you. And so that's what we're doing when we practice mindfulness practice is just seeing, I wasn't looking at this before, we're not looking, we're not aware of ourselves in life when it's happening, which is in the present moment. We're constantly thinking about something else as much good or bad, but we're right or wrong, but it does perpetuate stress, you know. And so the seeing of it, we see the futility of the mind which we're living in all of the time. And that's really unnerving for people to hear how very frequently, that's what a repost in a retreat will do too, is go, I am crazy. That's what I hear. That's what I hear. That's what I hear. But it's not why that I'm crazy. It is this human experience that it's, you know, and the thinking mind that perpetuates. And of course we have beauty in that and that's what it clarifies. That's what clarified from mindfulness practice. It automatically recedes and reduces the negativity of the mind, all of the afflictive states and the neurosis. That's how it came to me. That word felt very real to me on an experience I had. And this is just a neurosis, you know. And we have all the other beautiful things. We help each other. I have felt so much empathy coming in my direction from this experience I've been having with my brother, you know, like we connect, there's support, there's love, there's human connection, which is not the same as attachment. And generosity and those things grow. So it's not about annihilating everything, but growing, the Buddha said, cultivate the good. It is possible for you to cultivate the good. If it weren't possible, I wouldn't tell you to do so. If this cultivating of the good were to bring you suffering, I wouldn't tell you to do so, but because it needs to benefit and pleasure, therefore I say to you, cultivate the good. So that's what the word bhavana, which is the translation of, we translate as meditation, means, it means to cultivate. So meditation is just habituating the mind towards things that are on with you. And every mind is filled with this kind of self-perting mechanism. We're all doing it in useless, futile or ways that the mind perpetuates within us. Brunston.

Useless, euthyled with a way that the mind perpetuates within us confidently. Well, I mean, and then this is where it's really interesting, doesn't it? Like, oh, you identify that now you go to war with your mind. Now what you do is you break your mind into two pieces. It's like, OK, here's the non cultivated bad part of the garden. Now here's the good part of the garden. I'm going to start supplying weapons to the good part of the garden. We're going to. This is where, you know, in the psychedelic community, someone needs to start working with language because how many psychonauts do you hear who obliterated, destroyed, shattered, crushed their ego? All the languages, the word, the way they describe their experience is like, why would you do that to yourself? I understand that. But, you know, again, we're going back to language there. And that those words are used in. It what it what it depends is if that word brings up a version for you, which it did for me. Saitu Pandita was a big teacher about going into battle over it, and it would bring up anger in me. I thought I had to use. But we have to understand that the weapons that we use in this battle are compassion, their loving kindness, their awareness of self. And when we we get used to using those weapons, then the then crushing and obliterating and annihilating. Those words don't. They're they're a bit more meaningful, but we do have to be careful because you do have to go in with and even the ideas of good and bad and right and wrong are not good. It's what leads to stress and what does not cause an effect. There's a cause and effect. That's an observable law in this universe called karma translated as karma or karma. You know, but it's observable, observable. You can see that the mind is the forerunner of all things. When we think, actors speak from a certain mind state, it's consequential. And we can change that. That's changeable. So all my mundane way of understanding it is. I'm friends with a bunch of comedians. Some of them are known as like their roast comedians, meaning they have. Perfected the ability to analyze someone and say the cruelest, funniest thing you've ever heard, but the only reason they can do it. And have the audience like them is because behind it is love. And when a comedian is getting roasted, they laugh. It's not a fake laugh. It's because they there's a comrade weird camaraderie there at the moment. People are doing that as comedians, and that's not there. They lose instant lose the audience. They don't like it. No one wants to see someone get savaged and their feelings hurt. So, yeah. So, but I know what you mean by this kind of like compassionate wrathfulness that there when there's love behind it, it works. But when there isn't, yeah, it's just it's just going to throw up someone's defense mechanism. So maybe what maybe in the identification of the. The untamed, uncultivated mind. There's a possibility to be. Loving to that part of oneself, but for me, yeah, yeah, yes. I had to incline my mind in that way, but I had to stop using the anger and everything as I heard these battle analogies. I was like, oh, that's not effective. And and I've had teachers that are really good at seeing you, you know, watching your motivation. It will creep in sometime or greed will creep in. We want we're trying to achieve something spiritually. And that's an interference in our practice also, you know, greed and hatred as the motivating factor is not it's not good. So it just takes an inclination. OK, kindness and kindness. But I love that you said that about comedians, too. And I feel like I've always been a big fan of comedy from the time I was a little kid. And what I love about it is the ability to laugh at and point out the absurdity, those are the great composite of this human existence. Yes. Yeah. I mean, yes. And when it's done, right, it's, you know, it's I just saw a great comedy show last night and it's like, I still am just so happy just from the experience of like, whoa, just seeing that is really nice. But let me pat myself on the back some more for being a comedian. I I do you have a little bit more time. I know you've you. I can't believe you gave me an hour of your time right now. If I've been more aware of what I wish I could help. I'm the worst at like, I don't know how to respond to things like that. I don't I know you're not supposed to say I'm sorry. But then you're not supposed to, you know, there's all these things you're not supposed to do. Who's that? I don't know. I read it somewhere. Don't say you're sorry. So I don't know what else to say. Like, Jesus, that sucks. You don't have to. Glad I'm not you. Yeah, yeah, me too. I'm glad I'm not me where. OK, and I'm going to shut up about the stupid boundary thing. What is the action of self compassion? Who is being compassionate to who here? Who my I have a sense that really there's some imaginary boundary here or something that's causing a lot of problems and that once you see past that boundary or it's just I mean, God, I mean, you know, everyone wants a nice view. Everybody wants a house with a nice view. And I don't know if you saw the curb your enthusiasm or Larry David. It's like, you really like the view you get. You just look at the view a few times. You don't care about the view anymore. It's but in this situation, it's kind of like, you know, a prisoner gets moved just moving a prisoner from solitary confinement to a cell with a simple little window overlooking anything is going to be for that prisoner, the greatest thing that ever happened to them. It's like, my God, I can see, see, see out. So is it possible to really be compassionate to oneself? Like, I can lift a thing with my hand. I can move stuff around. But is this thing you're talking about a result of seeing something a little more expansive? And then that thing, naturally, it is being compassionate to the little you that you thought was all of you. Does that make sense? Yeah, yeah. And, you know, the. The compassion is a cultivated mind state, right? And it arises. We should understand it. It needs to be studied by by meditation to really understand what compassion is, because people use that word. And for codependency, sometimes, or for guilt, or for. There was another one, I don't know. But anyways, we can mistake our emotions. To real compassion is a desire to alleviate a wish for somebody to alleviate their pain and suffering. So the freedom to wish of beings to be free from suffering, wishing ourselves to be free from suffering. Who is doing that? What is that great question? And you can keep asking that because that might obliterate your ego. My question. Incinerated. It could do all of all of those things. And, you know, again, it's answerable and direct experience only. But we are at distinct beings, right? If I pinch myself, you don't feel it. We have a mind and we have a body. The I part is a psychological component of the mind that says I am that makes ourselves permanent and forever. But what we are is a being that is changing and in a constant state of change, there's nothing solid. And even this very being, this identity is going to change and transform at some point, apparently. And I mean, we know we're going to die, but apparently it changes. Then the mind finds another body, apparently. But even we don't even have to discuss that. We can just look within our own lives and know from 10 years ago how much we've changed or from when we're a baby, how much we've changed. So what we start to see with insight is that we're, that Ram Dass says, the changing series of events. We are distinct individuals, though, and so it's not a no-self in that way. But as Tunisar Bhikkhu says, the Buddha said to relate to things as not so. This is not me. This is not mine. This I am not because it's that mental process of identifying with something that brings a lot of pain and strip. It's really helpful to do with our difficult emotions too. You know, I mean, so much gets compounded on people and their suffering. But they experience loneliness or if they experience a problem in love. And that can be very helpful, but this is not me. You know, people identify with the broken parts of their self. They identify with those parts of their broken. I am of this kind of person. People report to me all the time. They come to my classes. My mind is always wandering. I'm like, okay, who else? Everybody, like, okay, it's so funny what we call I. It's so funny what we call I. Yes, yeah, yeah, it's, it's a, it's a really interesting phenomena. That maybe we'll get, you know, sometimes I wonder as Buddhism or insight, whatever you want to call it, really like a short-term fix for a like problem with a brain that got too big too fast and we just got confused. And now we've, I did that confusion has become culture and everything that we call civilization is just a byproduct of this sort of the Neo Cortex grew too fast. Cortex grew too fast. Something happened. No, it's, it's broader than just that. I mean, this is, this is talking about realms of existence and the cure for, for anyways, we won't speculate, but do you practice mindfulness? I do. Yes, I do. And after you practice, do you feel some benefit? I do. That's the most important thing to just always look at that. And it never stops in my experience. You'll see it's always in the benefits, just deeper and deeper and deeper and better and better. And the healing of that ache in the soul that you described is available and it will just keep happening. Good news. That's good news. And always connect your mind with that cause that you put in, if your meditation practice to the effect and the cause you put in that a night of drinking to the effect and the cause that you put in when we lose our tempers to the effect and the cause that you put in being generous and helpful to people to the effect. That's cool. Well, that's what mindfulness is. It's just paying attention. And when we do that. Oh, then I don't practice mindfulness. I'm sorry. I thought it was something else. What do you do? Well, you know, I like, I practice, but I practice mindfulness the way I practice doing abdominal exercises. I mean, you know, you see someone at the gym, you're like, Jesus, look at that. So yes, but I'm going to start practicing mindfulness now. Thank you. Do you do the pot? Do you do these vipassana retreats yourself? I want to go to the one you run. Oh, okay. Well, I'll tell you when I do, I don't have one scheduled right now. I really want to offer them freely and I'm just waiting for that ship to come about. I just want to offer them for that's how all my retreats were. And yeah, I just want to offer them freely. And in the West, they've become so much a part of this and they have to in, you know, various ways. So there's places that have offered me to come, but I just, I want it to be free. You could have a spring around food or something. Well, there's all kinds of ways. And I feel like, you know, Sairu Pandita said, you put your mind on something and a wholesome intention, it will manifest. So it will manifest, but I will let you know if I do a retreat. Thank you. For sure. Thank you for your time. Thank you for answering my lopsided questions. Melissa, it's really been a joy chatting with you. And just thank you for out of the blue, sending a really powerful email to me. That has become a co-on. And I think about it there apart for a second. I'm like, no, no. And then I'm like, oh, it's totally right. And then you're a great teacher because I always, you know what? Now, if something annoys me when I read it at first, I'm like, no way, way. I'm like, oh, shit, it's good. This is good, but it's in there. It didn't annoy me. But you know what I mean? It was, it wasn't even challenging, but it disrupted some confusion that I was having. And I really appreciate the time you took to write it. That was very kind of you. And thank you. I look forward to talking to you more in the future if you have time and. Much love to your brother. Oh, yeah. Where can people find you? Oh, well, I teach a weekly class on zoom, Melissa McKay.net is the easiest way. Now has all the things. Great.

Check out the latest in-store, and we're never short on options at jcp.com. All dressed up everywhere to go. JCPenney. Hey, everybody. It's me, Dee T. Selle. I'm the Dugga Dressel family, our podcast. I'm so sorry. I got mosquitoes. Holy shit. Fucking studio. I guess the mosquitoes are different than any mosquito I've ever encountered. But I sort of want to do a little dress. What's going on right now? Here in the styles, the whole spitting controversy. Mother fuck. Did he really spit? That's the question. That's the last one. God, these mosquitoes in Texas are horrible. They don't sound like normal mosquitoes. Sometimes they chant. Sometimes they just imitate your voice. Perfectly replicate your voice. You just say things that are similar to what you're saying. It's really crazy when you're trying to have a conversation. Gotcha. Back to Harry Styles. Did he spit? I'm correct. I think a lot of people didn't. Let's think of all America and we all know that. As of all of us, we all know that. Get the hell out of this culture. It's not going to work. God damn it. What the fuck? This is a little bit of a deep wound. Fuck. Holy shit. I think it's a waste of time. Fuck it. What the fuck? See that? Fuck. I'm trying to do something. Mother fuckers. I think that was the last one. That was the last. I think that was the last one. Fuck this. I'm getting exterminated. I'm getting exterminated. Cut to commercial beer though. This episode of the DTFH has been supported by Babbel. I live in Texas now. Why didn't I pay attention in Spanish class? I didn't. I hated it. It was like having my back ripped open with demon claws and hot salt poured in the festering wounds. I just disliked the process of learning another language. If only Babbel had existed when I was in high school. I would be a polyglot instead of a monolingual, which is incredibly avarito. That means boring in Spanish. Thanks to Babbel's addictively fun and easy bite-sized language lessons, you can finally cross learning that new language off your list. I've been taking French lessons with Babbel and they're addictive and fun. It's like someone at MKUltra decided to start a website where they teach people how to speak another language.

I just covered myself in a psychotropic poison that was given to me by Grant Williams from Grant Williams Austin Exterminators. This poison is incredible. The only problem is that it creates an alteration to your vocal chords, which honestly, I don't mind. I like the way I sound right now and I'm completely okay talking like this for the rest of my life. That means I don't have to deal with any more of these Austin mosquitoes. Even better, this is the perfect voice for me to read an excerpt from one of my favorite Julia London books, Extreme Bachelor. He kissed her laugh, felt himself floating, the feral sensations taking hold. With his mouth in his hands, he slid down her body, leaving a hot, wet trail on her belly. He pushed her thighs apart, kissing them tenderly and spurred on by Leah's gasps and moans. And then he moved slightly so that his mouth was on her sex. Leah gasped and clutched his head. Michael loved that about her. She was a lusty lover and he slipped his tongue between the slick folds. He held her firmly with his hand and casually. Sorry about that, gang. That was obviously not me. That was the final mosquito in my studio. Terrence Diler from Diler Exterminators brought a chunk of polonium. You just leave it in your studio and the radioactive material keeps the mosquitoes out. Thank you. If you're having mosquito problems in Austin, all the links you need to find them will be at DuncanTrussell.com. Friends, I hope you will come see me. If you're in Austin, I'm going to be at Vulcan on the 17th. Then after that, I'm going to be at Cobbs in San Francisco. Then after that, I'm headed to Utah. There's many more dates after that. All of them are at DuncanTrussell.com. Would you like commercial free episodes of the DTFH? You can get them at patreon.com forward slash DTFH. We also have a weekly gathering every Friday and a meditation group that meets every Tuesday morning. I hope you'll join us. That's patreon.com forward slash DTFH. Today's episode has stuck with me ever since I got to have this conversation with Rom Dev, Dale Borglam. He is amazing. He's the executive director of a living dying project. He is somebody who works with dying people to help them live. It's a really heavy, really deep, really beautiful conversation that helped me connect a lot of thoughts that needed connecting personally. I think you're really going to enjoy it. If you are interested in connecting with Dale, reach out to a living dying project. A living dying project is at livingdying.org. I hope when you listen to this, you will consider donating to this amazing foundation. Now everybody, please welcome to the DTFH Rom Dev. Rom Dev, welcome to the DTFH. How you doing? So glad to be here, Duncan. I'm so happy that you're here. I got a lot of questions for you. I'm really interested in the service that you have offered to the world for a really long time. I've lost both my parents and I've had cancer. Me too. Oh, cancer club. And lots of great members. Now I know there's even another wonderful member of the club. I have in the past been horrified at this problem that we die. In researching you, I was really taken by your acknowledgement of something that came to me in a clinical ketamine therapy where whatever that voice is that speaks to you from the psychedelic realm said to me, your fear of death is actually your love of life in reverse. You're afraid to die because you love life so much. And that's where it's all coming from. And that was the beginning of me not to say it like if a bear came into my podcast studio, I wouldn't want to be like celebrating the fact that I was about to die or something like that. But it really shifted my thinking in regards to what the fear of death is. And in your work, I have found that when you are sitting with dying people, when you're working with dying people, really it isn't so much about dying as much as how do we live during whatever the amount of time we theoretically have left here in the world. And I wonder if we could just start off with your theory on, I think everyone by now probably knows what death is, but what do you think life is? What is living? Okay. Well, I'm the director of something called the Living Dying Project. It's a living slash dying project. And to me, it's about the slash between the living and the dying, that the way we live kind of determines how we die. And the fact we're going to die can inform how we'd like to live. So believe it or not, I've got a PhD in mathematics from Stanford. And here's my equation as a recovering mathematician. Okay. All fear is based on fear of death. And fear of death is exactly equal to lack of enlightenment. So that for instance, like the New York Times did a survey a bunch of years ago, what are you most afraid of? Number one was speaking in public, number three was dying. That's kind of funny on one hand. But at the same time, the part of Ramdev or of Duncan, that's afraid of speaking in public, we might get embarrassed, whatever. That's going to be at your bedside. I mean, the line that I've been using a lot, it's kind of fading a bit, but that when you're dying, Donald Trump is going to be at your bedside. He's going to be right there looking at you, right? What? That's bad news. Now, what I mean by that is whether you love the guy or hate him, you probably have a very strong and often unconscious emotional reaction to the guy and that place that's in your subconscious, unconscious, that place that you're caught in. I love Donald Trump. I hate Donald Trump. To the extent that you're caught on that, that's going to be there as you're dying. So that really another teacher of mine, this guy, Trungpa Rinpoche, he said, until you come into intimate contact with death, your spiritual practice will have a quality of you being a dilettante. Wow. So the point here is, actually, the dirty secret is that I kind of feel that dying is often kind of boring. It's slow, it's cumbersome, interspersed with intense moments. Yeah. But it's pointing to the fact that I'm going to die. I just turned 80, believe it or not. Wow. Congratulations. I guess. It's better than the alternative, isn't it? But what I'm saying here is that the fact that I'm going to die is intellectually obvious. You're going to die, I'm going to die, but we don't know when. Right? That's intellectually obvious. But if we really, really knew that on our bones, Duncan and Ramdev, how would this encounter with us and with the audience be going right now? If I didn't know I was going to survive the Duncan Trussell family hour, that I might drop dead at something, then I would just want to love you and just embrace you and be that guy, right? Right. And see that you're that guy. But if it's this intellectual thing where I'm saying, oh, here's about death and here's what I know and all my experience and let me enlighten you and all that bullshit, then it's like it's removed from intimacy. It's removed from aliveness. Right. So the place where you and I get afraid is, in a way, it's good news. Ramdev said this saying that I always hated, but it's true. That suffering is grace. Yes. Right? I mean, if you want to be free, the place where you're suffering, the place where you're caught is pointing exactly at what you need to do next to open, to surrender, to God, to open your heart. Right. Right. So I want to be free and I feel like being around people who have intense illness, end-of-life stuff, grief, whatever, is forcing me to admit my own mortality and that I want to be more alive than not just when I'm with dying people, but when I'm with you. If I'm with somebody who's dying and I'm distracted or I'm preoccupied, it hurts my heart because I know I might never see them again. Yes. I might never see you again either. I don't know. Right. We don't know. I mean, that's the problem, isn't it? I mean, if we knew, sometimes I think about this, like, you know, and like reflecting on what, what some part of the multiverse where let's imagine a planet where everyone knew what happened after you die. And it was like the New Age or say some kind of like celestial spa. You pick your next incarnation, hang out with dolphins. It's awesome when you're ready to take incarnation again. You reincarnate again. How many people would even be on the planet right now? I mean, there would be mass suicides. How many people would just be standing in line to jump off cliffs? This lack of understanding what happens when we die. It is part of what keeps us here, isn't it? I mean, not to, I'm sure a lot of people are like, look, I love it here. I don't want to go. You know, I, in earlier phases of this incarnation, I would like look at a credit card bill. I'm like, you know what, I'm going, I'm going back to the spa. Forget this. I'm out of here. You know what? It's that lack of understanding that keeps us glued here and isn't that lack of knowing whatever it is part of what feeds into that unenlightened fear that you're talking about. It's just this is an impervious, frustrating, annoying mystery. And I get why people get real tangled up in neurosis when thinking of it at all. Yeah. Well, I was listening to your interview with Jack Cornfield that you did a few weeks ago, I guess, or I don't know how long ago recently. And he was kind of talking down off the edge a little bit and saying it's all okay. And I mean, to me, working with fear of death is a very awakening and live-in experience. So that, like very often when, when we're afraid, we're asleep. Very often when people are feeling fear, they're fixated on the trigger, right? Yes. I'm afraid because of global warming. I'm afraid because of my bank account is going down because of what's happening in the stock market. I'm afraid of this. I'm afraid of that person. And very seldom do we actually experience what it's like to have an emotion, to be embodied while we're having something intense. So like in English, we say, I am afraid. In Spanish, yo tengo miedo, I have fear. In Tibetan, fear is here, right? So just in the way we think about or language things in English, it's so easy to get caught in the passing emotional state. So that I'm among other things, I'm a meditation teacher, which I think is a very dangerous label. And even the notion of meditation that good meditation, bad meditation is a little bit tricky. People get very guilt-ridden, spiritual guilt. I'm not meditating enough. My meditation is crap, whatever. But the notion of being able to be embodied. What does it feel like for you to be sitting in the chair with your beard there hanging out on the mic and trusting being embodied and letting the words and the actions come out of that, trusting the heart and the belly enough to let go of all this crap in the mind. I'm afraid of this. I'm working with that. And trust this radical surrender. People do that with psychedelics. People do that with meditation. People do that with being in nature. But it's a rare person that's really integrating that into daily activity. So to me, the whole spiritual life is not very useful until it can be integrated into what does it feel like when you wake up in the middle of the night and you've got to take a piss, right? What does it feel like when you're in a traffic jam and you've got to get somewhere on time and you're not going to get there on time? What does it feel like when you and your wife are having a difficult day and the kids are yelling and you know, whatever is going on? Yeah. So that, I mean, all this airy-fairy stuff about floating off into spaciousness and being in the heart and that's great. But this foundation of being in the body, being real, being human. Yeah. Yeah. Like, you mean it's okay, fine. The whole spacious heart, compassion, all that stuff. Great, great. That's not where we're at now. I'm not feeling it now. You know, as you're saying, kids are screaming, all the other stuff that's going on, all the whatever epigenetic stuff and all the under the surface stuff is swimming around. It's a big bowl of shit sometimes, no offense. And I could see how if you do get caught up in that airy-fairy stuff when you're like in a bowl of shit, then it's not like the airy-fairy stuff is making you feel better. You're just like, oh, great. Well, where's my spaciousness now? Where's the, I had to get up to piss. I'm not going to sleep for the rest of the night because I have insomnia. And then, you know, so I do know what you're talking about. Is this what you mean by living? Is this what you're saying when you, is this what you mean? Like, just allowing yourself to be, if you happen to find yourself in a hot tub full of your own garbage, just like admit that's what's going on. Okay, so not only are you in the hot tub full of garbage or the bowl of shit, but you're feeling guilty because you think you're spiritual and you can't get out of it. So it's like there's a double trouble there. This episode of the DTFH has been brought to you by DraftKings. Here is how you connect to sports. It doesn't matter what the sport is.

Okay, so not only are you in the hot tub full of garbage or the bowl of shit, but you're feeling guilty because you think you're spiritual and you can't get out of it. Right. So it's like there's a double trouble there. And here's a quote from Walt Whitman. Sometimes touching another human being is almost more than I can bear. Wow. Yes. Okay. You felt that, I felt that. Right? You've looked into the eyes of another person and you've wept because you felt so much love. Yes. Have you ever looked in a mirror and cried because you love that guy so much? Probably not. Not because I like that guy so much. Sometimes touching myself is more than I can bear. We won't go down that road right now. Okay. Okay. So what I'm saying though is that because of conditioning and being socialized and everything and early childhood wounding and all that crap, we end up being stuck in our minds identifying with such a small part of who we are that we've had those experiences of the vastness. We've had those experiences of touching somebody and seeing the divinity and everything. And the divinity doesn't have to be extra special. It can be in the mundane. It can be in walking from here to the other room. It can be just looking at your child. It can be just about anything at all. And instead we have all these notions. I mean, so many people that come to me who are dying haven't forgiven themselves. There are still feeling that they've been a bad person and they didn't do this enough. They didn't do that enough. Imagine being on your deathbed. Really imagine being on your deathbed and not liking who you are. Oh, wow. Yeah. And I see a lot of that. And there are some people, though, who at the end of life surrender into a bigger version of who they are. Maybe the body's in pain. Maybe there's confusion in the mind, but they're not so identified with that stuff. So that right now there's Dale and Duncan, Ramdev, whatever my name is. Ramdev, Dale, and Duncan were talking to the three of us, right? I've got two names, everybody. It's a little confusing. My spiritual name, Ramdev, and Dale, the other guy. That here we are talking, but is there this other reality that we can surrender into? It's not another reality. It's going beyond grasping. It's trusting. It's this radical trust in our humanity of just being who we are, trusting our basic goodness. Trusting that it's okay to be a human being, that we don't have to get somewhere. Right. I want to just speak from my own personal experience and get real, real. When you're talking about seeing the divinity and the unbearable, the Walt Whitman quote, sometimes the love I feel for my kids is so intense that I can't deal with it. And so it's like my mind instantly conjures up mortality in like feeling this deep love for my kids. And it's not just like, for truly, like I could be jumping on the trampoline with them and they're having fun. They're on the trampoline. I'm thinking, oh, your dad's getting old. Is my heart okay? What if I just have a heart attack on the trampoline in front of you kids? Oh my God, I'm going to die. You're going to die. You know, they're unaware of this. It's not like I announced this, but it's the strangest feeling to come into contact. Come into contact with that divinity and then not be able to stay there. Not because the divinity's gone anywhere, but because it's too much. It's intellectually, I could think to myself, you know what, if I could just hang out in the place of unbearable love for my kids and my wife and my own life, that would be a few minutes. You know, I don't know. I'm sorry. I don't mean to get slightly vulgar here, but you ever have to wonder yourself like, what would a 10 minute orgasm feel like? You ever wonder that? Maybe you've experienced it. I certainly haven't. But you ever just wonder like, boy, if we could extend this just a little bit longer, then I could like, you know, understand what's going on here better. But I can't extend either of those experiences. Orgasm, just because my body won't let me, the intense love I feel for my kids. So which one do you want to talk about? We can talk about extending your orgasms or we can talk about extending, resting in divinity. Let's do orgasms. I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. I'm the most shallow person on earth. Let's do divinity. Let's do divinity. Then we'll let's get to the orgasms. I'm excited about the orgasm thing. I'm not going to lie, but let's do divinity. Okay. So you're really looking at the crucial point here that there you are. You're jumping on the trampoline with your kids. You feel this almost unbearable openness and love and spaciousness. And then the mind jumps in and starts thinking about, oh, I'm getting older. Maybe I'm going to have a heart attack. My kids won't have a father. So that moment right before those thoughts arise are a very instructive moment. I used to do a lot of long meditation retreats. I get into this wonderful, open, spacious, happy mind. And then all these bullshit thoughts, just random thoughts would start coming. They'd come for a shorter time, a longer time. I'd be aware of it back to spaciousness, thoughts, awareness of thoughts, spaciousness. And I thought, why don't I stay in that open place, the place you're talking about? Why do I keep doing that thing? And I noticed that right before I started thinking, there was fear of death. Not in a big way, not like I'm going to have a heart attack, but that the spaciousness itself was ego death. And like Descartes says, I think therefore I am. So that the mind wanted to reify my separateness. It couldn't bear just being open. So it had to start thinking about bullshit. That the constricted mind is more comfortable than the boundless nature of who we are. So that there's this ongoing tension moment to moment between the spiritual reality that we are that spaciousness and the ego's need to have a solid place from which to stand that doesn't really exist. So that to the extent that we're not waiting for the next cancer diagnosis, to the extent that you can begin to be with that quiet voice that says, there's too much space here, let's contract again because that's so comfortable. For instance, they were building a big dam in Egypt that was going to create a lake that was going to drown a lot of large mammals. So somewhere in Africa, I think it was Egypt. So they decided they were going to tranquilize, capture and move a few hundred miles, these big animals. And they did that, they opened up the cages, the animals didn't want to come out because they were so used to the place they used to be, they didn't want to be in this new place. And we're comfortable with our cage. So the point is, can we begin to feel in more palatable bites, if you will, that subtle fear of being nobody. I mean, Ram Dass at the end of his life talked about becoming nobody, but another friend of mine who was a therapist said, you've got to become somebody before you can become nobody. Ram Dass spent a lot of time becoming somebody before he said, okay, now I can become nobody. And that becoming somebody is being willing to look at that grasping at solidity of I'm somebody. I know who I am. I have a fixed viewpoint here that I can trust. And as we all find out, people die, cancer comes, children have problems. Life is always changing, it's always impermanent. So that can you begin to trust in simple moments that you can just let go? Like right now, you don't know what your next question is going to be. I don't know what I'm going to say. It's just coming out, it's just coming out. And then begin to extend that into more fraught emotional situations. But take those simple ones. Can you have the orgasmic non-orgasm here when you're walking in the woods, when you're eating your Cheerios in the morning, right? When you're just lying down to sleep at night. When you light on in the bed, are you putting your head on the pillow? Are you putting your head in the Divine Mother's lap or Maharajie's lap or something like that, right? Like each moment is this relationship with the beloved, like that Walt Whitman quote, touching another human being sometimes is almost more than I can bear. Yes. Yeah. I want to hyper fixate on this for a moment just to sort of like, you know, because I think this moment, the transitionary phase between what you're talking about, the experience of divinity or emptiness or whatever you want to call it, and a return to good old comfortable neurosis. There are actually, if you look at it, there's gradients even there. Or there's like a flavor to it. And this is why you will hear bitter sweet or something get brought up. A kind of, there might be, and I don't know, a millisecond where it isn't bitter, a millisecond where it's just that. And then it's like this in the, for me, it always feels like in my heart. This sadness or it's, I don't know if bitter is even the right word for it, but definitely uncomfortable as you, as you veer away from that place back into the fear. Now it's interesting to me because I don't think I'd ever made the connection or thought to myself. Oh, it's not that you're thinking those things because you're afraid of dying. You're thinking those things because you're, you can't stand to be in this moment. So it's like an same thing. Same thing. Yeah. So that being in this moment, fully in this moment is, is dying out of ego into, into presence. Wow. It's, it's, it's a, it's an ego death moment to moment to moment, surrendering into spaciousness, surrendering to God, surrendering into love, surrendering into whatever we call that. That bitterness, do you still feel that? Or have you surrendered into it? Does that come up for you? That it comes up for me. In fact, there's a book now called bitter sweet. That's really a hot book. It's on the New York times list written by some woman. I forget her name, but the Tibetans say, for instance, Duncan, that compassion is the combination of sadness and joy. There's a sadness that they're suffering in the world and there's a joy that your heart is open. And it's a, there's a joy that transcends happiness and sadness. So that being in the world and knowing you're going to die and you're going to, and that very likely you're going to die before your kids are going to die. And knowing that people are blowing each other up in the Ukraine and knowing that the Republicans want to take over the planet and knowing all these things. It's sad, but at the same time we're being asked in some way to have a joy that transcends that and not getting lost in the sadness. There's a difference. An emotion arises, a difficult emotion, but any emotion arises. There are three possible responses. One is to push it away. I don't want to feel that. That's my response. Let me have a drink. Let me binge Netflix. Second response. When my brother was told by his oncologist that he was dying, he got the message in an after hours email because the oncologist didn't want to tell him face to face. Whoa. Okay. What? Yeah, right. He's in the wrong business. That oncologist is in the wrong business. What kind of oncologist doesn't want to tell people that? Like, that's crazy. That's like being a mailman. I wanted to deliver mail. Well, he wanted to put the mail through the slot rather than say hi to the person who's getting mail. So first possible way of dealing with emotion is push it away. Second is getting lost in it. Oh my God. Oh my God. Look what's going on here. You probably do some of that too. I do both of those. Push it away. Getting lost in it. There's the third possible response. Having an embodied mindfulness and a compassionate heart. You open to what you're feeling so that that sadness you're talking about. Yeah. Can be something that you get lost in and say, oh my God, it's so sad. There's so much crap going on in the world. Yeah. Or something that you can meet with a joyfulness and an openness. It's the same sadness, but you're not getting lost in it. See, I resent the sadness. I resent it. I resent it in the way I resent the neighbor's dog that barks too much or the person walking in high heels in the apartment above or whatever. I just resent it. I get mad at it. It's like, what are you doing? You keep messing up this thing. You keep screwing up the party here. Yeah. If you've been to any Ram Dass retreat, you've heard or if you've read Cornfield or any of the teachers or you've heard again and again, various offer a tea, rub its back, do a dance with it. But I can't really do that. I just am annoyed with it at the very least and generally angry with it. I mean, I think if I'm afraid based on what you said earlier, when I'm on my deathbed, I'm going to be pissed off. Some part of me is going to be legitimately pissed that this is happening. I don't want to be like that. But yeah, how to fix that or what is the, I mean, okay. So, I mean, that is the big question in spiritual life is how do we not get caught in anger and sadness and fear and things like that? How can we be present? How can we love awareness itself? How can we cultivate this living relationship with the moment rather than getting lost so that once again, it goes back to that ego death thing of surrendering into the present. That sense of being angry about the way things are is more comfortable in the short term than the surrender into wholeness. But if you really pay attention, it's suffering. It's really uncomfortable to be pissed off. It doesn't feel good. No. The ego is saying, but this is better, Duncan. This is better than ego death because then I'm not going to exist. And you need me because this is a matter of life and death for us. This is ego life death thing. So that it's, I mean, that's kind of the point of meditation. You're sitting there. The mind is wandering. The body feels agitated or tired or whatever. All this stuff is coming and going. And is it possible to just be with that, to not think that meditation is about getting somewhere, that life is not a self improvement project. Life is not getting Duncan from schlumpy Duncan here. How dare you? How dare you, sir? There's some assumed better Duncan, you know, that you're thinking there's like a new improved product out there somewhere if you do the right shit. And I don't think, I mean, we're all stuck in that place to a certain extent. I've been meditating since the 1960s. I lived with Ramadas. I traveled Ramadas to India. I was the director of the Hanuman Foundation. I'll do a plug right now. I'm the director of the Living Dying Project, livingdying.org, where we have a podcast on the Ramadas Be Her Now Network that Duncan comes to a bunch with Ragu. There's a lot of free information there, livingdying.org, about how can one be with that fear? How can one be with these emotions and not get lost in it? How can we use our mortality to awaken? So to me, it really comes down to what is your motivation? What do you really want? My first meditation teacher, Suzuki Roshi, said, the most important thing is finding the most important thing. He also said, you're all perfect, but there's still some room for improvement. Oh, Zen. Okay, so what we're saying here, though, is that what is the most important thing for you? Yeah. What is your motivation? What is your deepest motivation when you wake in the middle of the night and you hear the footsteps in, down in your belly there or whatever, right? Or your heart feels constricted. And if, in fact, you are really motivated to wake up, if you really are hungry for truth, the way you're hungry for air, then suffering is grace. If you're not hungry, then the suffering, you say, I don't want the suffering. I'm angry about it. I'm pissed off. Let me get to another place. But if you're really motivated to be free, if that's what you want, if you can look yourself in the mirror and say, I want to wake up, then those places of pissed-offness are useful. If somebody comes into a meditation teacher and says, I'd like to meditate. I've never meditated before. And the teacher says, well, do you get angry a lot? And the person says, no, I never get angry. The teacher will say, okay, but in the back of his or her mind, they'll be saying, this guy's not going to be a very good meditator. Because the anger is exactly the same energy that we meditate with or that we have sex with or we create with. Like so in my life, if I'm not meditating a bunch or having orgasms or being really creative, I get angry. Yes. But if I'm doing something like really creative or really meditating, then that's that same energy. I want to thank ExpressVPN for supporting this episode of the DTFH.

But if I'm doing something like really creative or really meditating, then that's that same energy that's getting used up. That's Shakti, that Chi. You're clarifying something for me that I think I got confused about. I meditate infrequently. Sorry, David Nickton. But I do meditate at least once a week and I try to do more. Within that slow process, I had this what I thought was an epiphany and now I'm starting to think it was confusion. I had this moment of thinking, oh my God, you think you're creating but you're just doing this to evade suffering because I recognized what you're saying. I recognize that in my creativity, it was the same energy. And I thought, oh, well, that means you're the whole things of fraud because you're trying to cope with suffering by running away into your creative process. But it sounds like you're saying, no, it's actually your creative process is a way of channeling that energy. Am I misunderstanding you? No, that's exactly what I'm saying. That is cool. That makes me feel so much better. Huh, that's really interesting. But being really creative, not being phony creative, that you're putting your being into it, you're really doing something. I mean, you hear stories about people, they're writing or they're painting or they don't even hear the phone ring or they forget to eat or something because they're so focused on what they're doing, right? So to me, I kind of imagined at times that I've got this knob on the side of my head here up by the temple and it goes from zero to 100. And at zero, all my attention's out in the world and none of it's inside of my body. And at 100, it's all inside and none of it's outside. Deep meditation is I'm all inside, I'm not even paying attention out there. Being pissed off in a traffic jam, it's the opposite. But can you start playing with that knob and be living a life like 50-50 or 75-25 where when you're doing this podcast, part of you is am I centered? Is my heart open? Trusting the stuff that's coming out of that rather than just being lost and trying to be the super fancy dunk or something like that. Super fancy, you just call me a schlub. I don't feel super fancy at all. You're all a schlub. If you all could see me right now, I'm very greasy. My hair's disheveled, he's absolutely right. It's a pure and true observation. I'm sorry, I didn't take a shower today. Well, you know what? I didn't either. So here we are. Thank God we're on the opposite sides of the country, right? All the time. This is one of the silver linings. People either in person can't smell me because they lost their smell or through the screen. This, you know, when I'm hanging out with people like you, I am more, I can stay in that place more. Like when I was around Ram Dass, I could stay in that place more. And then when I'm there swimming around, it's like, oh, this is easy. The knob, when you're saying this about the knob, I'm like, oh, yeah, of course, the knob, it's, he's been the knob, you're in and out. But when I'm not, when I'm not, then that knob, you reach for the knob and it's like, it's gone. It's not there. So I don't mean to like create some hierarchy of practice or something like that. But is it contingent on a practice? Is the fluidity or, I don't know, the ability to spin that knob only based on some kind of like severe meditation practice? Mayor Baba said, love is contagious. Those who haven't got it, catch it from those who do. And when the Buddha was at his cousin and his attendant, Ananda said, oh, Buddha, I have heard that the sangha, the community of seekers is fully half of the path. The Buddha said, oh, no, Ananda is all of the path. Right? So what they're both saying is being alone and trying to twist the knob is really hard work. And that by being around other people, at least occasionally, being at going to retreats or having people you know where you get together and you feel some inspiration from being with these other human beings, makes it so much easier than trying to do this by oneself. We're living in a... The stuff we're talking about right now is going directly against the grain of the main message of our culture. Right? So it's hard to do it. It's hard to do it without support. Right. It's hard to say, I'm not so interested in egoic accumulation. I'm interested in surrender and opening and compassion and being open to the suffering of my fellow beings. I mean, there's a lot of this right-wing Christianity where it doesn't feel very Christian at all. Right? It's not about supporting other human beings. It's not about being with the downtrodden. It's about getting your own in a certain way that really irritates the hell out of me, really. Yes. I know what you mean. I was just having this conversation with a friend of mine who was really frustrated with their Christian friends. And I was just thinking, look, if there's any service you could do in the world for Jesus, it's like getting to the source material and then fixing all the way that it did end up in the place you're talking about. The way somehow this thing that does seem like a recipe for floating in that place or being in that love, whatever you want to call it, somehow got convoluted to turning into the antithesis of at least my understanding of it, which may be wrong, I don't know. But I think that you have made me realize something that I never quite got. There's a book, I bet you know it, The Denial of Death. It's supposition being what you're saying, all neurosis, all the everything is really upstream. It's your fear of death manifesting in all these micro-way, like little ways, little things. Now I'm starting to see, now I get it. Now I'm starting to really get it, which is if you theoretically, based on what you're saying, if somehow you address that fear of death, then it's like pulling the dead dog out of the well or something. It's theoretically, if you get rid of that, then this impulsive, I'm sorry, I'm a terrible interviewer. I shouldn't do it. Are we still back there with the dead dog and the well image? I've been watching Game of Thrones. You know, I feel like what you're saying is, actually, every single time you're on the trampoline, or you're in love with your kids, or you're having a conversation like this, and the thing creeps in where you're like, shit, I wish this conversation could go on forever. It won't. Or, oh god, I wish my kids or I live forever. Oh god, this isn't going to last. That is death. You are experiencing death, right? What are you talking about? That is an encounter with the very thing itself. Is that what you're saying? The moment before the thoughts jump in, there's some fear of non-existence, right? So instead, just keep jumping on the trampoline. Just keep playing with life, keep dancing with life, instead of making it a big self-improvement work project where I've got to fix my ego. I mean, Rhombus had this other line. I'm not sure I completely believe it, but I kind of do. He says, if you're a son of a bitch and you get enlightened, you'll be an enlightened son of a bitch. Whoa. So that's good news for you and me, right? I'm getting roasted here. I'm getting roasted through my own show. Yes, it's good news. You've got me. You see me. And I said for me and for everybody, I mean, it's not that everybody has that place where they're caught in their personality. Enlightenment is not about fixing the personality completely. It's fixing it enough so that you can be present. But that as I get older and I've been a meditation teacher for five decades, and I'm still as neurotic as I was a long time ago, but I don't care about it anymore. Right. I'm not lost in that. So I'm not roasting you as a son of bitch. Everybody has that quality of being lost in their personality. Yes. Are you going to spend the rest of your life beating yourself up about that or spend the rest of your life going to therapy and trying to fix it, which a little bit of that is good, but eventually get on with it. Like this whole thing about being the adult child of an alcoholic or something, the operative where there is adult, like can we eventually get on with life? Right. And it's, I'm not saying that people aren't wounded and they need therapy and they need support and there's trauma and all that. That stuff is completely real. But at the same time, there's a context so that we're two fold beings. There's this human being with the woundedness and the personality and there's this soul level. There's this divine part of us. And we forget about that second part. We get lost in the first part all the time. If we can remember the second part, the first part, we can hold so much more lightly. The fact that we're going to die, the fact that the trampoline might break. I haven't thought that. I didn't get to that fear. You know what you're making me think of is the times when like my genuine grief about my mother passing turned into a performance like a hall pass if I was being a son of a bitch. So if I've like found myself, you know, being a jerk with my wife, I might be like, you know, I'm grieving right now when I'm thinking to myself, this is not from grief. This is selfish. You're acting like this because you, you're not, you're being a, not an adult. And then like, you know, those, that's an embarrassing confession. Hope my wife doesn't listen to this episode. She already knows, but the, but the, the, you know, it's like, it becomes like a kind of tattered teddy bear or something that you're like carrying around. Like, you know, this is, it goes from being like, I am genuinely crushed right now to. I'm the genuinely crushed person. That's me. It's some point, right? You have to let that go. I get that. I get that. That doesn't have to be you forever. So I had the great grace to be with Maharaj and a lot of other great saints. And he said things like, I'm always in communion with you. Another saint said, be peaceful. I am everywhere. Yeah. There's these great books by Father Greg Boyle tattoos on the heart where he's this priest in East LA dealing with gang members and ex cons and things. And he keeps telling them, they come to him and say, Father, Father Greg, make me a better person. He says, you're perfect the way you are. God loves you just the way you are. It's for you to accept that. So being with Maharaj was very difficult because he kept relating to me by seeing the place that was whole. I was right in front of him. I was horny. I was feeling inadequate. I was feeling irritated. And he just kept loving me. So that's even going back to that other quote before of we become more loving by being around people who have that love. Is it possible then that that tattered teddy bear you're carrying around gets replaced by realizing that you're surrounded by this unconditional love? That's where it comes. That's you're triggering me now. See, that's what I'm talking about. The moment I get even close to that, it's like, no way, no way. Like it's, you know, I can only approximate what you must have felt around. Neem Crowley, Bobby, Bobby, Neem Crowley, Bobby is a baseball player. Neem Crowley, Baba, I can only approximate what you must have felt around that person. By the way, I feel just being around people who've been around that person, which is my reaction. That is always like, I don't deserve this. You know, if I pulled off this trickery, that I am getting secondary darshan via people like you and Ragu and Ram Dass. So suppose right now, though, that you just slow down and accept that I love you and God loves you and that your kids love you. And that that's more important than all the mental shit that we can talk about. Right. And relax into that. And I have a hard time doing that. I mean, I have a very excitable type A kind of personality thing happening. I'm addicted to excitement, right? I used to drive motorcycles in a way that it's remarkable I'm still alive. But the point is that I've had those experiences where I'm beginning to more and more trust that I am loved, that I am supported, that moment to moment, even when things are difficult, even when health things or money things or relationship things or work things are like floating around, that underneath that there's this support, there's this absolute foundation of care, of love. One can, as a meditation teacher, what I really focus on is the very beginning stage of getting grounded and centered and embodied as the foundation for opening the heart. Opening the heart means becoming vulnerable, becoming spacious. And if you haven't worked with the first three chakras, the place from which martial arts are done, then it's going to be difficult to bear the openness of the heart. If the environment is not being really supportive. So that by getting grounded and centered, by really inhabiting the base, then there's a solid dunk and a solid dale, Ramdev, who can bear the openness. And it's kind of humbling to say, I've got to start at the beginning, even though I've been doing this for 50 years. Right, right. Yeah, right. I get it. Because otherwise it really is unbearable. You don't have the, you don't have anything to bear it. Your back isn't, I get, I could see that, like how... Could we do a really quick grounding breath or not? Yeah, I'd love that. Okay, so just imagine that as you're breathing out, you're pushing an energetic egg out through the base of your torso, down the very base, out into the earth that supports and nourishes, and it's just an easy natural in-breath. That each time you breathe out, that place between, for a male between the genitals and the anus, for a woman out through her vagina, just pushing energy out into the earth and feeling that sense of support and nourishment as you breathe in. It's abundant. It's always there. I'm sorry, when I'm breathing in, I'm pushing the egg out, or when I'm breathing out, I'm pushing the egg out. Breathing out, you're pushing the egg out. Okay. You're giving birth to this egg, if you will. Okay. And this is the immediate antidote to fear, to feeling attacked, to feeling startled, to feeling anxious. It's a way of receiving this boundless grounding support, the mother, earth element, mother, mother, divine mother. That's cool. It's just like dropping down into that support, getting grounded, feeling that sense of ground. And there's very little about this in the spiritual literature, Duncan, because all those books were written by Asian people, hundreds, not thousands of years ago, who walked around barefoot. They didn't have an iPhone. They loved their parents. Right. I was at a Tibetan retreat once, and the guy said, okay, we're going to open our hearts. Everybody think about your mother. He said, oh, wait a minute. I forgot. This is America. Thinking about your mother doesn't mean your heart's going to open. Right. Which is one sense kind of funny, and in another sense, it's profoundly sad, right? Right. Tragically. So is it possible to stay grounded and to have a conversation? Is it possible to have that sense of being supported, of nourished, and you live in your life? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think it is. The answer is yes. I mean, what? I want to be honest here. I think it is. But for you, you could say yes. And this is why people like you are so important in the world. So how do we extend our orgasms? I'm sorry. In the beginning, you mentioned it's a possibility. I'm so grateful for, and I'm sorry that the way I think is. I was hoping we were going to get back to this. Definitely. Thank you. Okay. So I very rarely quote this guy Rajneesh, the guy that had the 49 Rolls Royces and things. Yep. But he talked about, he had a book about sex. He explained it really well. He said, there's two kinds of orgasms. There's the peak orgasm where you get more and more excited. You ejaculate and then you come back to stasis or whatever you call that. But there's the valley orgasm where you get more and more relaxed. You're in union with somebody, but instead of getting more excited, you're opening, getting relaxed, becoming present. And then it's possible to have an orgasm that goes on and on and on without ejaculating. Orgasm and ejaculating often come together, but they're two separate things. So it's possible to have an orgasm that goes on for an hour. And you're speaking from experience. I am. Wow. I've heard of this. I've never met anyone, anyone who can speak. Well, it only happened once or twice a long time ago, I have to admit, but it did happen. I don't mean this in some kind of like gross, pervy way, but just only because like, I think we would be, have to be severely repressed or nuts to not admit. We're talking about one of the great human experiences that is most of us have a limited opportunity of experiencing that. What is that like? What is, what happens 30 minutes in to an hour long orgasm? What are you thinking or where are you? You're not thinking anything. It's the whole point. I mean, in fact, I started thinking, oh, this is great. And as soon as I started thinking that, it started going away. So I just let go back into that place. I mean, here's another story. I was with Maharaj. I was right in front of him. I was holding his foot, rubbing it, feeling love and devotion and saying my mantra. And then after about five minutes, I started thinking, boy, am I lucky. Isn't this great? And as soon as I started feeling that, he started pulling his foot away. So I went back to just saying my mantra, love, and he relaxed his foot. And then after a few more minutes, I started thinking, wow, look at me, right? And he started pulling his foot away. It happened three different times. And as long as I was just open surrendered, there was that flow of love between us, which is, I mean, holding his foot is not quite the exact same thing as having sexual intercourse. Probably better. But it's kind of that same thing of surrendering into love. So that like being with your wife, and instead of getting more and more excited and aggressive or whatever is happening, can you just be excited enough to maintain connection there, if you know what I mean? Yes. And just be opening and opening and opening into love and spaciousness and surrender. It's so cool. It's like, you're, it's so interesting. You know, I, as I'm thinking about this, not the orgasm stuff, I'm sorry for going there, but the life, I don't know, because I like kind of like, I don't know. I was trying to be funny or something, but the, No, but sex is part of being a human being. There's nothing to be ashamed about. I guess what I'm saying is you're making me in my head. I have this image of someone walking out into the ocean and then thinking, this is great. I'm standing in the ocean and then turning into the ocean and maybe thinking, this is great. I'm the ocean. And then forgetting there were ever anything but the ocean and there's something in that that feels scary. There's something, I like the idea of the, the possibility of walking back to shore, but this, this, this thing of like that, that I know is going to happen when we die, but that theoretically seems possible while alive. That's something about that seems really, really, I don't mean to go back to the fear thing, but a more refined version of the trampoline fear, I guess you could say a sense of like, well, if I stay out here too long, I'm not coming back. Have you read the Wizard of Earth sea by Ursula Kay, Le Guin? Have you ever read that book? No. It's a cool book. I read it when I was a kid, but one piece of it stuck with me. Wizards, they could turn themselves into dolphins. They go swimming out in the ocean as dolphins, but the danger of that is if you stay a dolphin too long, you forget you're a wizard. So many of the dolphins out in the ocean are actually wizards with amnesia who just forgot they were wizards and became dolphins. That's what I'm talking about, that this line of thinking in teachers like you, I feel like there is a quality of luring us out, like luring those animals out. And then somewhere you're like, wait, I can't get back. And I know this is more neurotic thinking, but that's what pops into my head because you're so talented, you've fully brought me into this place. Now it's like, oh shit, if I stayed here too long, there wouldn't even be a Shlubby Duncan. Okay, but what I'm saying is that being in that place, you'll want to stay there because it's so enjoyable. It's so joyful. It's so full. If you want to go back and be, I don't know what adjective to use here. If you want to come back, you can always come back, but you're not going to want to. I mean, as a very simple example, you look out the window and there's a tree and you see the tree and you just see the tree. There's nobody, it's not Duncan seeing a tree, not Duncan liking the tree, not saying that's a maple tree or an oak tree or whatever, it's just, there's looking. So that there's a lot of times during the day where you're in that place where there's nobody. It's just pure experience. Yes. And then eventually, whether it's trampoline or looking out the window at a tree, the ego jumps in again. Yes. And the ego is a wonderful tool. The mind is a wonderful tool. You can still be Duncan. You're going to be Duncan. You're going to be neurotic Duncan, like I'm neurotic Dale Romney, right? But you're not going to be identified with it anymore. And the image with the wizards and the dolphins, the amnesia thing, there's no amnesia. You still remember you've got this body that you take care of and you've got the family you take care of. And you can always come back to being the guy who's doing that stuff, but you're doing it in the context of, I'm swimming in this vast sea of love and consciousness, right? It's not that you're pushing that other part away. They're both there. Well, what you're saying works with my theoretical lifespan, which is rapidly diminishing, as statistics come out about living in the United States. But what about when you are sitting with a dying person? You can't, when they're saying, if you do the same thing for them that you just did for me, and hopefully people listening, and they're like, wait, I don't know, I'm not coming back from this. What do you say then? How do you work with someone who is actually, there isn't even an option at some point to swim back to the body, to swim back to the identity? So I say to them that it's not a choice between living and dying. It's a choice between being awake or being asleep. It's a choice between being present or not being present. It's a choice between wholeness or brokenness. So that I don't know how many more moments you're going to have in this body, but don't we both want them to be as full and loving and open as possible? We don't know what's going to happen after we die. I don't even care what's going to happen after I die. All I want to know is what psychological, spiritual tools and stuff can I do for me to be more awake and help other people around me to be more awake? There's a part of me that really deeply believes that consciousness survives death. I've had a lot of experiences of somebody dies and they talk to me. I mean, there's hundreds, thousands of books out there, but after death experience and all that kind of stuff. But once again, that's all theoretical. It's like I'm really practical. I want to know how can I live this life, whether the doctor says you've got cancer and you've got a week to live, or the doctor doesn't say that. How can I live today? How can I live this moment with Duncan Trussell in the most full way so that I'm awake and that I'm connected with you. I'm connected with the people that we're talking to right now. Right. Yeah, anytime I get to hang out here for an extended period of time, it is always like, yeah, you could see how death is just another thing that is like the tree, like the thought. I see, I could see how you would be the best person to die around. That's a weird person to be. That's a weird one. But yeah, if I would have got to pick, you would be in the top of my list. I mean, this is having been around hospice and I love hospice. Hospice has been such a help to me and my family, not dissing them at all. But this element, you know, it's more pragmatic with hospice. Do you need more oxygen? Do you need what's the medication schedule? Where's the pain? Where are we at in the process? Right. So, I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if someone listening to this is dealing with the real thing, dealing with the terminal prognosis. How does someone, are you all over the country? How do people connect? Yeah, we're all over the world. We have 100 volunteers, 120 volunteers, I can't remember. Once again, it's living, dying, L-I-V-I-N-G-D-Y-I-N-G dot org. And we have trained volunteers who work, before the pandemic, we worked mostly in person. And now it's mostly via Zoom. We have volunteers in Europe and Asia, in North America, South America, maybe not South America we had, I can't remember. Anyway, so people contact the Living, Dying Project info at livingdying.org. And they say, I'd like to be a client. I mean, you've got, maybe so many people will be inundated here with potential clients, but... Let's hope the people listening are not, let's hope not. I need my listeners. Well, I always say that I'm in a growth industry here. The demographics are very good. But, you know, I also, so what are the rules here? Like, I mean, we're all dying. I mean, technically, can't everybody reach out to you? And be like, well, I mean, the doctor hasn't said anything yet, but... We don't have enough volunteers to deal with just people who are anxious about life. But anybody that's got a life-threatening illness, we match up people who have a life-threatening illness with meditators for their mutual benefit. So that the trained volunteers are doing this as their spiritual practice. So that caregiving is work on yourself. It's not primarily about helping or fixing somebody. It's about you waking up. And in you waking up, you'll be the best caregiver. Where if I'm coming to you and saying, I'm going to help you, I'm going to fix you, I'll be missing a lot of the signals in me that I'm getting lost in. Am I doing it well enough? Whatever. Whereas if I'm being present, this is my practice. I will be the best possible Dale for supporting Duncan or whoever it might happen to be. I got it. I got it. So this isn't something to replace hospice. It's something that... Yeah. It's definitely a compliment. And it's all free. Wow. Wow. So we need donations, folks. Okay. Yeah. Yes. It's a really bad business model. Taking care of dying people for free. Yeah. It really is. I would say, yeah, you might have to work on that. But how are you going to... I mean, Leigh, I could see how... Like, you know, who do you send the bill to? Well, people donate and we get memorial donations and I do a lot of speaking stuff. This has been very enlightening for me. And I'm so lucky. Like, not to go back to, like, whatever the thing is that doesn't just see the tree, but it's like, that's a... I got to get the sprinklers working. But I just don't... I'm not yet... At a place where I feel like this makes even sense to me that I get to have these conversations is my job.

262^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - Edmund McMillen Transcript and Discussion^2017-03-11^Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. I'm dirty a little angel. You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Good day to you, my sweet, beautiful friends. And prepare yourself, because I'm gonna let myself ramble today. I feel good. I went to a flaming lips concert last night. My friend Shelby got me great tickets. I was able to watch from a balcony as Wayne Coyne and the flaming lips exploded glitter and good vibes and confetti and an infinite number of inflatable balloons and everything. Just an outflow, a white hole. Which is what a lot of people say the Big Bang is actually. A white hole that it's the other side of a black hole. This whole universe is just the outflow from some other universe that got punctured or something. And we're just sort of the, we're the other side of suck, friends. A black hole sucks, literally sucks. That's what it does. It just pulls everything into it. Can't help it. Ultimate version of selfishness in physics. The thing is dense, man. It's heavy. It's got a heavy vibe. And if you get too close to a fucking black hole, you get sucked in. It'll suck it all in. Doesn't matter what it is. A star, fuck you. I'm eating you, a star. I don't care how big you are, star, I'm gonna suck you into me. Everything consumed by black holes. Who knows, perhaps one dark day, billions and billions and billions of years in the future, this entire universe itself may be sucked into some supermassive black hole. But I like the idea of the white hole because the white hole is the opposite of suck. It's the opposite of suck and yet it comes from suck. And this, friends, is why I think this is a very special podcast today. And this is why I think the flaming lips are an important band to go see. Because it feels like this outflow of positivity coming out of the flaming lips maybe has some roots and some darkness. I don't know for sure. Possibly the story is pretty interesting about Wayne Coyne working at a Long John Silvers and getting a gun place to his head and suddenly experiencing what in history has inspired a lot of great artists, which is the feeling of only having a few seconds left to live. Some great artists have been marched out to be executed and then they weren't. There's a lot of different versions of the story, but coming face to face with the suck, face to face with a potential subjective singularity at a Long John Silvers on the floor of a Long John Silvers, the smell of the fish and fry oil on your hands. The whole world slowing down as you feel a fucking gun to your head. I don't know if he had a gun to his head. I might be exaggerating the story, but from that moment, maybe that moment caused something to shift inside of Wayne Coyne, that insane gunman robbing a fucking Long John Silvers of all the places, of all the places to rob. Why a fucking fast food fish restaurant with a pirate theme doesn't make much sense on that wherever you're robbing. Go for a bank, right? Go for some, I guess Long John Silvers, maybe, I don't know, like if you come at the right time, there would have been a lot of money or, I don't know, but that robber didn't know that in the moment that he was putting that gun against Wayne Coyne's sweet fucking head, that he was triggering, potentially triggering, who knows, maybe there would have been a flaming lips no matter what, but for the sake of the story, he could have been potentially triggering a white hole. That moment of suck could have punctured something inside of Wayne Coyne, and that allowed whatever the hell the flaming lips are, I don't know what it is, crossed between a kid's show and some kind of heavy duty magical ritual, but whatever it is, it's cathartic and beautiful, and I think it does have its roots in darkness, and this is why I like this podcast today, because Edmund McMillan, our guest today, is the creator of a lot of great games. One of them is one of my favorite games. I have a few favorite games, Hearthstone, unfortunately, I think the people over at Blizzard should be tried in the same way that the people manufacturing Oxy Cotton should be tried on some days when I realized I'm in the grip of a fantasy card game addiction, whatever, it brings me joy. World of Warcraft, of course, Starcraft, I'm a Blizzard nerd, okay, that's mostly what I play. Fallout, I love the Fallout games, and so usually I found out about this other game, Binding of Isaac, from just browsing through YouTube, maybe it was on Twitch or something, and I looked at the game, and I remember looking at it on YouTube and wondering how it was getting such rave reviews, because when you look at the game, if you haven't played it, then maybe it seems a little, especially if you're like me and you've been playing these big fucking fancy games, it might seem a little antiquated or something, it was a flash game, but I remember downloading it and playing it and realizing, oh, this is like an incredible game, but it's more than an incredible game, it's art, it's got something in it that is reflecting a very dark understanding of the world, and the moment that, anyway, look, you know this, this is the Buddhist story of the jewel in the robe. There's a, and really I think about this story too much because it's kind of a dumb story. If you break it down too much, it's kind of a dumb story, but the story is this guy goes and visits his friend who is some kind of wealthy, I don't know, like noble person, and they get drunk together, and he passes out. The guy who was visiting the noble person gets too hammered, he passes out, the noble person gets some kind of message in the middle of the night, a telegram for the emperor, you gotta get to the fucking palace, don't waste a second. And so the nobleman had wanted to give his friend a gift, a diamond, and he realized he didn't have time, and he couldn't wake him up because he was inebriated and unconscious, so he sows this diamond into the hymn of his friend's robe and gallops off on his horse to go see the emperor. Anyway, his friend, being a wandering drunk, falls into a bad life. He leaves, he probably was, you know, he left his friend abandoned him, I don't know, he's probably bummed, wandered off into the mud and ended up just, you know, wasted, wasted, no money close to death because he's starving. And anyway, he ends up, I don't know, running into his friend, the story is pretty dumb, like number one, why wouldn't you leave a note? Why wouldn't you just leave a note in your friend's hand, like check your robe, there's a diamond there. But anyway, the point is not to get into the details of the story, the guy ends up finding the diamond, you know, and all this time that he was poor, all this time that he was fucked up, all this time he was in his own personal hell, he had this diamond, just waiting for him to find it. So I like when somebody takes, when somebody transforms their own personal darkness into a diamond, when that thing that you were afraid to say out loud, the thing that you're most embarrassed about, the thing you wouldn't want to tell anybody, is actually your most precious possession because it's an energy source. Not everybody figures that. A lot of people, that diamond ends up fucking them up because they're so afraid of it. They don't realize that there could be some potency in the thing. But folks like Edmund McMillan seem to have taken a really dark, some dark experiences and used them to make something beautiful and fun and something that is a white hole, something beautiful pouring out of their own personal suck that pours into our universe from their own subjective black holes. They've flipped their black hole around, turned it into a white hole and let it pour forth with some incredible art. But the art still has within it that emptiness, it still has within it the flavor of darkness and that makes it that much more beautiful. So this podcast, this convert, this was I had a great day yesterday. I got to have this conversation that you're about to listen to with Edmund McMillan and then I got to go see a Flaming Lips show. So it was a stellar day, one of the best days I've had in a very long time. In both events, pointed me in the same point or pointing me in the same direction. And I hope that maybe they'll point you in the same direction too, which is that that thing you're afraid to confess, that thing you're embarrassed by, the thing, whatever it is, whatever it is, maybe that is your diamond. The thing you've been avoiding the most, that's where hidden inside of that thing is a glowing, beautiful diamond that isn't just gonna help you, it has the potential to help the fucking world. That's what's, you know, the whole time you're not doing the thing, whatever it is, you know, because you're scared, you don't think you deserve to do it, you don't think you're good enough to do it, you're afraid of failure, you're protecting yourself. And that makes sense, of course. I'm terrified too of doing shit. This, for example, freaks me out every single time. But where it gets unethical is, what about the possibility that whatever that thing is that you're hiding from the world is not only something that could be cathartic for you and could help you evolve into some higher version of yourself. But what if that thing could also help the world? What if that thing that you're hiding, whatever it is, the thing that you haven't processed, the thing that you're holding inside, what if that thing, the black hole, could be a white hole that if you figured out a way to get in there and you let it pour into the world, then you could create something that would help people. And it doesn't have to be like, oh, you fucking cured malaria or whatever, I hope you do. Cure baldness, do me a favor. But it could just be something that is really funny. It could be a painting that people walk by. And it, I don't know, in some way or another, it makes, they don't even know why, why they feel a little better. It could be something bigger than that, though. Who knows? Last night, I saw a volcanic explosion of positivity in the form of unicorns and weighing coin, running or rolling, rolling around in a ball over an audience, fucking laser lights and just too much beauty, and yet somehow still dark, which I like. You know what? I've got this little card here from Alex and Allison Gray. I'll read it to you. This is, you can order this, I think. It's from their Chapel of Sacred Mirrors. It's a card, it's a card with a paint and Alex Gray painting on it. But it's called Artist's Prayer. Creator of the universe. How infinite and astonishing are your worlds. Thank you for your sacred art and sustaining presence. Divine imagination, forgive my blindness. Open all my eyes, reveal the light of truth. Let original beauty guide my every stroke. Universal creativity, flow through me from my heart, through my mind, to my hand, infuse my work with spirit to feed hungry souls. We're hungry out here, man. We're hungry. We wanna suckle at the other side of your black hole, sweetie. We wanna taste the outflow from that part of you that's condensed density to the maximum degree, the part of you that's making you feel so heavy. We wanna taste the other side of that, the thing where you flip it around, where you transform it. We wanna taste the outflow. We want that, everyone wants that, we need it. That's one of the things people feed on. And then the good way, you know? And if you're not doing that, you don't wanna be like some dry nipple mama dog with all the little puppies starving because your nipples are clogged up with fear. You gotta unclog your nips, my friends. Let the milk flow. We're gross. You know what I'm saying? My loves, just go for it. I love this podcast. Edmund McMillan inspired me. Wayne Coyne inspired me. The flaming lips inspired me. Binding of Isaac inspires me. Even though what I'm about to play may not seem that inspiring to you, it sure is to me. Cause it's funny and it's creepy and it's entertaining. And I called it addictive. Now the word I think I would use is compelling. But here very quickly is the very beginning of Binding of Isaac. I'll just play a little bit of it for you so that you can understand, for those of you who don't know what the Binding of Isaac is, or who haven't played Super Meat Boy or any of Edmund's games, I just want you to get a taste for what kind of video games this wonderful artist is putting out into the world. Thank you. Isaac and his mother lived alone in a small house on a hill. Isaac kept to himself, drawing pictures and playing with his toys as his mom watched Christian broadcasts on the television. Life was simple and they were both happy. That was until the day Isaac's mom heard a voice from above. Your son has become corrupted by sin. He needs to be saved. I will do my best to save him, my lord. Isaac's mother replied, rushing into Isaac's room, removing all that was evil from his life. Again, the voice called to her. Isaac's soul is still corrupt. He needs to be cut off from all that is evil in this world and confess his sins. I will follow your instructions, lord. I have faith in thee. Isaac's mother replied as she locked Isaac in his room away from the evils of the world. One last time, Isaac's mom heard the voice of God calling to her. You've done as I'd asked, but I still question your devotion to me to prove your faith. I will ask one more thing of you. Yes, lord, anything Isaac's mother begged. To prove your love and devotion, I require a sacrifice. Your son, Isaac, will be this sacrifice. Go into his room and end his life as an offering to me to prove you love me above all else. Yes, lord, she replied, grabbing a butcher's knife from the kitchen. Isaac, watching through a crack in his door, trembled in fear. Scrambling around his room to find a hiding place, he noticed a trapped door to the basement hidden under his rug. Without hesitation, he flung open the hatch, just as his mother burst through his door and threw himself down into the unknown depths below. Friends, that is the beginning of one of my favorite video games on this fine planet that we're currently stuck on thanks to gravity. Today's guest is the creator of this video game. We're gonna jump right into this episode, friends, but first, you know what it is. Today's episode of the Dugga Trussell Family Hour podcast is brought to you by the saviors of your life that you might not even know about, blueapron.com. While I get it, man, going out to eat is one of the true pleasures in life, it can become a crutch, it can become a blockage, an obstacle, something that is actually keeping you from experiencing one of the primary and fundamental pleasures of being a human being, which is cooking. Do you watch the cooking channel? I do. I used to torment myself watching the cooking channel. I don't have cable right now, but if I go to a hotel, I might watch the cooking channel. And one of the things that has always seemed absolutely ridiculous to me is these chefs are trying to show you how to whip up some kind of thing, you know, like a bacon souffle or a complex macaroni dish. And they have already placed on the counter in front of them these bowls, perfectly filled up with every single ingredient that's been measured out on a scientific scale by an assistant. And all they gotta do is just dump one thing into the next, into the next and mix it or put it in the oven at the right time. And at the other side of this process is some delicious fucking meal that you don't get to taste. But I've thought, yeah, you know what? Anybody could be a chef like that. If somebody was like ladling out the exact right amount of nutmeg into some polished silver cup. Yeah, I could do that. I could make it that fucking amazing looking macaroni truffle dish that you just whipped up friend. But I can't do that. Cause my brain doesn't work like that. I have no scale. I have no patience. I go to the store. Inevitably we'll forget to write down the critical ingredient for the recipe. And I'll get back home and then realize, oh shit, look at that, no butter. So I'll just use whatever's in the refrigerator. Well, I mean, I'm sure coconut milk could work as butter, right? Oh, whoops, didn't get the rosemary or the Yugoslavian turnips. You know what? Maybe I'll just use the potato that I have. I've never had a potato. So I don't even know what I'm talking about. But you know what I mean? I substitute with just what's there because I forgot whatever was supposed to get. Anyway, the end of my two hours of cooking is some failed bubbling bit of plasma that looks like a melted gas repairman that tried to smoke a cigarette next to a fucking gas outflow pipe. Just some blackened bubbling remnant of what was supposed to be something delicious. And God forbid you should be doing this around friends. God forbid you've gotten the curse of humanity, hubris, and have made the decision to cook for your friends. And so there's like three people coming over in 15 minutes that are about to eat what looks like a scorched marshmallow that a bird puked on. And it's supposed to be a macaroni or potatoes. And so then they come over and you serve, I've done this, I've served, I'm not gonna say what book I got it out of, but it was a book that was supposed to, it's like to supposed to teach you how to cook. You know, anyone can cook that style of book. And like, no, not anyone can cook, not me. Your books a lie. And I am sitting at a table now watching the glum faces of my friends as they realize that they're gonna have to fucking eat this shit I concocted. And it's embarrassing. Blue Apron, they save us from this humiliation because they deliver farm fresh ingredients that have been measured out in advance. Everything's there, everything's measured out. They have these wonderful laminated cards that you can look at and they're just, the info is the data is there, man. And it's like they know me, they know me. And from this, you can begin to cook. And every time you cook anything for the rest of your life, you know how to cook that thing, at least sort of. You know how to cook that thing. You become a little less food illiterate. Blue Apron, all right, that's my personal spiel. Very quickly, let me read what I have to read. Blue Apron is affordable. It's less than $10 per person, per meal. You can choose from a variety of new recipes each week. You can customize your recipes based on your preferences. They have a lot of different delivery options.

Plus, you'll show Blue Apron that it was worth sponsoring the DTFH. Give it a try. You will not be disappointed. I only promote stuff on this show that I like. Speaking of things I like, I like Krishnadas. He is a Kirtan Walla. That means a Kirtan singer. And he was a, he sat at the feet of Neem Karoli Baba. Ramdas' guru. I've gotten to hang out with him at these Ramdas retreats that I go to. And he's been kind enough to be a guest on the upcoming live DTFH at the Bell House in Brooklyn on March 21st. If you wanna know, I always say, Hare Krishna, what Hare Krishna means. What chanting the Hare Krishna Mahamantra means or singing it does, then this is the podcast for you. March 21st at the Bell House. Tickets are at dunkitrosil.com. Also, I'm gonna be the independent in San Francisco. That's Wednesday, April 26th. Finally, if you wanna really freak out with me in Hawaii, I'm gonna be at the Ramdas Spring Retreat. That's May, I think it's May 3rd. May 1st, May 3rd, not sure, but you can look it, go to ramdas.org, it'll be there. Can't wait, man. Oh, fuck, I can't wait. Just to lay in that sweet ocean, slurping my tie and staring into the infinite. Come, join me there. If you can, it'll be a blast. I guess that's, oh, Amazon. Also, thank you guys who keep using the Amazon portal. It's a fantastic way for you to support this podcast and anything we talk about on the podcast or don't talk about for that matter, if you go through the link at dunkitrosil.com, Amazon gives us very small percentage of it. And man, I know I keep pushing this thing, no pun intended, and I'm not sponsored by Ableton, but holy shit, this Ableton pushed too. It does not stop being cool. Every, you think you understand this incredible machine and then the rug just gets pulled out from under you and you find other layers of complexity. Look, I'm not, I don't consider my, I'm not a musician. I don't think anybody thinks I am. And I don't think that you have to be a musician to wanna make music, cooking, making music. These are just basic fundamental human impulses, man. And if you wanna like skip the, a lifetime of training and music, then technology will allow you to do that. I'm not, I think if your intentions are pure here, like if you're not tricking yourself into thinking that like you're gonna have an Ableton pushed too and turn into base nectar overnight or something, if you just go into it with wanting to trip out on how technology is making whatever's in your head and whatever's in the world, the time between what's in your head going into the world shorter and shorter and shorter, then Ableton and Ableton pushed too. Well, well, you know what, look, what are you gonna do, play video games? Play video games, it's great. Play Binding of Isaac, it's fine, but maybe spend a little bit of time learning something new. That's what I'm doing. I love it. So yeah, go through the Amazon portal, get a push too. All right, God, sorry, that was a long one. I told you, I feel good, flaming lips. I don't go out enough. Jesus Christ, the world is so full of beautiful white holes, just waiting for you to put your mouth upon. All right, that's it for me, man. Today's guest is the creator of some fantastic games. I'm not gonna list them all because there's too many to list. The ones I'm most fond of are Super Meat Boy and Binding of Isaac. You can find out everything you need to know about Edmund by going to his blog, which the link will be at dunkintrustle.com or by playing his games. Either way, I hope you will please send as much love as you possibly can to one of my favorite artists living today. Everyone please welcome to the Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour podcast, Edmund McMillan. For me, man, it's what I gotta do. So that's why. So forgive the sound quality, please. Be gentle with me. There's just no time for me to fly out to Santa Barbara to do an interview. And I don't wanna put that on a guest. He wants some weirdo flying across the country to come to your house and interview you. That sounds annoying. When Skype, this incredible technology allows this very same thing to happen instantaneously without spraying rocket gas or whatever comes out of a plane into the sky. So again, in all seriousness, if I could make these podcasts technically perfect, if I could make these Skype podcasts as good as the one-on-one interviews, I would do it. And I'm gonna look into it, figure out how to do it if it's possible. So if the sound quality on Edmund's side seems a little, I don't know, Skype-y, well, it is. And so just be kind, listen to what he says. Allow yourself to surrender to the limitation because there is no way around it for this particular episode. So forgive me for Skype, it's all I got. All right, fine, here we go. Today's guest is one of my favorite artists living on planet Earth. He's a video game designer. He's created many, many games. I'm gonna, the ones I like best are Super Meat Boy and Binding of Isaac. You can watch him on Indie Game, the movie. But first, listen to him here. Everybody, please welcome to the Dunkin' Trussell family, our podcast, The Legend Himself, Edmund McMillan. Welcome. Welcome, welcome on you. As you are with us. Shake hands, no need to be blue. Welcome to you, welcome, welcome. It's the Dunkin' Trussell family. Welcome, welcome, welcome. Edmund, welcome to the Dunkin' Trussell family, our podcast. Thank you so much for taking some time out of what must be an incredibly busy schedule to have a chat with me. No problem. You are the creator. I have a few favorite video games in my life. And I'm sure you know, as much as anybody, how much it means to have a favorite video game. It's a big deal. It's something that you go to for comfort when you're stressed out. It's a very potent and powerful thing. And you created one of those games, which for me is the binding of Isaac. But on top of that, you've made over 50 video games, which is insane to me. And I guess I just wanted, I was curious, do you spend more time playing games or designing games? Well, I spend way more time designing games, for sure. Do you? Yeah, I mean, I try my best to play as many games as possible. But yeah, as time is, the more time that has passed, the less I tend to play games. I'll play like the really appealing ones or the really, really cream of the crop type games. Even though I'm playing Pokemon, go a lot. I don't know if people think that that's cream of the crop. I mean, you know, but that's the thing with games is like, who knows, it's such a personal connection that happens. And why you end up liking one game over another is anybody's guess. But I was wondering, as a creator of games, you're a creator of games, I'm a consumer of games. I have a video game addiction problem. I get... No, that's probably why you like Isaac. Yeah, yeah, because you made it as addictive as anything that could, it's so severely addictive. I hate to call it addictive. My goal is never to make an addictive game. Maybe it's just semantics here, but I like to use the word compelling. Well, you know what? I say addict and addiction in the same way. I say like freak or dumb. Yeah, I just don't like feeling like a... Like I'm making something that's actually wasting people's time or they could have been spending it on better things, but you know, whatever. This is, I mean, I've never had a chance to talk to a successful game designer at your level. And this is one of my primary questions. Is that very thing? Number one, there is a stigma against playing video games. A lot of variety of stigmas against playing video games from the most basic and ridiculous one. It's for children to the more extreme one, which is you're wasting your life, man. You're sitting there pressing buttons. You could be learning to play piano right now. And so what do you think about that? Do you really think it's a waste of time to play these games? It's something that I go back and forth in my head all the time. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, I can say right now that, I mean, playing video games is as much of a waste of time as listening to music or watching a movie, which aren't that big of a waste. I guess it's just when it becomes not worth it, I guess. I don't know. I played World of Warcraft with my wife for a little while and I think we played for a month in it. It was kind of like, oh, wait a minute, let's not do this. Right. Like, you just don't, I don't know. I guess there's a point. I don't know. Honestly, it's a strange thing. It's odd for me having my most successful game be what she's considered the most addictive game that I've done, a completely non-linear, infinitely replayable game, which was my goal. And it's kind of like the new arcade in a way where you're not just playing for high score. You're just experiencing a new experience every time, which was my goal. But then I, sometimes I guess I do, I question like, you know, it's cool when people show you how many hours they put into it. My wife is like a huge obsessed player. Like she plays at least three or four hours a day and we have a baby, so that's saying something. Wow. And she, I mean, she was the first beta tester. She was the reason why I probably, probably the number one reason why I kept making DLCs is because she'd finish it and I just, it's cool to see her get so into something that I made because she wasn't really into anything else that I had done in the past. But then it's kind of like, what am I doing? Like I'm playing with fire here, I guess in a way, but there's also a part of me that doesn't really care. So whatever. That's pretty intense though. No, that's intense. Because first hand, you get to witness what it looks like. First hand, right there, your wife is dive, is jumped into the reality that you created. And wow, yeah, that's so intense, man. By the way, soulmate, I guess, right? That's a soulmate. Yeah, sure. How'd you guys meet? I met when she was really young. I mean, I was young too. I was 19. I didn't know how old she was, but then I was informed and I stayed away for a while. She was 14 at the time. We didn't start dating until she was 15. Wow. And we've been together for almost 17 years. Wow. And this was, when you were 19, were you already developing games at that point? I don't, it's possible that I was, but I didn't recognize it. I mean, I was a comic artist. I made comics for many years through high school and a little, I think I started making games officially, or I knew that I was making games officially around like when I was 24. 24. And that was in action script? Is that what you started in? Yeah, I started in Flash. But actually, I mean, I started in Click and Play. There's this program called Click and Play that I had in high school that I was making games with, but I didn't, I mean, when I was in high school, people always, you know, like, what are you gonna do when you get older and people are like, you should make video games. And I was like, well, there's no way I ever could because no one's gonna listen to me. Like there's no way I'm gonna convince a company that you should make this game about a naked child that's commentary on like religion. Like that's gonna be something that anybody's gonna get behind. Like all the ideas that I had were way too weird and it just didn't seem possible. So I just tossed that idea away. Like I thought maybe the best I could be an animator for a video game company because it seemed to be something that I was pretty okay at. Sure. For the most part, I had given up on that idea and it wasn't until I found out about what the indie scene, you know, independent games in general, which was super tiny in 2003, 2004. But that's kind of opened my eyes to like, oh, wait, like I can just work with one other person and they'll listen to me. Yeah, you know, like I'll be able to convince. I was for the longest time and still to this day, I mostly worked with fans, people that already dig what I'm doing enough to listen to me and listen to my stupid ideas and help me execute them. Well, you couldn't, yeah, you couldn't. I don't see any way, at least in the universe, the way things used to be in 2001 that you would have been able to pitch any of these games to anybody and get the kind of feedback you would want. Let me read some of the games from your Wikipedia that you've designed. Yep. The Lonely Hermit backup files, that sounds cool. Then we get Dead Baby Dress Up. 12 uses of Dead Babies. Dead Baby Dress Up, two. Six more Dead Baby Uses. Dead Baby Dress Up, three. WWF Baby Dress Up. Eight more Dead Baby Uses. Dead Baby Dress Up, four. The Boy Who Questioned God. Dead Baby Dress Up, X. Dead Baby Superhero Dress Up. Yeah, these ideas. Are amazing, and I mean that. I don't mean that sarcastic. No, yeah, back in the early 2000s, people, I was known as Edmund Dead Baby McMillan, like that was what I was known for. And the whole Dead Baby theme, that was the mascot for, This Is a Cry for Help, which was a comic, and later a website that I maintained, which was my claim to fame then. And that mascot made its way into Isaac and became the blue baby. Wow. Like in a lot of ways, Dead Baby Dress Up, which for people who, well nobody knows what Dead Baby Dress Up is. So if you can imagine the blue baby from The Binding of Isaac, and you drag and drop pieces of facial features and clothing onto it to configure it, you can take a screenshot of it and do whatever you want. And back in like 2001 and 2000, this is when I was making these things, I was obsessed with the idea of customization. And I later incorporated that into The Binding of Isaac. And I thought it would just be really cool to, every item that you pick up gives you some sort of random, not random, but a facial feature that makes a randomly generated blue baby or dead baby. Oh wow, I get it. Of course, yeah. And one of the things I love about that level of customization, Binding of Isaac, is that in most games, when you pick up something to customize the hero, it makes the hero look better, stronger, healthier. Whereas in Isaac, most things that you pick up distort the poor thing. By the end of the game, you're surrounded by floating dead babies. You've got a cyclopean eye, wings. You've transformed it into this mutated thing. It is dark. And I can remember being drawn into the game, initially just by the name. Because I knew what you meant by The Binding of Isaac. You were talking about one of the many stories of human sacrifice in the Bible. And can you actually, would you mind relating the story, where you got the name, The Binding of Isaac? Yeah, Binding of Isaac's from the chapter in the Bible where Abraham has to, or is asked to kill his son to prove his devotion to God. Which I think is, I mean, there's a lot of wacky shit in the Bible, but that one's pretty insane, mostly because it happens now. People do hear the voice of God and tell them to kill their kid and they kill their kid. Well, yeah, and you know what? A lot of the ways that that gets translated in a more modern sense, is the voice of God that they hear is patriotism. And the way they kill their kid is by encouraging the child to like, join whatever military is the military of the country that the kid is born into. And so- Well, there's a lot of ways people kill their kids these days. Yeah. But I mean, I'm going for the more literal sense. Like when The Binding of Isaac came out, that week, some, a woman killed her kids. So I had Google Alerts set up for The Binding of Isaac to see, you know, reception. And I started getting a ton of Google Alerts. And I was like, what's this? What's this? And it's like, woman kills son, here's voice of God. And it's just like, what? And it's like, oh, and I actually, that was when I realized, oh, this happens quite often. Like people hear the voice of God. And then it goes into the whole theme of the game where it's kind of questioning the whole like, if you believe that, then shouldn't you believe that that is a possibility of something that could currently happen. And everybody writes those people off as crazy, but it seems like a devout person might question if that's true. Well, yeah. It was an interesting subject matter. It was the beginning of what I wanted to explore and where I wanted to go with it initially. It also, the title The Binding of Isaac was also so perfect. It also reads the same as The Legend of Zelda, The Binding of Isaac. Oh, fuck. So it was like, I don't know. It just seemed so perfect. It is perfect. And it's perfect on a lot of different levels. One aspect of its perfection is that it's based on one of the most prevalent, yet somehow taboo occult principles, which is the idea that there is some occult energy to be gained from sacrificing your child or a child to an entity. And Christians, a lot of fundamentalists love to point their fingers at secret occult groups that live in the world that sacrifice, ritualistically sacrifice children when the entire story of Christianity is based on an omnipotent being sacrificing its child so that the world can be healed. The whole of Christianity is based on child sacrifice. And people seem to miss that point altogether. So the pillar of the game is based on one of the fundamental components of Christianity. I mean, when you go and take communion, you're eating the flesh of a God. You're eating the flesh of a sacrificed God. It's really an intense and dark religion in a lot of different ways. And I think that your game captures that in such a beautiful and subtle way. And it's also mixed in with a lot of other occult elements. So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about where you gathered the information and your understanding of the symbols that made it into the game. Well, I grew up Catholic. I went through seven years of catechism. So I had a great deal of experience. And I also grew up as the blackest black sheet of my family. Like I was super black sheet. So I had one side. So my mom and dad were divorced when I was five. And my dad, who was a huge drug addict, got into recovery, which came with extreme Christianity, which was like his new drug. And so the McMillan side of the family were all like this. They were all super hard, poor Christians, very fire and burnstone. And then the other side of my family, mainly my grandmother, she was very devout Catholic. And I grew up with these two sides, the same coin, but for the most part, like the Catholic side was super ritualistic, very, I enjoyed the rituals. They were very interesting to me because they were very reminiscent of D&D and spellcasting and the specific, like I've said this before and I think possibly in the movie, but my grandma used to do a, I was gonna say spell, she would do a prayer of safe passage whenever we would go over 17 over the hill, over in Santa Cruz. And it would always feel comforting. How did the prayer go? What was that? How did the prayer go? I don't know, she would, I think she would pray the rosary, which what I would actually do as well. Like I, I mean, I guess it's, you know, it's like meditating or whatever else. I used to have really bad ulcers when I was little and I used to pray the rosary in order to sleep. Wow. So I mean, it goes deep. There's little stuff too. Like I remember very vividly when my, my grandpa passed away when I was five, we would go and light candles so he would get out of purgatory. And it was just so mind blowing. Wow. And that is magic just to clarify or in my opinion, when you're that there isn't, there is no difference in a magical working and a prayer. It's a different type of magic, you know, because it's a invoking a God, but it's still magic. You're uttering some incantation to a transcendent force to affect some change in your dimension. It's just that because Catholicism has become such a popular form of magical practice, people don't refer to it as magic anymore, but please continue. Sorry. But yeah, but basically kind of what you're saying, like growing up, I always kind of saw it as that. My grandma felt magical. She felt, my grandma came from Mexico as well. So there was kind of like, there's this mixing of, what is it called? Can't my mind- Santeria? Yeah, it's like, yeah, a bit of Santeria. There's, there was a, she walked the line of like, am I a psychic or am I talking to God? You know, that sort of thing. And like there were, there was a big blend and which is why I'm so interested that I have like a big collection of weird, you know, Mexican Catholic stuff, which walks that line as well. Wow, cool. All around my house. But yeah, growing up, my grandma seemed like she was magic and it, I don't, yeah, I can't say that I ever really believed in any of the stuff that I, that was being said, but it, the way my grandmother was with religion, it's, she was so, I guess, progressive. She, she was very like, this is my religion. This is what I believe. And nobody else is, is on the same wavelength. Like, and nobody else needs to be like, this is mine. This is my personal relationship with my God. This is what I'm doing. Nobody else needs to do the same thing because nobody else has this personal relationship. So it was never, I never felt like I, if I didn't believe it, I, I was in the wrong, if that makes sense. Yeah, it makes a lot of sense. But then on the other side, my dad's side of the family made me feel completely like the devil. And I, I was the kind of kid growing up where if I was pushed into a role, I would play the role. Like, and if I was going to be a weirdo, if I was going to be the weird, evil, dark kid, I'd totally embrace it and I'd become that kid. And I think in a lot of ways it pushed me into this, the person I kind of am, like all these different, pushing all these different directions and kind of, you know, the, Isaac is, is an exploration of, of that, of feeling, of, of feeling bad. Yeah. Because I'm different. And it, and it, it, it, it, I, the art that you, it's so artful and that when you, as a, you know, you're a child of divorce. Many of us are children of divorce. I've read about some of your experiences going to, you went to visit your dad on the weekends. I, and, and you would. So not only would you go to visit your dad in the weekends, but this was, I, this is after he is in recovery and has taken up fundamentalism. Is that correct? Yeah. Oh yeah, for sure. And you're going on the weekends from this magical grandmother who's, who has a very advanced connection with her religion. And you're basically landing in like a kind of hell. A, a, a judgmental, dark, hellish world. And, uh, um, somehow you can feel it in, in that game. And I think that that, if anybody challenges me on video games, being a childish activity or anybody throws out just like, and unfortunately not many people do it these days as much, but the ill-informed idea that video games are somehow not art, your game is the game that just destroys that argument. Because captured in the energy of this game is the feeling. You feel it, man. I like, when I play that game, I feel it. I feel, it takes me back to when I was a kid, takes me back to like the time I pissed my pants in like the second grade, you know, like in, in just the humiliation that kids feel that it seems like adults forget about. And it's there in the cutscenes of that game. So fuck, it's great, man. But, um, I wanted to ask, do you, so you, you didn't take up Catholicism. You don't feel, do you, do you still pray? If I'm like having a panic attack or something bad's going on, I might, I might, I, I randomly prayed, but I don't, I don't, I don't think I'd believe. I don't know. I usually pray to my grandma, if that makes sense. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. It makes sense. Yeah, for sure. I mean, I think that's the thing people, one of the very, I think one of the mistakes people make is like, they think there's a right thing to pray to, you know, like, so if you have to like figure out the right thing or you know, like, it can't just be God. It's got to be a God from the right team. And it's can't, certainly can't be your grandmother or my, or my mom or whoever is passed on. Never can you access those people, which is insane. If you ask me, I mean, everything that dies goes back into the infinite. So it's just some component of that infinite, I guess. But man, you, is your, is your dad still around? Yeah, he's still around. He actually, he recently, he recently, a few years ago, he visited me and he asked for a copy of, of Isaac and I gave him a DRM free CD and he, he's like, oh yeah, you know, there's some, some kids around my mobile home park and they might like it. I'm like, yeah, whatever, cool, but, you know, do whatever. And then he visited me, you know, a year later and he was like, oh yeah, like our church had a lock in and I installed Isaac on all the computers and the kids loved it. Oh wow. And I was like, I was like, really? I'm like, I don't know. Like there are aspects of that game. I mean, the, the whole thing kind of like is, revolves around questioning Christianity. And he's like, oh no, like it's all by the book. Like it's, it's just another story in the Bible. Like it's, wow, he, and that was a weird thing too. Like I remember thinking, my wife especially was really worried about releasing this game. She felt like it was, it might be too critical and that people would, you know, the wrong kind of people would get upset. Yes. And I didn't think so, but I was worried, you know, I'm always, you know, and I remember preparing like, oh, what am I, what will I say when I'm attacked? And, you know, but no, it never happened. It never ever happened. In fact, there was a Christian pastor, pastor that wrote a review of Isaac praising it. Oh my God. That is nuts, man. Again, another indication of just how, how powerful the thing is that you create it. I mean, when I, I've interviewed, I performed at the wedding of the grandson of the founder of the church of Satan. I've interviewed the head of the Satanic temple, Lucian Grieves. I've been in the presence of familial Satanists. And your game made me feel way more creepy than being around them. Like fuck, cause you're like, and so, cause it's fascinating cause you're getting these dopamine hits. You're playing this game. Holy shit, man. I think I'm finally going to make it through. I'm not going to die this time. And then suddenly it dawns on you. I'm steering a baby that was severely abused and almost murdered by his mom that uses his tears as a weapon. What the fuck, man? So, so powerful and dark. Do you, do you, do you don't think your dad, when he played it, had any inkling of the fact that he was something of an inspiration for that narrative? I don't, I don't know. I mean, there are a lot of other things that I pull from, from different people. Like, of course my, there are a lot of people in my family that have been very abused. I mean, I kind of come from like, I mean, I think, I think most people come from some history of abuse, but I'm learning that I'm wrong. The more friends I make, the more I'm like, well, yeah, you were molested, right? It's like, I thought, hey, wait, wasn't everybody? What's going on here? I guess, no, but yeah. You seem very familiar with abuse. And you also seem like the other thing that I like about the game is, and especially chatting with you now, is that the fact that this kid's power is his tears. And it works within the game when you realize that maybe the binding of Isaac is a kind of tear that shot out of you and turned into this beautiful game. Is that safe to say that it? I mean, I guess in a way, I mean, I hate to think that people can see my work. I mean, of course you're gonna see my work and think I'm a big weirdo, which is true, but I mean, many people have had way worse than I have. I just grew up poor and had, I mean, I don't know. I don't know if I'm downplaying or upplaying or what I'm doing here, but I hate to think for people to think that I'm, my mom's a terrible mother and et cetera. Oh yeah, none of us want that to put that on our families, man. I mean, that's the problem with like a, you know, I remember going to visit my dad in the summers and it was fine. It sounded like the worst. You know, it's not like I, you know, there's a very sad and there's a bittersweet song, a lot of us sing, which is, you know, I didn't have it as bad as other people, you know? It's a bittersweet song. It could be so much worse. I don't know. There's, so when making Isaac, which originally, you know, depending on how you design something from the bottom up or the top down, I was designing around this Legend of Zelda shell, you know, at its core, I was trying to do, much like what I did with Super Meat Boy, I was kind of re-envisioning something, I guess in the way like Quentin Tarantino would, like I want to relive my favorite things growing up, but I want to put my own spin on it. I want to put my own, I want to make it mine in a way. And I did that with Mario with Super Meat Boy and I did it with Zelda with the Binding of Isaac. And one of the things Miyamoto did when writing the story for the game, or just the general feel of the game, was he wrote about his childhood and how he used to explore as a kid and that kind of feeling of, you know, being a creative kid and imagining this world and adventuring into the unknown. And I love that so much. I thought, how can I make this mine? And I started exploring my own childhood and just got darker and darker. Holy shit. And it's just kind of like, it's not that, I mean, I was alone a lot, but it wasn't, I didn't, it wasn't a bad thing. I liked being alone. I wasn't a fan of people in general. So I enjoyed my time alone. And, you know, yeah, in a lot of ways, of course the game is about me growing up. I mean, as an artist, I think it's really hard to create something genuine without exploring something personal. The thing I have the most experience with is me. I know who I am. And I know what I've been through. So the most honestly I can speak and the most artistically I can speak is with my own vocabulary, my own personal experience. And I thought, okay, I'll just dump it all into this. I mean, it was, I did not think that anybody would care. I was purposefully going dark. Like I was going to make something so, so weird and so off that it could, I hope that like you, like I hope it would speak to you. I hope it would speak to people like you. Like I hope that there is, there would be a handful of people out there who had maybe some similar experience that they could get into and understand what's going on and really love it. But for the most part, the mainstream will just totally be like, ah, that's a fucking, fucking weird game. But it turned out that the design was very appealing, which in a way is, I guess I kind of get off on that. Like the idea that I'm forcing a bunch of people who definitely do not know what's going on, they just see it as a weird, I'm a little kid crying on shit type experience. And that's great, you know? But I feel like there's gotta be something there that's bleeding into their brain and they're picking up on little pieces of who I am. And I guess in a way it's kind of like a twisted enjoyment of making you see these things that you're not supposed to or something like that. It's subversive. And yeah, I'm sure there's people who are just, I mean, just like the whatever youth group that was sitting around playing this game. I'm sure there's people who don't see it. But you know what I bet? I bet that a lot of the people that you think might not get it, get it. Because that hesitation when you don't necessarily want, you know, none of us want to do the whole victim thing. Nobody wants to do that. No one wants to be like, ah, it was horrible. You know, the silence, the naps, beginning to love the emptiness, beginning to love the silence, beginning to love the sound of the fan, the feeling of the aloneness and how it became this weird, anesthetic. And yet still you're like, it was fucking divorce, man. And no one wants to be like, ah, the divorce broke my heart. But for a lot of people, that's the first heartbreak. That's when it all like just is fucked up. And if it's preceded by addiction, alcoholism, you know, it's instability into instability into instability. So you don't necessarily have to be getting your, you know, your butt fingered by somebody. It can, you know, because you're getting an early glimpse. I think what happens is some people don't get the early glimpse, you know, like, and I have friends who grew up in that, where you're like, what, you lived in one house your whole life? What? Your whole fucking life? I had that exact conversation with a friend of mine. And I was like, whoa, like between the ages of five and 17, I think I lived in at least 15 to 16 different houses. You are a gypsy. And that, you are definitively a gypsy. And it's interesting, the gypsy culture in the, in the West is particularly depressing because at least the gypsy culture in the East embraces the never ending movement from one place to the next. Whereas in the West, our gypsy culture pretends that every new place you're gonna move, that's where you're gonna stay. And every single fucking time there's another person who marries your mom or another place to go, packing up, unpacking, you become intimately familiar with the process of packing, moving trucks. How, you know, most people don't know, I can look at, like I gained at a young age the ability to estimate how long a move would take. You know, like I knew from the number of times we've moved. So that's pretty, pretty weird, right? And then you run into these people who are like, yeah, you know, this is my friend from the third grade and we would play together that childhood room is still there. I mean, it's, it's, and I'm not, I don't, I love my life, I like where I'm at. But I also acknowledge how fucking weird and turbulent it was. And I think that there's a gift in it. And I think that when you see your work, you realize how that, what you did is transmute something that a lot of us went through. And that's why I say, I bet a lot more people connect to this game than maybe you think, because a lot of us went through divorce, you know? And that game speaks to that. Yeah, it's been having, so we just had a daughter and she's, she's a year, a year and a half. And just sitting around with my wife who grew up very similarly to me, of course, that how else are we going to find each other? Right. But to like look at this little girl and be like, you're going to live in this house forever. Like your parents are going to stay together. There's not going to be this back and forth. Like, it's, I mean, it's, it's nice to be able to, I've learned that having a child, you kind of like cathartically fix your childhood, all the holes and all the, all the weirdness. I mean, of course, the things that made me who I am, but like you get to fix it, you get to right the wrongs. It's kind of, it's a very cathartic experience. I mean, having a kid is a religious experience for sure. That's what everybody says. Did you, when you, when you guys, was this something when you started dating or when you rise, you're in love and this is real, you're probably going to get married. Did you just know you were going to have a kid or was it a question mark? No, I mean, my wife got pregnant when we met. And of course we didn't have the baby. And that was, I mean, in a way that's kind of the story of Super Meat Boy, which I'd never speak of. What? But wait, can you, do you mind speaking of it here? We can jump over it, but I'd love to hear more about that. I mean, she was 15 years old when I met her and mistakes were made and we didn't have the baby. And it was very difficult for her. It was very difficult. And her, that distance and the depression that came along with the choice was a hurdle. It was an uphill battle and it was something that bounced around throughout a relationship. And of me as this codependent person, I needed her more than anything in the world and to have that distance between us was difficult. I mean, she did eventually get over it and was able to get through with it and then it was like 16 years between that and our baby now. Wow. And that, there was a lot of tell me if we're gonna really have a baby. Like once you open that door, it's hard to close it. And like, is this gonna happen? Is this not gonna happen? And it was a very difficult thing for us as a couple and trying to figure out what's the most responsible thing to do, what's best for us and what's best for our future. And the stars aligned. And recently, there were a few horrible things that happened mostly with our family and there was a minor health issue that happened. And it was kind of like, hey, what are we doing? Like, what are we doing? Like, am I gonna just spin my wheels and make money? How much money do I need? Like, what the fuck am I doing? Like, the priority is straight basically. Like I do, I want, some of my fondest memories that I have with Danielle are when we play a game together and having a baby seemed like the best cooperative game we could play and making that decision has been the most amazing thing ever for us. And I'm glad we waited because having a kid is so difficult. I have no idea how a single parent does it at all. How old are you? It's, I just turned 37. Okay, yeah, okay, wow. So you, yes, I, oh wow, man. Yeah, so you were, you were like, what? I get it though, because that thing you just said, how difficult having a child is. I mean, for you, a game designer, an artist, somebody who's like, you earned a life of freedom, man. You don't work for some corporate. You work for yourself, you're free. So I get it, man. Having a child is a surrender to a greater destiny. And, but whoa, man. I mean, I, you know, I'm an, if I have a child now, I'm going to be an old dad. But at that thing that you're saying, man, I feel it all the time. Like, what am I doing? Like, why wouldn't, why wouldn't I want to do that? Or- Well, it's scary. It's a scary, intimidating thing. And it always blows my mind when I see so many people willy-nilly having kids and it's just seem like making that decision is just, I don't know. I mean, but yeah. Like I said, the stars aligned and stars aligned. Stars have aligned for me many times in my life. And this is just one of those situations where it's like, no, we're going to do this. And it's completely life changing and it's completely great. And it just, I don't know. Yeah, it's, it really brings you back, makes you relive everything all over again. And it totally makes your priorities change. Like the hardest thing for me right now is the war between the family man and the creative person. Like, I am a terrible person to be around if I'm not being creative. Terrible. I'm a just awful, self-destructive mess. Oh, well, can we talk a little bit about your creative process? I'd really like to know, especially now that you have a child, what your work day looks like. No, it's definitely a lot different. I'm leaning on the people that I work with much harder than I, and it was very difficult for me as a workaholic as well, to go from, you know, 80 hour plus weeks, you know, infinite. I don't even know what the fucking hours that I work are. You know, you work until it's done and that's it. Like, which is also very difficult to do when you have a relationship. Right. And an obsessive work schedule who makes me feel like a man, you know what I mean? Like, it makes me feel like I'm worth something. It's the one thing that makes me feel like I'm something. Absolutely. Tell me your old, prior to the child, tell me a little bit about what a typical day designing one of these games was like for you. What did it look like? What time did you wake up? I just get up, I get up when I get up, and I sit down and I work all day. You have your own office at your house? Yeah. So would you get up, you get up, you make breakfast, do you take a shower, or do you just literally get up and go to the computer and get back to work? I just get up, go to the computer, especially when things are really like, you know, you gotta get shit done type stuff, like you just get up and go. What time would you wake up? Oh, it's random. I have the most fucked up schedule in the world. That's another thing that I have to figure out, like how the fuck we can stabilize our schedule so this child actually sees the light of day. Right now we're on an early schedule, which is great. Like I'd be waking up right now normally. Yes. But we recently just flipped our schedule, which we do a lot. I probably am like living very unhealthily when it comes to the amount of sun that I get versus, you know, sleep deprivation and stuff like that. I'll probably have to tone it down. What time are you going to bed, Edmund? Oh, it's different. I mean, a reasonable time when I get tired. I'm very, I don't know. I found this, I found that the later I stay up, and of course Danielle's on the same schedule as I am, so the later we stay up, the more creative I feel. Yeah. I feel super, super creative. And I'm an insomniac as well, so it's like the reason I can't sleep is usually because I've got a million ideas of things I want to do. And I got to write them down or whatever else, and I can't stop my brain from, you know, going down all the different paths. But I also feel, I'm also a total nut case in that same situation. Like it's edging into insanity. Like I'm more prone to panic attacks. I have, I'm super paranoid. I'm just a super fucking weirdo, but I'm super creative. And motivated. And then the opposite, it's like once I come back around and I'm waking up at six in the morning and having a whole day and where I'm going out and doing stuff and whatever else and getting some work done, I feel like a regular working man. I feel totally balanced. I feel calm, I feel healthy, but it's difficult. I always flip back around to that other person. And it's not like I feel like I need that person, you know what I mean? But I, it's difficult for me. There's not enough hours in the day. Like I just have, I tend to just, I'll stay up another hour and I'll get some work done. I'll stay up another hour and I get some work done. And then eventually it just pushes into we're waking up when it's getting dark. And you can't, you can't do that. No, you can't. Because nothing's open. You got to move to New York. Yeah, that's, I guess that's true. Like Santa Cruz goes to sleep at 11. So it's like. Yeah, you, you're in a place, definitely. I know exactly the, the, the world that you're in there, man and the artist life does seem to be an insomniac's life. But I, you were talking a little bit about sort of creativity and your own personal being on sort of the precipice of madness. And when it comes to, to making things. And this is something when I'm, when I see like some, like a, when I see art that I love. So one of the things that often pops into my mind is how did they have the courage to make this without thinking that they were having a nervous breakdown? Like the, when you come up with an idea like many of your games, especially a video, like a painting, a drawing. If I want to make some song for my podcast or whatever, I could, you know, there's a lot of the temporal risk is low. Yeah. You know, but, but for you, it's like to dive into an idea that is initially, as we discussed earlier, completely unmarketable, risky, and more than that, like on some level offensive and on, and confessional. When you jump into that, how do you overcome the part of yourself that's saying, what the fuck are you doing, man? Are you okay? There's absolutely no part of me that ever feels that way. Oh, wow. And I, and it's probably just conditioning from, you know, growing up and just like letting loose when it comes to just writing and, and, and comics and whatever else I throw myself into, like. What a blessing. You're blessed. That's a blessing. That's a blessing from your grandmother. Because I, and, and I think a lot of people that I know, when we see people like you driven, Simon, like you see driven people all the time, but driven artists, almost to the point of madness. You know, I, I want to be that. But I can't, long-term projects, I don't know. It's just like, especially like ideas that I might have that are preposterous in my mind. Some evil part of me pops up as like, no way, man, no way. There's no, go ahead. I guess for me, like as you, as you said in the beginning, like all the little shitty games that I've made over the years, right? Like I've failed repeatedly. I've, I've, I have worked on things for years that never saw the light of day. I've worked on things for years that just poof, they're gone. And I've had failures, many failures. I've had two good games, you know, that people really know me for and tons of games that it's like, what the fuck, who fucking cares? Like I think recently I put out a game that I made in a few months with a friend of mine called fingered. It was just a little goofy game that explores the death penalty, but I thought it was fun. Can you talk about, how did it work? What's the premise? It's a randomly generated lineup of people that are, and then you've got these witnesses that give you rough descriptions and you kind of rule out who didn't do it and who did, and then you kind of just hedge your bets. And then you have to put the person in the electric chair and pull the switch, and then you see if they did it or if they didn't, and then you go from there. It was a super fun little project. I really enjoyed working on it, but people fucking, I mean, it was, it was garbage game to these people. I sold it for like a buck 50 or whatever, but it was, you know, they were like, pfft. It's like, well, get used to it. Cause this is the shit I made always. Like I, I'm going to make what most consider garbage that is fun for me to do. I'm in this, I mean, I'm in this for selfish reasons and I'm not, I'm not going to apologize for that. Like I, I am in this because I need this. I don't fucking care if I make money off this. Like I never did in the past. Like if you dig it great, I'm doing this because I need this to get out of me. I'm doing this because this is fun. This is what makes me happy. This is what keeps me going. This is what makes me feel like a person. I could give a fuck what anybody else thinks. You know, like I really don't care. And I think I don't care because I know what it's like to fail and I failed so many times and I've learned from those things. And it's not an ideal. You just pick yourself up and you move on. Like it's, it's a, the movie is a weird illusion as well. And I'm, have you, did you watch any game or movie? Okay. So that's what inspired me. By the way, that's like that somewhere right around watching that game is where the, our Twitter interaction happened. It's such a good game, but yeah, go ahead. Sorry. So like I, a lot of people will come up and be like, you know how to do it and whatever else it's like, I kind of wish that that movie would show. You don't, it's like a psychic, right? A psychic, when they're scamming somebody, they will be like, oh, I'm feeling this and I'm seeing this. And then the person on the other end is going, no, no, no, but then when they get something right, they go, yes, yes. That person, this psychic is amazing. This person's so great. They're right on, they're right on. But nobody, nobody remembers the, the misses. And I've had so many failures, but nobody's looking at them cause they were failures. Nobody's talking about them cause they were failures. And it's like, it kind of creates this illusion of success and how success works. And that's, that's the one thing that I, I kind of wish that it would, it was a little more clear. Cause I get these people that, you know, message me and they're like, Hey, I just quit my job at, at EA where I had the secure job and I have a wife and kids and I'm going to do it. I'm going to be an independent game developer. And it's like, what the fuck? What are you doing? And it's, it's, it's, I guess it's that, it's that illusion though. It's that illusion of instant success. Like you're just going to jump in. And it's like, I've had a, I've had a lot of experience and I had a lot of other experience with failure, with what not to do. And for whatever reason, I'm able to pick myself up and move on. And I learn a lot. You learn a lot from making mistakes. You learn a lot from doing things just in general. And from taking risks, man. And the, but you know, like, let's talk about that guy from EA or let's talk about, you know, sometimes I get emails like that too. And from people who are like, I'm going to, you know, and they don't say they're going to be a game designer. Sometimes they say, I'm just going to Peru. Like, you know. And, and, and, you know, part of me thinks, oh shit, oh shit. You know, this could be a big mistake. But then on the other hand, you, if somebody's working at EA and they're, they're not getting that feeling that you, it seems like you live inside of, and that is failure. You know, that's their first failure, working at a thing they didn't want to be working at, right? Yeah, for sure. But it's a, it's really risky and earth-shattering for somebody to have that kind of failure late in life. I mean, it's, if you're not used to it, I don't know. I've been invited to go up and talk to colleges and stuff like that, especially UCSC here. And I'll take them up on it, but I'm probably not the guy. I don't say the things that they want me to say because the first thing I walk in, I'm like, didn't go to college and you definitely don't need to go here to make games. Ah, like, what do you, and then of course it's like, oh, so I don't know what to tell you. And I realize that I'm a different type of person. I realize that there's very different people out there. And some people like the structure and need the structure. And that's fucking great. There's, there's, it's not like it's any worse working for a company. You're not a worse person. You're not a less creative person. It's just different types of people that have different types of motivation. And I don't think that's something that can be taught. I don't think that's something that can be explained. I just think it's different, different people require different types of fuel. Right. And if you're going to college for game design and you haven't already made multiple games, I don't think you're going to make it as an independent game designer. I mean, it's, it's a harsh thing to say, but that's the, I think it's the truth. Like an independent game designer is somebody who is an independent artist in general is somebody who's living it. It's a stupidly, you have to sacrifice everything. You live it. That's it. That's it. That's your life. You're, you're an artist and that's all you do. That's all you think about. And you know, you know already who you are. You know, you're that person and you know what you need. And let me, let me point out what you just said. You said, you have to sacrifice everything. And I think that when you talk about the voice of God and you talk about the voice of God coming into a person's life. Yeah, sure. The crazy people here, God tell them to like throw their fucking baby off the roof or whatever. But I think the voice of God is what I think of God as is the same voice that got into you, man and said, you're going to have to sacrifice everything. Edmund, you have to give it all up. You're going to have to sacrifice your whole fucking life to make these games. And if you don't hear that voice, you know and it isn't a clear voice, that's the problem. If only, right? If only some very clear voice from the heavens popped into your head and was like, quit your job, go into the wilderness, obey me, then we'd be set. But it's a kind of, it's a, I know, I know when I set down the path of comedy, I just, I realized early on, I remember saying this to my mom and saying this to myself, I'll just be poor for the rest of my life. Like, yeah, it's the exact same thing. And that's where, that's it. That's the archetype. That is the archetype of the person that we are. You know, that's what it is. It's like, don't fucking care. Like, I don't care. I mean, I live poor my whole life. Like, what difference is it going to make? Like, I know what I'm doing. I know how to eat top ramen and fucking hot dogs. Fuck off. Like, I can do this. I'm skilled at this. Sure, my gallbladder got removed. Oh, Jesus. But, you know, whatever. Like, yeah, I mean, I hear you though. Like the whole, I guess for me, the voice is more of a voice saying, you'll never be happy unless you keep going. And like, you know, when I hit my teens and I was, you know, my initial soul search, I guess you could say, creatively trying to figure out what the fuck am I doing? Why am I doing it? Why am I here? What am I going to do? I guess I made that decision of like, I'm going to try to do this because I know if I don't, I'll probably kill myself. Like, I'll probably end up at the bottom, you know? I'll head down some path in my father did. You know, I'm, it's all in me, you know? And unless I keep moving in this direction, logically, it seems like logically I would have to end somewhere. It's, I gotta end up somewhere. Like if I just keep going, and it was just a lot of not giving up. Like, I mean, when I was making games in the early 2000s, I was working at GameStop. That's how I was paying the rent. I was working at GameStop and I was doing freelance work for like local music magazines and stuff like that. A lot of other independent stuff that I was doing and I had nobody really holding my hand and I had nobody really, you know, you learn from your mistakes. I remember just doing the most logical thing possible. And when I was really desperate for work, I would just machine gun email every fucking local business and say, hey, I'm working on my portfolio. I do illustration, I do logo design, use me up. I'm going to do, I'm going to work for free. And then I would, and they would hire me. And that's how it's like, it's seemed logical to me because I would do that. Like I would hire that person if I was a company and they were like, hey, I will work for you for free. I'm good, I don't have a lot to show for it to prove that I'm good, but I have some enough for you to believe me. Let me work for you for free. It's like a few local magazines. I was like, I'll do your logo for free, give me a chance. I'm working on a portfolio. They're like, cool, they did it. And they're like, oh, I'm pretty good. Can you do this? Yes, but I need to be paid. And then it's like, okay. And then it just goes from there. And it's like, I think nowadays, of course, that climate has changed, probably not good to recommend people working for free because there's a lot of people online who'll just take you for everything. But you got to work, you got to be logical. That's the key thing with anything. You got to be as logical as possible or you're going to get taken advantage of. That's right. Yeah, you got to balance it out. Still, you got to follow that feeling, you know? And who knows? I don't know. Like I think my idea is irresponsible to say out loud sometimes, but I don't know if you feel dead in your job. I'll tell you, here's the thing. Top ramen, when you're doing what you're supposed to be doing tastes a lot better than a steak when you're in a life that you despise, you know? Especially with when you put an egg in it. Yes, people forget the egg. I didn't know about the egg until I started eating ramen out here. Very quickly, Edmund, if I could just ask, do you have any thoughts about virtual reality and the future of VR? If there is a future of VR, what it might be? I think we're a ways off, a long ways off. I don't think anything really that we have currently does much more than what a game would do, except it's stuck to your head. And it's one of those things where in order to really experience VR in any kind of compelling way, you need to be able to feel something, some sort of force feedback in some way, shape, or form. Anything else is kind of shitty. You've tried the Vive? Yeah, yeah. And I hate to say that too, because of course, like I don't want to be spitting in the face of the people who've given me these things, but it's a reality. It's just like, I honestly don't believe there's gonna be any compelling game design future in when it comes to games on your phone. I hate to hear you say that, only because I would love to see what you would make for that game. Like, do you have it off the top of your head? And this is probably a dumb question, but in a perfect world where we have force feedback from VR, and maybe VR 10 years from now, VR in an alternate universe, what kind of game would you make? Ah, man, I have some weird ideas for that, but there would be just really fucked up. It'd probably be, have you played The Witness? Ah, no, I haven't played that. You should, you dig it. Okay, cool. You can tell you already from getting to know you from us talking that you'd really like it a lot. Cool. I think you totally dig it. It's like a little mini religious experience. Like it's a... I can't wait. I'll download it. Going into the mind of Jonathan Blow. He's great. I could see VR being kind of like that, like a puzzle, an exploration puzzle experience. And I would try to explore that in some way. And the one thing that I think VR can do really well is scare the shit out of you and actually immerse you more in the world. So you could, I think, the horror genre in general could be pretty great, but it's one of those things where with art in general, when you're giving more of a basic guideline and you're giving limitations, you'd be surprised, as you probably know, of how inspiring that can be and how it's important to have these limitations. With VR, you're going into this 3D fucking... It's what we're experiencing now. Like it's no rules. So I think, theoretically, nothing great will come of it aside from something super into the future where you're really experiencing Westworld type shit, right? Well, I don't know. I mean, we disagree on that point, but I don't think, I mean, I think as far as games go, there isn't like, whereas like Binding of Isaac, I've spent, well, I don't know how long, there's no way, I don't know how long I've spent playing that game, a long time, a long time. Still not very good at it, but or me, boy, Christ, man, I'm so stuck right now. I'm so stuck, but I think, you know, as far as like applications for art, for building stuff, for communal experiences with other people, you know, that's where VR shines. But yeah, there isn't a VR game that I've spent a lot of time playing as compared to like World of Warcraft or you know, some of the other games out there. So I hear what you're saying, man. It's kind of like the, you know, the initial, we, that controller, it's like, Nintendo had their years with that controller and they're like, we're gonna make this game that incorporates all the best of what it can do. And that was Wii Sports. And that was the only fucking good thing that ever came out of that. That's right. And that's because Nintendo, you know, some of the greatest designers out there, they fully explored it. They had hoped that people could go further with it, but they did fully explore it. And that's it. And I hate to sound like a pessimist when it comes to the VR stuff, but when it comes to games, like actual game design, I feel like what you're seeing right now is the best of, it's the best. Like that's as good as it's gonna get until, until there's a big change to VR where you can actually feel your environment and explore it more. Brutal. But hey. But I've loved to be proven wrong, man. I mean, I loved, proved me wrong. So I can play some fucking great VR games. Have you played accounting? I've seen it. Okay, give it a shot. It's quick. If you play it in 30 minutes, it's funny. I think you know what you said about horror is also true for comedy with VR. For sure, for sure. You can make really funny games in there. But yeah, I hear what you're saying. Yeah, like games like Surgeon Simulator would be perfect for VR if it hasn't already happened. Or your lineup game. Cause you know, there's a game, cause that's the thing with VR. People don't realize it's a, it's a shared experience with a person and the goggles and someone in the room. Usually it's like a missionary thing where you, Yeah, I've seen, there's some interesting ones. I've seen like ones where you have to diffuse a bomb and somebody else has to describe it to you and, That's it. But your lineup one. But I mean, honestly, what you're, that's not VR. Like you're talking about an augmented reality experience. Like you're talking about an out of bounds, like you can, you can, you don't need VR to do that. You could literally have somebody in another room and have just have a DM type person that's orchestrating the rule set and have the other person, you know, giving information. It's more of like a real life game. It still doesn't, it's not, it's not utilizing what VR is. And maybe it's just that what VR is currently isn't enough to go beyond, I don't know, maybe there isn't even anything beyond that. I'm questioning the whole thing right now because, because what, because what are we going to do? Fucking play sports. You can play sports. Like, what are you going to do? I mean, all you can, I feel like the best things that can happen when it comes to VR in the future is scaring the shit out of somebody and making them laugh. That's great. The two things I want to do most in life. Oh, and trust me, you could scare the fucking shit out of people in VR with VR and that's great. Man, Edmund, you are awesome, man. It's so cool chatting with you. How can be, I mean, you have a fantastic blog, if you don't mind telling people where they can find you. Yeah, dude, those, they're your polls? That's all that's on there. It's like the dumb polls I did from ages ago that were for my own personal enjoyment. Brilliant. I had fun. I mean, that was a project in itself. I thought, hey, I'll have fun doing this little art project for a month and, you know, I'll like, I'll enjoy it. I'll get some information that'll, you know, give me a better idea of how the world works. A lot of helpful information in there. For sure, especially the butt wiping stuff. That one blew my mind. I had no idea people stood up to wipe. Wow. Oh, wow. Yeah, that's, you know, that is a thing. I think that's intro, God, this is such a stupid way to stop the podcast, but, you know, I think there's a lot of interesting things to cover when it comes to wiping your butt. And I think, you know, people don't realize that they're locked into a butt wiping cycle. You know, like the way you wipe your butt is like fascinating cause probably you've been doing it for decades and it's like passed on to you by your parents. The best way to loop this back around into a more meaningful conversation would be to say that that question in itself is exactly what I'm interested in exploring when it comes to art. It's the talking about the things that people don't talk about for whatever reason. I've always been interested in wondering why is it evil that I play Dungeons and Dragons? Why is this band wicked? You know, why is that pentagram so evil? Like what's in it? What's there? You know, I was the kid that would record myself saying, fuck, and then play it back and try to hear exactly where the power was coming from. What am I missing here? Why can't I be saying this word? You know, like the mystery and the stuff that's not said and wiping your ass is something that nobody fucking talks about for whatever reason, even though everybody does it and we all seem to do it totally differently. I think that's the most, that's super fucking interesting. Yes. And that's, that's me. I mean, that's what I'm about. That's what I'm most interested in exploring when it comes to art in general and just, you know, I guess society and how interesting those untold things are. And you are a master at it, Edmund, and I'm so glad that you- I'm far from a master, but I try my best. Hey man, how can people find you? I'm on Twitter, I guess. Edmund, what is this? What is it? I lost my Twitter a while ago. I'll have all the links. Is it Edmund McMillan? I don't know. Yeah, guys, all the links are gonna be in the comment section of this episode.

263^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - 475: Yan Zhu Transcript and Discussion^2021-11-20^We are family. A good time starts with a great wardrobe. Next stop, JCPenney. Family get-togethers to fancy occasions, wedding season two. We do it all in style. Dresses, suiting, and plenty of color to play with. Get fixed up with brands like Liz Claiborne, Worthington, Stafford, and Jay Farrar. Oh, and thereabouts for kids. Super cute and extra affordable. Check out the latest in-store, and we're never short on options at jcp.com. All dressed up everywhere to go. JCPenney. Good evening, and welcome to the Ducatrustle Family Hour podcast. Recently, you've probably heard about this, Commander Gethric's coal of the infernal legion accidentally shape-shifted into his demonic form at a cafe in Hollywood. One of the humans dining at the cafe went insane. And tore his eyeballs out before the dimensional guards could freeze time and wipe the memories of the humans dining at said cafe. A tragic event, and our hearts go out to the family of the human who had to be voided to avoid a detection. Was this an idiotic mistake? Yes, obviously. But does Commander Cole, a long-serving soldier in the Army of Chaos, deserve to have his wings plucked from his body at the throne of Amgor, the judge of time? Absolutely not. And yet, this is exactly what the so-called protectors of the Covenant want us to think is normal. Over the last decade, punishments given out by the adjudicator and his servants have grown increasingly severe. In fact, there have been 7,000 additional wing pluckings this last season, more wing pluckings than all the seasons combined. Many of us are asking, why? Some don't seem to want to admit what we all know. The adjudicator has entered his 300th season and has yet to shed his skin. He is entering his cycle of decay. This is normal. I wish him well. But at some point, we must invoke the pact of Hamlin and bring the adjudicator to the arena, where he can prove his power through the trials of the seven cauldrons. It's always been this way, nothing new, except for the fact that the adjudicator is trying to use his power to change the law, to avoid the trial of the seven cauldrons and, as a result, rule for another season. Maybe more. Why not six seasons or 10 seasons? Or you know what? Why not forever? When we return, we have an interview with Arch Cranston, Denivore Grinch, the Lord of Snakes, to find out what he thinks can be done to renew the covenant and invoke a new adjudicator, who can lead us to glory as we colonize this garden world. We'll be right back. This episode of the DTFH has been supported by the Angels of the Internet over at Squarespace.com. Squarespace has everything you need to get your online endeavor going. And I'm gonna offer you, my dear listeners, something incredibly special. Right now, the domain name, ciasanta.com is available. That's right, fuck Elf on the Shelf. The weird little snitch toy that you put on your shelf that watches your kids and reports back to Santa and tells them whether your kid has been naughty or nice. Ciasana is so much more powerful than Elf on the Shelf, because ciasana actually sends information in real time to the CIA. That's right, ciasana is a device that has within it a camera that literally films everything you and your family are doing and sends it to the CIA. So will Santa see it? No, Santa won't see it. Will the CIA see it? Yes, is Santa real? No, is the CIA real? Yes, and that means your kids are gonna behave better not because they want presence from some mythological creature, but because there's the very real risk that you or them could be arrested based on their behavior. Ciasana.com, it's available. You could buy it right now, just by going to Squarespace. You'll get 10% off that domain name and you can use the beautiful mix and match templates Squarespace offers to quickly create a website that no doubt will become immensely popular with parents trying to figure out a way to get their kids to behave.

You're going to love it, it's coming out and if you sign up for the DTFH Patreon, join our family, you can participate every Friday at our family gathering. After this anthology, we'll be writing another book. I feel certain of that. Also, if you're into meditation, you want a great group online to meditate with, we have a meditation group every Tuesday. It's our journey into boredom. And of course, if you sign up, you'll have access to our discord community as well as commercial free episodes of the DTFH that come out early. So I hope you will subscribe. It's patreon.com forward slash DTFH. Now, if you're a longtime fan of this podcast, then you probably listened to the conversation I had with Bill Day, the DJ, Mr. Bill. And we talked a little bit about how creepy it is that these massive tech companies are sort of in control of all of our privacy or emails and pretty much anything that you are doing when you have a phone with an app open on it. They track where you're going. Apparently they listen to some of the things you say. And he mentioned to me that his partner, Yanzu, is a digital privacy advocate. Right now she's the head of security over at this wonderful open source web browser called Brave, check it out. If you're looking for an ethical web browser that isn't selling your data to God knows who, that's where you need to go. Also, Yanzu got to interact with Chelsea Manning just prior to the leaks that I'm sure you all are aware of and the story about that is really fucking creepy and super cool. Also, Yanzu is a programmer. She's designed a lot of awesome apps that you can actually use in Ableton and she's a spectacular musician. You gotta listen to her tracks. All the links you need to find, Yanzu are gonna be at dougatrestle.com. But now everybody, please welcome to the DTFH, Yanzu. Yanzu, welcome to the DTFH. I'm very excited to talk to you. Thank you for being here. Thank you. Thank you for having me. I wanna talk to you just to start off, to have a chat about online privacy. And I think I'm something of a privacy nihilist in that I think a lot of us have just surrendered to this reality that some incredible AI algorithm is vacuuming up all of our data, our behavior patterns. And selling it, parsing it, using it to manipulate us. But I'm curious because this seems to be like one of the central aspects of your life. Why should we be worried about our online privacy? That is such a good question. And over the years, it seems more and more often people start to self-identify as a privacy nihilist and say, like, look, Google has all my location, they have all my emails, you know, there's nothing I can do about that if I want the convenience of being able to, you know, have my travel itinerary and my calendar automatically every time I book a flight, you know. And I think if people were actually privacy nihilists, like if I said, give me your phone unlocked and let me look through it, like they would all do it. But I've asked like 12 people this and none of them are ever willing to give me their phone unlocked, which means maybe they still have something to hide, you know, privacy is kind of the right, well, in my mind, it's the right to selectively choose what information you share with people and what you don't. I show people and organizations and corporations and all that. So yeah, so I think it's worth asking yourself, you know, if you're really a privacy nihilist, would you give me like pretty much a stranger to your phone unlocked, right? You know what, honestly, just cause I know Bill, I would give you my, I'd give you my phone unlocked. I don't know, like, yeah, go for it, you know, but not everybody, I wouldn't want everyone to have that. No, I wouldn't want everyone to have that. So that is a fantastic point. But we already did it, right? Isn't that the idea is like, well, it's too late. We already gave them our phone unlocked. Like they theoretically, all of the data, if we haven't been using some kind of VPN or being super careful or using all the things that folks like you recommend that we use, isn't it too late? Yeah, so that's kind of the other argument, right? That it's kind of a lost cause that if you've used Google or Apple or Facebook or these services, they've already been collecting all your data and there's nothing you can do about it. I think that's true to some extent, but I think it's important for people to still say, like, hey, look, we do care about privacy because otherwise there's gonna be no limit to how much data they're gonna collect and profile you. So I think my role in this world is kind of just being a voice in tech that says, like, yes, you know, there is some compromise where people have to give you your data for you to provide useful services, but can we limit that somehow? Can we put safeguards and regulations on how tech companies are allowed to use this data? For instance, there was recently a study that showed that there's all these apps that people have been downloading, which actually are selling their location data to advertisers and other third parties, right? So you might download some game and you just wanna play the game, but then, you know, you don't wanna be also, you know, so you have like kind of a trusted relationship with that app, but you're not expecting that app developer to sell your data to like 40 other companies, right? Yeah, I remember when they were saying with TikTok, it's collecting keystrokes when it's on. And I remember relaying that to folks I know use TikTok and they're like, yeah, whatever, it's so great, I just love TikTok, I don't care that it's collecting. And then that gets really interesting and that, you know, I think one of the assumptions folks have as well, what? The data's gonna get sold to Amazon or something, who gives a fuck, but it's like, this data could be sold globally, anywhere, like you don't know where it's gonna end up. Or the, you know, I remember one of these like deep fake apps that came out, you know, put your face on Bruce Willis or whatever, right? But the terms of service basically said, like we can use your picture anywhere that we want, you know, we now own your likeness and that was in the terms of service. So I get it, like a lot of these apps, it's like, it's not just that they're trying to sell us Vitamix or something, it's like they're taking something deeper. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about that, the possibility of some future golem, some future synthetic replicant based on the data that's been vacuumed being owned by a corporation. Is that just a paranoid fantasy that I have? Or is that a possibility? I think some lesser form of that fantasy already exists because a lot of companies are using AI and machine learning to train models based on the data we're providing. And then those systems are making automated decisions without humans in the loops. No, I don't know if you would call that a golem, but. Wait, you mean they're sort of like creating some, reflection of our online behavior patterns. And already like using that, like the thing is already in some neural network existing as a shadowy version of us, is that what you mean? Well, I think it's often a lot more innocuous sounding than that, for instance, if you use Netflix or Hulu, then those companies are using data about what you're watching and what you're interested in to build a model of use so they can recommend other things that you might want to watch. So if that's possible, then it would be pretty natural to say based on your online behavior, people can build more sophisticated models of what you're interested in and target ads for you based on that.

You know, have you heard the stories how they used to put cocaine and Coca-Cola? I have. And I've always thought, man, those are the good old days. That must have been incredible to be able to buy cocaine or opium over the counter. You know, when things were heroin, you could just get heroin from a pharmacist. I've never tried heroin, but I imagine that must have been nice too. But is that what we're experiencing right now? But with technology, are people gonna look back and be like, what were you thinking to allow these unregulated algorithms to manipulate your nervous system? That is an interesting question. I honestly don't think so. I think maybe I'm not a nihilist, but maybe I'm a pessimist with online privacy and data collection because I just, you know, I look at all the supposed benefits people are getting out of this data collection and they're pretty big, right? Like being able to, you know, what's a good example. I guess like even with online advertising, a lot of people say like, hey, I do get advertisements for products I actually buy and this is creating real value in my life. And I think we'll look back and say like, oh, all these advancements we've had in convenience was all thanks to this vast amount of data that we were willing to share with the algorithms. So yeah, I kind of don't see us regretting this in the future to be honest. Oh, that's sweet. That's pretty cool. That's an interesting take. You know, my feeling on it has been so like weirdly pessimistic, like hyper pessimistic and apocalyptic really, just this sense of like, my God, there's some kind of collecting scanning, the collective scanning that's happening, like we're being scanned by these self-created machines that are then, you know, tricking us. But that's nice to hear that you think this could lead to some like actual positive future because it seems like the storyline these days is like, holy shit, the AI is going to destroy us. It's, we're doomed. You don't vibe with that? Well, I think there's kind of two sides to this. One is kind of using AI in the sense of machine learning algorithms that learn more about us and what we like so they can give us useful features and more things that we like. And then there's this kind of amorphous fear of such an AI becoming more intelligent than us. And then using that power to like destroy humanity because it decides that our existence is not in line with its goals. And so, yeah, I have a lot of friends who are kind of more worried about that latter scenario, which, you know, might come about regardless of whether we keep using Netflix recommendation engines. As long as people keep working on artificial intelligence, but I don't know, to me, I feel like climate change and these more immediate threats are more compelling than this kind of apocalyptic robot feature. Okay, well, let me present an argument to that and please shoot it down. So, omnipresent climate change, we all know the story by now, everyone knows the story by now. This is happening simultaneously with some of the most hypnotic, I would argue paralytic technological advancements in human history. Like here we have this reality and then with it, I mean, I only, I resisted TikTok for a long time. And then finally I jumped in and was thrilling to realize, oh my God, this thing is like, it's noticing how long I'm peering at these videos. And then from that, finding better ones that I like and then dialing it in and dialing it in, the effect being very long, I've heard that it's like sometimes hours people spend just staring at the screen. So, you know, don't you think like the fact that we have these pressing issues that have met this incredible algorithm that as much as I would love to believe it's making people get out and like change their lives, it seems mostly it's just keeping us stuck staring at these machines. Yeah, that's kind of the, I think what you're referring to is often framed as like phone addiction or social media addiction, right? That these engines keep generating more content that you like and that like hit some button in your brain and you just keep wanting to spend time on these platforms. Yeah. Yeah, no, I think that's a real problem. I just, I'm not sure if like the, how that will feed into the bigger apocalyptic fear about an AI that's like super intelligent and eventually will control all of us. I think that's certainly possible in my mind, but I don't know. Yeah, I don't really have a good answer to how to address the problem of companies being incentivized to just get more and more of your attention. And so this is like a machine in itself that just keeps building things that are more addictive for us. Yeah. Yeah, that's pretty scary. It's scary, but I got lost in the stratosphere, my apologies. I would love just to, and again, I'm sorry if people ask you these questions all the time or if this just seems mundane or something, but I would love some real, like if I decided today to like reverse my privacy nihilism and start like protecting my like online behaviors and everything, what are some just pragmatic things that we can do? And not just with our phones, but like are there things that we need to be doing with our routers and like what would you advise if you could give just some like real simple, hopefully simple tips for us who have are completely like barebacking the internet? Well, so one, I guess I've just been thinking about phones and like location data a lot recently, but one big one I think is to kind of turn on that setting that and when you download new apps, that says like only let this app see my location when I'm using the app. Right. Because you know, if you download Yelp or something really, it doesn't need to know your location all the time. It don't really only needs to know when you're like looking up a restaurant in your area and that kind of limits the amount of data that app can collect on you. And then therefore limits the amount of data they can be selling to some random third party. And the reason why I think people should care about this is like, you know, let's say you're a gay person and some oppressive regime that doesn't like gay people, right? And you're using Tinder to find other gay people. And so you might not care that like Tinder knows that you're gay and you live in this country, but maybe that country's government could go to Tinder and say, hey, give us this person's location and identity and then you could be in some trouble. Wow. That is so creepy. I mean, theoretically, sorry. I guess the point, yeah, the point is like, you know, maybe you trust the person who made this app, but they could have relationships with other governments with other companies that aren't going to act in your best interest at all. And you don't know that because you probably haven't read their privacy policy and know who they're sharing data with. What, yeah, is there, where is the regulation here? Like why is it that they're allowed to have these like massive privacy policies or like terms of service that no one's gonna read? It seems like they should be forced to say upfront, if you use this app, we're gonna sell your movement, your data to Saudi Arabia. If you happen to go to any of these places, we will have no problem letting them know this is a gay person coming to your country. Why don't they say, it seems like it seems so obvious in the same way that, you know, they have to list the ingredients on food. Why aren't they being forced to be completely upfront about what's happening with your data? Honestly, I don't know why there seems to be so little regulation on like the complexity of language and privacy policies in terms of service. I'd guess that, you know, companies would argue, hey, our policy is just really complicated because it has to be and we don't know if we're gonna get acquired by some other company and then have to give them our data, et cetera. But there was a project at an organization I used to work at called the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which basically took companies terms of service and tried to like dumb them down. So like, you know, a five-year-old or a 10-year-old could understand them. I don't know if they're still doing that, but that is a good question, right? Like if these terms of service were actually so easy that like anyone could understand them when people actually read them and make different decisions based on that. I mean, it seems kind of clear the reason that they're complex is because if people understood just what you just said, if people even thought about that, there would be a real hesitation when it came to using these apps. I've, you know, one of the terrifying possibilities that I heard is like, and also don't forget, regimes change all the time. Like the way, I mean, we just saw it. We just saw it. It can happen just like that where suddenly, oh, this isn't a democracy anymore. Oh, that's over. And then the new state, whatever it may be, could theoretically force companies to give them all of this data and they can use it for whatever they want, including arresting people based on the new laws that they've created via whatever coup has just happened. So that's the other creepy possibility when it comes to our data sitting out there, which leads me to a big question I have for you. Is there any hope in eradicating our footprint online? The current thumbprint that exists, is there any talk or hope of being able, if we wanted to, to completely obliviate all that stuff sitting out there? That's a, I don't think there is any way to completely obliterate it, but there is a regulation in the EU called GDPR that allows people to request that companies delete any personal data that they have on someone. And so, so I work at a browser company called Brave, Brave.com, and we, since this regulation went into place, we've actually gotten dozens of requests from individuals saying, hey, please delete all the data you have on me. And so people are actually making use of this law now. And I think there's some services where you can put in your email and they'll just automatically contact the privacy person at a bunch of companies and say, hey, I reside in the EU and under this law, you have to delete all my data. I'm not sure if it applies to people on other jurisdictions. I think there's a similar law for Californians now, so. Whoa, really? Wow. Yeah, so I mean, it is within the power of state and federal governments to say like, hey companies, you have to have a process in place for deleting all personal data for people under these jurisdictions. And that could actually work in practice. When did you get into this? Like, when did you start on this very strange path? Because, I mean, you truly are in the front lines of what I, and again, I'm sorry, I'm a weirdo, but I think of it as magic. But just because, what's that quote everybody use, any sufficiently advanced technologies indistinguishable from magic, which for me, having no idea how most of this stuff works makes it all pretty magical. But when did you start learning about this? I mean, and maybe I should have asked, I had a question before that. Do you consider yourself a hacker? I consider myself a hacker in kind of the old school sense of the charm of someone who just likes to figure out how things work and figure out ways to circumvent rules built into technology. Not the person with like the bank robber mask who's like on their computer trying to hack into the banks. Right, but I mean, surely that is a quality of the hacker. Even the old school hacker, the power of what's a captain crunch, the captain crunch whistle, you know? The whistle, yeah, yeah, the 2600 hertz. Yeah, so when did you realize this about yourself? Like when did you realize, oh shit, I'm a hacker? That's a great question. So I did not go to school to do anything related to computers. I went to school for physics and that was kind of my first interest. And then when I got to grad school, I quickly realized like, I don't really want to work for the rest of my life in this field where, you know, you kind of are uncovering some great mysteries of the universe, but it really has not that much effect on people's day to day lives. It's kind of just this like abstraction or this kind of curiosity that I'm working on. So I took a leave from grad school and started volunteering at this organization called TOR which builds a network. I guess you can describe it as like a network of computers that you can pass your computer's traffic through to keep your IPO address anonymous. TOR, yeah, the deep web. The deep web, the dark web, yeah. That's what most people know it for. The Silk Road, the place where people try to buy drugs and assassins and all that. But I would say actually the moment that I realized I cared about online privacy was in my last year of college when I was living in this like crazy hippie co-op at MIT and we always had people coming in and out and like staying with us. And one day someone brought their friend who most people now know as Chelsea Manning. Yeah, so she later became this like famous whistleblower who like leaked to WikiLeaks this video of the U.S. Army doing, I don't know what you call it, like an airstrike where they were killing a bunch of civilians. It's murdering people. Yeah, yeah, and it caused a lot of outrage at the time. I think 2010, but when she came to visit our house, she was completely unknown. I just knew her as my friend's friend who's in the Army and kind of had this like haunted look about the things that she'd seen in the Army. And so yeah, so I chatted with her for a bit during that visit and I was like, wow, you just come from a completely different world than me, right? Like I'm some college kid just studying physics and you've been in the Army and you've seen these like horrific war crimes. And that kind of stuck with me. But I guess the interesting part is that when she did, a few months later after that, after I met her, she leaked that video to WikiLeaks and it was all over the news. I think it was like the front page of Wired and the New York Times and her identity became known. There was a lot of government interest in her and who she was. And my friends and I became like really paranoid because there was this like black van parked outside our house and we thought it was like the FBI or something who was following us. To this day, I don't know if this actually was what it was, but suddenly we were all like, oh, we should like encrypt our emails because we were in contact with her and they're like, do you have these investigations into her and we don't want to be followed? Yeah, and so that's when I learned to like kind of encrypt my email to kind of like care about privacy. It was when I thought there was like, you know, some government agency that was like really interested in me. Whether they were or not, yeah. What a disaster because it's like the narrative for every paranoid schizophrenic is that there's a black van watching you. And so like when it really happens, I think, and I think the people who do this sort of observation are fully aware of the psychological component in being observed, which is why they do it the black van. It's like, they could do any van. They could have a UPS or didn't have to be a van. I'm sure they could have a couple of cars or whatever, you know, but they do the black van because they want to fuck with your mind a little bit. They want you to like wonder and feel crazy and they want to demonstrate to you their power and show you that it's like, yeah, you don't really have any control of anything. Like we're watching you now. That's terrifying. I would have, that must have been so frightening to realize that you had been interacting with someone who for a little while, at least from the state's propaganda mechanism, became public enemy number one. Yeah, I think at the time I was like so young and like naive in these things that I didn't even real, like it didn't even scare me that much. I was just like, wow, this is kind of exciting, like a spy movie, like what's going to happen now. And then definitely at the time I was like, well, you know, I have nothing to hide except that. I did talk to this person and I did have contact with her. I think like people were, the main reason we thought the government was interested in us particularly as like MIT students was that she had visited some of us and they were wondering if she had given us like material that she was trying to leak or if like we in some way were like helping her disseminate this stuff. And so like I, to be honest, wasn't like, I didn't have anything, but my friends were really paranoid and were like, oh, we don't want people looking through all our computers and just poking around in our business. Yeah, and because I mean, even though I'm sure you wouldn't say it out loud, I mean, like if anyone there was helping, if someone was probably helped, I mean, it's an MIT commune with of hackers with somebody who's got like valuable information regarding like a horror war crime. So anybody with chances are someone there is going to help. this podcast is sponsored by better help.

This is what's so scary about hackers. This is why people like me are kind of terrified of hackers because this idea that y'all like, you know everything, like you have the ability to like find out all the stuff. I mean, how far away from the truth is that? Honestly, I feel like that's pretty far, right? Like if you're worried about that with random hackers, like how worried are you with like some random employee of Facebook or Google who decides they wanna look at all your email or all your messages? Worried, I mean, cause to me it's that very human reality, which is somewhere in these companies, more than likely there's at least one person who's just bored and who just, you know, has some spare time and a back door into this, whatever it may be, people's phones, people's messages, whatever it may be, and just decides to start going in there. I mean, how possible is it that somebody at Apple or Google or Facebook or any of these mega companies has the ability to do that? Honestly, it's very hard for an outsider like us to tell. I've never worked at Facebook or Google, but I've heard from people who work there that they have some kind of safeguards against employees accessing data. Like maybe they'd have to go through layers of management and get people to sign off on it, but who knows how well that works in practice or if it was some way a random employee could bypass it. Like from my perspective, if a company is collecting data on you, then it's safest to assume their employees can't see that data if they really are motivated to for whatever reason. Right, right. And this creates a kind of shadowy power imbalance, doesn't it? Like in the sense that if what you're saying is true, which it must be, I mean, I want to believe that there are like intense walls of encryption, but I don't, I just don't, I just knowing humanity and knowing curiosity and knowing the basic drive to power that you would, it would be more shocking that there was a true system of ethics within these companies preventing people there from looking into other people's private data than that this stuff was constantly being siphoned and potentially being, you know, anytime they start talking about breaking up Google, breaking up Facebook, anytime the government starts talking about that, I always think, really? Because I bet they know stuff about you. I bet they've got information on people who can make the decision about breaking up the company and they could use that to manipulate the government, meaning that in some weird way, there's like a kind of secret tech government that could theoretically be pulling strings right now. Please stop me if I'm just being too paranoid, but just do, you know, thinking of human nature. This is what sometimes when I'm having dark fantasies about the way the world works, this is one of them. Yeah, no, this is great because what sounds like what you're doing is kind of thinking of worst case scenarios and from kind of the privacy, paranoid advocates perspective, that's like what I do all the time is saying, like, hey, if they have this data, like what's the worst that can happen? For example, Brave and a lot of other companies actually use Google for a company email just because it's like the most convenient service. Yeah. And so like, you know, if you're a competitor to Google, you always kind of have this like worry in the back of your mind that Google can see your emails. They could be using this information to, you know, like see what products they're about to launch and just, you know, launch them themselves or do something to throw a wrench in your plan. Yeah. Yeah, there's actually an antitrust case against Google right now going on. I forget how it was brought up, but basically the government's like collecting a bunch of information to make the case that Google might have kind of a monopoly. And it's a lot of it's really interesting because I think one example they gave is that, so Google's essentially an advertising company, right? They sell ads, you see ads on search as a result and they found that they basically gave preferential treatment to Facebook ads. So for most advertisers, when they're trying to serve an ad, they have a timeout of like 300 milliseconds or something before they can serve that ad, but Google gave Facebook a double that. They gave them a 600 millisecond timeout. So Facebook just had like twice the window of opportunity to show you an ad. Yeah, and so they can make arbitrary rules like this and it's not clear if like, you know, it's not obvious to other people. Like certainly other advertisers weren't given the same opportunity and that wasn't fair to them. But who knows why Google chose to have this special relationship with Facebook. It's all kind of shadowy to us. It's scary. It's so scary. You don't want to piss off Google, by the way. I mean, that's the other thing. It's like, I don't want, I would hate to imagine Google just decided, I don't like, I don't like that podcast or whatever it may be. It's just so much, it's so much power. And I remember when, you know, I don't, I bet you do recall, remember when they were trying to get Apple to get into people's iPhones? Like, do you remember that? This was the San Bernardino, like terrorist iPhone, their shooter iPhone, yeah. Yes, and Apple, you know, I think was, where they were very like, they were amazing and that they resisted and they said, listen, if we start doing this, we have to, we'll never stop doing it. Every law enforcement agency, not just in this country, but around the world is going to be asking us to open up people's iPhones. We're not going to do it. We're never going to do it. But their lawyer, this, and again, Stoner, especially at that time, I was eating a lot of them, but their lawyer said something along the lines of like, to me, seemed like a threat, which is like, look, what if all of a sudden Apple just started coming out, saying that the CIA was responsible for the assassination of JFK. And then almost after he said that, immediately they just left Apple alone. And I kept thinking like, was that like, because Apple has some shit that they just are hanging onto, secret stuff that like, they're like, look, you want to like force us to open up our phones? Okay, but we're going to start leaking all the information we have on you. And so back off. Oh, I just was wondering, was that what that was? And why? Oh. You know, like, so to me, like, it seems like these tech companies are becoming like many nations or something, you know? And their entire arsenal is not military, is not weaponry, but data that they have on people in high positions of power. And it seems to me that you're not refuting that or that that isn't necessarily my own pair and why. Yeah, I don't know. I guess I have never been like close enough to the upper echelon of these massive tech companies to know whether there's like some kind of relationship with the government where they're like saying, hey, if you don't do this, we'll keep this data private. And like they're making bargains with each other. Certainly it couldn't be, I guess, but you know, in the first place, Apple employees should not be looking at people's personal data. So like, if that were happening, that would be kind of seems like a big violation on the part of the tech company. Well, you know, what's the alchemical maxim as above so below? And God knows, in human society, people look at each other's phones when they're jealous or worried or they think people are cheating on them, they go into their phones. And if that happens in families, it definitely is, it's probably happening in tech. But you know, you're at the forefront of security at Brave. I mean, could you do that if you wanted to? Is it even possible if you wanted to like start snooping into someone's data who's using that browser? Could you? Honestly, no, because one of the principles that we have at Brave is we just don't collect the data if we don't need it. So like really, for the vast majority of users, we don't have any data on them. Like we don't have their email addresses, we don't have their contact information. So like if I tried to look really hard, I could maybe, I could see like a bunch of IP addresses because there's various servers where we're getting IP addresses, but that's not usually like traceable to an individual. And we don't really have any like other interesting data that's associated with the IP. But how do you make money over there without the data? Like what's the monetization route? That's a great question. So we kind of, we're kind of in the mindset that people, you know, if they want to give us data, well, maybe I should just give the straight forward answer, which is that Brave has an often privacy preserving ads platform. And so what that means is that we let advertisers show ads to users who opt into them, but these ads don't leak any data about people. So they're kind of like non... So I say privacy preserving because the way we actually decide which ads to show users is not in the traditional way, which is where an advertiser kind of collects all this information about like what websites are visiting and kind of built a profile of you. And then based on that decides like, hey, you're interested in buying shoes or you're interested in buying a car and then shows you those ads. And so what happens is that on your own device, and it's important to note this data never leaves your own device. The browser itself sees what your browsing history is. And then based on that, just picks an ad out of a big catalog of ads to show you. And so as a result, the advertiser doesn't learn this information about you because that information is just kept on your device, but you still see like a relevant advertisement, hopefully. That's cool. That's beautiful. That's so futuristic. That is like, that's the path forward. I mean, that's what it's going, that's clearly anyone with a brain is going to choose that over the other thing that they're doing. But how much money do you think? Like theoretically, if you had to guess, how much money are you losing doing that? That is, I don't have a specific answer for you on that because I don't work on that side of Brave as much, but I will say, yes, like this is a new model and a kind of a challenge we have is convincing advertisers that this works as well as their traditional method of siphoning everyone's data, building these online profiles. And so we have to prove to them that building these local profiles where the data doesn't just get shared with them, works as well and will lead to people still buying their shoes or cars or whatever. So yeah, it's still kind of in its early stages and we're still kind of just trying to show people this works and you should switch to showing people ads in this more private way. Look, isn't that so crazy? Like truly, it's like there's just more money and like being unethical, it seems like. And that's why companies like Brave and it's in the EFF and it's like, they're amazing. That's what I love about the like old school hacker ideology. There is this kind of mystical punk rock ethic to the thing where free software, what's that song? Do you know the song I'm talking about? The hacker song? Oh my God, I'll send it to you. It'll give you goosebumps. I'll send it to you. It's very lo-fi. Maybe I'll play it at the end of this. But it's just a whole song about how keep the software free. The software should be free, keep everything free. And this seems to be what Brave is mirroring that a little bit. But you should also make some money. My God, I mean, what are you gonna do? We live in capitalism. Yeah, I mean, that's the thing. Like a surprising number of people don't seem to understand is like, yes, we do wanna be ideological purists and give out free software and not make any compromises. But at the end of the day, I've seen so many free open source projects just basically get abandoned because they couldn't make enough money to sustain themselves. So at some point you have to say, like, hey, we have to come up with some way to like make money and sustain our business, but also not compromise like this core set of values which are like basically untouchable. And so, yeah, I think it's tough. I definitely see a lot of projects which are basically like the backbone of the internet that everyone relies on and the people running them are just like one or two people randomly who do it in their spare time and never really try to monetize it. That kind of scares me. Yeah, well, right, yeah, right? Because like you gotta eat. And, but is it do you with, you know, like everyone now is like obsessed with NFTs and with crypto and like, and what are your thoughts on that as a monetization as an avenue of monetization for these people, you know, as some kind of like monetization engine that transcends the current mechanisms people are using to make a buck or do you think it's just a nightmare? I have a lot of thoughts about NFTs actually. Let's hear them. Well, so I think like, well, I think not speaking about NFTs, but I think crypto speaking about cryptocurrency more generally, I'm kind of a pragmatist in the sense that I think if, you know, people who really need the money and are trying to do good things with it are able to use the hype around these new currencies and investments in order to support themselves or support their businesses. I think that's a good thing, right? Like in some ways a lot of projects have been using cryptocurrencies kind of as like a replacement for Kickstarter where instead of just asking people like donate some money to our projects so we can build a thing, they say, hey, buy our coins so we can build the thing. And then when the coin goes up, those people also get rewarded. So I don't think that's like inherently a bad model for funding software. I think where it gets really tricky is just the fact that these currencies have been, you know, such attractive investments to a lot of people who don't necessarily have like the best ethics. And so I personally think a lot of NFTs are used for money laundering where, you know, basically someone says, I have this cryptocurrency which is from a ransomware attack but I want to cash it out without showing that it was, you know, stolen from a ransomware attack. So the way I'll do that is I'll make an NFT, like sell it to myself and then I get my money back but now it looks clean, you know. Holy shit, that's crazy. You can do that? Yeah, I think that's why you see all these sides with like all these crappy artwork that's being sold for a large amount. I think someone's just making bad artwork and selling it to themselves to like clean up their, you know, dirty money or whatever you want to call it. My God, that's the most grim thing I've ever, that's so sad, that's so weird, that's so sad. Wow, wow, that's amazingly weird. I don't know how I missed the boat on just that obvious aspect of it. I've always thought, oh my God, that's incredible. Like anytime like monetization becomes possible for artists, I just think it's incredible, you know, cause so many, so many like musical artists are really just getting screwed and like a way for them to like get more profit from what they're making or just a normal amount of profit that's currently it's being cut up in a million different pieces and given to whatever the particular server that is showing their music to people, it seems great, but yeah, is there a way to fix that? Part of it, is there a way to make it so that it really is benefiting artists and not just being used to launder ransomware money? Well, so first of all, I'm really sympathetic to the kind of the sentiment that creators and artists need better ways to monetize cause yeah, and music piracy is a huge thing. And like from streaming, I think someone calculated that if a single person listened to a single artist song on Spotify nonstop for a year, that artist would only make like $23 from those streams. It's crazy. Such a small amount, right? But I don't think NFTs are the answer because there's, I feel like they've just been polluted by like the money launderers and the people who are trying to use them for like pump and dumps where they try to convince a lot of people that some art's worth a lot of money, but really they're just trying to like make their, make a bunch of money off of it. I really like in the NFT space, I don't think much of it is really about the artists themselves, but rather it's about like, how can we make the most money and make our money look legitimate as fast as possible? I get approached every once in a while with a good pump and dump. Like someone's got some coin that they want me to talk about and then for, and they make it seem so appealing. And for a second, I'm like, my God, what an incredible chance. And then you realize like, oh, that's one of those things they're talking about. Speaking of music, by the way, wow, SoundCloud.com, Ford slash Azuki. That's you, your music is so good. I mean, I didn't know if we start talking about your music or start talking about your technological work, but wow, like, wow. And also on top of that, you're making your own VST, you're making filters for the, you're just making music software? You make that sound so much more impressive than actually. Oh, okay, okay. It's impressive. Give me a break. As I'm like researching you and going deeper and deeper into this crazy rabbit, it's like, oh, and also you're making like digital synths? Holy shit. Let's talk about it. Well, so I think the thing most people know me for in the music software space is basically a plugin. It's both available as a VST and a Max for Live device, which is only usable in Ableton, but basically it takes this existing piece of software called Spleter that was developed at the company Deezer for splitting a song into stems and kind of packages it in a way that more producers can just use it in their DAWs. So I mean, I think that's kind of a passion of mine is just taking research projects that companies have made where it's really cool technology, but it's not packaged in a way where like normal people can use it and just making it more usable. So I don't know, I don't, I feel like I don't really do any of the hard work on that one. Okay, well, let me, can I run some ideas by you that I would like you to do? Yeah, please do. Are you familiar with UberDuck? No, what's up? UberDuck uses deep, is it just, you can type in sentences and get famous people to say it. It's like deep, fake audio. And oh, it's glorious. It's amazing. Some of them aren't, I mean, it just depends on how much time somebody spent on the particular voice. Some of them are really great. Some of them are low grade, whatever it is. It's an incredible technology, weirdly anonymous. You go to UberDuck, I can't remember the exact website. It's, let me see here. Google, I'm on Google, I'm sorry. UberDuck, I'm not used to it. I will switch though. I will switch to UberDuck, okay. Yeah, uberduck.ai. And it's really amazing, but my God, I just keep, I have this dream of being able to interview these people. You know what I mean? Like somehow connecting UberDuck to, what's the new AI that Elon Musk was so freaked out about? You know what I'm talking about? Like Elon Musk mentioned it. It's a new AI engine, philosophy bot. You know that philosophy bot? No, I've never heard of it. Okay, philosophy bot, let me see if I can find it. Uses this like, yeah, philosopher AI. It uses GPT-3, have you heard of that? Oh yeah, I do know about GPT-3. Yeah, so you can ask it a question and it instantly produces a convincing response that is just from an AI. So anyway, will you please combine UberDuck with that software so that we can interview famous people for our podcasts without having to act? So you wanna like basically interview Kanye West or someone and have it be like their voice, but speaking like a completely, the GPT-3 generator text, got it. Yes. What do you think? How hard would that be? Yeah, that doesn't seem too hard, but do you think they could like sue you for doing that? I don't know what the like legal question is. Yes, I think they could sue you for doing it. I do, but I don't think they could sue you for combining the technologies so that if we wanted to do that, because then it opens up all this other stuff, which is, I mean, like, you know, like the ability to call these people and just have conversations with them or the, you know, and again, someone's gonna do it. You might not be the person, but someone's gonna do it. And to me, it's one of the pathways to this kind of like fame diffusion. You know what I mean? Like I think we're in the last days of fame. You know what I mean? Like AI is going to obliterate, it's gonna dilute. Like the meat body Kanye West becomes almost insignificant when there's five billion AI Kanye West that anyone can communicate with at any time, you know? Yeah, I wonder, this actually, I just had a thought, which is it would be really cool to have something like this for famous singers like Adele or Beyonce, where you could just write like a melody and some lyrics and just have them sing it and use that in your song. Like I think people would find that super useful. Yes, incredibly useful. Or just as a podcaster to have my own AI version so that if I like lose my voice, I could type in what I wanna say and it would say it, things like that. Or I mean, aside from all the silly stuff, people who maybe lose the ability to talk, you know, I think, you know, or the other for grief counseling, you know, like the ability to communicate with people who've passed away by creating an algorithm for their voice. Yeah, well, to do that, it seems like you'd also need like a big set of basically a large body of texts that they've written or said in the past so the AI can kind of learn like what they're likely to say. I think there was actually a Black Mirror episode about this where, you know, someone dies, but you feed them like a recording of them or like basically all the texts that they've ever sent and then they make a bot that kind of can reply in the same way this person would reply to you. Yes, yeah. I mean, this is the, one of the creepiest things I ever heard about these neural networks is they don't know what they're doing. Like inside the neural network and some of these layers, they're like doing things that people just can't figure out what's happening. And do you get much into simulation theory? I used to be a big fan of the theory that we all are just living in like a simulation of like a single brain that's in the universe. It's called like the Boltzmann brain theory. Okay, thank God. I winced when I asked you the question because I felt like it's such a mundane, boring question, but can you explain what the Boltzmann brain is to some folks listening? Cause they might not have heard of it. Yeah, oh man, this is, I think if you've like studied thermodynamics, this becomes like really compelling, but basically the theory is that, you know, the universe is really complex. And because in thermodynamics, it's very difficult for like complex organized systems to just arise out of nowhere. It is actually more like statistically likely that the universe we live in is a simulation of like a single brain like in an empty universe than the possibility that all of this complexity that we observe actually exists. So essentially like what we're living in is like a dream of like a single brain rather than a reality. Yes, and so that the weirdly the Boltzmann brain completely mimics like a lot of mystical traditions that say that we're the thought process of God and that we're what happens when God's thinking. What's the difference between the Boltzmann brain and God? Isn't that God's brain? No, yeah, maybe it's like God, but without the whole religious connotation of like, you know, Jesus lived and did all of that. But yeah, I guess in some sense, it's like a, it's God in the sense that it's like omniscient and is the creator of everything. Yes, right. And then within that, we have this realm that we're in a synthetic reality where a thought form of this kind of Boltzmann brain. But this is, do you ever think to yourself like, oh yeah, I'm in a neural network. I'm part of some processing unit that is using like even this conversation and all the conversations you've ever had to try to reach some, I don't know, some form of data output, some resolution to a question. You ever, do you ever wonder that? Yeah, I do. But at the same time, I'm like cognizant that this isn't a testable hypothesis. So it's something where, you know, we can speculate on it, but we can't ever know if this is really what's happening because there's no experiment we can construct where, you know, we decide if we're living in a perfect simulation or if we're living in this actual reality that we observe. Well, but there could be like, maybe not an experiment to truly test it, but couldn't there be some like mechanism of hacking it? Like couldn't theoretically there be like some, as like something that we would consider to be like, oh my God, it's like the next, you know, industrial revolution, but it's really like some form of hacking into this thing to gain access to higher processing power or something. Yeah, if it's like a leaky simulation or some simulation with some way of like escaping it and detecting what's outside it, that would be interesting. How do we hack it? I don't know, I think it depends on if like the laws of the simulation that we're living in like allow us to somehow see what's outside it. I don't know how we would figure that out. By doing it, I mean, you would just have to figure, you would just have to, my theory would be, well, one hypothesis I would, if it's a closed system that's designed to like keep you from hacking outside of it, then I would imagine anyone who came very close to hacking outside of the system would be like would die or would just, you know, would be eradicated or something or would, you know, go insane or something like that. But it seems to me like the thing follows some kind of, again, I don't know what it is, but don't you think it follows like some pretty obvious like video game logic? You know, like in a video game, it's inevitable that you think you only are able to do this one sort of, maybe you just don't realize, like the thrilling part of the video game is suddenly, you take flight, you're like, holy shit, now you can fly in this video game. So if the simulation is an entertainment mechanism, then, you know, part of the game might be the intent to hack it to escape, which just leads you to another level of the game. Yeah, maybe there's a, yeah, I could see this, you know, becoming more of a thought in my head if, for instance, we notice like, some stuff that couldn't be explained by science, like, you know, people spontaneously disappearing or something, it would be like, oh, that's like some kind of glitch, you know, we should look into that. Yeah, a glitch. Sometimes it feels like it's glitching out. Well, I, you know, I just want to talk a little bit about your music. Do you have a few more minutes? Yeah, of course. When did you get into mute? Like, when did you start recording music? Oh, so I actually was, so in middle school, I started playing the flute. And then shortly after that, I discovered I was much more interested in like composing music. So I kind of became this like child composer when I was in middle and high school. And I started really being interested in like writing music for like jazz bands and wind symphonies and all that. And that kind of like stopped when I went to college because I decided like a lot of people that I should just, you know, pursue a career that's more fruitful more likely because I, yeah, like I think even that I was super realistic that like the field which I was really interested in, which was film scoring was just ultra competitive and extremely difficult to get into. So yeah, and then after that, around maybe like five years ago, I started messing around and Ableton and kind of just discovered the world of electronic music and thought that was really interesting. I'm still not an expert by any means in that and I'm still learning and it's kind of like messing around with Ableton. I still don't feel like totally comfortable with it. How could you? It's the most insane thing I've ever, what is the craziest software of all time? Are you making your own beats? Who's, what's your process when you're making beats? I, it's been a while to be honest. I kind of like stopped making music at the start of the pandemic because I just lost motivation like so many people. I was like, oh, there's no shows happening. Like what's the point in doing this, you know? But yeah, I do work a lot. So I find I'm actually most inspired by like vocals. So if I can find someone who has like a vocal melody that they're singing that they wanna like give me or someone who has like a rap that they wanna put a beat under that's like more fun for me to work with. Oh, I see. So you don't start with a beat first. You start with some inspiration and then figure out the beat from there. Yeah, that's usually more of my process. Cause whenever I try to make a beat, it's like, I feel like if there are invisible guardian angels watching us, they're cringing at the horrific beats. I can't do it. Like what do you do? How do you do this? I don't understand it. These, your bill or you or any of these people, any like, how do you do it? Is it, am I just missing some fundamental component of my soul or something? When I sit down at the push two and try to make a beat, it either comes out the same as all my other beats or it just, it sucks. Yeah, honestly, I kind of had the same process for a while. I think early in my like electronic music exploration, I was using a Launchpad controller. And I was like, cause I'd seen videos of people like making quote unquote beats and they were all just like playing them live. And so I was kind of like limited by my personal like rhythmic abilities to like play something on like a physical instrument. And then I think when I started looking up like the way Bill and other people were working, I was like, oh, they just open Ableton and like click in the midi track. They're not like actually playing these things. And then so then I was like, okay, your limit. Like there's no longer limitation. You could just click on whatever, you know, in the grid. I know you click in the grid. That's great. I click in the grid, it still sounds like shit. Maybe it's just hopeless. I don't know. I'll just give up on that part of my music creation. But God is, I can't believe you stop making music. Your music is so good. I really hope that you resume this practice because it's really beautiful. Thank you. I appreciate that. I think, yeah, there's a lot of factors in that and my like kind of demotivation. One is like being around Bill more and just seeing like the music industry and just being like, oh, there's so much of this that I don't want to like immerse myself in because it's ultra competitive. You have to do a lot of self marketing to be successful, it seems. And there's a lot, you know, in that that's not just sitting around at your computer like doing creative work that you actually want to do. And also shows, I think I like don't actually like being at shows or playing shows because I used to DJ a lot more often. And is that just because of like the possibility of getting a disease at the shows? Well, that is part of it now. But I think also just having to like stand up in front of a lot of people and act excited about something. You know, it's a lot of pressure because like that's a lot of DJing, I think, is just like the kind of performance aspect of like standing there in front of people trying to be excited so that they're excited. And I'm just not good at like faking excitement for not actually excited. You know what, this is something I've been going back and forth on myself. I just interviewed a comedy writer, Martin Olson and his, we were talking just about how like, well, yeah, I mean, you've got to be a con artist if you want to be an artist. Like you have to like overcome that part of yourself that wants to emote what you're authentically feeling. You have to like find a way to like actually do the thing that so many people say, that's like dishonest or terrible, which is to, you know, exhibit like some kind of exuberance that might not even be there. But I've noticed when I do that, the exuberance might just show up from the crowd, you know? Like it's possible to generate it in real time with even if you feel complete. I mean, Jesus, I know so many comedians who are like in the midst of like a 10 year depression. And they go on stage and like are able to like completely tune into like some energy that maybe isn't exactly the energy of, you know, be having an endogenous depression or something like that. Wow, yeah, that's so amazing. And it definitely seems like comedy is one of the more difficult stage performance types, right? Cause you kind of have to like react to the audience so much and like, do you find yourself like, I don't know anything about stand-up comedy, but do you find yourself having to like respond a lot to the audience and kind of just like see what their energy is and keep adapting according to that? Yeah, I think that's one of the, I mean, there's so many different ways to do it. That's one of the ways, that's one of the like, you know, you do hear this stuff about, oh, comedians, they always come from like fucked up childhoods. And one of the explanations for that is not the fucked up childhood made you funny, but the fucked up childhood forced you to attune yourself to the moods of whatever chaos bubble you were in. So you became hyper-tuned to if mom is angry, your dad's angry, your brother's angry, or what's happening in the room with your like, you know, drunk, abusive, whoever, so that you could survive. And so that like, finally tuned to an environment thing that sometimes gets translated into like, well, I'm an empath. And it's like, well, you're someone who like, as a kid learned how to instantaneously adapt to shifts in energy so you wouldn't get beaten. Oh, that's so interesting. So like, then so comedians have just, some comedians, not all, I do think we have to try to let go of this like sick artist paradigm because I think it makes people sick because they so want to be an artist. You don't have to do that. But I do think, you know, and comedians and probably some DJs and stuff like do that naturally just because they like had to survive with it, you know? So yeah, I think that's part of comedy. It's part of music too, I guess. I mean, like we have to do in real time with our shitty neural network, what the algorithm is doing, you know, it's like weirdly similar, you know, that the algorithms mirroring our behavior online back to us in a kind of manipulative way. It's strangely like a performance that some AI is doing for us, I guess. Yeah, that to me just, it all sounds so difficult. And I've learned about myself through the pandemic that I really prefer work that doesn't have any like real time component to it. So like software engineering, right? Like, or even writing, you know, you can just kind of hone in on what you want to say or do and you don't have to like keep taking inputs from the external world and adapting to it. And you can kind of just like take your time getting things to how you want it to be. Here's my last question for you. Thank you for being so generous with your time. Of course. If you were given an infinite, infinite money, what software would you design? Oh, that is such a good question. Might have to think about that for a minute cause like you never think about like, what if you had infinite money? Cause it's just not like a realistic situation. Yeah, and also if you just like want to spit ball, it's totally cool. It's not like, you know, whenever we're thinking about things, when you're thinking about making stuff, like making a sketch or something, we always start with infinite money. Like what if we had Steven Spielberg money and what would it look like at that level? And then from that, you can kind of reduce it down to like whatever you have around you. But I just would love to hear what you would create if you had unlimited resources when it came to technology. I think in terms of impact, like if I had infinite money, I could buy up every other tech company, right? I could like buy Google, Facebook, Apple, et cetera. And then I could just like run those companies in whatever way that I thought was like best for humanity. For instance, I could say like Google, stop all third party tracking and make sure like people, you know, have like consent to share whatever data they want. Like you can basically go through these companies, like identify whatever like ethical or privacy issues that you think exists there and just fix them, right? Cause you're like, I have the resources to do that. That might be the most effective thing to do actually. What else would be cool? I don't know. I guess like maybe cut some kind of alternative to Facebook where it's not so addictive and it's actually helping people connect in some meaningful way rather than just make themselves feel bad. Cause like I have heard through the pandemic with like people not being able to have in person events that it's been more useful for them to have social media and have these ways online of like sharing what's going on in each other lives and like keeping those connections going. But I just think like with Facebook and Instagram, there's so much negativity that comes with that, right? There's the fact that Facebook is mining all the state out to sell you stuff. And then there's the fact that what the things that get the most likes or the most attention in these algorithms is not necessarily like the positive. That's things that are good for people to see. So maybe just thinking about how can we like redesign social media to keep the positive connection aspects but reduce the like mental anguish and other negative side effects that come with it.

Happening now! Ah, deep... Greetings... Ah, motherfucking... Right you... Good Lord! Ah, hungover, man. Please stop drumming, Frank. Hungover. I did drunk history last night. I got to get hammered with Dr. Drew. Stop. This is something I never expected to happen in my life, but I don't feel very good today. But I want to get this podcast up. And since today's guest is a psychonaut, psychedelic advocate and hilarious comedian, seems like the perfect episode to briefly mention how absolutely insane it is that we live in a country, most of us live in a country, where alcohol is legal and mushrooms are not. As I'm sitting here, gassy, taking gross fucking hangover dumps and just stinky in general, my eyes hurt, my feet are sweaty, just poisoned. I'm poisoned. My brain feels like somebody just, just, just replaced it with a bag of old rotten potatoes. Which, by the way, found in the pantry today, was noticing this horrible smell in the house. I thought it was the air conditioner. I replaced the air conditioner filter. Yeah, man, I can do that. It's really hard, too. It's very hard to replace an air conditioner filter. Very hard. I was thinking I was going to have to get the air conditioner cleaned, went up on the roof to look at the unit on the roof, because I thought maybe a rat had climbed in there, and we were smelling his decomposition or just getting blown out of the AC. But no, what happened was, at some point, I did that thing. I don't know if you guys do the thing where you're like, you know what, I'm going to order some fucking potatoes. And I'm sure I'll make some french fries, make some potato salad, maybe. I don't know. But yeah, a bag of potatoes is like six bucks for a whole, look at all these potatoes. It's nothing. Live off of these things. But you know, it's a big bag of potatoes. You put it up in an upper cabinet, and then like time passes, you forgot you bought the fucking potatoes, and then your house gradually starts filling with this awful, festering, stinking, industrial waste smell. I've been smelling it for a couple of days, wondering what it was, like thinking, like, fuck, I hope I'm okay. Am I having phantom smells? That's terrifying. It's something about hypochondriac. That's a very scary thing, man. Like you start smelling cigarette smoke when it's not there, rotten eggs, but it's just like something going on in your brain. Late at night, when you've eaten too much marijuana. Those are the kinds of things you think when you smell rotting potatoes that are hidden behind toilet paper bags. So today, I'm desperately going around the kitchen with my wife. Do you smell that? Where is it? What could it be? Fuck, is it AC? What is it? And then reached up into the pantry and pushed aside the toilet paper rolls. And it was like I was standing in front of a Nosferatu. It was just breathing on me at this point. I gagged. I almost threw up and I rarely throw up. I don't think I've ever thrown up because of a stink, but this is the closest I've ever gotten. That's how bad it smelled. And I grabbed the potatoes and pulled them down and just a waterfall of pinkish ooze just rushed down out of that top shelf. Like, have you ever seen synthol extraction videos? Lunatics inject themselves with this oils to give them fake muscles and then inevitably it becomes infected and they have to go to the doctor and the doctor slices their arm open and all this rotting oil and muscle goo go just sprays all over the fucking emergency room. That's what it was like. The dogs were sick. Everyone in the house was sick. My wife was sick. We're all just like gagging and choking. That's what my brain feels like right now. Just an old bag of shitty potatoes. I don't know why I'm going off on the potato thing, but I was interested in like the stink of the potatoes because I was thinking like, man, that seems like I could kill you. And then I googled potato deaths or something or like potato stink death and sure as shit in Russia. I guess some family had like done the same thing I did only not just with one bag of potatoes. They'd gotten a Russian quantity of potatoes that they thought they were going to eat and they didn't. And they put them in their basement and the parents and went down to like probably because they'd been smelling some something incomprehensibly horrible. And they just walked down the steps right into a cloud of rotting potato gas and they just died down there. Died of potato fumes. Didn't see that one coming, I bet. They didn't predict that when they were calculating in their minds how they were going to die in Russia. They weren't like, oh, probably by potato gas. But that happens. That's the world we're in. Got a little off track. The point is, I don't feel great. And so I was sort of like scanning through the internet, recalling that I'd seen some kind of study regarding like alcohol, like how harmful alcohol is in comparison to other drugs. And you can find this, it's fascinating. This professor in England did the study and published it in the Lancet. And they used, I don't know, all these, they figured out a way to quantify harm. And the long and short of it is alcohol is the most harmful fucking drug on planet earth, right above heroin. It's above heroin. And the least harmful drug is mushrooms, according to Professor David Nut. Why did his last name have to be nut, right? Like if you're going to do this incredible study, which basically makes you a psychedelic advocate, which he is, David Nut is a psychedelic advocate, he's a scientist, any good scientist should be something of a psychedelic advocate, or at least someone who based on the current data knows that psychedelics compared to alcohol are the difference between lemonade and gargoyle piss. But we live in a world where alcohol is completely fucking fine. Everyone loves it. It's great. But mushrooms, illegal. How many other people are hung over around planet earth right now? How many other people are gassy and disgusting right now? I bet some of you right now are hung over as could be just feeling gross, soupy, bulgy bloated, nasty, greasy, like one of those hot dogs rolling on the fucking thing in the convenience store. Anyway, I'm not going to go on and on about this because I just went on and on about it. If you want to hear me, if you want to hear like a long diatribe on how absolutely insane it is that we can't go to a fucking bar and order a nice cup of mushroom tea, then I uploaded a much longer version of what I just said over at Patreon. But I'm not going to spend any more time yapping about it. I feel sick ish. I want to get this episode up so I could go back to sleep. Also, I want to help promote a screening of Shane Moss's movie, which is gross. I want to help promote Shane Moss's movie, which is going to be screening in LA tomorrow. That is Friday, June 15. There's also a big party afterwards. And I wasn't able to get this up as soon as I'd like. So that's going to be it. I'm sorry. No, it's a lazy intro, but I've been drinking gargoyle piss, friends. Don't feel good. I'm going to jump right into this episode. But first, some quick business. Speaking of gargoyle piss, have you been brushing your teeth the wrong way? Much thanks to Quip for supporting this episode of the DTFH. Truth is, most of us are brushing our teeth wrong. You either don't brush them long enough or you forget to change your brush. You put your brush right next to your toilet, splatters of bacteria water, get on top of it, and then you shove into that stinky hole you make words with. The next thing you know, you've got more bacteria in there than you're taking out. You're not brushing right. That pie hole of yours is a nasty, sick little thing because you do an improper brush. You don't spend enough time on the quadrants of your teeth. This is something I learned. I didn't even know you could break your mouth up into quadrants, which you can, the four quadrants of glory. And Quip trains you to brush your teeth because it has a built-in timer. Helps you clean for the dentist-recommended two minutes with guiding pulses that remind you when to switch sides. Also, Quip's subscription plans are for your health, not just convenience. They deliver new brush heads on a dentist-recommended schedule every three months for just five bucks, including free shipping worldwide. Wherever you are, you could have a clean toothbrush in your mouth if you go with Quip. Finally, everybody loves Quip. They were on Oprah's O-list, name one of Time's best inventions, and is the first subscription electric toothbrush accepted by the American Dental Association. Quip starts at just 25 bucks. And if you go to getquip.com slash DTFH right now, you'll get your first refill pack free with a Quip electric toothbrush. That's your first refill pack free at getquip.com slash DTFH. It's spelled getquip.com slash DTFH. Trust me, if you're like me, you don't spend enough time brushing those sweet pearly whites of yours, man. You need to know how long to keep that brush pumping in and out of your mouth. Quip will teach you about that. It's also got a wireless mirror mount, so you could mount it right on your mirror and keep it away from your toilet. A surprising amount of people do that. How often have you been over at somebody's house and they've got their brushes in a cup right next to the toilet? And whenever you flush that thing, it sprays and splatters. You don't know what's going on in there. Drunks are going in your friend's bathroom and waving their cocks around, little micro droplets of bacteria are just spraying everywhere. People are going in there and popping zits above their toothbrush and little bits of pus are spraying down onto their brush and people sneeze on their tooth. But you don't know, people break in all the time and sneeze on your toothbrush unless it's mounted on a mirror. So you can get your toothbrush far away from the toilet. It should be there. You stick it in your mouth every day. Oh my God, when you think about it, it's crazy to think about. Imagine, when you eat with a spoon, what do you do? You wash it. Put it in the dishwasher maybe if you're fancy. But many of us, they just shove that fucking toothbrush into our mouth and just sling it. Maybe you lazily run it under the faucet a couple of times and then put it in a cup right next to our toilet and just splatter toilet water. It's, we're disgusting, but not any more thanks to Quip. You can mount that thing on your mirror far away from your toilet. Brushing your teeth is one of the most important parts of your day. To stay healthy, Quip knows that and their team of dentists and designers is focused on helping you take care of your mouth better.

We've got a wonderful episode of the DTFH for you today. Returning to the podcast is a wonderful comedian, a psychonaut, psychedelic advocate with a scientific mind. He just made a film about psychedelics called Psychonautics and that's screening at the Chinese Theater June 15th. That's tomorrow at five PM. After that, there's going to be a big party. Now everyone, please spread your glory wings as far out as you can and flap right into the heart of today's wonderful guest. Comedian, Shane Moss. Yeah, I can adjust. Shane, welcome back, man. It's been too long. It's so great to see you. Yeah, good to see you, my friend. So you're in town right now trying to promote this movie that you just finished? Yeah, I finished the documentary and it's coming out. It's in this dances with films festival. It's in LA and it's so the movie's premiering on the 15th at five o'clock at the TCL, the Chinese Theater, the old man's, I keep on wanting to call it the man's Chinese Theater, but it's something else now that I should have looked up before. God damn it. Everyone listening is just like, what the, somebody, you know what happened just now? I guarantee it. Like somebody was like thinking like, should I fucking kill my grandmother or not? And like, maybe I won't. And now they did it. You just threw someone into a violent. I mean, that's the, that's the chance that you take when you're a comedian, you know, you go on podcasts and trigger people, people, people die all the time. And let me tell you, if you want to fucking piss people off, if you want to throw people into a rage, say the name of man's Chinese Theater, it's happening to me. It's like, it's a phenomenon in LA that people aren't aware of, but it's like, it will send someone into such a terrible spiral. Yeah, I wouldn't, you'd think I'd, I'd keep it a little tighter to the best, maybe not just go throwing around those trigger words. You got to be careful these days. On the wall there, you could see the list of trigger words that we're not allowed to use. Oh yeah, I'm gonna be more, I'm gonna be more mindful. You are in a film festival, what's the name of the film festival? It's called the dances with films festival. And so, so it's, it's nice because people can just buy a ticket to my documentary and they don't have to get like a whole movie pass, but they, they can get the, or the festival pass, but they can also get a festival pass as well. Can you bring our listeners up to speed? The last we talked, you had just come out of a period of great acceleration, growth, you were in a hospital for a little bit, you'd gotten out of the hospital. Yeah. It was bipolar episode related to psychedelics and now you've stabilized and I want as curious as to how you worked into this documentary on psychedelics, this particular thing that happened to you? Well, it kind of changed everything. It kind of changed the scope of the film. We didn't really know initially, we were like, what is this documentary? Are we like, is this like a tutorial? Like at first we were maybe going to call it, so you're thinking about tripping and talking about like, this is what setting and intention is all about. This is how you integrate and, and kind of showing the process I use with, with some of the researchers and all of that. And I thought that was kind of an interesting idea, which later just completely got abandoned for what ultimately ended up being, I think a more sensible, a more balanced documentary because, because the psych ward stuff ended up, we couldn't film in the psych ward or anything and I was completely crazy at that time. So I wasn't being filmed and, and I was, I thought every, the world was turning against me and was, was like, like, I remember reaching out to you and being like, should I reach out? Is he an ally or is he one of the tricksters? Like I remember just everyone in my life, I had that same question, my girlfriend, my family, it didn't matter. And, and so we ended up having to animate some of that section and just me like sharing it. And then we took some stuff with So, so some of it is little bits of my stand up. We also recorded, we happened to be recording the first stand up set that I did right after getting out of a psych ward and me explaining the story. So we tell a little bit of the story through like little bits of stand up here and there, but it's, it's driven by, it's a lot of just showing me going and doing, like, ketamine at Dr. Terry Earley's office in Santa Barbara. I don't know if you've, I know you've had Cole Marta on the show before he works, that's his office. Oh, I got you. And, and, and so things like that, going and doing mushrooms with, there's this Michael meditations guy that runs retreats in Jamaica and, and just kind of showing the, so we did DMT, ayahuasca, LSD, ketamine, and, and mushrooms kind of covered the big more popular ones. Right. And, and then the psych ward thing just kind of really changed the story. So, right. So it ends up, you know, without talking about, without giving everything away, which I kind of already did, um, it, it ended up showing kind of a balanced approach where I think for people that are, that know nothing about psychedelics, it will be very informative in just in terms of understanding the basics of what psychedelics are about. And I, you know, through my tour and everything gone out of my way, trying to figure out how to articulate these things so that anyone can understand. But then, uh, I think for the, the people like us that are big into psychedelics and psychedelic advocates, there, there will be a little bit of a, a lesson learned about going too far with them as well. So hopefully a little something for everybody. Oh no, I'm, I'm pretty, I don't know how you are with like, uh, hearing yourself or watching yourself. I don't like it. I can't stand it at all. I don't mind hearing myself, but watching myself, it freaks me out for some reason. But I imagine you get used to it eventually. It's just something you must. I guess. I've never, I can't really listen back to my podcast hardly. Uh, I mean, I can, but I definitely would prefer not to. What do you think that is? That, that kind of cognitive dissonance that happens when, you know, a lot of people, they, they say, I don't even want to listen to my voice ever. Like if you try to record someone's voice, they're like, no. Yeah. What do you think that is? Well, there is just the technical of, of your voice sounds different because of the, the way your, um, voice vibrates off of your, your bone or whatever, from the jaw bone on the inside, I forget exactly what it's something to do with the way that you hear your voice is different than the way your voice is. So then you hear your voice recorded and you're like, what, that's not my voice. And it's like a really, is that what I sound like? And then because it's different, maybe it's, maybe it's like jarring or bad. It's, it's, there's also these all sorts of assumptions that the mind tends to make. Like I'm, I'm almost six, four. And so people will always after shows just be like, you're taller than I thought you'd be. Because I think people just assume that everyone is average. Like that's just the rule of thumb. Like just assume everyone's average. And so then there's this jarring like, whoa, I wasn't expecting that. Right. That could be part of it. But the weird thing is, is that we are, we have evolved to be these, these very confident beings. There's all these, um, uh, the evolution of self deception is like one of the most fascinating things in the entire world. You can, you can take a picture of, uh, you could take a picture of either one of us or your average person. There's individual differences because some people have like lower self-esteem than others and whatnot. But if you take the average person, you take a picture of them and you morph it, uh, like you make it 10% more symmetrical than 20% more, 30% more. And so you have like five, five levels of a more handsome Duncan or Shane. And then you go the other way too. And you make it 10%, you make our faces a little more wonky, 10%, 20%, 30%. So now you have 11 pictures, five of them more attractive, five of them less attractive. This is how I feel at any audition I go to. Like whenever you go to an audition and you look and you see the spectrum of you based on like, you know what I mean? So like you see like, oh shit, there's like, there's like super attractive versions of me. And then there's like maybe a little less attractive versions of me. You land somewhere in this ridiculous spectrum of this palette of humanity as you're being like chosen, but keep going. Right. No. But when you flash, if you mix those pictures up and flash them on a screen and have people point at their actual face, like as fast as they can, the face that they typically pick is the one that is like 20% more attractive than their actual face. You know what I think that is? I think that is the inside of humans is a soul and that the soul is so beautiful and so like, so, so radiant and so full of love. You are such a wonderful positive being. I love hanging out with you. You are definitely, especially because I have like states of horrible depression and anadonia and just hate life and everything. Every time I talk to you, I'm just like, oh, that's, yeah, that's a wonderful way of looking at it that would have never occurred to me. Well, you know, it's, well, let's state, let's explore it because the, it's like, this is the same phenomena that the sense of timelessness of the self. So it's like, when you're sort of contemplating yourself, you know, you're not looking at yourself in the mirror. Your, your like assessment of self is usually based on more of a kind of like field of consciousness. And then you sort of like, oh, this is what I am. If you really spend any time with that, minus the depression, you really, you feel this, you realize, I kind of feel, I felt like this my whole life. And it gets obscured by the clouds of ego or mental illness or moods or whatever. But there's this sense of like an eternal nature. There's a feeling of like, oh, shit, man, I don't feel like I'm 44. I feel eternal. I feel like I've been here forever. And that like, this surrounding body is like, it's getting old, but I don't feel old. You know, so I think maybe when people are pointing at the more beautiful version of themselves, that's the best they can do because I'm like, I'm, there's a sun inside of me. Well, evolutionary psychologists have a much more cynical take on what is going on there, which is, which is that 90% of people think that they're, that they're better drivers than average 90% of people think that they're smarter than the average person. And so the numbers aren't adding up. And that's to say that, that the 10% of people that don't think that they're smarter than average, there might be some very depressed, self loathing people in there that actually do have a very high IQ in art. And then, and then there are, you know, people in the obviously lots of people in the 90%. There's at least more than 40% of them likely that are not smarter or better drivers than the average person. But confidence is a big thing in life. And I think that you know, I've been thinking about this, about the ideas that, because we're all kind of selling ourselves in a way to others and to ourselves and to, I mean, to someone who like right now, I'm doing great. I like I mentioned before we were recording went to the rock gym this morning, I woke up super early, I already got a workout in today, like the weather's beautiful, I'm gonna see darker, there's no problem getting out of bed today. Then those days when you do have a hard time, there doesn't seem like, like, who cares? What what is, you know, what is the point to go out and do another podcast, like who what what, it's not going to matter what I go to CrossFit today. And like, that just means I'm going to have to live longer, because I'll be healthier, which means I'll have to do more CrossFit. And I'll just put whatever I just kind of be this rat in this wheel, the rest of my, you know, so it's like, definitely your perception can change the story, your, but, but the positive story gets you out of bed, and gets you moving a lot easier than right. Well, it's you know, it's a it's a so like the your version of the story is we have such a strange dynamic. I always feel like whenever I talk to you, I'm like, am I just an asshole? You're not a wonderful being like Duncan. Oh, shit, man. First of all, number one, you're not an asshole. It's I look this in this this kind of dialogue is the best ever, because it's like, it's great. We're talking about kind of scientific material, the science, scientific materialism versus mysticism or something like that. And so when this is an ancient conversation, it's the best conversation, especially when both people are friends, and and both people aren't afraid or of being wrong, you know, and so the your version of the story is that every day, we kind of tell a story to ourselves. One story that we can tell is that this is ultimately an absurd life, right? And it's all the all the all the beautiful variations on that story. You know, this is this is kind of an absurd life. It's really, really meaningless. Like if we're to look if we just for one second stop being a historical so many people are these days and really just take a deep, deep look into the past and understand how many people have lived on this planet, how many people have aspired to so many things, how many people have sat in a chair in an office, their heart resounding with joy as they type the last letter in some incredible book that they wrote that they were certain was going to change the world. No one knows their name, they're uncared, they died alone. And all of their naive, whatever the fuck that was, it was like, you know, it's just energy being dispersed by a planet that produces like sort of some form of sentient meat. And it's just meat, it just like comes out of the planet, shuffles around a little bit, sinks back into the dirt, makes these embarrassing monuments for itself out of Christ. Some of these monuments maybe are even made out of like more meat, like the stones, maybe they have shells in them or there's like, you know, so it's like we we sort of are building this bridge into a meaningless future on the bones of those who've died before us. I very much admire your verbal fluency by the way you beautifully articulate it. I've thought this way before, so I'm very familiar with that state of consciousness. So then the other state of consciousness is this idea like, well, you know, actually, what we are is this eternal, transcendent love field that is playing in the waves of matter and the way that dolphins surf waves, we're sort of playing here. We come here to play, we come here to like the same reason you go to the rock climbing gym or people go to the gym. We come here or granted amnesia or given pure respite from whatever the infinite consciousness that we emerged from was, we get to experience this thing with full fear and the fear if you really sit and look at it, it's beautiful. And if you look at the despair, it's beautiful. Yeah. And if you look at the pain, even the pain is beautiful. And then you start realizing like, Oh, wait, the entire thing is made of beauty. And or rather, the thing that I am as it glows through the field of matter that I've incarnated in, it seems to illuminate it in this beautiful way, even when it's the worst thing ever. So there's another story to yourself. And then one, but these are two stories. Now, I think it's important to find the truth out. That's the real important thing and not really to tell ourselves stories, because no matter what, it's like, well, I'm just telling myself a story. This is something Ram Dass talks about a lot. He says, this is my imagination. This is a, and then when an imagination gets so discredited. Use your imagination, kids. You could be on a mountain high, you could be on a dragon's back flying through the sky. Use your imagination. It's like, it's like a little bit of silly putty in some far corner of your mind that you can pull out when you're bored in traffic and think about licking the assholes of 17 beautiful women tied up in some wonderful dungeon before you fucking rage at traffic. You know what I mean? It's just something you pull out when you're bored. Kind of almost like a, like the appendix or, you know, you can use your imagination. No, it's not reality. Ram Dass's idea is like, no, no, no. This thing, this imagination is everything. It is the truth. It is real. I'm not talking about deluding yourself, but really like looking deep into the self and analyzing it underneath the pain and the pain itself. I keep coming back with fucking roses, man. And it's like the, the analysis that I do constantly is seeking out the bones. I'm looking for the horror. I'm trying to find it now. And more and more and more, I'm becoming less capable of discovering it. And I, to me, that's its own weird form of like, fuck, am I okay? I did have, I had a moment like that last year when I came down from my mania and I started feeling depressed again. I was like, oh good. Oh, I'm experiencing reality again. And I can tell it's real because it hurts and it's sad. And which is in itself depressing. But yeah, I, I mean, I do, I go back and forth so much. And I do think that this is maybe just, I mean, what a wonderful, interesting, odd, pointless blip of existence. Like it might be both of those things at once. And let's talk about the pointless language because it's like, you know, like, let's look at that for real. Because especially when like I start ascribing words like that to my existence, I want to be sure I'm being precise. So for example, the pointless thing, it's like, well, I mean, we do know they're suffering. There's no question about that. I think that you could, that's like an inarguable truth in the world, isn't it? Right? Like, I don't think anyone could tell you, no, there's no suffering in the world. I can't imagine anyone saying that. It's an, is it an axiom to say that life is suffering like the Buddhists say? Is it a human life is filled with suffering? Is that an axiom? Is that an undeniable truth? Do you think? I mean, I think that, I mean, the way that I look at things is we have all of these different emotional states are just different evolved motivators, psychological motivators, but still suffering. Yeah. Like you could say there's, like, even if I'm talking from a purely scientific, like a materialist point of view, suffering is real. Yeah, mostly because you want to avoid that feeling, like pain is real, so that you'll not jump off of that fucking thing that will cause you pain and suffering, whatever it might be. Right. And there's certain types of suffering that are good suffering, probably, right? Is there good suffering? Oh, yeah. There's, I mean, because there's like accomplishment, you know, and reward of having to, having to, even when I think about going to CrossFit, you know, it's to me, like pure hell and torture for an hour. And then afterwards, I'm like, I did it. So maybe, you know, maybe that's like pain versus suffering. Maybe like you could say, I don't know, I go back and forth on this, like the difference between pain and suffering but it might just be a semantic question. I don't know. But what I'm getting at here is pointlessness. Right. I want to talk about pointlessness. Yeah. And like if you were from a, from your trained scientific mind, if you were asked to prove scientifically that this existence is pointless, how would you go about doing that? Yeah. Yeah. I guess to make it falsifiable that you would be like, but what if there is a point and then there's points, there's an infinite amount of points everywhere. And it's not so much that I think I've talked about this before. It's not so much that it's filled with points. Yeah. It's, it's, it's more like it's, it's more that the idea that there is one singular point. Let's do first of all, let's just get real scientific and define what is a point. I don't mean mathematically. I mean, like in the term, in a human sense, in the existential sense. That's a great question. I mean, I guess it, I guess it's a goal. I think much of this consciousness is, is kind of goal assessing software. So, so I think that when you, when you go, oh, here's, here's what this purpose is. There's this finish line that you get to, whether it's an afterlife or a comedy central special or, you know, whatever it, or, or, um, so it's a goal. Yeah. I, I, so for you, a point is a goal, but then it's also when you ask like, what is the, the point of life, then you can go like, well, why, if you're wondering what we're here to do, ask, how did we get here in the first place? And then, and then that quickly just becomes where vehicles for our genes, right? And so, so then that is kind of the point, I guess, but, but our genes don't have like any kind of a conscious goal in mind as far as we know, but we do. Right. I mean, we certainly do. Like there are a point, like in other words, like if, if, if you're establishing like, okay, a point, the point is to a, to a, to have a goal, right? Which, you know, I think, I don't know, you know, like this is where we get into the whole subjective thing. It's like, oh, shit, you're, you're, we're running into a real problem here. Cause it's like, well, yeah, if I, you know, somebody was telling me, listen, man, the point is to achieve your goals. Yeah. So I would be like, dude, you are going to kill, you're going to blow your fucking brains out, man. Because like, you know, I get it. Achieving goals is fucking incredible. Like every time I get a podcast up and I work really hard and get the thing up and get that nice dopamine drip. It's, it's wonderful. It's wonderful. It's wonderful. But the shit I'm into right now, man, is I really love Chogyam Trumpa right now. This Chogyam Trumpa Rinpoche is a Buddhist teacher and I'm taking lessons from this guy, David Nick Turnies, a meditation teacher. And he's like, Chogyam Trumpa Rinpoche said, this is hopeless. So that's the first thing like, like any minute, like this is hopeless. So number one, let's stop torturing ourselves with the idea that there are points. We torment ourselves with points. So now let's just get rid of that shit all together, right? And say, okay, maybe let's just say it is pointless. Great. Now we live in a pointless world. Let's see what that's like. And so the, his thing is like, this is the, this is what's happening here. And it sounds grim at first, because you're resisting it. So it sounds grim at first. And when I first read it, I was like, what the fuck are you saying? You bastard. But, but so, and for any kind of Trumpa students out there, my apologies if I fucked this up, because I'm not pretending to understand half of what he was talking about, maybe a four percent. But I kind of get this one. So what he's saying is it's kind of like, listen, here's where we're at here. We are in a really, really perplexing situation here, which is that we are existing. We have existence. We're in these bodies. They are impermanent. We are dying for sure. Our identities seem to be real, but they're not at all. Like, if you spend any time at all, like contemplating your, who you are, what you are, any part of it at all, if you, if you look deeply into it, you begin to realize like this shit is all like, kind of like wavering and like vaporous, you know, it's like the person I was yesterday, I'm kind of that person today, but maybe not really that person anymore. The person I wasn't always a kid. I'm not really that identity anymore. And there does seem to be a sense of like, you know, eternal self. But the more I look into that thing, it's like, wait, what are you seeing there? The eternal self really, there just seems to be this field of seeing a thing. So, am I that? So the idea is that like, we're in a really, really difficult predicament for sentient meat to get into, right? So that's the suffering. We are suffering here. We are suffering. That's real. You are suffering. Yeah. When you sit still for any amount of time, you want to start doing something. You want to look at your phone. You want to turn on the TV. Yeah. You want to send an email. You want to check your bank account. You want to see where this thing is going. How many tickets did I sell? Am I doing the, you want to hear a fantastic study? That was like this very thing about, about kind of restlessness. That's not the exact thing that they were studying. But, but they've, they would have someone fill out a survey or whatever, and then they'd be like, you, well, we're not ready for the next part. You have like 30 minutes or whatever to kill. You can either drop this survey off next door, or you can walk 10 minutes away to drop it off at this other place. And, and people would logically go like, oh, I'm just going to drop it off next door because that's less steps that you have to walk. But if you instead would say, oh, there's a, there's a dark chocolate for you at the one next door and white chocolate for you at the one 10 minutes away or switch it around, didn't matter. People would go, oh, I'm going to, I like white chocolate. So I'm going to make the trick to 10 minutes away. If you give people the slightest reason, the slightest excuse to busy themselves, they will do it rather than sit there twiddling their thumbs for 30 minutes. Right. And so here is the question. Why? Why do you think that is? Shame? I think there is an evolutionary mismatch with our, with our current state that we find ourselves in where there was never enough. There was never a time in our evolutionary history where you were safe to just kick up your feet in the hammock and chill out. I think there was never, there wasn't refrigerators stocked with, with food and grocery stores that you could go and replenish this refrigerator at. There was. What is that data coming from? Because Chris Ryan is, you know, he paints a picture of the world as having like, you know, like you try to summon up like, what was the work week? What did the work? Yeah, like four, four hours a day or whatever. And then they'd, they'd sit around chilling, but not the rest of the time. But is that chilling or was that trying to increase their social status to, to attract mates? And when you're sitting around trying to like be the most charismatic guy around or when, when you look at, when, like there's this baboons, when I think it's baboons, if you study, when primatologists study them, they have a similar thing where it doesn't take them that many hours to go out and gather the resources that they need to feed themselves. And so they have a lot of free time on their hands. And so they're just kind of bastards. They all like pick on one another and they're always in fights because when you give them enough time to, they spend the rest of their time just, just trying to increase their, their status. So it's definitely not, it's, I, I think that there was never, when, when people think about evolutionary goals, they think about survival more than anything. Oh, you'd get food or whatever. But there's so many other, there's so many other things that we need to do to get the most valuable mate out there or multiple mates. There you go. So that's perfect. That's a perfect response. And it totally fits into the, the, the Buddhist paradigm, which is what, here's what happens when you're sitting still. For me, when I'm sitting still, what starts happening is you either don't want to be there in the sense you're sitting still and you're like, this is boring, my back hurts, my legs hurt, gotta move. Or you have in your mind another place you want to be. So this is called desire in a version. So in any given moment, a human is longing quite often, longing for something, the points, the goals, longing for some phone call to come in, longing for some state, or they're one, not wanting to be where they're at, because where they're at sex is too hot, it's too cold. I don't like the service in this restaurant. It's too loud. I don't like the air conditioning in the small. I'm starting to feel claustrophobic here. I want to move. And so all that is suffering, suffering, suffering, suffering, suffering. And so the idea is that is life. And we don't want to deal with that. But we want to imagine there's some respite down the line around this corner, that corner up, down here and there. If I go into this cubby hole, comb my hair this way, rearrange myself, close the door three times, clap my hands, become the president, become a king, become a pope, say I'm sorry to my mom, figure out a way to resurrect the dead, cure cancer, become the most famous comedian on earth, become the emperor of planet earth, become the emperor of the galaxy, become the emperor of all the universe, become the ultimate emperor of all things. We create all of these dreams. The dream is the suffering will end. The truth is the suffering will not end as long as you're alive. And this is so unbearable for people that they create all of this ridiculousness. And this is where the delusion comes in. So it's like now I'm creating this imaginary world. I've literally like in the way Trumpa puts it is. I'm standing on a floor of razor blades right now. That's existence. It sucks. It's cutting me. It's cutting my feet. I'm bleeding. I'm hurting. It hurts so much. I cannot believe how much this fucking hurts. But instead of going into the pain, looking at it, what is this pain? Why the pain? What is this feeling of the pain? What does it really feel like? Where does it hurt? What is it? What we do is we craft the way he puts it, a beam, an imaginary beam in the ceiling made of delusion. So we're sitting on these fucking razor blades cutting ourselves. We look up at this beam and that beam, that's where we climb in. We burrow into the delusion. And so now we're like, okay, I'm working on it though, man. This is going to be, oh yeah, you know what? They're probably going to come up with some kind of fucking age rejuvenating thing. Like I know I'm getting old, but I bet in five or 10 years the back pain will go away. And you know, this is really going to work out for me soon. I know it. And as soon as I get that fucking thing and the thing comes and this comes, and then I'm going to be great. I'm going to be great, man. So we're always like looking at that beam, pretending we're getting better instead of doing the exact thing that will cure us, treat the whole thing, which is to stop and feel the pain. And know it and not run away from it. And that place, that state of self-exploration going towards the pain instead of away from it, that is where the fucking, the gold is hidden, you know. If only I can get further into the pain, then I'll get to all of it. Exactly. That's another, no, it's not just, no, you're not just standing on razor blades, you're surrounding yourself. Now you're like, oh, I'll throw myself into the blades. So now this is where we get into the middle. This is why Buddhism is called the middle way, because it's like, or not too tight, not too loose, which is like, yeah, that's the next thing the mind wants to do. So now the mind is like, oh, okay, great. Well, we're going to get, not only we're going to fucking get into this pain, man. It's like, I'm going to really be in pain. It's like not that either. So, so there's this like place that you can find where you, which is why I, when I, you know, you hear someone like Chokin Trump say, this is a hopeless situation. If you're someone who's become addicted to the goalposts, if you're someone who's become hooked on the ambrosia idea that around this corner or that corner, you're going to be okay, then there is nothing worse to hear than like, it's not really going to work out. Yeah. But if you're someone who's like realizing like, oh, wait a minute, I think I'm fucking chasing my own tail here, man. I've, there's like a laser pointer up and running after my entire life. It's a little fucking primate kitten. Then suddenly there's just this sweetness that starts filling up your heart when you start sinking into what is right now. I've found that's like, that's the, that's one possible way to be. Yeah. I mean, well, I hope that one day I will appreciate the now the most out of everybody. Well, you should buy my new pills. Now X. 1995 will get you 30. And then there's this placebo effect where the more you charge for it, the more people think that it works. The bigger the pill is, the harder it is to swallow. The more you think that it's real fucking pills are the size of bricks and they cost a thousand dollars each and they're fucking enemas. Listen, if you want to be in the present moment, shove one of these pills in your ass. In fact, they're not pills. They're just bricks. They, they did a, they did a study very much like that with a, with some complicated heart surgery that they couldn't tell. They're like, is this actually working or not? It's like replacing some valve or something like that. And so they had one group where they did the surgery, another group where they didn't do anything. And then they had another group where they opened up their chest and then didn't do the surgery and stitched them back together. And the group where they opened up their chest and just stitched them back together ended up doing the best because the surgery was harming them. But it was enough harm. It was enough to like, that people went, well, they wouldn't have done that for nothing, you know, but they didn't touch the heart. So it didn't fuck with them. But then it gave them enough. It changed whatever happens when you have this, this idea of positive well-being and you think things are going to work out, the body's amazing and can repair itself in certain circumstances. And so, I mean, to me, I think life is a little bit about finding the placebo that works for you, which I think is now is easily worth $1,000 for that suppository. I think it's fine. I think it's that idea. This is a very important question, which is like all these fucking hippies who keep going on and on and on about love. Are they full of shit or not? Is that real? When I see these people... That is an important question. Is that real? Is that real or not? When I'm looking at Ram Dass and he's glowing with light and when I feel my life transformed from like very slow transformation, but a real transformation from my association with that particular paradigm, the question is, is it real? Does it work? Is it all truly just pointless? Is there some other way that isn't delusion, that isn't placebo? Have I missed something? Is it possible that the millennia of various mystics crying out from their caves and their little huts and their fucking mountain cabins who are saying, holy shit. There's more than we thought. And the way to get there is not the way you think you get there. Is that bullshit or is it real? I've gone back and forth with these same questions. I've had enough psychedelic experiences to see all of those lovely amazing things. And then when I'm optimistic evolutionary point of view, well, love is this evolved bonding mechanism and cooperation is this fantastic strategy that humans have clearly done well by. And so more cooperation seems to work in a lot of cases if you're not being taken advantage of by people, which will happen within the system of the game theory. There is just going to be enough incentive at some point where someone will take advantage of someone else loving too much. And so there is a little... But everything you just said, that is all a, like you could put that on a grid, you can quantify it, you can like say, okay, this is what the reason... Here's one reason love helps evolutionarily. Here's one reason that it helps. But I'm saying, and that's great. And I think that's an important study to do. Like let's really look at like the benefits of love from a purely evolutionary perspective. Let's look at that. I love... That's an amazing... That's a great thing. Like how does love help a community? How does love help a village? How does love help a planet? Great. But before that, I want to get into like, what is it? What is love? What is it? That state of consciousness? What is it? That perfect balance of oxytocin and dopamine and serotonin? And what is it? What is it? And what does it do to a life when it comes into a life? Yeah, I think it's a mix of those things and a beautiful story that we tell ourselves as well. Okay, but still like the actual articulation of the love state. Like do you know what I'm talking about? I'm talking about like when you're so fucking in love with somebody. Yeah. Whether it's a baby, whether it's a dog, a cat, when you're so fucking in love with somebody, that when you get around them, even trying to talk to them about how much you love them becomes impossible because your language reservoir is not... It doesn't have the right tools in it to say this thing that you're feeling. Right? This begins to transcend data sets and symbol systems. Yeah, I mean, I've been in a place where I have felt this universal love where anything that's like coming out of my mouth right now seems absolutely silly. Like why are you like resisting and making up excuses when you can just like accept this eternal love that is the source of all things. I've been in those states and I wish I could remember them and tap into them more often than I can, but I always end up going back to like trying to... I guess it's just my rational mind of trying to be like, yeah, but let's break that down and I guess I'm a little bit too much of a reductionist sometimes, which reductionism has all sorts of problems because there's this holistic immersion process and all things and reductionism is bad for predicting things like the chaos and all of these unpredictable like butterfly effects and that sort of thing that happen that obviously are real and have these... Reductionism doesn't help you predict the weather. So I don't know. I do think that... I wonder a lot about... because after my thing last year and what I was in, I was like, oh, you know, I'm like really loving doing this indie comedy, so maybe I'll get out of comedy clubs because that was wearing old. So maybe I found myself chasing another thing and then after a while I was like, well, why am I doing any of this? And I've accomplished so many goals in my life and then you get up and to the top of like Mount Nowhere and kind of realize that there's just a bottomless pit of want up there and there's just like, oh, I guess there's another peak over there that I should go and have another look on top of that one. Maybe the answer's up there that will give me... And then there's also, I mean, the way in which we age and how our age affects our well-being and what brings people pleasure is another thing as well. So it might just be that we're like getting older and getting more of an appreciation for... That's if you ask people what one of their more memorable experiences was recently, a positive experience. Younger people will say something exciting, bungee jumping or whatever and older people will say something a little more relaxing around the campfire with my kids or something like that. So we slow down. So I don't necessarily trust that when someone's like, oh, I've been around the block and I've had and I realized and I sat in the... And then I realized it's just about being happy with what you have and just to say, well, for you it is now in the place that you're at that is the best strategy for you. And so is that priming the way that you are trying to articulate consciousness itself. Like I had one of the most interesting experiments that I accidentally did was I used to speaking of selling things and selling ideas to ourselves. I used to sell these stupid plastic beer mustaches. They clipped on beer bottles, you drank it, looked like you had a mustache. I call them Shane mustaches. Great way to make money. Yeah. People buy one. I'll send you some. Thank you. And they came in eight different colors. Black and pink were the big sellers. But if I wanted people to get other colors, I'd be like, you know, St. Patrick's Day is coming up. Get your green one. Fourth of July is coming up. You want to get your red and your blue mustaches because I needed... I wanted people to buy a variety because they'd get more of them. And then there'd be colors that I... Well, the local sports team, get those colors. Just anything I could do to trigger like, oh, that is why I should have an orange beer mustache. You just give people kind of a reason because they want to support you anyway. And there'd be say purple. I hadn't unloaded a purple beer mustache in forever. Crazy. I would think those would sell like hotcakes. So I would... Or whatever color wasn't selling. I would just... I would have these... It'd be in a thing with like a bunch of different compartments. And so I'd have these eight different colors and there'd be like stacks of 20 of them all equal of each color. And then I would just use, you know, a little bit of knowledge from behavioral economics. And I'd just take out, you know, 15 of the purple mustaches. So there was five left. And every time, after that show, people would see like, oh, well, this is... There's only a few of these purple ones left. I need to go and get that purple one is that there's these mental heuristics of this law. Jesus Christ, you're like the fucking Hannibal Lecter of merch. Jesus shame. Everyone listening to this is like, that mother fucker. I know. I got a purple mustache. I went to his fucking show where he hypnotized me to buy a purple fucking beer mustache using some satanic scientific potency. Exactly. But I think we're all doing that to ourselves. And, and so, so what was more interesting than that was not that then all of a sudden these purple mustaches are flying off the shelf, even though I hadn't sold one in three months. It was, I would always ask people, they'd go and get purple one. And I'd be like, so what is, why'd you pick the purple one? And I knew why they picked it. But I would always ask them and they would always have a story. It's always like their granddaughter's favorite color or their second car was purple. And oh, they just always liked purple and their favorite color on the rainbow. And they don't, and, and it wasn't like a smart or dumb thing. You know, it's not like smart people made a different choice and pick smart people just had like better stories about why they picked the purple must, they still made the same behavior. They would just consciously dream up these, they'd have a better imagination for, well, purple dye was always really expensive to make. So historically, you know, purple went around, was thought of with royalty and wealth. And that is why I bought a purple beer mustache. You know, I always buy it. Everyone in my family is used a purple beer mustache. And, and, and so you can kind of always tell how intelligent someone is by the sophistication of the lies that they tell themselves. And, and so I, so for example, now let's play the joke on me. I, if you ask me why I'm a standup comedian, this is, you know, you got to talk to reporters and stuff all the time and you tell them a story, I'll tell you this very fanciful story of, you know, I was nine years old, and I had this friend tell me I should be a standup comedian and just planted the seed in my head. And, and it's what I've been dreaming of since I was a little boy. And I just, I always watched as much standup as I could. And I cared about the skill and the craft and I loved the writing of it and then honing the performance and switching the jokes around in the order of this show. But I also happened to gain status, get resources and potentially attract mates from doing this. So is that like a little side bonus? To this conscious story that I think that I'm doing this? Or is that actually what's driving it in this nice beautiful story about the little boy is the story that I'm making up? Gotcha. Yeah. Let me add to it. When I was studying psychology, bachelor's degree in psychology, not to brag, but when I was studying psychology that one of the, they were talking about certain people who have usually some kind of traumatic brain injury will lose their ability to have a short-term memory. So they have long-term memory, but they don't have any short-term memory. So one of the things that they would do, if you heard about this, putting the coke in, putting the coke in front of them. Oh, I haven't heard the coke one. I thought you're going to. So you could put a Coca-Cola in front of a person who doesn't have short-term memory and all of a sudden a Coca-Cola has appeared. They don't know where it came from. They don't know what happened. They don't remember whether they got the Coca-Cola or didn't get the Coca-Cola. And so you could say to them, where did that Coca-Cola come from? And they would say, oh, I got up and went to the Coke machine and got a Coke because for their mind to have no ability to explain why a Coca-Cola just appeared, it was easier to invent what happened to get that fucking Coca-Cola than to deal with the fact that shit's just appearing in front of them. It just didn't work for them. So it just goes along with what you're saying, which is that we want to give ourselves a reason for this thing or that thing. Yeah. And I think that when you're talking about suffering, there's also all of these odd tweaks and ways in which the brain processes suffering. So have you ever heard of the peak end rule? No. This is fantastic. It will come with a very funny little study at the end that you're going to love. So the idea is how does the brain process pain or suffering? Is it like units of pain? You hit yourself a little bit with a hammer. That's four units of pain. You hit yourself twice as hard. That's eight units of pain. Is that how it's doing it? And so they do these... I think it was Dan Ariely that first started doing these tests. And he was a guy very interested in pain because he had been horrifically burned. He still has all sorts of scars all over his face and whatnot, horrifically burned in a chemical fire in college and spent like a year in a hospital bed and nearly died and had to... So what started the process of exploring pain for him was the nurses would rip the... They'd have to change his bandages as his skin was healing and they just rip it off like a bandaid. And he'd be like, you need to stop doing that. It needs to be slower. And they would just be like, no, no, we need to... Everyone knows you rip off a bandaid as fast as you can. So he went and that was like the first thing that he studied when he was well. What is the best way to take... And then proved to them that, no, you want to go slower. It's not as painful for people when measured and like surveys and stuff afterwards. And so anyhow, the peak end thing, you take a big bucket of ice and you have someone stick their hand in this freezing cold bucket of ice and it's painful and uncomfortable and whatnot. And then... For like a minute. And then you have them... I think, yeah, it's the same group. At another time, you have them do the same thing, stick their hand in for a minute. So that's the exact... If pain worked as a series of units, they just experienced the exact same number of units of pain. Now, you add a little bit, without them knowing, you add a little bit of warmer water. It's still cold. It's still uncomfortable, but it's not as cold or as uncomfortable as it was. And you have them leave their hand in for another 30 seconds. So if pain worked in units, this is the exact same number of units. It's the first study, but then an additional 30 seconds of not as bad of pain, but pain nonetheless. So logically, if you're a robot, you would want the first one where it's just a minute and you get it over with. You ask people which one they would want to do again and they pick the second one. Because the brain, it compares the average of the pain with the peak of the pain and what the end of it was. You always want to close a comedy show with a big strong jet. Like, I've had shows where I bombed the entire show and then closed out by like crushing for 10 minutes. And people are just delighted afterwards. And so here's the fun study that they did. This is back when colonoscopies were much more uncomfortable than they are now. They're trying to figure out how do you make this more comfortable for people. And so they do it really fast and more painful, but for a shorter amount of time. Do you do it slow, less painful, but for longer? And they landed somewhere on the middle with that. But then what they decided to do was to leave the colonoscopy device inside of the person, like not really doing anything for just like another minute or two after the colonoscopy was complete. So it's still painful. You still have this uncomfortable thing in your ass for two unnecessary minutes and people enjoyed that one more. Wow. That's so cool. That's such a crazy fucking study. Leave it in their ass, Gerald. They'll like it, trust me. So like I tried to, after I do a CrossFit workout, I try to like stretch a little bit afterwards. So it's like, that's the painful stuff that I remember because it's not as painful as the horrible workout was. And I want to be able to get myself to go back in the following day. But there's also, but this is again, like the evolutionary mismatch thing. We intellectually know that exercise is very good for you, right? So why didn't we evolve to just like happily go bumbling into CrossFit? Like some people certainly do. I mean, it's the happiest people that I've ever seen there. And, but I think you're up against a lot of instincts that are like, I mean, if our ancestors saw us running on a treadmill or something, they'd be like, what the fuck are you doing? You know, we, we made tires to, to transport us, to roll us. And then CrossFitters are like rolling a tire around. It's like all backwards. None of it makes sense. They're not even rolling it. They're flipping it. They're not even using a tire correctly. You're making life harder on yourself because you evolved to have these muscles for this necessary function that is no longer, you don't need to like build shelters every day and hunt or whatever it might be or, or wrestle to find a mate. And, but now you have all of these, you're set up for all of these muscles. And now if you don't exercise them, they'll deteriorate. So now rather than muscles being this thing that served this function of lifting, lifting stuff that you need to lift, now you need to lift stuff to serve the function of muscles. You know, you're lifting things for lifting sake, like to lift up something heavy and then just put it back down into place. It makes no sense whatsoever. Well, it feels good. It feels like afterwards, it's certainly, or there's like an endorphin rush. Yeah. When you're lifting shit, it feels good to lift heavy things. It does. Oh, you're lucky. It doesn't for me. Well, the, so it's the analysis of it. Like sometime, like one thing like that, I think it's an enjoyable thing to do when you find yourself in a real pickle. Yeah. Whatever it may be. If you can stop for a second and look at the feeling, really look deep into the feeling, especially with lifting weights. Yeah. And just look at it and think, what, what is this feeling of lifting? Because I think a lot of people don't even do that. Like, I know, like, I know many people, they just, I know, I'm not going to talk about many, me in particular. I will rush through everything. Like, for example, like a cookie in the cabinet, I'll go and get the cookie. And I'll, and I'm going to get a cookie. And that feeling of like excitement. Oh, fuck, man, I'm about to get some sugar. Here we go. I'm about to eat this cookie. And then you eat the cookie, but you don't even taste the cookie. And you realize I just ate a cookie a few seconds later, but that moment of eating the cookie is gone. You lot, it wasn't, you didn't experience it. Yeah. Rushing, rushing, rushing. So, and you're not full from it either. I just did a whole episode on, on satiation in general, but appetite, you know, just food appetite is a big part of, and there's all, if they, if you give someone like a pitch counter and have them, and have them count the number of gulps they take, they'll be full faster than if they're just like watching TV and eating a cookie, they'll just slam it right down without thinking of it. So, it's not like a stomach fullness thing. It's a perception thing. Well, if you go into the gym with the right food on your stomach and you like drink enough fucking coffee or whatever, you take some, you get a little stoned, do you work out? You don't like weed. Maybe, maybe that's why I like lifting heavy things. Like I, not that I, I just, I just smoked a little mouth before I go into the grocery store. That's why you hate it. Doing fucking meth at the gym. It's a paranoid nightmare. What the fuck have I stumbled into this unnatural hellscape of plastic and sweating fucking narcissists? What world have I, but you know, I like, as you're talking like, there's a couple of things that occurred to me. One of them is a story I heard Jack, I think it was Jack Kornfield told this story. He was talking about how like in, you know, he went to, he's a Buddhist teacher. He went to Burma, I think he was in Burma to study Buddhism. He became a monk, shaved his head and studied Buddhism in Burma. And there were stories, you know, and there were one of the stories is like, and you hear this all, all the time, which is like, if you go, if you really do spend enough time sitting still and following your breath, you start getting, you crazy psychedelic shit starts happening to you. Like really crazy shit starts happening to you. Shit that like makes psychedelics seem like the difference between smelling a rose and an actual like, and it's smelling your actual rose and rose perfume. So it's like some of the experiences some of these people are having is like, oh, shit, that's what the psychedelic was mimicking synthetically. And this experience is the experience, you know, versus it's, and that's what I think one of the great gifts of psychedelics is that they give you a strange place you can place you can refer to if you decide to start like getting into like whatever it may be. Yeah, it's a little bit of a compass, I feel like. Yeah, it gives you points in the right direction. This reminds me, you could say, for example, you could say, this kind of reminds me of MDMA, the thing I'm feeling right now. This kind of reminds me of ketamine a little bit right now. This kind of reminds me. So it gives you this interesting thing you can refer to. But so this is one of the things they talk about. And they get really precise in their ability to kind of dial up certain states of consciousness in the same way. I'm very precise when it comes to dosing myself with psychedelics. I know the amount of this psychedelic or that psychedelic to microdose, and I can approximate what state of consciousness that's going to put me into. I know by now how to I know with beer, for example, I know what one beer feels like two beers feel like three beers feel like based on alcohol content, you know, that is that's a great trait. I get wrong sometimes of that. But you know, mostly like, I can guess what's going to happen if I drink that next fucking whiskey ginger, right? So so in the same way, like through a disciplined practice, apparently, and I now I'm completely speaking from other people's stories, not my own, you can begin to dial in certain states of consciousness through whatever the practice may be, breathwork, sleep deprivation, food deprivation, some combination of yogic poses mixed in with some kind of exposure to the elements mixed in with, you know, who knows what, but they have all these different ways or maybe just a basic understanding of the who knows, maybe they figured out a way to trigger certain, I don't know, neurotransmitters or maybe they, you know, they're there, who knows, who knows, but they can really go into these various states. And they have visions. And in these visions are can be so profound. And they get mystical, you know, like where people can travel, can like, you know, astrally project to other places and see things that are happening and predict the future and all the stuff that you fucking hear about, who knows. So Jack Hornfield tells a story that there was a monk who was like having all of these incredible visions and like all of these incredible experiences and been meditating for a while. And he was like, you know, witnessing what I guess you would, we would might call the DMT realm or the Iowa, you know, he's seeing spirits, talking to God, seeing the Buddha, seeing the Buddha field, seeing all the Buddha, seeing the, you know, the, the, where we're all headed, the ultimate final state of like pure enlightenment for the entire universe to, you sing it all. And so he went to this monk, the teacher who was out there in Burma to tell him all the shit that, man, I'm seeing the fucking Buddha field, man. I'm seeing the Buddha, I'm seeing the great chamber of enlightened beings that breeze the universe and do exist. I'm seeing it all, man. And the teacher said to him, you're missing the point. You're missing the point. It's not about the experiences that you're having. It's who are the experiences happening to? That's the question. Who are the experiences happening to? Who is this person that's feeling this thing or that thing? Who is it? And so, and that's an easy thing to miss. And I do it myself all the time. So like, this is the difference. This is where like, you talk to somebody who is fresh off a great DMT trip. And they're going to tell you some crazy shit, man. They saw, you know, listen to Terence McKenna's beautiful, flowery way of describing these fucking DMT trips. Oh my God, it's incredible. You feel like you're tripping yourself. Yeah. Some people, maybe they're not so good at it. It's like someone telling you a dream or something, but it's still, you know, whoa, what are you, whoa. And yet, all of that stuff, it's a way to distract yourself from a bigger question, which is who is this shit happening to? What am I? The experiencer, the thing that is like ascribing meaning and reason and oh, it's because of an evolutionary dynamic or it's because of the soul field or it's because I'm made of love or it's because this thing or that, who is made of love? Who is the soul? What is this thing that we are? What are we? What am I? What are you? Right. And that, to me, that's where the fucking rubber hits the road is that perpetually going back into that sense of like, what is this? What is the thing that is experiencing all of this stuff? I love just going back into that. What is that thing? And the more like that practice of like inquiry happens, I've noticed a kind of relief from the reactionary states, you know, it just feels like you become a little less reactionary when you're not so caught up and like, oh, I'm Shane, I'm Duncan, the podcaster, or I'm the comedian and this is why I do my podcast and this is why I do my comedy and this is why I make my art. Like you ask a fucking kid, it's one of the funniest things ever when you ask a kid who does something ridiculous, you know, you see these fucking kids, the YouTube videos, hilarious YouTube videos, they've covered themselves with paint. They got a can of paint out and they covered themselves with paint, they painted the fucking wall, they painted the bathroom. Yeah. And you say to them, why did you do that? And what do they say? I don't know. Yes. Because they're honest. Yeah, they don't know. They don't know why they fucking did that. They just did it. Who the fuck knows, dude? That's an adult question. You want to know why I did that? I don't fucking know. You sick motherfucker addicted to goddamn meaning. I know it is, it really is an addiction. But then it's like, it is, it's an addiction because we, but the somewhere in the exploration of the self. And it's a process, I think there is some kind of antidote to the horror. I will buy this pill for $1,000. This antidote to the whole, I just, I just have to stick this brick up my ass. You just shove a brick up your ass, Shane. Only $1,000. Listen, when I was told, this is literally just a red brick. Here's where it gets weird. So, you know, you're telling that story about the moustaches. So the man, the man who taught me this, it's really weird because he presented to me. He's like, he had this entire like, this like display of different and like pills, so to speak, enemas to shove up my ass. And there was, there was probably like 65 basic, normal sized butt plugs, but there was only one brick left. Oh, you needed it. And there's a line. I saw a lot of people iron that fucking brick. So I'm like, give me the brick. Yeah, it looks popular. That thing must work. It worked. It worked. So yeah, shove a brick up your ass. Well, I mean, on the, on the, when you pull it back out though, I think that just like right before exits, just leave it for just like another minute or two. Well, no, what you do is right as you're pulling it out, you ask yourself, who's ass is this? Well, it's also, it's also very subjective because we're like, we're living with our asses too, whereas like you ask someone else to describe. Yeah, it's just someone else to describe what they're seeing. Yeah. And people are going to have all sorts of different takes on, on what's going on. Well, the man who sold me the bricks, the brick man, he kept saying to me, who's ass is this? Just over and over again. It's my mantra. When things get rough, man, I just start chanting, who's ass is this, who's ass is this, who's ass is this, who's ass is this, who's ass is this, who's ass is this. It works every fucking time, man, because it's like, yeah, because it's like, you know, we're always getting bricks shoved in our ass, so to speak, you know. Well, life's going to shove a brick in your ass, whether you want it to or not. So, isn't it just better to have one in there? From one of your favorite podcasters, by the way, for only a thousand dollars. Guys, a thousand bucks and not only, if you order this today, if you order this today, use offer code enlightenment. Not only will you get a DTFH ass brick, but you will also get high fives from a lot of your friends. Yeah, for sure. You will get so many fucking high fives because like when, and I can tell, you know, these, like, this is like a lot of other podcasters, they sell t-shirts, whatever, fuck you. Uh-huh. We see each other, because I can tell if someone has a brick in their ass. By the look on their face, and I'll go to them like, dude, thank you for listening to the podcast. Quick question for you. Whose ass is my brick in right now? Whose ass is my brick in? Whose ass is my brick in? Shane, the next time you find yourself in bed, depressed, wondering if there's a point, just ask whose ass is this brick in. And there, my friend, is the secret and the point. See, like I said earlier, you just have this beautiful way of expressing everything in this way that just makes it all make sense to me. It's beautiful. I mean, that's, and that's, to my point, life is counterintuitive. Like that's not something, you know, when you grow up, they tell you like, you could be an astronaut or you could be president or something, and you like work really hard to try to do that. And the poor guy, Donald Trump gets up there to president and he's still not happy, still not. I'm going to be real honest with you, dude. Based on my deep understanding of whether or not someone has a brick in their ass, I don't want to get political here. Oh yeah. I mean, brick talk always goes this way, though. You got to expect. Listen, it has nothing to do with like whether you're a Republican Democrat, liberal or conservative. When I look at Donald Trump, I can tell you that guy's got a brick in his ass. Really? Yeah. He's carrying one around for sure. And, and it's helping him. I think, look at the, look at the unemployment. He's doing great. Yeah. Oh, those job numbers. You know, I think it's time for you to tell people where they can find you. And then after that, let's go shove bricks in our ass. Oh, sure. Sure. Well, whose ass is? Let's find out. The ass. The universal ass. What came first, the brick or the ass, at the start of all things. They both came together because they were in love. People can go to Shane Moss at USS.com. Am I really, I'm not, I'm not selling my website as, as well as you just sold that ass brick to me. But you can check out the Here We Are podcast. I interview different scientists each week and you can talk in, if it would mean a whole lot to me to see people. If it would be cool to get to premiere the, the film Psychonautics, a comics exploration of psychedelics to a packed house on June 15th at five o'clock. And there's also an after party serendipitously. There was this sci-fi or psychedelic festival happening that night. That is now like the official after party of the, of the premiere. And so people, people can get the, in the ticket stub, which is $15. We'll get you $15 off of this sci-fire event. And so, We'll be adding it to my calendar. That's awesome. So, yeah. So there's, there's going to be like Cole Marta and Dr. Terry, Terry Early. Cole's going to be there? Are all going to be like giving talks there, but there's also going to be music and art and all sorts of, it's a, it's going to be a big, awesome psychedelic, you know, awesome. That sounds like a blast. Yeah, yeah. Shane, thank you so much. It's always a pleasure to chat with you. Nice talking to you, buddy. That was Shane Moss, everybody. Go check out his movie. It looks amazing. Thanks for listening, everybody. Until next time, Hare Krishna. A good time starts with a great wardrobe. Next stop, JC Penney.

USAA means United Services Automobile Association and its affiliate, San Antonio, Texas. Greetings to you, beautiful friends. It is I.D. Trussell, and you are listening to the Ducket Trussell Family Hour podcast. This podcast that you're about to listen to actually happened with some synchronicity behind it. I've been looking into a kind of spiritual breathing, I guess you could call it, called TUMO. And then, of course, I got into Wim Hof. I'm sure you all have heard of him. He's somebody that uses a breathing method to shift the energy in his body so they could swim through glaciated water, like some kind of human polar bear. And then I started reading a little bit about pranayama, which is another form of energy breath work. And in the midst of my research into breathing techniques, I was contacted by today's guest, Brian McKenzie, who is not only a super athlete in ultramarathons, but is also an expert on various breathing techniques that can help you calm down or help you focus. I've been trying some of them, and they work, and it's super cool. And so if you're interested in breathing as more than just a thing to get oxygen in your body and CO2 out, this is the episode for you. Who would have thought that breathing is one of the ways to experience high-level psychedelic moments? It's true, and we talk about it in today's podcast. My dear loves, if you enjoy the DTFH, why not take the deep dive by going over to patreon.com forward slash DTFH, where you will get commercial-free episodes of this podcast, along with a lot of other stuff, including access to our Discord server, which is a thriving community of geniuses. And we have a video tier, where we all hang out three times a week. I hope you'll check it out over at patreon.com forward slash DTFH. We also have a shop located at dugoutrustle.com with beautiful ceremonial garments for you to adorn your precious, lotioned body with. And now, without further ado, I would like to introduce you to today's guest, Brian McKenzie. He is a human performance specialist. He runs marathons. He runs ultramarathons, and he trains people to get in amazing shape. This is a really fascinating conversation that has altered my life. I'm now using some of the breathing techniques that he taught me, and also that are on his website. And it really is helping me fall asleep at night. It's pretty incredible. So, without further ado, everybody please welcome to the DTFH Brian McKenzie. Welcome, welcome on you. That you are with us. Shake hands, no need to be blue. Welcome to you. It's the dugoutrustle. Brian, welcome to the DTFH. Man, I'm so excited to talk to you, and I got a lot of questions. So, forgive me if I start machine gunning you with questions. It's rare to get a chance to talk with someone like you. And somebody like me right now, I guess you could say I'm in hibernation when it comes to working out, though I used to love running, and I just can't get over that hill. And so, I just want to start with a question that's going to seem like juvenile, idiotic, stupid attempt to be funny, and it's none of those things I really mean. You are a comedian. Yeah, but I would never do this. I would never do this with a guest, a joke up front. But really, man, when I'm reading about, like, Goggins, and then I'm reading about you running these ultramarathons, and then, you know, getting ready for this conversation, I was just looking at videos of the Angelus Crest ultramarathon, and it just looks brutal, and I have to ask this. Where do you poop when you're running 100 miles? Well, I mean, in the woods, if that's where you're at. If you're at an aid station, there's usually a porta-potty. Oh, I get it. Okay, I feel so dumb. You know, in my head, I was making the... I was over-rugged. No, no, I mean, but make no mistake. I mean, I wouldn't... I mean, look, I mean, I don't run Ultras anymore, but, you know, when doing it, there probably isn't an Ultrarunner out there who hasn't shit in the woods. Okay, gotcha. I mean, it just makes sense. I don't know why... I figured it was something like that. I don't know why I thought... What did they... I don't know. In my head, it's such a brutal, rugged thing that you don't even shit, or you're... I don't know. Now it all makes sense. That was a dumb question. If you're out there... No, if you're... I mean, if you're out there long enough, you're going to, at some point, because you do have to take in calories, and you're... You know, at some point, your digestive system is going to have to expel things. So... Okay, I gotcha. And that leads into the next question, because, you know, when a lot of people hear about the type of workouts that you have advocated, you are a controversial figure in the exercise world, they... A lot of people think that's how you get hurt. The workouts in power, speed, and endurance, your book, one of your books, you know, when I was researching you, I was pretty surprised by how controversial you are. How many articles there are out there saying, like, you could really damage yourself. And certainly with ultramarathons, you can hurt yourself. And I'm not asking you that question to be controversial. I'm asking you that question in the hopes that you can sort of banish that fear from some people's minds who maybe are interested in the type of exercise regimen you advocate, but are sort of afraid of brutalizing their bodies or something. Certainly. So, I mean, the foundation of what it is, what I teach, is really a skill-based approach to anything. So think of it kind of as like the martial arts in essence. You enter the martial arts and basically every single system, you're a white belt for like a year, where you're just basically learning the skill and something like jiu-jitsu, which everybody's really aware of at this point, that's like, you basically are just learning to defend yourself, even though you're not really defending yourself very well. And that's essentially what we've done is we've taught more or less a skill-based approach to human movement, whether that's with endurance and understanding principles behind how to run in a way that's not going to damage you and then actually increasing intensity. So take, for instance, if we were to teach you how to run better, right? And using these principles. You'd go out, you'd do some drills and some work around this, and you'd spend the majority of your time doing that. Then you'd enter into doing something like, let's say 200 meter repeats. You'd only be doing those repeats till you could not maintain form and recover from those things. The basic idea that the public and the vast majority of people have taken on is I'm just going to go out and run until I hurt. Yeah. And then I'm going to stop. We don't advocate that in the slightest. So the approach we've taken is totally the opposite of what people are doing. And pain, I saw this in a recent Johnny Depp movie, but it's awesome, but it's like he said, pain is the only truth. Now, pain is not the only truth, but the fact is, pain is nature's way of saying wrong and understanding what that pain is. There's differences in pain, like psychological pain, et cetera. When I'm talking about working out or taking care of yourself, pain's there for a reason. It's there to tell you to stop doing this this way. Unfortunately, most people who get caught up in exercise regimes or even in movement practices, including yoga, will take things to the point where they're in pain and this may take some time to get there, like years to get there, and then all of a sudden they're in chronic pain and then they have to stop doing what they're doing until the pain goes away, and then they repeat the same process to getting back to where they were at and then run right back into that pain again, never correcting what the problem was, which is ultimately just a manifestation of how you're not paying attention to the physiological signals that are going on in your body in the first place. It seems like that flies in the face of every shitty gym coach I've ever had in high school, which is the idea is like, pain is weakness leaving your body. That's how you know you are working out the right amount as you start hurting and then you continue working out even though you're hurting and then the next day you're incredibly sore and then you think to yourself, wow, I did a great workout. So that's all wrong. Well, in essence, yeah. Look, I understand that and I can empathize with that and there's actually some truth to that, like pain is weakness leaving the body. Like there isn't a cell in your body that doesn't benefit from stress. And I mean, ultimately what we teach right now is we've actually gone down, we've gone back to the beginning of everything with what we do in understanding breath work as kind of something that like, I mean, look, like yoga's been taught and like yoga's been talking about breath work for 5,000 years at the baseline of the foundation of its practice, right? So it's the oldest movement practice we know of and at the foundation of it, they've been talking about breathing, pranayama, right? And there's various forms of, or various methods within inside the idea of yoga, but the fact is, is a yoga practice itself has breath work attached to it. And so we've actually, we've actually cattle it, use this to kind of bring a reality check to fitness. And so coming back to your idea about pain as weakness leave you the body, there's a real reason why you actually have acidic pain in your body when you're working out hard. And that's because you're actually becoming acidic. And your cells are actually getting stressed to the point to where they're going to make some real adaptations, but we as a society or we as a kind of, yeah, we as a society globally look at this as, well, I got to get right back to working hard the next day. Right. And that's not how that really works. So that's where, yeah, you should take it to the limit on certain days, but then you're going to need some time and some in other places like maybe mobility or yoga or going easy and then coming back to going hard another day. Okay. But understanding that. Yeah. I'm interested in the breath in breath work. I've been looking into it because the David Nickton, I work with him. He's my meditation teacher. And he was just talking about this, this teacher, Delgo Kensei Rinpoche, who was the Dalai Lama's teacher. And he was talking about tumor breathing, which is reminded me of some of the breathing techniques that I saw in some of your YouTube videos also reminded me of Wim Hof a little bit, but he was just saying that some of these like Rinpoches, they don't even, they don't sleep that much, but they have this breathing technique that makes it so that they have just all this energy and it sounds insane, but that, and I'm sure you've heard this, that some of them can lay in the snow and from this exercise melt the steam or rise out of their bodies. Can you explain what that is physiologically and how that parallels the type of breath work that you teach? Yes, sir. So what I do is, so basically everything I do is we teach principles. So we teach truths, right? We teach physiological facts and orchestrate those so that people can actually navigate them, right? So in that, I've gone and studied some of Tumo. I've gone and studied Wim Hof. I used to be very close to Wim Hof. I've studied a number of yoga, yogic breathing exercises. We've studied all this stuff, but where our work really sits is really understanding why we breathe and what this does. And so with Tumo, what, the reason some of these individuals don't need to sleep that much is because they can put themselves into such a deep state of relaxation that their body's actually mending itself almost in a sleep-like state. That's what you will see with high-level meditators. Like any science that's done on high-level meditators, you'll see brain waves that are reminiscent of deep sleep, of sleep that's very deep, right? So this is why they, and they're not very reactive people, kind of like, you know, like you and I, like you're a stand-up comedian by trade, right? Sure. Like you've got to be on, dude. And that on, if that carries on throughout your day, well, that's what these people don't really do. They're very calm and responsive to things. And it's not one way is right or one way is wrong. It's everything comes with consequences. They're not going to be a stand-up comedian. They're not going to empower the world through comedy. You are, right? Yeah. They're going to empower people through getting more interceptive, right? And getting deeper layered into themselves. Something that actually, you know, you are interested in. So Tumo then takes it a step further with understanding the breath control and how to actually manipulate the physiology to shut down some of the sympathetic and bring in more parasympathetic or bring in more sympathetic and, and, and decrease parasympathetic. Would you mind doing a quick sympathetic, parasympathetic refresher course for some of the listeners? Certainly. Very, very simple. So our autonomic nervous system has three parts, but the two main parts are the sympathetic, which is our survival state, which is our stress state. Okay. And then our parasympathetic is our rest state or our, our response state. This is where we make adaptations to everything we do. So think of like learning to swim or learning to ride a bike as a kid, like how frustrating that might have been or if you've got kids, you've watched your kids do this and how frustrated they are at first. But then all of a sudden it's like one day they wake up and they go in and they do it and they're doing it perfectly fine. Yes. That's, that's that transfer over of using these states, right? But we're in, in flux with this throughout our entire day. Our autonomic nervous system is always on and it's on as it alludes to autonomic. So autopilot. The beauty of this is, is that our survival state or our stress state, we actually know and we, we, we need, right? And we're the only species on this planet that understands that we can actually self induce a high stress situation to create adaptive processes. It's how you got good at doing standup comedy. Right. Whoa. That's crazy. You know, it's like trauma bonding or like when you're in an intense situation, like you got it. You're in it with, you become friends with them. Yeah. Whoa. Think of the first time you went up on stage, how good were you? So horrible. So horrible. And how, and then how long did that take till you were really good at it? I never got good at it. Well, you're, you're pretty good. I've seen you do stand up. Like, look, look, look, and like I talk in front of crowds, right? And my life, like talking in front of 10 people was very different than talking in front of thousands of people. Right. Like that's like a very big difference, but that's all in my head. So the better I can control that. And so check this out. We have a way of controlling that that we're not really aware of. Some people are, but not everybody. And our breathing is a direct connection to taking control of our autonomic arousal states. And so if I'm in a high stress situation, if I choose to engage my breathing in a specific way, I can actually calm myself down and bring more parasympathetic tone into it so that I'm actually more aware of what's going on. Think of a high stress situation, like our current situation with, you know, like what's going on in the political scene and everything is like, like the cops, think of a cop controlling his breathing versus just not controlling his breathing and not being aware of it. I actually teach this with cops and with operators like special forces folks. And, you know, even doctors in high, high stress situations, ERs, things like that, we teach this stuff.

This is what I've noticed when I'm stressed out because I meditate and sometimes I'll apply mindfulness to when I'm really stressed out just to look at what's happening. And one thing I noticed is my breathing gets really shallow and it, you know, like how it's a weird thing. Like if you, if you're not drinking enough water, obviously get dehydrated, but then to get back to hydration, you kind of almost have to go against what your body wants. It's really weird. Like you just have to just start chugging water. Then all of a sudden you get, you get back in the flow of drinking enough water. I've noticed with breathing that, you know, when the more stressed out I get, the more shallow my breathing gets. And I don't want to take deep breaths. You know, there's some force. Yeah. What is that? That's your sympathetic nervous system going haywire. So we, we're, we're this, most of our work right now is right in the world of what you're talking about. And the, you know, although we've also brought this into high performance training, whether we're talking with MMA fighters or big wave surfers or whatever type of athlete, we're also introducing this, the concepts of these things because it's, it's really all the same. So from, from a psychological standpoint, high stress, you know, like shallow breathing, that has metabolic consequences meaning there is caloric output that is happening for that. Right. Like, like a grandmaster chess player can burn 6,000 calories a day sitting at a table playing chess. Right. Yeah. Yeah. We're under the impression that we need to go work out all day in order to do that. And that's not true. So what, what's happening is, is these, when we get into these high stress situations, when the shallow breathing is kicking in as our sympathetic nervous systems on override and we're not paying close enough attention to the physical, the signals that most animals would, right? Like we, I have a very, we have a theory that, you know, like we like to talk about, well, I need to go get out into nature, right? Yeah. Well, here's, here's something shocking. You are nature. Right. You need to get into you. And, and that's what we need to do and start to pay attention to. And this is why we live in such a reactive society is because we're not actually paying attention to ourselves. And we think this nature thing is something that we're not a part of when in fact we are as much a part of it today as we were at any point. We're just not participating in the wild. Okay. I gotta stop you man because you're tripping me out because today. Yeah. I don't mean to keep saying I was, I'm not, it's not like I'm proud of meditating. I'm here to, yeah. But I'm, I was sitting today, you know, watching my breath and I started thinking just what you're, I was like, what's the difference between watching my breath and like watching tides go in and out or watching wind blow through trees? It was this moment of like, holy shit, this is like, this is this ancient river that runs through everybody and it's like, it is all of your, your existence depends on it. It's flow. But yeah, people don't, when they're watching their breath or thinking about their breath, they don't think, well, this is identical to glaciers or forests or all the beautiful things in the natural world. It's interesting. So you would think, oh, I need to go outside. I got you. That's cool. It's like, so what I do is I take that woo woo psychedelic thing and I make sense of it because the fact is, is that's all energy and alls we are is a, is, is the universe using energy in a human form. And the only way we have to manage energy is through breathing and that just so happens to be connected into our psychology as well. So there's no escaping what it is, right? So if I'm tripping out, if I'm freaking out or if I'm depressed, I'm going to have a breathing pattern that's attached to that because carbon dioxide is the reason that we take a breath. It's not oxygen. So contrary to what we all believe or behave as is like, hey, I need to breathe because oxygen. Well, yeah, you need to breathe because of oxygen, but you're not breathing because of oxygen. You're actually breathing because carbon dioxide is triggering in something in your brainstem to tell you when to breathe. That's why when we hold our breath, we need to breathe, right? Like you're freaking, you start to freak out if you're holding your breath, right? That's carbon dioxide. That's not oxygen. If we were to put a pulse ox on you, your oxygen levels wouldn't drop real far. Like they would be in normal ranges. Wow. But your CO2 levels would go up. And so this is the, this is where we need to understand kind of this, this yin-yang concept of like inflow with nature, right? Yeah. Like oxygen is like the yin and carbon dioxide is the yang. And so when we actually move energy because we don't create it. Okay. And this is another myth. We don't create energy. We just move it. There is no less or more energy in this universe than, than has ever existed. It's always been here. Right. It's just moving it from one thing to the next. All stuff you kind of understand, right? Yeah, sure. And so we're taking oxygen in and we're, we're using beta oxidation or aerobic metabolism to break that down, whether with carbohydrate or fats. And the byproduct of that becomes, and this is very simple stuff that I'm breaking down. It gets more complex than this, but we don't need to do that. So the byproduct of that becomes water and carbon dioxide. And the only way for that carbon dioxide to leave is the same way the oxygen came in. And ironically, the oxygen only becomes bio available if there's enough carbon dioxide in those cells, the red blood cells. Wow. And then, so if I'm high stress and I've got shallow breathing and I'm breathing out of my mouth, I'm offloading more carbon dioxide than I need to. And so I start to burn through more carbohydrates, which is also triggering fast energy sources, which is limited. And so we start to move towards this more sympathetic, like we started off with this sympathetic place in our autonomic nervous system that puts us in this high stress environment. So if I am somebody who's constantly on making animated shows on Netflix and going and doing standup TV and like all this stuff, I've got to really learn how to manage my shit. So that I can actually sleep at night so that I can recover enough to like bounce back the next day. And also I've got a kid and a wife, right? I've got this whole process of life going on. And it's like, well, what do I do? Do I do two mode? Do I do a Wim Hof? That's right. You do what works for you. But first we've got to understand where that really, why we're actually doing these things. And we're doing it because CO2 is actually telling us to breathe and how to move energy. And so when I slow the breathing down and I breathe more out of my nose, right? So if I'm nasal breathing, I'm automatically putting in more parasympathetic tone. And so the reason for this is because I'm limiting how much carbon dioxide comes out. So if you take a breath in through your nose and out through your nose right now, just... Right? Yeah. Now do one through your mouth. See the difference in how fast that happened? Yeah. Yeah, totally. All right. So check this out. So we're going to run a little experiment for you and the listeners, right? So just 10 control... Oh, let's just go five. We'll go five controlled breaths with the nose. Okay? All the way in, all the way out. There's two, all the way in, all the way out. There's three, all the way in, all the way out. And four. Last one and five. All right. Solid. How do you feel after doing that? Great. A little calmer? Yeah. All right, perfect, perfect. Now check this out. Let's do 10 mouth breaths all the way in, all the way out. Okay. Three, four, five, seven. And 10. Good. Hold on one second. Hey, it's just, it's just beneath. Go say hi. So here's what happened. Well, how do you feel? Like, you know, slightly hyperventilated. Yeah, but stressed more, right? Yeah. Yeah. Just like, yeah. So one activated your sympathetic nervous system. One activated your parasympathetic nervous system. That's so cool. Right? Yeah. But we can use these things in special ways in order to manipulate our own physiology, right? Right. Like, so if I actually were to continue breathing through my mouth, if I'm intentionally doing this, I can start to up-regulate myself pretty good. 10 breaths is pretty good for most people, right? Yeah. And you can go 20 or 30 and like Wim Hof does 30 breaths like this, right? Then you hold your breath on an exhale and people hold their breath on an exhale for a really long period of time because we'll go back to this thing that I was talking about with carbon dioxide because we got rid of most of the CO2. So we've gotten rid of the trigger mechanism to tell us when to breathe. So now the oxygen levels plummet when we do something like the Wim Hof method and we, and the body's idea or understanding of this is, oh, shit, the oxygen levels are really low right now. I'm going to prepare you for death. So we go into this kind of deep, euphoric, death-like place. What? Well, and if you've read anything like about, like, like, I mean, like, I have some theories about Christianity. I mean, if you've read the sacred, you know, the, the, what's the cross and the sacred mushroom? The sacred mushroom and the cross. Oh, yes. John Marcus. Yep. Yeah. I know what you're talking about. Right. So, so look, like when you, like a lot of these things people have been playing with, there are actually, there are actually sects of Christianity that used to use breath work, but got banned. Like you can keep going layers deep with this stuff and starting to look back and, and there's things that have been used within many different religions and many different indigenous cultures that people avoided because for whatever reasons, control, whatever's going on, it got a little out of control. Who knows, whatever. Yeah. But the fact is, is when the body gets ready for death, there's this process that happens where you kind of go into this euphoric state and that process is indicative is across the boards that happens to every one of us when our oxygen levels get low. But oxygen's not the reason we're taking a breath. It's carbon dioxide. So when we take it to the other side of things, like slow controlled breathing, pranayamas, things like that, we're actually developing a higher tolerance to this carbon dioxide, which is actually teaching us how to use more of the oxygen efficiently. So aerobic metabolism. So this is why so many people who take, take, like dedicate their lives to breath practices and meditation are deep level thinkers. They are hot. Like they can handle loads of stress without reacting to it. Yeah. They're very responsive to it because their body is actually using oxygen at a very, very high level in a deep meditative place because they're controlling that carbon dioxide. It's weird to me. You know, there's, it's weird to me that, that you really do have to learn how to breathe. It's one of those things that people assume they're experts at. And you know, when I hear about breath work, it's wild because you realize, oh, shit. This is a, actually it can in some, like if you look at some of the pranayama practices in particular, holding the nostrils and like, it's, it can get quite complex. It's not just like you know how to breathe because you can breathe anymore than, you know, you know how to have sex just because you can fuck, right? It's the same thing. Just because you think you're compassionate doesn't, you're not born with compassion. That's another idea is that you have to develop it. It's a thing you cultivate deep. Can you talk a little bit? This is a place in pranayama where I have gotten kind of, I've kind of rolled my eyes a little bit, but listening to you talk now, I think, oh, it's probably, obviously it's I'm rolling my eyes at a 5,000 year old practice. But what's the deal with the not pushing one nostril down and like breathing in and out of different nostrils? Is that bullshit? Why does that really? No, no, you can actually activate more things just because there's more activity on one side of particular branches of things and then the other, right? So you're getting activation of certain things, like, you know. And so our physiology actually, like, look, the system is perfect, except we've just fucked it up because we've decided to live these very non natural lifestyles where we sit more often than we've ever had, like we eat foods that are more processed. We, you know, we we we're less active, you know, like, this is why we have to actually teach breathing. If we were out in the wild, we wouldn't have to actually teach the breathing because you would actually fall right into place, like you'd fall in like an animal. And if you watch animals, like it's radical, man, like most of them, you know, like, like you won't see animals breathing out of their mouth unless they're overheating or dying. Whoa. So you can watch a lion hunt and you can watch antelopes run and you can watch dogs do things. But the moment they're either overheating, like, look, a horse doesn't actually open its mouth. Unfortunately, they've got a bit in its mouth, but it can't actually really breathe through its mouth, even a racing horse, because it's not efficient enough to get the air through the system, which works high level for a horse. Right. So like, but we're really like the nose was designed with the respiratory system in mind. It was not designed like the mouth was designed with the communication and digestive system in mind, even though in emergency situations, like emergency type efforts, like when we talk or when we're working really, really, really, really, really hard, you're going to divert to the mouth breathing, right? Right. So going back to the nose and your pranayama on one side or the other, you actually have a rectile tissue in your nose. What? Yes. So like your nipples and your scrotum and your wiener, right? Like, or the clitoris for the ladies, you have a rectile tissue in your nose and it's constantly adjusting based on the needs of the system. Whoa. And so one nostril will be open, one nostril will be closed. And so when we manipulate these things through specific pranayamas, we're manipulating specific things, but you actually have to get to a specific level to actually even be able to feel these sorts of things. You mean what you're saying? You're stimulating or you're stimulating a rectile tissue in your nose. Yes. Yes. Yeah. There's a reason why when you start moving, like if you like, let's say you started walking up the stairs and you had your mouth shut and all of a sudden your breath rate goes up, but your nose was clogged or you had a cold, your nose will open up. As soon as your metabolic rate goes up enough, that erectile tissue will be triggered to open up more. That is insane. I had no idea that that's. Yeah. You have, like look, you've got as many hair follicles in that nose as you do on your head. What? Yeah, like look, that alone should tell you that there's a filtering system in there for a reason. And it's the first line of defense for your immune system. Wow. The air you breathe. Holy shit. This is crazy. Like that's a completely redefines the rest of my life, knowing that there is a rectile tissue, nose boners that I could like. Yes. That's the craziest thing, but it totally makes sense. Wow. That's really intense, man. And so you're saying like, I mean, this is, if someone is a non-discipline breather, it's a classic insult. You call them a mouth breather, right? It's like associated with lack of discipline. It's associated. Wow. Friends, websites are way more than something that you use just for a business.

There is something wrong. And unfortunately, I would say about 80% of the population is dealing with something like this. There's dyspnea about a breathing disorder that is probably 80% of the population. So how do you fix it? What's a way? Because whenever I've read about Pranayama, I do feel a little intimidated by it. It seems like it's the kind of thing that you have to, even the Wim Hof method, it's a big lifestyle change. So when you're starting to work with people, what are the beginning steps to get your breathing in order? Really, it's really understanding what works for you. And most people are just looking to get something to get them calmer, to just chill out. And their methods are many, principles are few. And so what we do is we actually, what we've started to understand, what we're discovering is, is that CO2 is the metabolic stress messenger. And this is language we're coming up with, because we've been looking at this so much. And so getting an accurate snapshot of that, we found that there, so there's a lot of ways that people have used to understand how well they tolerate CO2. One's a breath hold, one's called a bolt test that was done by the butaiko method, but that's just a method and it's a very subjective test. The other one we stole from the freediving world, we feel it's probably the most valid one test. And that is a max exhale test. And so just chilling out and doing some very calm breathing, after calming down, you want to test how long you can inhale, trying to inhale, exhale as slow as you possibly can under a timer, without watching the time until you have to run out of air, you need to breathe, right? Right. And so you exhale as long and as slow as you possibly can. That time can then be equated to some specific rhythms that we have. And on our website, which is shiftadapt.com, under breathing, there's a breath calculator. It's free. And there's seven different protocols that we offer. There's three different apneas and four different cadences. And the first cadence for most people, they're going to fall under a 30-second CO2 tolerance test. The first rhythm that they should actually start with is just an inhale, an equal, in and out. And using your CO2 tolerance test, that'll kind of tell you exactly where you should start, whether it's like a three-second in, three-second out, which is also known as like coherent breathing. But that goes right past that method if that doesn't calm you enough, right? So then you go four in, four out, or then maybe five in, five out. You just work up a ladder, right? Like I just did a whole series on this on my Instagram, which I broke down each of these different kind of rhythms in understanding. And so the rhythms change where it's just inhale, exhale. And then it goes up to inhale, hold, exhale. Then it goes inhale, hold, exhale, hold, which is box breathing. Then you do a pranayama, which is an inhale, hold, double time, exhale, hold. And so all of these are on there, and you can just input your CO2 tolerance test if you do it, and you can get all these protocols and play around with them. And there's instructions there to what you could do and how you can use this in an appropriate way to actually understand, well, how am I going to get myself to chill out? Well, play with this and see how this makes you feel. And here's why this is why we give seven different protocols is we all deal or manage stress very differently. Like Duncan and Brian handle stress very different, right? Right? That's a no-brainer. Well, since carbon dioxide is the stress molecule and the metabolic stress molecule and my brain stem is what dictates how I take a breath based on CO2, this would mean that we all vary in where we should be with inside the spectrum of a breath practice. So finding a rhythm that works for you is entirely in your creative wheelhouse. We're just kind of giving you the tool and kind of the idea to start and not pigeon holding you into, hey, you need to go do five-in, five-hold, five-out, five-hold and repeat that. And that's going to be your method. That's going to work for some people, but not everybody. Gotcha. Let me ask you, on a scale of like one being stressed out and 10 being Xanax, do you think breathing can get you as relaxed as like a benzo or some of the medications people have for anxiety? Oh, yes. For sure. For sure. I've heard that, and that's another thing. I've scoffed at, you know, this is... Well, I mean, what is addiction? Addiction is nothing more than the nervous system trial, an attempt to regulate the nervous system. Right. And so, literally, like I'm going after a reward here, and, you know, that, getting an understanding of that and going, okay, well, I mean, I've just, like, breathing is literally the remote control to the nervous system. Wow, that's nice. You have your interceptor point with breathing. Now, I'm not going to say just going, inhale, exhale is going to be, you know, like a benzo. Like, we may need to do some serious breath work in order to get you to really get yourself to calm down and understand things, but there's a good damn reason why breathing is at the foundation of every single serious meditation practice that exists. Everything. The one I do is not change your breath, it's just follow your breath, but when you look at all the other... Are you doing vipassana? Well, yes, but it's even, I hesitate to even call it that, just, but it's like, I'm a basic student, man. It's just a, yes, but yes, that is what you would call, that's actually, I think, probably the next... Just paying attention to your breath, breath is basically, is the, you know, the foundation of the course. Yes, but it hasn't gotten into the body scanning and stuff, not to get like meditation nerdy or whatever, but it's very close. But yeah, this is the, you know, these are things that one of the, you know, one of the things that Ram Dass would say is that there are practices that involve breath that will get you as high as any of the psychedelics out there, that there is a way to... Oh, I mean, I've gone, I've done, I mean, I've, I've experimented in the psychedelic realm, my friend. And I, the biggest trip I ever had was breathing. From holotropic breath work. Is that what you did? The graph stuff? Yeah. Yeah. It was a version of holotropic breath work. I started a time warp, like went into a wormhole, like I blacked out one of this wormhole, came out 15 years later where I lived out my life, like in the past. What the fuck? It was crazy, dude. And I can't... It's hyperventilating. I'm sorry. Before I want to hear how I definitely want to hear this experience. Yeah. But I also want to know how to do it myself. So did you, what was it? Just like hyperventilating or, you know, I've, I've been so, and this is so my own stupid hippie hubris that whenever I hear, and people I really trust will say, no, you holotropic breath work will, you will trip. And I always think, oh yeah, I did that when I was in elementary school. We, you know, hyperventilate. Yeah. Hyperventilate and choke ourselves. Yeah. Go lights out. Yeah. That's, is that what it, that's not what it is. That's, it's... No, so sort of, it's sort of similar, similar, right? Like, so, you know, you, there is a hyperventilation component to it. And there's, you're, you're looking to change blood pressure after you've gotten the, the pH of the blood to shift up a little bit, to become more alkaline. And the system, again, only, like it recognized, like your, your physiology, like your mind is the only thing that's actually comp, like creating the stories around the shit that you're doing, right? Right. The system, the rest of the, the system works perfectly fine and only, only responds to what it understands. And so if I become too alkaline and then I create some pressure, or if I, or if I become too acidic and do things, my, my physiology will respond, right? Right. And so the physiology responds by preparing you for death. This is what this stuff is, man. And you know, it should be done. I don't want to get into too much of the detail because it's like, you know, like people could get really hurt. That's what everyone says, too. Oh yeah. This is probably the third time when I've been asking someone to explain all the tropic breath work in a flippant way that someone, well, all the tropic breath work simply hyperventilating for a very long period of time. It's a pain in the ass. There's quicker ways to get to the place. But even those people are like, this is actually dangerous. Like this is a powerful thing. It is dangerous. Like, I mean, look, if you have, if you have any sort of cardiac issues, you should not be invested in any sort of hyperventilation technique breathing. We call it superventilation work because it's actually intended. Hyperventilation is a chronic problem, so superventilation work is like I'm intending to do something right now to myself. And so the, you know, holotropic breathing is simply, you know, you're simply lying there hyperventilating for a long period of time, but you have somebody there because what happens is is respiratory alkalosis kicks in. And so your system starts to shut itself down and you start to go into these states and a guide is there for two reasons, to keep you hyperventilating and to make sure nothing shitty happens to you because you can have, you can go into cardiac arrest because what happens when we engage this hyper superventilation techniques is when you become more sympathetic, you constrict the blood vessels. So when you did the fast 10 breaths with the mouth, you felt a little high, you felt a little stressed out, right? Those were the blood vessels in your brain constricting. Those were the blood vessels in your heart constricting. Okay? So the system's going, okay, fine, I'm going to make you a little bit more euphoric so you slow the fuck down and you chill the fuck out so that like, it's the system's beautifully designed. There is no problem with the system. The problem is, is the thinker, right? The storyteller. And this is why, you know, you're a storyteller. I'm a storyteller. That's what I do when I talk is I like to weave stories about nature and what we're not paying attention to, right? Yes. And like what animals naturally do. Animals are like, even though we're the most evolved species and the only reason we're the most evolved species, like we haven't been able to prove this with science. But what I can factually say is that because we understand adaptation, we understand we can actually make a stressful situation and then back off and adapt to that process like becoming a big rave surfer or, you know, skateboarding around or becoming a stand-up comedian. Yeah. Right? Like I know I can engage in this and if I repeat these because I'm frustrated enough to engage in this and then take a break from it, I will get better at it. Right. And this is my passion and what I want to do, right? Yes. Every other animal just basically does like whatever it's like, it's genetics are actually telling it best to do, but they pay attention to that, right? We also have the ability like we have. We put ourselves in every single environment on this planet. No other animal can do that. No other animal has done that. Right. So, right? Like, and so where animals are excellent is in transitioning. Like an lion that sits there and hunts antelope, they exist with antelope, no problems. Like 99% of the time. And the antelope don't hold no grudge. Right. And we just know when the big animal moves in a specific way to get the F out of there. That's so funny. Antelopes don't get revenge. There's no antelope vendetta. No. Lions will be fucked. No. If you're like, look, dude, like, I mean, you know, like this is the reality of it. So the lion won't even hunt really during the day, but then at night, like all of a sudden nocturnal turns on, right? And so the lion actually engages and it's like, all right, I'm going to screw around. The antelope knows instinctively that if the lion is within 200 meters, it's screwed, right? So it never lets it within 200 meters. So it just meanders in 200 meters. So when the lion gets within 200 meters, it's on, right? And so what happens is, is let's say the antelope gets away immediately. Like moves. Okay. So what does the lion do? It goes and lies down and chills out and cuddles with its cubs and pride and that maybe takes another nap and then it gets back up, sees an opportunity and goes for it again. Lies down, takes a nap and goes for it again. And then all of a sudden it gets on it and it's on it and it's chasing it. It's going and going and going. Here's the trippy part, right? Like, like we've all seen this on the nature channel. Boom, the lion's chasing the antelope. And all of a sudden we remove the visual and you put up a dashboard of each animal and their physiology, the heart rate, the respiration rate, the pupil size, like everything that's going on that you can think of physiologically. But I mix up the dashboards, which, which animals, which you don't know. There is no, we don't know. And now we insert a human being who's in the situation. Right. They've got a dashboard and they're at work freaking out, which animal was which. You can't tell because they're all in a survival state and their physiology is all doing the same thing. Wait, wait, wait. You're saying a human stress that at work, the fizzy physiologically looks like a guy. High stress. Yes. Yeah. You are correct. No joke. No joke. High stress workout. High stress at work. This is why I said chess players burn 6,000 calories, right? It's like that mind, all the physiologies going off, respiration rate changes. Everything starts to change. And so all of this is going on, but here's the beauty in what we're missing and where the opportunity exists for us. What happens when the lion doesn't catch the antelope after that gnarly attack? No, no, he goes, he goes and takes off. He goes and takes a map and he doesn't go on Instagram and talk about it. Right? Like he doesn't have to go take a selfie about it. And I'm not saying no, go on Instagram, but what does the antelope do? The antelope goes back to within two minutes. Within two minutes, that antelope is back to grazing and maybe mating if it can. Or if it's in season, it doesn't matter. It'll mate and it'll shit. So that that in there, right there within minutes, that animal has down regulated to a parasympathetic process. We also know the parasympathetic side of things is our rest, digest, reproduce, modern day version, sleep, eating, shitting and sex life. What's going on? How are those things? If those things are in shambles, guess what? You are sympathetically dominant and charged. And so what happens to the human in this? The human at work who stressed out goes and sits in traffic and gets pissed off and validates himself about how angry is that he gets about being in traffic, then goes home and doesn't know how to deal with the kids and is pissed off and then has an emotional reaction to something that he doesn't even understand. He has his emotion too because he wasn't paying attention to the physiology before that. Gotcha. Gotcha. Yeah. This is this is like people who have been to Trump problems with trauma. Is there constantly strut? They can't think there's they don't know how to unwind. They can never relax in that is deadly, right? Correct. And I'm, it doesn't mean go take a nap after a high stress situation, but it does mean if you went into a meeting or you just got charged up with your kids or something, if you don't learn how to downshift real quick, that is going to own you. And then you're going to blame it on something you do not understand. My friend of mine has a quote. We cannot control what we do not understand even if we could control it in the first place. Right. And that's, that's the thing is it's like, well, I don't like, I don't even understand the emotions I'm feeling right now because they're so out of whack because they're so far back down like at the beginning of my day that I didn't pay attention to and shift or process. And I mean, what is trauma, dude? It's unprocessed information. That's it. And it's like, I'm not invalidating trauma. We all have trauma. But if I don't process this correctly and come down off that mountain and figure out another way to look at that thing, I will never move on from that. And that will trigger an emotional response to everything and anything that I have. And this is why breathing is so important is because it gives us the opportunity to intercept the physiological response that's going on. Much thanks to purple for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH. My friends, I have a purple pillow and it's like owning something that fell off the Starship Enterprise. They use high tech, bizarre materials, maybe quantum materials. I don't know. They're probably not going to like that I said that they might use quantum materials because it says right here that they use a comfort technology that instantly adapts to your body and sleep style. It's open air channels and temperature, neutral composition, eliminate pressure and keep you cool all at once. But my brain converts that to quantum materials that seem to have fallen off of a spaceship. It's crazy. I know you've seen a zillion mattress commercials out there. And I know if you've seen a purple commercial and you've got any kind of weird Carl Sagan skeptical being living inside of you, you might have thought I don't know if anything could be high tech, especially when it comes to bedding, which theoretically people have been using for millennia. But it's amazing. You got to try it out. I really love my purple pillow and that's not just because they're paying me to say good things about their product. Purple is fantastic. Their proprietary technology has been innovating comfort for over 15 years. You could try every purple product risk-free with free shipping and returns and purple has financing available as low as 0% APR for qualified customers. Experience the purple grid and you'll sleep like never before. Go to purple.com slash Duncan 10 and use promo code Duncan 10 for a limited time. You'll get 10% of any order of $200 or more.

I recognize there are a lot of unscrupulous pillow vendors out there right now. I'm not naming any names, but I've tried one of those and it's just a pillow. This is different. I don't, I do know what's in there because they say what's in there, but it's, it's something magical. It's, it levitates your head basically. It feels good. It's weird. I love it. So give them a shot. If you're looking for a new mattress or you want a cool pillow, purple, thanks for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH. Do you think, so particularly with trauma, there, there's, there's a lot of different ideas about it, but it won't, the similarity with the MDMA therapy. And I can't remember the name of the therapy where they get people to move their eyes. Yep. That is, is what you're saying. This idea of it's, this is data that hasn't been stored. It's a problem with memory. But do you think that breathing, like let's say you don't, you have repressed memories. You can't remember what the fuck happened. You just know something bad happened. Do you think just learning how to breathe in a way that is, no, no, no, no, I don't fit. So I want to be very clear. I don't think breathing is the answer. I think breathing is the tool is a tool. Gotcha. It is a, it is a motherfucker of a tool though. Like look, it's controlling all the energy, right? And so it's giving me an opportunity when I'm in a situation that I don't like to not have, remember the L.I. and the antelope and the, and the dashboard? Yeah. Well, guess what? If I actually control that breathing, I control that dashboard. Now you know which animal is which. If you just can see that, right? So if I can control that, then I give myself an opportunity and here's very Victor Frankel. Between stimulus and response is a choice and I have a choice in every single situation I'm in. I, you know, I, I go, so I live like five miles from San Quentin and I go in and I run a program there with these guys on understand, on understanding this stuff. And this is my contribution to a world that I could have wound up in. Any of us could have wound up in and I know that there's like these dudes are in a very big uphill battle, especially when they get out. But it's like, what do you want to learn? And one of the stories that I give them is it's like, look, and you brought up the Dalai llama, right? And, and, and this meditation and it's like there, I literally told them this story. There are a group of human beings who decide to give up all possessions, leave their current life, move to the middle of the mountains or middle of nowhere, typically in Asia, isolate themselves with a group, another group of people, eat maybe once a day and meditate and breathe and find enlightenment. What is the difference between them and you right now? That's cool. You don't have a choice in being where you're at. Right. And that's right. You don't have a choice, but you have a choice in how you handle it and the story that you're telling yourself. And although I'm not serving time or doing time, the choice I have been in, in many situations that I put myself in, whether it's a hundred miles or, you know, swimming with great white sharks or whatever, it's become a choice in how I manage that situation. And how can I use this tool that I know does something in order to help me find another way up that mountain? Well, let me ask you this. So like, yeah, I want to bring it to the, to just the root. Like you're about to go swimming with sharks, something I've always been perplexed by that particular desire in people, but I enjoy watching the videos that prior to jumping in to a place where there are deadly sharks, do you do nose breathing or is this, you know, do you, do you have a routine that you go through to chill you out that you could maybe relate to some of us? Yeah. I mean, like, I mean, I have a breath, a standard breath practice that happens every day. Like I, you know, a meditation, I sit there and breathe, and that happens for anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour, right? Just depends on what, what I'm doing that day and what my timing is like. And so that doesn't change no matter what happens, even if I get the opportunity to go to Mexico and get out of a cage, you know, 200 miles off of the coast of Mexico. Don't do it anymore. How? Don't do that. Now, well, like, look, it was like, this was actually bait. This was predicated off of a getting involved in a research project at Stanford. And then my buddy who was running, who I ended up becoming buddies with with a scientist who is running the project on fear, he's like, Hey, we're going back out to Guadalupe Island. Yeah. Do you want to come? No. And I was like, hell, yes. You gotta know. It wasn't like, it wasn't like I ever like dreamt of going and swimming with great white sharks. I was going to go, alls I understood was, Hey, I'm going to go get in a cage and look at great white sharks. Right. I'd love to do that. Yes. And he goes, I got three tags to get out of the cage with the shark. Do you want to get out? And I was like, yes. Fuck man. And he said, okay, go get certified to dive. And so anyway, the morning, like the, the morning I got to go do it, I did breath work like I normally did. And then before I got in the cage, I listened to what the guys who pioneered this had to say. And they were like, look, don't get mesmerized by one. Just move around like you normally would as best you can. And since you're the breathing guy, control your fucking breathing, dude. And that's what I did. I just slow controlled my breath. I didn't let my breathing get away from me. And I kept looking around and it was interesting because if you, like that whole thing on getting mesmerized by one was probably one of the most important things I've ever heard. And it's not just for sharks. It's like, I mean, look, like anybody, like don't just get mesmerized by one thing or you're going to miss the rest of the show. Like there's other things going on, right? And like you look at a great white shark swimming by you about 15 feet away and you're like, that's a fucking dinosaur that could end my life. And then it's like, well, wait, oh, there's three below me. There's a one above me. And oh yeah, that's why I've got to keep an eye on what's going on. But the interesting thing is, is it's like, look, this is an animal that understands being an apex, well, kind of an apex predator. The orcas, it's, you know, the apex, but it only understands what prey is, right? Like what does a seal do in the water? If there's a shark, it runs or it doesn't know that the shark's there. So it's just laying there. So if I freeze, that is part of my sympathetic nervous system, I freeze, it recognizes that. If I run, it recognizes that flight. So it understands sympathetic activity. What it doesn't understand is parasympathetic activity. And so the shark, dude, you could see in these sharks eyes and their behavior in how they were moving, they were very curious. They weren't destructive. I mean, I was out of that cage for 45 minutes. No, it was like, whoa, like, this makes sense, man. I don't know. Did you see the video of that guy feeding the, the sharks? Do you know he, he takes, there's a guy popped up on the internet who goes to this one place where there's sharks and he pulls hooks out of their mouth and they swim up to him to, because like somehow they recognize what he's doing and let him pull hooks out of their mouth. These are highly tuned animals, dude. Like that's why I was like, you know, just because we don't have any real scientific proof of, of like us being the most intelligent species, it's like those animals can detect shit real, real quick. I mean, I've been in, in Hawaii and we swam with, with a bunch of Galapagos and reef sharks. Like, I mean, we're talking like 80 to 100 of them. They're not real big, but you know, you know that they could, one of them turns on you. It's over. Like, but it was so interesting because two of my buddies who were in the water with us, they got all freaked out at for like, like halfway into this swim with these sharks and all the instantly, like I had no idea they got freaked out, but you saw the sharks behavior change instantaneously. Like it went from calm all of a sudden to erratic and moving really fast. And the dude who was guiding us was like, who the fuck's tripping out? Like he like got on these guys and they're like, sorry, we're freaking out. And he's like, get out of the, but get in the boat or chill out. You know, and, and literally, so they had to chill out and relax so that the sharks would chill out and relax, you know. Now I'm not telling people to go to, I'm not a professional shark diver. All this, these were just my experiences and going and getting in the water with sharks to understand things that I'm doing with the work I'm doing. So don't just go jump in the water with sharks thinking you're going to be fine, right? You got to go with a professional. I mean, like, look, these guys who pioneered this stuff, like they figured out that if a shark's coming directly at you, if, if like we had big cameras in our hands, if you go at the shark with the camera, it'll turn away. It won't not turn away. A shark's not used to something coming directly at it. So it's like, whoa, it's tripping out the shark. So like they're doing things that like I would, you know, it'd be very difficult for me to do. Right? I need serious training to spend time. So look, man, I don't worry. I don't think we're in any danger of somebody listening to this and like, you know what? I'm going to go find some sharks and be calm. But I am also like not a pioneer in this stuff, but I am what I am a pioneer and is an understanding how to control our autonomic arousal state and how to manipulate that in order to make the thing that we care about the most happen, which is adaptation. We are not adapting as a species. We like biologically, we are going in reverse. And this has been the problem with and I'm not demonizing like tech and medicine have their place, but they are ruining us because we don't want to take responsibility for ourselves. And so we're literally leaning into these things as though they're going to solve our problems that we that none of that technology like can be better than what we are, right? None of it. And though we're under this guise that that's going to change and it's not, we're actually retarding ourselves and and relying heavily on something that could do something better for us. And so this is putting too much weight on those industries like the medical community and like the tech industry to start to continue to do things that where look, dude, no amount of tech can actually tell you what's going on physiologically better than you can. No heart rate monitor, no respiration rate monitor, nothing. You actually have the ability to understand that stuff. If you actually take the time to listen to those things. Oh, right. Like the Apple watch, all the wearables, what you're saying is the loopstrap, the aura ring, all of that stuff. It's so inaccurate and it's like, look, dude, I've spent thousands upon thousands of dollars on this stuff to study and understand and it cannot do what I am capable of doing. Are you saying that it creates almost like a kind of deafness? The more you use the technology, the less you hear what your body is actually telling you. Well, you got five senses for a reason, dude, and it is dulling those senses. Like what you see, like every other animal uses their senses to understand what's going on in their environment. Our uniqueness to this is that we curate stories and through that prefrontal cortex, we can trigger emotional responses to things that our senses normally did, right? Like I see a bear, fuck, I got to run, like I smell smoke, something's going on, right? I hear a loud noise, like what is that? Or I hear a stepping of something, what is that? Right? I just touch something sharp. What is that? Right? Like, oh, I can feel my heart. It took me a few years, but like I can literally, if I sit here and just shut up, I can feel my heartbeat. And I have very low blood pressure, like we're talking 99 over 50. So I can still feel my heartbeat, even though, but that's just the ability to kind of sit with yourself and listen and pay attention. What am I feeling? Well, just because this makes me feel happy or angry, why is that? What is that? Why am I doing? Am I looking for confirmation bias off of this? Do I actually even want to take the time to understand what this is? Or am I going to allow somebody or some media outlet to dictate what it is, or social media for that matter, to dictate to own my emotions? Yeah, it's like, are you going to let a mood ring tell you how you feel? Exactly. It's like that's so fucked up. But I want to ask you this, it is a good, I think a good last question, man, because you seem to have really developed an acute ability to listen to your, and to control your body. When I was in, when I was studying in college, in a psychology class, I remember in one of the textbooks, there's a picture of this yogi dreadlocks sitting on the Ganges River and he was covered like they did a study on him because he could lower the temperature on one side of his hand, five degrees and on the other side up five degrees and they, you know, didn't fit in with the way we're understanding how people work. How deep can this stuff go? How much, if you can, if you can feel your heart, then you can control your heart. If you can, you know, get into the nuances of controlling your breath, can you, can you get to the point that they say you can, do you believe that shit that we can almost reverse age, cure disease, you know, the, the, the stuff they say is possible just sounds insane to me, but then when I hear what you're saying, it makes me think, whoa, maybe, maybe, maybe that's a possibility. I think scientifically we're just scratching the surface of what a lot of, you know, people have been saying for quite some time, you know, namely, if you talk about these yogis, it's like 5,000 years they've been, they've been talking about this stuff. Like, look, Wim Hof can, can do that same thing. Like he can, he can literally shut down the peripheral, right? And I'm getting to a point where I'm able to shut down one side and, you know, or shut down the limbs, you know, the peripheral of my body in order to just protect or be more dialed into the core, right? So and that's what happens like when you're in cold water. That's what you're doing is you're teaching your body how to protect itself in cold exposure, right? And that's what these yogis do in the cold snow where they take the, you know, the, the, the tumo guys take the sheet, sit in the snow, put it on in the river, put it on top of them and they don't move until that sheet's dry, right? Because they heat their body up with temperature. Yes. Yes. You can heat yourself up. There was a gal who did the survival show and she came to me about some stuff and she's like, look, we're going into the cold. Like I'm going to be up. I think it was in Alaska or something and like winter. How do I help myself do this without having to go spend 30 years doing this shit? And it's like simple, can slow your breath down. You will heat yourself up by controlling how the, how much CO2 comes out of you. So you can control because it vasodilate. So this actually train teaches us how to actually heat ourselves up in cold situations. The problem is, is that we get cold before we know it. And then we're like, and guess what, when we hyperventilate, yeah, we constrict things. So if I can learn how to control or constrict things, then I can start to shut down things. Right? So it's the exact opposite. So versus heating up and cooling off. So if I speed up the breathing, I can actually cool myself off. Right? Right. And, and, and, and there's subtle, there's subtle, there's a lot of, there's nuance in there, but these are basics into what we can do and like, look, I really think it all comes down to energy. I believe it's about energy. We don't understand energy totally, like down to the quantum. It's like beyond that, it's like there's energy going on that we don't understand, right? And so like in the cell, like there's trillions and trillions of cells in our body that are functioning and doing things. And this is energy and we're, we're merely matter. I mean, go back to the Bill Hicks thing, right? Like today, a young man on acid notice, the whole thing. Look, dude, it's like, this is all energy and how we control that energy is our own, like we have that power. And so learning how to control that, I think is going to be the premise of you understanding what's going on within your system. All disease is predicated off of stress, basically, unless it's genetic, right? Yeah. And so all disease comes down to stress and how I'm managing that stress and what I'm doing with that stress. And this is where it's like, I'm not suggesting, oh, you could just breathe into this and de-stress it. And no, that might be one route. But there's a many routes to this and understanding how you're managing stress and what you're doing with it. And we've gotten so far off this page of understanding the stress that we're dealing with that we're blaming it on the thing that's making us emotional. And yet the thing that's making us emotional and react had really has nothing to do with why we're upset and angry. It has to do with something way far deeper than that, that I believe breathing, meditation, and this stuff can get us to. And this is also why we're introducing this into the human performance realm and training is it's like we're missing some very big things with inside the human performance world. And I think breath is one of those things in controlling that variable that controls the energy and how we're using that energy to actually make ourselves or heal ourselves. And I do think medicine has its place. I do think we're going, we need to have medicine and we need technology, but our reliance on it is too big. And we have an opportunity to learn how to actually manage our own stress, which for the first time in our history, we're at the point where we are creating self-disease. We are at the point where we create self-disease. Metabolic disorder, problems like that are self-generated diseases. These are not things that are just like, whoops, I got this disease called diabetes, type two diabetes, and it just fell out of the sky. That's not how that worked. Obesity didn't work like that. But the medical, some people in the medical universe inadvertently put that out there to people. So there is that because it is, you know, it is a real ego exists. Yep. Ego exists. But I want to go deeper with this, man. What is your, I'm so sorry. I'm a shitty guy. I would love to. Brian McKenzie, what is it? It's Brian McKenzie.com or is there you have? Yeah, you can go there. You can go to Brian McKenzie.com or go to shiftadapt.com. And so look. Where is the breath, where is the meter that you were saying? Shift, shift, shift, adapt. So my company's name is shift and show shiftadapt.com is our website. And so we run a subscription service there where we actually have the breath work. You can get the breath calculator free. You don't need the subscription. But here for your, for your listeners, if they want to go screw around with this, right, go and sign up under performance and use the code Duncan pod. So your name and POD pod and they'll get a free month of our subscription to get an understanding of how to use the breath work and what we do to develop this, love, like develop our ability to adapt better. What I'm talking about with training, in essence. And then we have all of our webinars on there, which is our education in expanding on everything we've been talking about, like way more. Like it's giving the very basics and details of this stuff so that people can learn. So it's, it's free to subscribers. Hey, let me just say this real quick. I didn't know that he was going to give you all that. This was not some kind of long set up. I had no idea. That's very sweet of you, man. And I'm going to, I'm actually going to use that code too. That's cool. Uh, thank you for your, your time. You know, this podcast, I feel so lucky because it's like, I, I get to trick. I get to trick people like you into giving me free one on one. I don't, but it's, I really do appreciate it, man. Thank you so much. Like this is something when, when we came into contact, uh, it was, it came at the perfect time because I was, it was literally right when I was starting to look into TUMO and studying breathing. So this is a real synchronicity for me and I'm, I'm really grateful for your time, man. Well, you're welcome. And I, I mean, look, I want to say thank you too. Cause I, you know, your show is probably one of the most important shows out there. And I'll say this episode seven is the most important episode that has been done to date of any series out there. Oh man. Thank every, every human being needs to go watch or listen to that episode. As far as I'm concerned, thank you. I am so grateful to you for watching the show. I'm so lucky that you connected with me. And I hope that you'll come back on, on this podcast sometime. Anytime, my friend, anytime. Thanks, Brian. I really appreciate it.

It is I, Duncan Tressel, and this is the Duncan Tressel Family Hour podcast, and today's episode is dedicated to magic, the secret art, not magic like guy dressed like Elvis yanking rabbits out of a hat, not magic like David Copperfield or Cirque du Soleil, any kind of that Vegas horse shit, not magic like Chris Angel greased hair, climbing into a whale stomach and holding his breath for 17 hours. No, even though all that stuff is entertaining and interesting, this episode is dedicated to magic with a K. A lot of people, when they hear that, they get the heebie jeebies, they consider it to be the ultimate version of woo, woo, and they turn off to it. And I understand why because it sounds downright ridiculous, especially if you've done even the slightest exploration to the concepts presented by some of the magical systems, for example, the idea that at any given moment, we're surrounded by entities, disembodied motes of consciousness with personalities that can that either want to hurt us or help us or trick us, and that if we know how to, we can harness these the power of these entities, we can summon spirits using incantations to produce effects in our life that bring us closer to whatever our goals happen to be. And that concept is a lot of people just write it off as complete bullshit. And then if you believe in it, then a lot of people say that it's evil. The dabbling in that kind of stuff can lead to insanity, can ultimately destroy your life. And it's the trick of the devil, which is where the term black magic and white magic came from. And a lot of people, to this very day, truly believe that if you set off down the path of magic, then you will damn your soul to eternal suffering, because it's a forbidden art, which of course only makes it that much more attractive to anyone who hears that, who's like me. And if you explore the idea that you can actually get damned for trying to make your life better than it seems to point in the direction that you need to rebel as much as you can against whatever God would, for whatever ridiculous reason, choose to create a potential energy source that could amplify and enhance your life and then punish you eternally for accessing that energy source. My POV on this stuff is this. We have an ocean of phenomena surrounding us. And as part of this ocean of phenomena, we have our physical bodies and our egos and our consciousness of ourself. And we have within us, and I think this is true for just about everybody, a sense that if we applied ourselves, we could experience a happier life. And anyone who has actually applied themselves in the direction of achieving some goal knows that it's not the achieving the goal that brings the great exhilarating rush of happiness, but it's the pursuit of the thing itself that seems to create varying states of bliss and happiness and joy. It's not winning the war, but it's the war itself that seems to really appeal to us. When I say war, I don't mean war in the normal blowing people up war, even though it is true. If you've seen one of my favorite parts of the movie, Apocalypse Now, is when the, I don't remember who played this incredible, this character, but he's the guy who, he's the surfing guy. He's the head of the helicopter brigade, and he's a badass. And if you've ever seen Apocalypse Now, then you'll remember one of this incredible scene. He's the guy who said, I love the smell of napalm in the morning. But there's a fantastic scene in Apocalypse Now where he sort of gets down on one knee, and it almost seems like he's about to start crying. And he says, this war is going to end soon. This war is going to end one day, something like that. And he's clearly kind of broken hearted about that. Well, if you're anybody who's analyzed the specific circumstances of your life, then you've probably begun to realize that human existence in its own way is a kind of war, not a war against some external enemy, but a war against the forces of entropy that want to hold you to a specific set of patterns that you call your life or your identity. And if those sets of patterns that you have, that are, you're attached to are creating an unhealthy body or an unhealthy mind or unhealthy relationships or a general sense of sadness, a kind of malaise, a bitterness and anger, a feeling of unhappiness, turmoil, not getting enough sleep, not eating right, a feeling of laziness, a general sense of feeling diffused, blurry, and ultimately completely confused by your life situation, then those are your enemies for the sake of this particular metaphor. And so once you've made that decision that you're in a war or what has been referred to as a jihad, a holy war, not against the West, not against the East, but against the differentiating aspects of your personality, they're causing you to hate yourself or those around you, then you have used magic as far as I'm concerned. And what you've done is you've created a linguistic description of the reality that you're in that hopefully intensifies and amplifies your desire to climb your way out of whatever the particular quicksand pit that you've gotten yourself stuck into and into the light or into a better light. That's magic to me. Magic is the reframing of your paradigm using flowery language so that you can then have toe holds and finger holds and foot holds that you can climb out of the particular situation you're in. We've been given all these different lenses to look at the universe through. There's so many great lenses. There's the lens of science, cosmology, physics, biology, evolutionary biology, neurology, robotics, you name it. There's so many great chemistry. There's so many great lenses to look at the universe through, but a lot of these lenses aren't going to activate for some people the part of themselves that's going to make them want to fight. The part of themselves that's going to make them want to fight and push against the anaconda of boredom, the anaconda of laziness, the anaconda of being completely weary of the great struggle that started the moment you realized that you were a thing and you were surrounded by lots of other things and decided that you were going to start fighting for what you thought was limited resources. Any lens, to me, magic is not Harry Potter. It's not levitating forks. It's not walking through walls. It's not flying around in a fucking broomstick or casting love spells or having mind control over other people or astral projection. Though those are theoretically things that you could achieve based on some of the literature, to me, magic is using your will to overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles in your life. Magic would be the fuel. Magic is the linguistic fuel that gives you that extra push that you need. It's surrounding yourself with the symbols that you need to remind yourself that you are not a nobody. To surround yourself with the symbols that you need to awake, to wake up to the fact that you're not some nobody, that you're not just one little piece of a biomass, that you're not some meaningless, empty, pointless conglomeration of meat and chemicals that's temporarily aware and is therefore but is just ultimately a useless fart in the wind of time. But surrounding yourselves with symbols that remind you that as far as you know, you are the only being on this planet that's experiencing itself. You don't know if I have a sense of awareness. You don't know if I'm aware of myself. You don't know that I could easily just be a projection of you. I don't think that's not true. The cases were all part of the same consciousness. But magic is whatever you need to do to yank yourself out of whatever is letting you take your life for granted so that you can lay in your own muck and filth and sadness and pretend that that's normal. Magic is the whatever you can do, the force that pushes you up out of the ruins of your life. It's the thing that makes all great men great as far as I'm concerned. It's the symbol system that they use to give their lives meaning. And it's actively choosing that symbol system and utilizing those symbols in a very specific way to give yourself the momentum or force to move in the direction of whatever your goals happen to be. Ram Dass talks about how we all exist on that there's multiple frequencies happening at once. The frequency of absurdity, the frequency where everything is meaningless, the frequency where we're surrounded by shitty movies, terrible music, and everybody seems to be lost in a consumeristic materialistic haze where they think that buying stuff is going to somehow take away the endless suffering that comes from temporarily incarnating in a dimension where you're being aerosolized by time. That's one frequency, but there's a lot of other frequencies too. And magic, as far as I'm concerned, is using your will to pick out a certain set of symbols which allows you to tune in to some of these other frequencies that are existing around us at all times. Now, I won't get into the astral plane or the frequency where there's spirits or angels, but I'm talking about the frequency where you wake up in the morning and you look forward to your day. I'm talking about that dimension. I'm just talking about the life where you know if you decide to do something you're going to do it. That dimension, instead of that the other dimension where any idea that comes to your mind, for example, I'm going to start jogging tomorrow. I'm going to start working out. I'm going to quit drinking. I'm going to make a list of things that I need to do and I'm actually going to do it and then you never do it. That's just a particular frequency that you're existing at. Well, magic would be whatever it is that you need to do symbolically that moved you out of that frequency into the frequency where you become a badass who gets things done. Whatever it is, whatever you have to do. Now, if you want to get from the frequency of lost and in tropic hell to the frequency of being in action, being engaged in the great jihad of your life, being engaged in the great eternal, dharmic battle to actualize yourself in as much as possible, spread love into the world, the way if you want to get into that place, there's lots of ways to do it. You can do it just from pure existential willpower and just decide, well, I'm just going to do it to see if I can. To me, that's magic. It's still a symbol structure that moves you from point A, subjective point A to subjective point B, but there's lots of other things you can do to move from subjective point A to subjective point B that aren't quite so boring or empty. And for example, prayer. Prayer equals magic. It's the same fucking thing as far as I'm concerned. It's the same thing. When you mutter a prayer, whisper a prayer, chant some prayer, read a prayer from whatever scripture you like, you are intoning an incantation to petition some higher consciousness to help you move from whatever point in the multiverse that you're existing in to another point in the multiverse that you want to be in. So, oh, God, let me be a more loving person or, oh, God, please help me achieve my promotion or, oh, Lord, heal my brother who is so sick right now. All of these are all of these as far as I'm concerned, or it's magical acts. And if saying a prayer when you wake up in the morning creates some kind of neurological shift in your brain chemistry so that your reaction time is a little better or the way you treat the people around you is shifted in such a way that makes them treat you better, then that could very easily create a chain reaction in your life that leads you to achieving whatever the fuck it is that you want to achieve. Whether or not some divine being in the astral plane heard your petition and sent magic beams down into your life that transformed you in some way from because of the God's powers or whether just intoning a certain series of words in the right order created a neurological shift that allowed you to function in society in a way that gave you the edge you needed so that you could move to whatever place it is. Subjectively, you wanted to move to. It doesn't matter. All that matters is, did you get results as far as I'm concerned? I don't care where the juice came from. When I plug my phone into the wall, I just want it to charge up. That's it. And magic points us in the direction of certain energy access points that a lot of us might not have been aware of as far as I'm concerned. Is it real? Is there really spirits, angels, demons, beings that we can petition? Are there certain geometric formations that when placed in the right position on the right day of the year connect with the right planetary systems which connect with the corresponding spiritual systems to create change in our lives? Who the fuck knows? I don't care. All I know is that sometimes when I find myself in a bind, there are certain practices that I can use that come directly from Crowley or from some of the other great teachers of magic out there that will give me a little bit more energy when I need it. And I don't care if it works because of some actual existing physics or if it's just some way to induce the placebo effect into my life. All I know is that more than a few times in my life when I've wanted something to happen, the combination of certain magical systems mixing in with my own willpower and decision to work hard has created results and that's all I need to know. So there you go. If you feel cynical or suspicious or if you just think magic is a big pile of steaming fucking horseshit, then guess what? You and I are on the same page. On one level, I think it's exactly the same kind of steaming pile of horseshit as any other human invention is in the face of eternity and the fact that we're all going to eventually be transformed into dust by some kind of supernova. We're all sort of damned to absurdity at one level. But on another level, once you get past that place in the moment, in the level of the moment or in the level of what you want to happen this month or two months from now or three months from now, magic is a very useful creative tool that if you haven't experimented with, then you really shouldn't write it off just yet. And that's what this podcast is all about. And that's why I'm so happy to have Jason here because he's somebody who has been studying this stuff for a very long time and is incredibly apt when it comes to talking about it and teaching it. We're going to dive right into this podcast, but first some quick business. This episode of the Duncan Tressel Family Hour podcast is brought to you by Casper Mattresses. I can say a lot about Casper Mattresses and I'm going to because I have to because it's part of the advertisement. But the only, the ultimate thing I could say is I currently sleep on a Casper mattress. I had a pretty expensive damn mattress that I ended up buying because for a lot of different reasons. My mom had just died. I was out of my mind. I was doing a lot of crazy things at that point. I actually hired a dominatrix too. I was just doing weird shit, man. I was out of my gourd. And one of the things I did was sort of in this weird grief haze. Also as marijuana haze, I stumbled into a mattress store and got horn swoggled. The mattress salesman identified that he was dealing with somebody who was completely baked and brought me over to this like back expensive area of the mattress store and had me lay down on a vibrate. What essentially is a vibrating bed? And it's like basically like the same kind of bed you give to people who are sick. It lifts up, goes down, does all the shit vibrates. But it's somehow they've managed to warp it. So it seems like the greatest thing you could ever buy. And I remember being super stoned, laying there feeling the vibration. The mattress salesman knowing I'm super stoned says exactly the right thing to me, which was you're going to don't get addicted to it. My wife got addicted to it. And you know, it's bad. So just telling me I might get addicted to this mattress was enough to make me write him a pretty big fucking check for this mattress, which I then took home and have only been made fun of for having a vibrating bed. And once I realized, look, this is no different than just some cheesy hotel room, you've got a vibrating bed. And by the way, vibrating beds do nothing for fucking as far as I can tell. So aside from the fact that I got horn swoggled and ended up in this mattress, which was way too expensive and something I didn't need within like a year of having this thing eight months of having it just start sinking in. It just becomes like this lumpy mess of chemicals underneath me. And so I'm essentially it's like laying on like moon craters, just pieces of it just been down. I started getting back aches. It was awful. And so right around that time, I got contacted by Casper. I told them I couldn't advertise unless I tried one of these mattresses out. They sent me a mattress. It comes in a box, open the mattress up, got rid of my old lumpy fucking shit mattress and put the new mattress down and I'm using it to this day. It isn't lumpy. It hasn't changed. It's a nice, firm, bouncy, healthy mattress. My back stopped hurting. And so I completely and fully endorse this brand of mattress because I sleep on it. I sleep on a Casper. So if you're somebody who wants a really nice mattress and you don't want to get sucked into the hypnotic mattress maze, that anyone who goes into a mattress store is going to get sucked into. And by the way, here's an interesting fact about mattress salesmen, at least the ones I've encountered, they've got a dark side, something about hanging out around all those fucking mattresses all day long. Okay. Put yourself in their position. Really think about this. Think about this. You are in what could be considered one of the more boring jobs of all time. Like, one of you ever, no offense to you mattress salesmen, if you're getting joy out of your job, then it's great. But I'm just thinking from my own POV. If I'm sitting in an empty warehouse filled with beds that is not very populated, every time I go into a mattress store, I'm the only one there. It's creepy tumbleweeds are blowing down the fucking aisles. So if I had to work in one of those places where I'm sitting around comfortable beds all day long, I'm going to be in the worst mood ever. Cause all I'm going to want to do is lay on one of these beds and go to sleep and try to forget my life for a second. So mattress salesmen are pissed. They want to take a nap. You're fucking up their nap time. And also they're getting commissions. So they feel like they got to sell these fucking things to you. And also they're getting probably rejected by so many people who come in there and look around and get creeped out and just think, I don't want to buy a fucking mattress from this fucking serial killer. So if you want the experience of going to a fucking mattress store, be my guest. But if you're like me, or a recluse who likes to stay at home and not deal with bullshit like that, especially if I'm going to get manipulated by son of a bitch, some son of a bitch trying to sell me fuckpads, then here's your, I guess you could consider me a son of a bitch selling you a fuckpad right now, but at least we're not trapped in a warehouse together. You could jump forward by the way, this commercial is annoying you. If you don't want to deal with that crap and you're tired of your old mattress and you want a really nice mattress, then you should get a Casper mattress. All right, here's the stuff I got to say. It's an obsessively engineered mattress at a shockingly fair price. It's just the right sink, just the right bounce to technologies latex foam and memory foam come together for better nights and better days. Risk free trial and return policy. Try sleeping on a Casper for 100 days with free delivery and painless returns. The mattress is made in America. $500 for a twin side mattress, $950 for a king size mattress. Comparing that to the industry average, that's an outstanding price point. I got to read that. They should revise that. Nobody wants to say price point. If you go to casper.com, put an offer code Family Hour, you get $50 off of your first order. If you're thinking about buying a mattress, it's a great place to do it. In worst case scenario, you hate the fucking thing. You can send it back and then you can go into a mattress maze and allow the dark magic of the mattress salesman to control your mind and you'll end up with some kind of weird fucking mattress that is, I don't know who knows what's going to happen. It's a shot in the dark. The thing could suck you into some alternate dimension where you get fisted for infinity. Who knows? We don't know who these guys are. We don't know where these mattresses are coming from. These things are probably stuffed with dolphin eyeballs. Who knows? You don't know what's in it. You're not going to open it up. You're not going to open it up. If you think about it, if you're a mattress salesman and you have a skeleton that you want to hide, all you got to do is figure out a way to cut open one of those mattresses and just shove a skeleton deep, deep into the mattress and seal it back up and then sell it to somebody. If you have a mattress that you bought from a mattress store, you could be sleeping on a skeleton friend. You could be sleeping on the vanished, the skeleton of some vanished child, which is probably why you're having those weird dreams. Time to get a new mattress. You don't want to lay there and imagine that just underneath where you're laying and making sweet, sweet love is a tiny bird bones of some dead babe that a dark mattress salesman decided to stick into the comfy womb of some mattress he was trying to sell. Is that what you want to sleep on top of? Hell no. Go to Casper.com. Use offer code, family hour, and you will receive $50 off a non-haunted mattress. Casper.com. Give them a shot. They support us. Why don't you support them? We're also brought to you by Amazon.com to continue in the direction of reasons not to leave the house. Here's another great reason, Amazon. You don't need to leave the house anymore. There's no reason to go to these stores. I don't know if you've been to a store lately. You might notice when you go there, it's just, they're mostly empty now because everyone's ordering online. You don't have to go. If you're going out in the world, it should be because you're going to some nice event. You're going out to eat with people you love or you're going to get examined by a doctor. Something serious and something filled with reason, but if you're driving through traffic for hours to go and buy shit that you could buy online and have your delivered to your house the next day, you've just gotten stuck in an old paradigm that doesn't exist anymore. If you go through the Amazon portal located at dunketrustle.com, it's in the comments section of any of these websites, and buy anything from Amazon, they'll give us a small percentage of whatever you buy and it costs you nothing and it's a great way to support this podcast and it's also a great way to keep yourself from getting trapped out there with all those hypnotized lunatics who aren't aware of the fact that we are nearing the singularity and you don't have to leave anymore. This is your home. Where we live right now, compared to many parts of the world, are palatial estates where now you can have magically delivered to your doorstep anything that you want and that's pretty bad ass. Order those Hue lights, they're pretty cool. Maybe I'm just some cheesy 70s guy because I have a vibrating bed and my lights change color, but I like it. Go to amazon.com, use our portal, won't you? Next week, guys, that is next week. I'm going to be at the Montreal Comedy Festival. I'm doing two live podcasts. I'm doing two comedy shows. So go to the Montreal website, buy tickets to the show. Come see me perform. Come see one of these live podcasts. I've got some great guests who are going to be on the show. Segura, Kreischer, Ian Edwards. These are going to be great podcasts. I hope you guys will show up. Okay. All right. Fantastic. Today's guest on the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast is a returning guest. You've probably listened to the last podcast I had with him.

So if you're interested in studying under Jason Louvre and learning about so many different forms of magic from Raja yoga to chaos magic, this is a place for you to go. You can also get a free ebook if you go there. So check it out. All right, everybody. Thank you for humoring me with that long intro to this podcast. I love you guys so much. And I hope you will welcome with open arms the amazing Jason Louvre, Hare Krishna. It's the Duncan Trouser. Check, check. Jason, welcome back to the DTFH. Hare Krishna. It's so nice to have you here. Thank you. So many questions for you. I don't often get to be in the presence of a mage, a wizard, a practitioner of the occult, someone who's up to date on this stuff. So I got a ton of questions for you. And I hope you will allow me for an hour or so to be your magical apprentice. When you put it that way, it sounds like I actually know what I'm talking about. All great wizards act like they don't know what they're talking about. Isn't that part of the game? Well, you just you just saw my cell phone is all cracked. I came in, you know, my car is all busted up. What can I say? So what is that? So that's an interesting place to start, which is that it seems like one of the tricky aspects of learning about metaphysics is that some folks who go down that path disconnect from the basic gears of the machine that we happen to have been incarnated into. Well, it's funny you should ask that because that actually cuts straight to the core of all of the different schools of mysticism in the world. If you study eastern philosophy, particularly Buddhism or Hinduism, you will immediately come into contact with this idea of Maya or Samsara, that the idea simply that the world is illusory and distraction. And it's kind of there to it's kind of there as a distraction to get us to forget our true natures. And of course, we see that idea in Gnosticism as well. Obviously, it was recycled as the ideas in the matrix, which I try to avoid, because those are such overused metaphors. It's like the matrix, bro. It's like the matrix, but also Philip K. Dick referred to it as the black iron prison, things like that. And I've heard now just just a quick note there. I was just studying the concept of the Illuminati, and there's apparently some level in this strange hierarchy or there's some fourth dimensional out of time group of people controlling the Illuminati who are called the captors or the prison guards or something. I think when you hit that level in the Illuminati, you get a free Costco membership. You get a Costco. So but but right precisely. So in a lot of what we're looking at is the split between dualistic spiritual paths, which posit that the world is a trap, essentially. And ones that do not posit that because while all spiritual traditions agree that the world is illusory, some at their higher levels, particularly Tantric Hinduism or Tantric Buddhism, and some of the Western traditions, you will always hear this phrase, Nirvana is samsara, or the crown is in the kingdom as the kingdom is in the crown from Kavala, meaning that the world is really only a distraction in as much as it's reflecting to your own mind. When your mind is trained and you see reality for what it is, there's nothing frightening or constraining about it at all. In fact, the world is perfect. It's only our own mental state that leads us to perceive it as otherwise. Which side of the line do you fall on? Depends on the day depends on how irritated I am with traffic. Now, hold on two seconds. Damn it. I got to like adjust this concept where the world is essentially a reflection of your energetic being, right, is something I've been thinking a lot about. And in particular, that strange thing that happens, when for whatever reason you are tuned in, you have a focused rhythm, how the people just react to you differently. Like everything reacts to you differently compared to when you are in a diffuse, distracted, anxiety-ridden state. Everything reacts to you according to that as well. And it's an interesting thing to consider that. Is that what magic is? That's basically magic, right? It's shifting your energetic state with the concept being behind it all, you're reflecting yourself into the world. So if you shift your energetic state, then the world is going to reflect back to you, beauty, not just in the way people interact with you, but in the way all material phenomena interacts with you. I think you completely got it and hit the nail on the head. And it's funny because I was actually thinking about this on the way over. The whole idea of magic, people think about magic as they have Hollywood ideas about it, and they think you're going to be throwing fireballs out of your hands and things like that, which would be awesome. And if anyone can do that, please send me a YouTube of it. But really what magic is is seeing, understanding that the universe is nothing but pure magic. And when you learn to train your mind and get your mind to focus and go silent and be on point, similar to what you were just saying, then yeah, exactly what you're saying happens. And the universe reflects back to you a beatific state, a loving, compassionate state that's symbolized by different gods and goddesses in all chemical shapes and things like that from various traditions. But really that's the core experience. It's getting out of your own way, getting out of your own ego and your own bullshit in your own mind, which is the real controlling archon or controlling prison warden. It's your own ego. As soon as you get out of that, and that may just be, that's easier said than done, and that may just be for short periods of time, when you get out of that, then you're paying attention to the universe and not yourself, and you see the universe for what it is, which is a magical phenomenon. And yes, it's crazy how much that changes other people's reaction to you, because the universe reflects back what you see in it. And if you project anger and hatred and not to be New Agey, but if you put off negativity, you get it back. And if you put off, if you see, if you choose to observe the universe in a, I don't want to say quantum, because I don't want to be Deepak Chopra, but if you choose to observe the universe in a quantumly speaking as a magical phenomenon, then that's what it will be for you. Right. Yes, I like that. And I think there's a lot of different, like what you were saying, how there's this, for the state of compassion, for the state of an open heart, there's alchemical symbols, gods to represent it, mantras you can chant for it, sounds that it produces, colors. And that's a really curious mapping that has been done by a lot of different cultures in the world to get to the finer aspects of the energetic self. And so I've been thinking a lot about how, for whatever reason, people don't feel like they get to rename those things or giving them their own name, you know, like we're kind of stuck with all this old language that people are using, all these old symbols that some of it has a lot of logic behind it. Some of it doesn't. But, or from my experience, I don't understand it's a better way to put it. But I was thinking like another way to sort of chart these states is to start using the language of the multiverse or the idea that, just as a thought experiment, if your perception of the world is changing the way the world conforms around you, then couldn't you say that you're literally living in, you know, eight different or seven different worlds, seven or however many potential worlds you want. So when you get really freaked out and anxiety-ridden, this is something that just happened to me, like I was stoned and I'm walking to go eat and my shoulders are tight and my head start, my thoughts are just a hornet's nest and every hornet is everything that I need to be worried about in the world and it's just swarming around me. And all of a sudden, I was like, oh, fuck, look at the way you're walking and look at the way you're thinking and look at the way you're feeling and look at the world that you've created around you based on that. You are in a, what if this is a dimension? What if this is an actual alternate dimension that you have inadvertently steered your vehicle into and that by shifting these states of consciousness, you're actually traveling to other parts of the multiverse and so you can literally move from the world of cunts, which is, you know, which that was what I named it, as just some kind of like just easy, lazy way, cunt world. You just got to put that in Sanskrit or something. Make a symbol for cunt world. Yeah. Right. Cunt world. And then I was thinking, okay, okay, this is cunt world. So let's think about cunt world a little bit here. Let's think about cunt world and what are the adjacent quadrants next to cunt world? Like if I go deeper into the fear, where can I end up? And obviously, like it's hell, right? Like cunt world is the gate to hell. Like if you really freak out enough, you'll have a nervous breakdown, you'll get cancer, you'll get sick, you'll go through a divorce, you'll be abusive, you'll hurt people and all of that will create more chain reactions that will land you in a fucking hospital bed, prison cell, you name it. And ripple into the lives of other people. That too, but who cares about that? Hold on one second, sorry. I'm really sorry about this. You guys, I've been twitching. So I'm like, my mics are screwed up. So I'm having to adjust the volume. I feel like I'm too loud now. You're coming back from twitch universe? Yeah. So yeah, it's exactly, which is another universe. So yeah. So tell me a little bit about the concept of alternate realities and magic. Could you I want to I want to know if there's any corresponding philosophies to this and any of this magical systems? Well, I think that the core, the core idea there is just to, you know, simply the idea that we always have free will and we always have a choice. And we always have a choice of how we perceive and how we react. And that sounds simple and new agey, but that is incredibly powerful. It's by it's by cultivating the ability to it's by first cultivating awareness of ourselves that we then cultivate the ability to make choices and to stop with, for instance, destructive patterns that may have been, you know, like, for instance, if you're abusive, you know, you might be, you know, an abusive person, but that may have gone back all the way to your childhood when when you experienced abuse, and that might have gone all the way back to your father's childhood when he was abused, and that might have gone back to his father's and his father's and, you know, mother, father, family, friends, well, who's going back to the dawn of language, you know, the dawn of history. And, and, you know, magic is how magical is it to think that that pattern, which is, you know, we might be able to see as a demon or something even can be stopped immediately simply by choosing not to perpetuate it. And, but I think that, for instance, cunt world, right? Yes. Yeah, trunk put chugging trunk but talked about this, the Tibetan tantric teacher, in he was looking at the, there's a, you can Google it, there's an image called the, I believe the Mahakala, not Mahakala, what is it called the, it's the wheel of life. Bhavacakra, Bhavacakra, right, which is an image of the six realms of existence. So, and that goes from the heaven realms to the realms of the demigods, the humans, the animals, the hungry ghosts, and then the hell realms. And he, I, you know, and this is more than just, you know, I think that potentially traditional Tibetan tantric magicians might say those are actually dimensions, but his point is those are states of mind. And if you're in that state of mind to all intents and purposes, the world becomes that dimension. So the, the primary emotion that generates hell realms or cunt world is anger, right? Because anger leads to the feeling of trappedness. And when you feel trapped, then you're to all intents and purposes in hell. Right. So the idea is, and of course, since this is a Buddhist philosophy, the idea is that none of these realms are really, really that different from each other. They're all just different forms of illusion. But his point is, you know, at any point in a hell realm, you can simply just stop, maintain awareness and just stop perpetuating it. You always have free choice. And you can always choose the dimension, the reality you want to experience. And that does not instantaneous. That is a long term process that includes retraining your conditioned samskaras, or I believe that's before the samskaras, as the Hindus say, or your, your conditioned trains of thinking. But we always have a chance and a choice to choose reality. Because if you think of, if you think of the way that I think about this, if you think of the world around you as a sphere, right, your sphere of sensorium, the world of everything you perceive with your five senses is a sphere that you're in, like you're in the middle of a hamster ball. And then you think of your awareness, your consciousness and your perception as like a 3d projector. Okay, right. And it's projecting this sphere you see around yourself. So that we always fall into the delusion and the mistake of thinking that the world around us that we're subject to the world around us. When really, there is no difference between subject and object. We're projecting this illusion around us. We are we're each of us the, you know, the, the God of our reality, the primary archon of our existence. And we project that around us based on our thought patterns. But it's not just what you happen to be thinking at any moment. It's your conditioned trains of thought going back your entire life and in theory, prior lives and things like that. And and of course, bounced off all the people around you. So this is why meditation becomes so important because meditation is the ability to maintain awareness of our consciousness and ultimately to silence it so that we have control of it. And I think it's probably that's, you know, largely that simple. Wow. Now, there's two points that you're talking about here. I want to go to the first one, which is really interesting to me, which is the echo of of abuse, addiction, you name it, whatever, a lot of people, anything that gets anytime anyone points, and it is genetic, you know, a lot of it's genetic, there's a literal demon traveling through the DNA, apparently, of lines and lines of family lines where there's like alcoholism or where there's insanity, for example, or, you know, all simers or all these things. And I, you know, those, I don't know, I'm sure that there's systems of magic that say all of these lines can be dealt with, but certainly the one that we have control over is the one based on anger. Because I know what you mean, man, like when I've been, I've been floating on this float tank now. And what's been coming to me again and again, and like, again, is goes to Christmas pass level tour guide that I can't see showing me things like, behold, when you were cruel to that girl when you were nine, and just vivid, vivid, vivid, you know, like seeing it, seeing the look on her face, seeing the disappointment my brother's face, driving away from the situation and feeling my stomach drop. And then, you know, like seeing all these things and realizing that, whoa, there is appears to be, since I was very young, recurring pattern where I'm a shithead to people, and I think it's okay. And that's a real fucked up and intense and kind of, for me, delightful thing to discover. Yeah, isn't that rough? Yeah, that's really rough. That's why I don't smoke dope anymore. Why? Because that process gets so incredibly over, you know, you lose your, you lose your distance from it. It becomes your whole, you know, exactly what you're describing becomes overwhelming. Well, don't, isn't that good? Don't you want to be overwhelmed here? Because what I started thinking is, oh, this is the confession. I'm in a, I'm in a confession booth right now. It's not a traditional confession booth, but I'm in darkness with a sense of a presence, and my quote sins, since I was very younger being shown to me. And here I am atoning for them with the emotional sorrow. The sorrow is a good way to put it. It comes from re-experiencing your own asshole-ness, you know, and I think that's good. I think maybe you should start smoking dope again. It's a very Catholic reality imprint. Oh, cool. Yeah, okay, okay, great. Okay, great. But yes, but yeah, no, I, yeah, no, I agree with you as well. I'm, I, but it can be because, because that stuff can be dealt with in meditation as well. And sometimes I don't want to cut off your point. No, no, please don't forget it. But the one thing that I was going to add is sometimes when we get very guilt ridden like that, sometimes the one thing that we've forgotten is that everyone in these scenarios is just as much an infinite consciousness with free choice as us. Yeah. Right. So it's kind of like it becomes, that almost becomes another ego trap where it's like, I'm, you know, it's all my fault. And I'm the one fucking everything up where that becomes a negative ego trap. Right. Okay, great. So this is an interesting point that you're zeroing in on here. And it's the question of atonement and the question of when it, when are you in denial about your own actions? And, and it would be a very easy thing to do, to do, you know, if you listen to Ram Dass and you hear his prescription for loving the self completely, regardless of whatever it is that you've done, fully embracing the self, whatever it is that you've done, it sounds amazing, really great until you consider someone like say Ted Bundy and let's say post beating a woman to death and maybe raping her. I don't know if he's a rapist. I think he was. At what point do you allow yourself the incredible ecstatic bliss of thinking I'm just a universal consciousness and she's a universal consciousness. And all I did was essentially pop a balloon. That's all I popped a balloon that screamed a lot and cried and has a family, but I popped a balloon that's returned to the consciousness of the universe. I'm saying this, you know, Bundy needs, we need Bundy to not think that we need Bundy to come to the moment of crisis that emerges when you recognize the fact that your decisions that move in the direction of any kind of violence based on anger, whether it's physical or psychological world and thus you should stop because in the same way that when I hold a candle to my skin and it burns, I am being burned by the sorrow that comes from deciding another human in this dimension. Don't you need the Catholic atonement? Don't you need the lash, Jason? Do you need the lash? Well, to maintain social order, absolutely, right? But as a member of the Illuminati, you know, all I can say is that we're working on these things. Well, I think that I think that what we're talking about is a clear, when people get into spiritual reality, spiritual reality, these ideas, there's a couple things that happen. One is called spiritual bypassing, which is a, you can Google it, it's a, I believe a therapeutic phrase, which essentially means that once you learn a bit of spirituality, you can use it as a way to bypass your own emotions or your own, or to deal with the, to deal with reality, right? Spiritual bypass, is that a good thing? No, it's not a good thing at all. It's, it's essentially another form of self-deception because, and one of the problems with spirituality is spirituality will, I don't want spirituality sounds so vague, but you know, these, these, you know, Eastern philosophies and things like this will show you what you are ultimately, but it will not heal your personality or do the work of day-to-day life for you. It doesn't change your fundamental position in the world. It just gives you more awareness of where you are. That's basically it. So another thing that happens is what Crowley called confusing the planes, which is, you know, just because, you know, just because we're all ultimate, you know, infinite awareness experiencing itself, you know, just because we're awareness emerging from the void as an emergent process to take on finite, you know, the human race is this, is this finite expression of infinity experiencing itself that, you know, loves itself and has sex with itself and kills itself and tortures itself and traffics itself and everything on the spectrum from the best to the worst. And yes, all of these things are simply passing phenomenon in the great void, but to make the mistake that just because everything is infinite, what you do does not matter is missing the point. Because in the world, it's kind of like you can't, you know, just because, you know, calculus doesn't mean that you can, you're going to be any better at basketball, right? That's a really weird metaphor. But the idea being that day to day life is all the rules of day to day life apply to the plane of day to day life. There is no way out or spiritual bypass from them. The point is to maintain awareness and to not forget what you are so that you have free, you know, so that you maintain more free will and you maintain and, you know, and the so that you don't commit the sin of ignorance, which is ignorance of your true nature, right? But but the and and of course, as one people progress as people see more of, you know, it's a beginner's mistake to think that studying these things makes you yourself more aware. You're simply becoming more aware of the universe. And as you become more aware of how infinite and how much equally how equally divine all beings are, then it just doesn't make sense to behave like an asshole. Oh, cool. Okay, cool. Okay, cool. So it's again, it goes back to this concept of moving into another psychological realm, moving into another metaphysical realm, which is if you're in the Kant world or any realm below that first chakra land, then hurting other people makes great sense. The first chakra is only survival instinct and bodily health. These are actually the the energetic chakras. Chakra has a couple meanings. One is the it just means wheel. And one is the energetic wheels within the body. And another one is a wheel of existence. So there's no like hell chakra in the body. But wouldn't you say, I mean, if the survival instinct, it's like fight or flight, gather resources, that's for chakra kind of stuff, right? Don't they say that a person who is stuck in their first chakra in a negative sense can end up getting kind of fixated on bean counting and just also just survival stuff, maybe survival stuff with like more attractive masks placed on it, you know, like for example, when you watch one of those shows about the ultimate cheapskate, I don't know if you've seen any of those before. But like, I love that stuff. Usually like my my favorite all time reality show is Dog the Bounty Hunter. Right, right. I mean, I watch Lifetime Network relentlessly. I enjoy it so much. But the so but what I mean is that my understanding of the first chakra, I don't even pronounce it right. That's why I have you chakra, not chakra chakra. You can pick. Okay, so the first chakra, my understanding of it is that it's some like if you if you see someone who's like always fixated on their money, always fixated on their life conditions, not lasting, worried about the like in a state of fear, just kind of like fixating on hoarding or whatever. That's like first chakra behavior, right? That's like not good first chakra behavior, but like the negative version of it where you're like in a kind of neurotic state of survival, because you think there's limited access to resources and you feel like you've got to defend scarcity mentality scarcity mentality. Yeah, isn't that right around the first chakra? And then the second one, it starts becoming more about power. First is survival. It's just basic survival function. Second is sex. And third is power. Third is power, right? So two is purely devoted to sex. Sex and reproduction. Okay, that makes sense. Okay, cool. So, so the first so wait to think about this would be the first is I survive. The second is I and my progeny survive. The third is I protect these things. Whoa, cool. But the third's the heart, right? The fourth is the heart. The fourth is awesome. I'm getting dying to learn about this. So think about it this way. The first is I survive. The second is I reproduce. Third is I protect myself and my progeny. Got it. The fourth is now I love them because I'm not concerned with I've solved the problems of survival and protecting my own. So there you go. That's your standard. That's your standard set for a human being. And that's really all you need. The other the other chakras follow on into other territories. But that's essentially your basic way to create a human being. And and those things have to find healthy expressions exactly like you're saying, because if they become yeah, if they go into unhealthy expressions, then we get, you know, perversions or maybe perversions is the wrong word, but ineffective uses of these of these chakras. So but if you think about it, that's where most people in the world are at. They just want to they want to build a home for themselves and their family and and have it be safe and everything to be fine. And they don't want to be rattled. And they don't want they don't want to know about anything else they're consumed with that thing. And they're making more humans, right? And that is perfect, right? That is like a perfect human existence. Wow, that's so cool. Yeah, it's the this is Prabhupada talked about this, you know, Prabhupada, the Hare Krishna's Prabhupada talked about this. He said that all all sentient life in generally all that it's doing is eating, sleeping, mating, and defending itself. That's it eating, sleeping, mating, defending and that human beings pretend that they're not animals, because the way that they eat and the way that they sleep and the way that they fuck and the way that they fight is very advanced. And you know, they eat with very nice forks and knives on beautiful plates and and beautiful homes. And as they're doing this, they pretend that they're civilized because their cutlery is expensive. But really, all they are is a squirrel in its nest chewing on a nut that's pretending it's special. Right. That's it. Right. And and to reject the the fact that we are animals tends to lead to neuroses, you know, we are animals, we need to embrace the physicality of the body and the man bodily functions and our own animal nature. And to pretend that we're not tends to be a, you know, is the legacy of certainly Judeo Christian, some Judeo Christian thought, and and the legacy of some Western thought and is really the legacy of civilization and is kind of a control mechanism, you know, all of the philosophies that say that we have to stop enjoying our animal nature tend to be not not serve us. They tend to serve whoever's in charge of the local area. Oh, who wants who wants order maintained. That's awesome. Yeah, that's really cool. Yeah, you're not supposed to enjoy your body, the sins of the flesh. Your the body is a corrupt hive of demons and the idea is to as much as possible, cut off all forms of sense gratification. Ain't just Judeo Christian also as the Hari Krishna's right who say no eating no or no not no eating, they say that would be pretty intense. They say some of them they say no sex, right, no illicit sex, no gambling, no drugs. And I always forget what the fourth regulative principle is. Oh, no eating meat. So those are the four regulative principles. And it is the same. It's like denying the body. It's saying we're not going to allow our identities to be trapped in the fishnet of animal life. And though that is a pleasure, and though that is it can be some of the most joyful experiences of all time, having a great meal, incredible sex, delicious booze, lost in a I'm talking about celebratory not like addictive I'm talking about those moments when life is going great conscious just conscious beautiful moments. It's incredible. The concept is that as incredible as that is, it's still limiting you to the 80 or 90 year lifespan that you're currently experiencing. And it is inducing the amnesic state of forgetfulness that you are mentioning earlier to your true identity, which is an infinite being that isn't bound by the normal animal instincts. So right now. So the question is, you know, where do you want to land your where do you want to focus? Do you want to be the great enjoyer? Do you want to be Hugh Hefner or something? Do you want to be like the do you want to be like Game of Thrones level? You know, harems and like silk scarves everywhere and incense burning and opium burning and just sounds like what you're going for. No, I don't want that. But I but I do understand the joy of it. You know, somebody gives you a hellraiser box. You get fucking hooks in your debts. You're so happy about it because the ultimate pervert. But but and I don't think it's bad. But isn't the idea to move those the energy up from the root to the crown chakra to release the Kundalini energy so that you're no longer trapped in the first four of these chakras or the first three, the fourth one seems pretty good. Right. Well, the Well, here's the here's the question, right? Is it top down or bottom up? Yeah. Meaning are you really trapped in a body trying to experience spiritual consciousness and somehow stuck or are you already spiritual consciousness that's chosen to enjoy a body? Oh, that's a great that's so fucking cool. And for me, and that's a personal you know, philosophical question to ask yourself. But if you are choosing to be here and enjoy this, that tends to be a more productive belief, I think, because then you don't have the idea of the trap, right, which we see so much in, you know, so much of Buddhism or Gnosticism sells us on this idea of the trap, you know, we're stuck here. There's no trap. I don't think, you know, it's it's all choice. It's a loving universe. Yeah, it's cool. Everything's elective. The now, I love it, man. It's good. You've definitely pinpointed the fact that for whatever reason, I seem to be becoming a Catholic because I'm definitely my POV lately. And maybe it's just because I'm trying to be really disciplined in everything. His has been this sense like last night. Oh, you're becoming a Jesuit. Yeah, I just want to see if I can, you know, I'll be sure I've quit drinking. I've been monitoring my diet. I exercise all the time now. So like last last night, I had a slice of apple pie and some ice cream and I couldn't enjoy it. I'm sitting there eating it like, what are you doing to yourself? You've got to get control of yourself. You've got to see if you can pull this off. And that's a very heavy way to live. That's a very heavy way to live. But based on my particular goals right now, and just the alchemical experiment that I'm doing, if I allow myself to exist in the conceptualization of the universe being a place to gratify the senses, then I'm not going to reach this goal that I want to reach. And I'm fully aware of the fact that underneath everything is a general level of absurdity, making any human action or goal on one frequency completely absurd, fully aware of that. But even so, just because we appear to be in some kind of hamster ball of reality, ultimately floating in nothingness, I just want to see what kind of tricks I can do. And some of those tricks, I can't do them if I'm gratifying my senses and living the life of a Game of Thrones prince. Right. So now you're talking like a magician. So I think that personally, I think, just to take this down to very, very practical, I think that anything, any practice that develops your willpower and discipline, no matter what it is, whether that's maintaining a gluten-free diet or working out or choosing to learn computer programming or whatever it is, anything that gives you more willpower and discipline and control is good, especially now when we live in a very diffident sense, pleasure, addicted time in which all of the people we see around us are just kind of floating through existence, watching Game of Thrones and watching Walking Dead until they are the Walking Dead and just expecting, and we see it all day on the internet, expecting you know, reality to conform to their wishes and entertain them and lashing out and attacking it when it doesn't do exactly what they want. I mean, just look at the comments every time they release a new superhero movie. Right. And Crowley referred to this as the aeon of the child, you know, we live in a time of children where everyone is children around us, and that's a positive thing. That's a good thing because it's a period of individuation, which is an evolutionary step past subjugation previously by kings and gods, right? Yeah. So it's a big deal, but it's also kind of annoying to live in. But anything that will discipline you, self-imposed discipline or focus is good, especially now in such a precarious economic time. How much is having a detailed knowledge of Game of Thrones trivia going to help us if this starts to look like Greece, for instance? Right. That's definitely a thought that's crossed my mind. And because you can't really lose by being disciplined, like you're not going to lose anything. And it's also one of the unobtainables, which I really like thinking about, you know, the unattainables, the things that money can't buy, it's an unobtainable. So that's another thing that's interesting to me is that here you have a thing that's outside of the control of all economic systems. Money cannot buy discipline, if it could. But discipline can get you money. That's true. That's exactly right. So it's a curiosity, that's all. And well, I think that to summarize all the stuff we've been talking about into one thing, Crowley nails this by talking about philema, the true will, meaning, you know, the classic dictum do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law, meaning not do whatever you like, but that everyone has a different path or dharma in life, a reason to be here. And but that's not a given. That's not an automatic. You need to discipline yourself to follow your, you know, as Larry said, follow your bliss, it's not just follow your bliss, it's follow your your bliss and pain and suffering and hard work and your dream and your vision and develop the will and develop the discipline to get that unobtainable, which is the vision of yourself that you know that you can be. And therefore, there is no universal right and wrong for everybody. And I don't say that as a moral relativist, obviously, you know, there are definite bads. There are definitely definite don'ts and definite do's in life. But that we each have different roles to play and different paths to follow. And that what is crucial is, and I find that I find that choosing that attitude instead of the kind of passive mystical attitude of just, I'm going to, you know, everything's bliss, I'm just going to enjoy that. But the idea of almost, yeah, like Jesuit level discipline, but not Jesuit, the lemak, you know, that's the key. And it is advised again and again, you hear it again. And you know what, man, it ain't a fucking popular opinion. One thing I was thinking about is that if you want to sell books, you probably are going to sell more books if you give out some kind of version of this that involves not much discipline, you know, because it's that concept of discipline sounds so agonizingly boring. Discipline, please shut up. Because whenever when I was a kid, and I heard discipline, you know, it was, it was related to really mundane, submissive decisions that you want kids to make, you know, it doesn't, it's not really discipline. It's just, it's behaving according to the whims of your supervisors, whether they're your parents or your boss or whatever. So that's not what I think discipline is now. I think discipline is a whole other thing. That's exactly what you're saying, which is identifying this actualized state as a potentiality inside of you, letting that actualized state be whatever it is. And it's obviously incredibly individual for, for, for all people. Everyone, you're all, you're all going to have your own version of what this is. But even right now, I bet people listening, if you just think, what would I look like in my ultimate form? You know, what would that be? This is not even my final form. This is not my final form. What, what if, what if, what if, if, you know, what if right now I'm mid transformation inside the chrysalis of my ego, based on my experience thus far, can I prognosticate what my actualized self would be like? And then something will pop into your head. You'll see it, whatever it is, is ridiculous as it is, or maybe it's not much different than the way right now. But you identify that and then discipline is the grappling hook that you throw into that place and, and, and climb up so that you become that thing. For what reason? Who knows? That's why I was mentioning the absurdity stuff, because you do kind of think, well, like, why, right? You know, why even bother? Why even do it? Like, who cares? Like, don't even try. Let's not even try because nothing means anything and we're all dying. And so I'm just going to sit here and shove crappy food in my mouth and pretend that I'm a fucking rebel when really all I'm doing is sitting at the bottom of a pit staring up at the sun and pretending that I'm not trapped, you know? That sounds like the last Batman movie. Yeah. Yeah. And he has to jump without a rope. Never forget. Oh, right. Now I know you're talking about that when he's in the Danes prison. Yes. So to me, it's like, okay, this, yes, this is a, is a worthwhile activity as far as I'm concerned. And to me, it does seem like magic. And it does seem like what I've read from Crowley, you know what, Crowley, I never read from Crowley. I never read anything from Crowley advice. I've never read Crowley saying, oh, and here's when you take naps, or here's when you rest, or here, I don't, I don't see that from Crowley. Crowley is just focus your will as much as you can, more than you think, and you will achieve anything that you want to achieve. And that will better the universe because you're the universe becoming more. Yeah, I think that's very well put. And, and, and, and even to make that the idea of discipline more practical, if for instance, as an example, as a specific to talk about a specific practice, if people knew how high they could get from a serious yoga and meditation practice at the point where they're doing it for several hours and doing hardcore, serious pranayama and so forth, if people knew how high and happy and blissful they could get from that stuff for free, forever, on demand with no hangover, maybe that would be a motivator. But obviously, it's not just about, it's not just about bliss, it is about what it really is, is transcending the mind and getting the mind to go silent, right, is the key of the key. And that's very, very hard. It's one of the hardest things a human can do, I think. It's so hard. In that fucking tank, you really get a good glimpse of just how hard that is, because it's an, it's, you know, and I was listening to Jack Cornfield, and he was talking about noting and how whatever the particular state is that you're experiencing as you're meditating, just give it a name and let it go by, you know, note it like it. So the word I would use to describe what you just talked about is impenetrable. It is so incredibly difficult to, I can like silence my thoughts to some point, but there's always this thread of being, this thread of self, this, I don't know, nucleus of identity that I cannot get past. I can't dissolve it. I can't get any further. But if I did, I know that I would have, there could all that would be left would be everything. There would be pure emerging with the infinite. Do you know who Shiv Bali Yogi is? No. So Shiv Bali Yogi was one of the, you don't hear about him much, but he was one of the, in India, I think is recognized as one of the primary meditators of the 20th century. And he's no longer in a body, but his student Shiv Rudra Bali Yogi is still teaching. He went into Tapas. Tapas is when the Hindu meditators, after they reach a certain point of training, just meditate 24 hours a day. And he was in this for seven years, right, in order to, and apparently, according to when you talk to real hardcore Hindu gurus or teachers, that you'll hear this story. It's like, you know, the training is like 20 years. And he, so he was in in Tapas for seven years, barely eating anything. And when he came out of it, his fingers were fused into his hands, like this. So if you wrap your the front of your fingers to touch the balls of your palm, and then kind of curl your thumb into it, his hand, his hands were fused like that, because he had them in that position on his thighs while he was meditating. And they basically were like that permanently from then on. And his student has the same who I've met has the same hands, right? And it's like, this is what we're talking about, right? A nearly insurmountable level of discipline. But the point is that it is the point, right? It is the point of, of, you know, evolution, right, is to get to this point. So the point of evolution is to overcome the essentially the discursive mind. I mean, okay, first of all, God knows what those guys are experiencing at that point. I have no fucking clue, right? That is, I mean, you read those guys accounts, and they're like talking about like going to other dimensions and visiting other planets on the astral realms and shit like that. So fuck knows what's going on in those guys' heads. But to bring it down to the day to day, you know, the mind, the discursive mind, the ego, the part of us that says some things are good and some things are bad and I am and I'm scared, I don't want to die. That's a fairly recent development in human evolution. And it's an evolutionary stage. And it is not the final evolutionary stage. It's an organ we've grown, just like an appendix, or a heart or whatever, you know, that the ego is an organ we've grown to individuate ourselves and maintain a, you know, to be able to do human life as we currently experience it. But to think that it's the endpoint of the evolution of human consciousness would, you know, I think be a mistake. And so the idea is not to destroy that. We always get this idea particularly since the 60s, since like the acid tests of the 60s. And we get this idea, this kind of Charles Manson-esque idea that we need to destroy the ego, which is false, right? You know, that's not true in as much as you don't want to cut your appendix out. They used to think you should cut your appendix out, but it turns out we need it because it develops certain useful bacteria and things like that. So the idea is, no, no, no, you want to outgrow the ego, right? Because once you are able to maintain no mind states, you realize that basically everything, nothing you do requires the mind, you know, just observe yourself next time you're driving. When you're driving a car, if you drive a car, you are constantly making split second decisions that determine whether you will live or die and whether the people around you will live or die. Now try going on the freeway, right? Now how many of those automatic movements that you're taking, are you telling yourself, okay, now turn the wheel like half a degree to the left, like nothing, there's no language there, right? So we don't actually need the linguistic mind to function, right? And in fact, when we learn to function without or when we learn to outgrow the mind and keep it in its place, then that's when we begin to enter into what psychologists call flow states, right? So when you read these autobiographies of guys like Michael Jordan or something like that, and they talk about scoring a goal, or anyone who's at the top of their profession, you will always hear them saying the same thing, which is they're just not thinking about it, or some an actor who's at the top, you know, at the top of his profession, he's not thinking, or she's not thinking when she's performing those roles, right? It just happens. So that's the power of the post-linguistic or intuitional level of the human brain, and I don't know enough neuropsychology to put any neuropsychology terms on it. So you're saying that, you know, a lot of people scold me because I'll give evolution a motivation, but I know what you're saying, because they are like, evolution isn't a thing, it doesn't want anything, it's just adaptation. But what you're saying is that as a human being on this planet, if you want to be the in-between thing that happened between the protohomid and the human beings, if the human beings are going to, if this amazing transformation from monkey into us into whatever we're to become is continuing, as obviously it must be, then if you want to aid the movement in the direction of that next thing, then your job is to overcome your mind. And if you just want to have a better life, I think, you know, because how much of, if you go through the day listening to all the bullshit your ego throws at you about, and that could be either, oh, I'm so good, and I'm better than this, you know, I'm better than all this around me, or I'm lesser than, the ego is like a math program that constantly compares itself to things around it in order to maintain its reality. Because as long as it's comparing, as long as it's performing math operations, it's not, it's not equilibrated to zero. Therefore, it still exists. Wow. That is badass. That is so cool. I don't know where that came from. Really, really cool. Yeah. Okay. So it's like a binary kind of, you know, it's just like greater or less than what I'm around. This, that, this, that, this yes, no, yes, no, true, false, greater than, less than. And even as this thing is running the program, there's this, and this is what I've, you know, gotten from the tank, and also getting, I get it from VR too, weirdly, because virtual reality is the opposite of a float tank, if you think about it. But it's also, I, my big hope for, not, my big hope for VR is that it will, A, VR is the closest people who are, it's, it's a, it's like a simulator of astral travel. Right. It's also a simulator of the psychedelic experience for people who have not had the psychedelic experience. But ultimately, I think that just as astral travel and the psychedelic experience will ultimately show one, if you approach them respectfully, it will ultimately show the futility of it. Right. Like the, the, it's, it's a metaphor demonstrating the nature of Maya or Samsara as just stuff. Yes. Yes. Yes. We're just in virtual reality. Exactly. Exactly. It's, it's like, it's like Tantra. It's like Tantra compared to the float tank. Float tank is then VR is Tantra. It's like one is overloading your senses, one is removing everything from your senses, both point to the ephemeral nature of the thing that we currently consider to be reality. And, and, and the ego is a manifestation. Is it? Okay. So what I'm trying to get at here is the ottoman, the observer, the witness, right? Watches the ego play out all the games. Yes. Anything that you're aware of, anything that you can see, anything that you can experience is not your true identity. It's just something you're watching. What you really are is the great watcher of all things. So my question is, is the ego part of Maya? Is the ego in the same way that every other phenomena out here in the external, is the ego also just part of Maya and something that is very close to us, but still not us at all? Yes. I think the, well, okay. When we talk about the ego, the ego is a word that was created, you know, is a relatively new word that comes out of psychology. It comes out of Freud and not, and not the spiritual tradition. So, so it becomes the idea. It becomes tricky it's good in a way to talk about these things in Western language. It's also good to talk about them in Kabbalistic or Eastern language, because then we have a much more precise set of linguistic tools for talking about consciousness phenomenon in the same way as we have one word for snow and Eskimos have 47 or however many it is. So they have a much more developed toolkit for talking about snow in the same way that if you look at these spiritual traditions like Kabbalah or Vedanta or things like, you know, the Madhyamika of Buddhism and things like this, then you get an incredibly specific toolkit. So in terms of, yes, the ego is the primary generator of our experience of reality, right? So the ego being the bundle of karmic impressions or samskaras, which create the illusion of an individual existence, right? And, and transcending that moving on from that, then yes, we get to the atman or the external, the observer, right? The, it's kind of like the just the, it's like just the fact that one exists at all. Of course, the, the insight of the Buddha was that even this is Maya, even this does not exist, right? There is no atman. And the Buddha's point, whether one agrees with it or not, is that there actually is no, that the atman is the ultimate illusion. And in fact, there is nothing but the interconnectedness between phenomenon. Meaning arises, meaning arises, and this is kind of like a, it's almost like an advance in physics, I think, that meaning, reality arises only from the interconnections between things. So I would not be this version of myself, unless I was sitting here with you, having this conversation with everyone listening, right? And neither would you, right? When you, after we're done with this, I'm going to go to Vaughn's, and I'm just going to be the guy who's pissed off buying a bag of chips in an aisle or whatever. And, and you'll play with your dogs, and then you'll be dunking in in relation with the dogs. I'll be Jason in relation with the person in the checkout lane. And the Buddha's point is none of, all of these things are inherently empty of any independent existence, because you can't have, you cannot have a phenomenon without another phenomenon to observe it essentially. Right. Yeah, that's pretty cool. I love that. Yeah, it's good. It melts, it melts you down. Like it's all just a melting, it's all, you know, not this, not this, it's not even that. Oh, you think you found the observer, you found the great field of awareness, you found the thing that's watching, that is untouchable. Even that is something that is not real. So that you, it's just blind, it's, it's blindfold all the way down. It's just one blindfold, and you pull that off, and then there's another, and you pull that off, and there's another. And as long as you keep pretending that you can pull off the fucking blindfold, is as long as you're going to remain trapped, right? You have to eventually realize that the blindfold, and this is what we started off talking about in the beginning, and I can't remember the exact words. Samsara is nirvana. You have to realize that the blindfold is actually sight, right? That's what it is. You recognize that the blindfold and all fields of phenomena and all things that exist are perfect, and you surrender to that, right? Is that it? I don't even know what my question was, man. Kind of blew my mind a little bit and sent me on a weird rambly rant, so forgive me. Well, I think that the, oh man, yeah, once we start, now, okay, now we're getting into territory where it's like, okay, this is like, we're at the, where mystics sit around and talk shit about this stuff just all day long, right? Yeah, right. And, is there, is there not? Why is there, when is that, you know, so. It starts eating itself, you know? It's the thing starts, it's trying to dissolve itself backwards, and which is okay, like what we're doing is just the, you know, exactly, we're saying that endless wrestling with God, it's the, is awesome, amazing, beautiful interaction that we're having with our surroundings and our current predicament. Oh, I remember what I was going to say. I was stressing out because I forgot what I was going to say, and it ties in perfectly to this, so I'm glad I remembered it now. You talked about evolution and people having a problem with evolution, right? And we're at this absurd cultural moment, right? Where people are saying, you know, where we have, you know, the religious right being absurd, right? And believing in these fairy tales. Yes. And then we have the supposed cutting edge of western consciousness, which is hardcore, atheistic, materialistic, you know, so on, and so fedora-wearing, you know. Yeah, guilty of that one. Richard Dawkins, non, you know, atheistic approach to reality. And we have this, we have this, this silly debate between these two things and this silly debate between this idea of science and this idea of religion, which are not even really science or religion. They're just kind of these bizarre cultural forms that have brought up around sets of people. Right. And one of the things that, what we've just been discussing, this phenomenon of non-existence and dissolving, Crowley calls this NOx, N-O-X, the NOx formula. And I think I'm getting this right. Don't quote me on this. But basically, one of Crowley's points is it is actually better to be, it is better to approach the field of spirituality and religion as an atheist than as a religious or faithful person, because then you don't have your preconceptions in the way, right? And it's better to do experiments from a position of non-belief, because belief, faith, all these ideas, it's, once one, once, and obviously one can experience this on psychedelics or if you're a hardcore meditator or through whatever way, you get to a point where you realize the shit in your head is just the shit in your head. And whether you, you might have read it from a book, but that's just shit from somebody else's head. That ultimately, as human beings, the mind or the ego-making faculty is not capable of perceiving or putting into language any of this stuff. So when you start talking about mystical states, you just end up kind of saying nonsense. And it makes sense to people who have experienced the same thing. We're talking about this and it makes perfect sense to both of us. But somebody who comes at this from, they were just watching Fox News is going to be like, what the fuck are these stoner hippies talking about? It just sounds like nonsense. So my point being that the atheistic and almost counter-religious current meaninglessness of our meaningless capitalist society, our meaningless post-capitalist, globalized, computerized, Googleized, Game of Thrones eyes, walking dead eyes, dehumanized culture, this profound meaningless that we're experiencing is actually an alchemical stage. The idea that it's a laying fallow of the empty, all this God is dead existentialism, all this stuff, is a laying fallow of the old systems of belief. It's a letting go of our prior fairytale understandings of the divine that are archived in this museum form as all the world religions, not to be too offensive. But this is a stage prior to a new, hopefully a new, more mature understanding of divinity and the universe and consciousness and our place in it that comes from a rationally sophisticated position. It comes from, they'd incorporate science instead of, for instance, I mean, yesterday they announced that they've discovered, at the Large Hadron Collider, they've discovered the Penta Quark, which is great. If there's not a DJ Penta Quark yet, there needs to be one. So the Penta Quark is the lowest form of, not lowest, but I guess the smallest form of matter they've discovered now, it's smaller than the quark, and it has a fucking pentagram in it. Oh no. Yes. They found the devil's mark. And I read this article, and it's like, there's literally language in this article, like, this Penta Quark is cursed somehow. I'm not making this up. We have discovered the Penta Quark. That's amazing. A fucking Penta Quark is a pentagram. Well, you know, I remember like walking down the beach. It's an upright pentagram. Oh, thank God. By the way, a pentagram in any of its forms is beautiful and not able. I was walking down the beach, and I remember finding a star fit or a sand dollar and realizing that sand dollars have pentagrams on them, and then certain cacti have pentagrams on them. And that's beautiful that they've actually, but I see, I love what you're saying, though, man, which is that I love this idea that the, and it kind of reminds me a little bit of what Alex and Alison Gray taught me, and I'm sorry if I misunderstood what they were saying, but what you're saying is that the in-between phase that you're talking about where you, it's okay. We need it. We don't have to be down on ourselves for it. You don't have to think that it's a sign of this disintegration of society. It's actually just a growing phase that humanity is currently having. And they mentioned to me something similar, which is that we actually needed the, this period that you're talking about, because to facilitate the technological innovations that are going to happen, especially with psychedelics to like part of the, we couldn't have LSD without science. You know, we needed a period of stringent, non superstitious, super accurate philosophies and thought so that we could bring into existence the components that were necessary to build the next part of this hyperdimensional spacecraft that we all seem to be shingles on, for lack of a better word. And so I love that, man, because it's very merciful. You know, it means we don't have to, if you want to be an atheist right now, if you don't want to believe, if you want to reject all forms of religion, superstition, as superstition and nonsense, and give up all the mystical stuff and throw it all away. I actually have a friend who, you know, we've been talking and he was going deep into the Bhagavad Gita and a lot of the Eastern philosophies, and he said, it's just, it's, I don't want to do it. It's too much. It's giving me anxiety. It's, it's making me scared. It's, it's rattling my cage a little bit. It feels like a rabbit hole. I can't stop going down. I don't want to do that anymore. And what you're saying is super cool, which is like, don't abandon it. You don't have to. You can approach it from the perspective of an atheist. Don't believe. Give yourself a break from it all if you want to. You don't have to constantly be lost in this incredible, beautiful, the world of the magician or metaphysics or whatever it is. You do, if you can just as, you can be as much use in the world if you just let yourself deal solely in the realm of matter. Right. Is that what you're saying? Well, the, one of the, one of the phrases I came up with, and I've been teaching these classes about magic, and one of the phrases I came up with in the last one was that belief is the currency you spend to make things real. Oh, cool. Right. Or attention. You can apply that to attention. Attention is the currency you spend to make things real. That's awesome. We look at the world around us. Why does everything want our attention? As soon as you open your laptop or you go outside, you're constantly bombarded with pay attention to the new Batman versus Superman movie or go to Vaughns or go to McDonald's or whatever it is, or people come at you wanting to get, involve you in their whatever it is, their drama that they're having. Attention is, seems to be the, the hottest commodity. You know, human attention seems to be the hottest commodity on the planet. Now, why is this? I think it's because it's like hotter than oil. Like human attention is the great fuel. Yeah, go ahead. Sorry. Yes, absolutely. Right. And, and we do in a way live in a, you know, I, I really have begun to suspect that we do live in a modern slave society or human sacrifice society without getting too dark, but, but a much more gentle and, and evolved one than the Aztecs, perhaps, or whoever. But I think that. So you're saying that we're basically like to take what you just said about the slave society. Like the idea is that in the same way we get like, slaughterhouses or, or dairy farms with the milking machine, sucking at the enslaved cows so that people can drink cow juice with their coffee in that same way that we're all like, or a lot of us are just like cattle wandering through some cattle run where our, our attention is being extracted and transformed into energies by our, by our, uh, masters. Well, not, not necessarily by our masters, but by each other, because we're all our own, you know, one of the things that Facebook has proven to me is that we're all each other's captors. Wow. As soon as you get on Facebook, you know, people that you've met 10 years ago once are like up in your shit. Hey, I met you 10 years ago for five minutes. Let me interrupt what you're doing right now. I still wish Facebook had in quotes underneath it, we're all each other's captors. That's so funny. Yeah. It's not like people intend to capture you either. They just, uh, they just get you. Holy shit. Actually, I was just reading, listening to this amazing, amazing, I think it's Sebato, it's Lou Barlow, it's called, it's called Choke Chain and it's a, it's a great song and the essence of it is like the moment you think you're free, someone comes and chokes you with a chain, you know, like a dog on a choke chain, like the moment you have any kind of autonomy or you feel like you're, you're truly being yourself. It's a matter of seconds before some son of a bitch will come and challenge that and try to yank you down into whatever their paradigm is. Yep. And yes, I'm working on a practical way to solve this problem. What is the solution? I don't know yet, but I think that, um, uh, when you become very good at meditation, one of the things that you realize, um, is that, you know, the idea of the will, there is literally nothing that a single pointed focused human awareness cannot do, I think, right? Um, the, uh, you think of your attention as an electrical current, right? And you're putting it on something to turn it on, right? Uh, to make it real. Um, and then you think of all the things that distract your attention, people coming at you on Facebook, your phone going off. Um, the new DC comics movie is out, right? Whatever it is, right? Or you got to go to the, you got to go to the store, you got to get your oil changed. Yeah. You know, the 10,000 things. Yes. Right. A Buddhism. Um, uh, if you think of your attention as a frayed wire and those things just like fraying the wire of your consciousness, the idea of meditation is that you build the strength to insulate the wire so that those things don't have power over you. Cool. And I think that my only answer is it's just got to be trained just like going to the gym. And, uh, I don't think there's any way around the hard work of just doing the mental work of meditation to attain single pointed awareness. Um, but, um, yeah, people don't, people don't want you to do that. They don't want you to be free. And I think that, um, one of the things is when you get really good at meditation, you realize that you have everything you need and that you can get bliss and happiness and love on demand from the universe. You develop your innate connection to the universe. Most people have not developed that their, their, um, um, so that they, they get their energy from other people. Oh, that's good. Okay. That's really good. Yeah. The other, every person around them is a nipple. They try to suck that sweet attention nectar out of. Yes. And they don't realize the fact that they're actually, there is a, a turn as to quote Gandhi, there is an eternal nipple that we can all suckle at. Yes. One moment. So yeah. So universal love nipple. We don't have to access, we don't have to become these like weird attention parasites feeding off of our brothers and sisters, but we can actually tune into this kind of infinite love frequency. This is like the Tesla talked about this, right? His idea that there is, uh, you know, there's a way that we could have endless access to energy. It's a great dream. This is the great dream. It's just, this is the medical, metaphysical version of fusion that you're talking about here. Well, um, my, uh, everything in the world that anyone has ever come up with has come out of nothing, right? And, um, if you think about the classic image of the stage magician is somebody pulling a rabbit out of a hat, you know, something from nothing, that seems to be the way the universe works when you engage with it fully and hence magic with a K is really not that different. Uh, you know, my, uh, my, uh, I think that my best under under current understanding of the universe is that it is nothing, right? It is emptiness, uh, and non-existence ultimately, but somehow paradoxically, and this makes no mathematical sense, but or logical sense, but it seems to be loving nothingness. Cool, right? It's like a, like the, the, and, and how could it be anything else really? It's because it's, it's an emptiness. Rom does cause it loving awareness. Okay. If you think about zero, non-existence, uh, what, uh, you know, the only thing that can emerge from non-existence is the connections between things, um, uh, you know, because phenomenon emerge from nothingness and then the connections between those things form and that is love, right? The connection between two things. So, so how could it be anything else really? Um, it's the adhesive, right? That is so trippy and that's what we really are. Yeah. Yeah. It's really, really, um, and, and this stuff that you're talking about here, this is considered magic. Like people would say that this, this philosophy that you're saying, this is, this is magical, not magical in a sense, like you're out of your fucking mind. There's no talking, uh, unicorns, that kind of magical thinking, but it's magic with a, magic with a K thinking, which is that we are a unified consciousness that is just pure love. Well, I like the, I like the word magic with a K for a couple of reasons. Um, one is it's totally fucking absurd. Yes, it is. It's just like the, the, the things that come into your mind when you hear that word are just like, uh, you know, there's a guide down by the river in a bookmobile who's going to like, uh, I don't know, like, like, you just think of like, you know, people in basements with robes and rings, being total assholes and yeah, and, uh, listening to coil. And, uh, I've definitely been that person. Um, but, uh, when you hear the word magic, it immediately fills your mind with absurd, foolish things. And I think for that reason it's good because it frightens away people who are not ready to deal with it. Or embarrasses away. Like a lot of people, you know, if you want to show you, you want to see how powerful magic is, mention the word around the wrong people and you will force them to roll their eyes instantaneously. So the word itself produces a Gergev and shock if applied in the right way. People are just like, shut the fuck up. We don't, like, like, come on, man. Like, are you an adult? Like, no one wants to, this is, I mean, like, this is, no one said that to me, but I have noticed in the wrong company, God forbid I start rambling about magic. Man, it's like, the pressure drops in the room. It would have been better for me to have explosive diarrhea in a chair than in their house than to mention magic. A lot of people don't want to hear it, not because they're afraid of it, because they think you're a fucking idiot that you would ever buy into that nonsense. Right. But then if people actually begin to look into it, then off to the races, I think that, but the other thing is it suggests, it undermines by its existence, by the word itself undermines the idea of the, we can, the arrogance of the ego into thinking that reality can be understood. Right. To suggest that we don't necessarily, we don't know, we really don't know anything. Okay. If you think about a hundred years ago, people didn't, at the, you know, around the 1900s, people didn't even fully understand that there was a connection between sperm and egg meeting and having a kid. You know, we didn't understand, we didn't know about DNA. We didn't know about, you know, all, you know, we didn't have computers. We didn't have any understanding of the outer planets. What's that? There's a great word for the phenomena where people used to think that flies grew out of shit. Like they didn't under, what's that called? You know, I don't, I don't know. It's, it's a great spontaneous generation or something. You know what I'm saying? It's like, yeah, people also used to think that fish were a vegetable that just grew in the ocean. I could see that. That wasn't that long ago. You know, we, we, we, people are believe in nonsense. But when I guarantee you that back when people thought that fish were, was a vegetable, some asshole was talking to somebody else. Like there was some guys like, Hey, you guys, you know, I've got a crazy thought. I think that fish are actually living organisms. I think that they're not, I don't think they're plant life at all. I think we're, these are animals is what I think. Someone's like, Jeremy, shut the fuck up with your crazy ideas. Fish are vegetables. Everyone knows it. If you're going to be a fish, aren't vegetables guy, please just bring it up somebody somewhere else because we're sick of hearing it. Shut up and go back to tilling the field like everyone else. Oh, I guess you spell fish with a K at the end of it too. Huh? You fucking, you hippy, you hippy woo woo fruit. But that is the attitude. And I think people like us get really frustrated with it. When you look at it contextually that through every period in human history, there has always been a version of Richard Dawkins. There's always been a version of the most stubborn, certain hyper secure per guy or girl who thinks that because they have managed to compile in their mind, the very cutting edge of whatever is the scientific understanding in that particular era and time, they are there for the the level by which all truth can be determined. Right. You know, and that is so fucking frustrating because it's like, look, your confidence and all that you're doing right now, every single time period, there's been someone that level of confidence. And every single time period, those people have been shown to be complete and absolute jackasses. Yes. You know, and so that's why it gets frustrating because you do have to fall back into the state of like, I don't know. Do you know the Lancet, the medical journal, the Lancet? Yes. So I think a month or maybe two months ago, the editor of the Lancet, which is I believe the most prestigious medical journal in in the world, in Britain, but I think in the world as well, it's like you'd be gold standard for scientific, like this is the like ground level reality. There was an editor, the editor of the Lancet in his editorial wrote that over 50% of all published science is just nonsense. Right. Because it's it's not done properly. It's driven by fun. I don't remember his specific reasons, but essentially, like it's not done properly. It's biased and and if we look at, I think I think that science is the great hope of humanity. The true scientific method of saying let's approach reality and do experiments and discover what's real and what's not. Like that is one of the best ideas that human race has ever had ever. Yes. Right. But it doesn't get applied properly and it's only applied to certain things. I think that magic certainly Crowley's conception of magic is applying that exact same attitude to the claims of spirituality and religion to see what's real and what's not by doing the actual recommended practices and taking notes and comparing it with other people who have done the same thing. Don't want to waste my time, bro. It's all bullshit. I'm not going to waste my time, man. I'm not going to get look what was you when we sit around and burn incense in front of a good nash or shut the fuck up, man. None of that shit's real. It's just a fantasy that human beings have come up with to deny the fact that they're going to die. And so in one last desperate attempt to give the illusion that they're okay and not stuck in a cyclone, which is a kind of accidental conglomeration of particles that happen to wake up and are now going to die, they're building fake doll houses made of bad ideas that they spend their time in instead of experiencing real life, which is going to supplantation and getting the discount because your grandfather's there making sure they have baby chairs for you. I love supplantation. You can get great deals there. And you can just like the ice cream section at supplantation, you can get as many like soft serve ice cream cones as you want. And they actually have some pretty decent stuff now. You can get my favorite trick at supplantation is to go with a baggy coat and to just get a bunch of wrapped yams, like sweet potatoes in your pockets and just walk out like that because then you're set for the week. Wow, you're robbing some supplantations. There's a magic trick. Just listen and the tradition of great magicians, you're robbing supplantation. Now, so this idea of science, I don't think a lot of people understand how scientific magic, at least Crowley's magic is and Crowley actually said science or magic is science for the vulgar. Have you heard that quote before? I don't remember. Yeah, I don't remember. He said it. Well, I mean, who knows if he said it could have been a misquoted thing. But the point is, they're very, very similar. And the if there's a lot of people who for no other reason than because they think that they should, they won't try praying. They won't try chanting. They won't try visualization rituals. They won't try astral projection. They won't try any of this stuff because they think they know it's not real. Right. Even though they haven't they haven't done it examined the sources, they're getting this idea that it's not real to determine whether or not they actually tried it themselves. And so it's a form of and it's a form of, I think, laziness because how can you go through the world telling people there's no God, there's no life after death, there's no spirit world, there's no astral plane, there's no soul, there's no this, there's no that. If you haven't spent any amount of time in deep contemplation, practicing the various rituals and rights that have been prescribed by whatever the particular religion is that you want to debunk. Once you've done that, instead of trying to debunk the fucking thing from outside the subjective experience of it, until you've gone into that subjective hamster ball where the walls of the hamster doll are painted with the particular symbols of whatever religion it is, I don't think you can go around saying it's bullshit. I don't think you can go around saying it's nonsense or tripe or whatever it is that you're saying, not you, but whoever it is out there is listening to this, who's been doing that, there probably isn't anyone because I think most people who listen to my podcast probably have some connection with magic, but how can you go around refuting all this stuff if you haven't tried it? And what a great victory you get if you discover from an actual experiment, not bullshit, but if you actually spend, let's say, I don't know, two weeks every morning praying, simple experiment, approach it from the POV of an atheist, spend two weeks every morning waking up and praying however you want to pray. If something changes in your life, then you've just discovered the most incredible thing that has been people have been yapping about for a long time. If you eliminate all the external variables and things that could have, you know, if you approach that with scientific precision, because the flip side of that is the approach of the true believer, right? The person who's like, who gets full on it, this is reality. This is like, you know, I'm going to be, you know, who approaches it as a religion, right? And the idea that simply by doing these practices, you somehow become a good or better person, that is equally insidious, right? Because to take these things as de facto true, just because they're written down by somebody else is also in a form of laziness, right? So Crowley says that magic combines the method of science and the aim of religion. And that the idea is you do experiments, you note what happens, you don't take it too seriously, you don't get overwhelmed by it, and then the next day go out and proclaim you're the messiah or the reincarnation of Cleopatra or the Lizard King or whatever. But you take experimental data, you do yoga practices, you do what might be considered astral travel, you do ceremonial magic procedures, you do a flotation tank, or you do prayer, or you do whatever these things, Sufi dancing, whatever these things are, and you take scientific notes about what happens, and then you review them, and you let the experience sit, and then you've expanded your experience of life. You've had experiences that you didn't have before, and you now have new data for understanding the universe that you did not previously have. But that's not just, you know, that could be anything in life, you know, you could go work on an oil field to see what it's like. That's true. Yeah, that's true. But yeah, I just don't think people understand, because when people think of magic, I don't think they understand that the people who really practice it are very stringent in their approach to it. Well, not everyone is, you know. But if you were to approach it from, at least from the Crowley School, his everything that he says is very detailed, very precise, very disciplined, and it's a lot of reading, you know, he's not just saying like, do ceremonial magic, he's saying you need to read these 30 books, or you know, it's just a huge object, it's like becoming a doctor or something like that. It's a very real practice. It's about that level of work. Yeah, it's like a PhD level of work, or two. Yeah. So, and of that same, one of the things about Crowley, too, is he assumes a classical education. So what he assumes the reader going in will know Greek, Latin, math, history, things like this. And it was one of the most, one of the most fruitful things with Crowley for me is not even the magic per se, it's the looking at how much the standard of education has dropped off in the last 100 years. And understanding that just for us to get to the level of an average well educated kid with a classical education, like an 18 year old kid with a classical education would have had in that time period who had access to that is a huge amount of work for an adult now, you know, the standard of education now is so low that even to get to the point of having a knowledge of our own culture, our own history, and how to do scientific experiments, how to understand languages beyond just English, how to look at things logically, you know, that's a, you know, that's magical right there. And for me, I like I tend not to dwell on these, you know, the supposed supernatural aspects of this, because I'm not sure there actually are any, I think it's just methods of altering consciousness. But I dwell on the practical discipline of it. And the idea of self education, you know, and that's, you know, I've been teaching these classes in Magic Online, and I found that there's a huge hunger for not just, you know, not just spirituality, but learning education, finding out more about the world than just, you know, what's thrown at us by HBO and or Facebook. And there's a huge hunger for because people know they're missing. People are missing so much now, they don't have access to nature like they used to. They don't have free free spaces, they're not they're not able to go places that are not controlled, right, right, that are not under some form of surveillance. Yeah. So they're not there's nowhere that people can go where they can just be themselves, or that is not mediated or advertised to they don't have access to the classical education. And people are missing out. And we've experienced a process of deforestation, which exists not only in the physical world, but within the within ourselves, right, we're losing all these things, and we're losing access to so much knowledge and so much wisdom and and skills of the past, you know, like, for instance, I've been one of the things I've been doing is just as an experiment is metal smithing. I started teaching myself how to do metal smithing and then studying with people. And what I started to realize is all there are all of these disciplines that where do you do that? I just well, I've just been finding people who are masters of it who were teaching classes like you go to like places like you're you're talking about anvil. Yeah, hammer banging on like where do you do that in LA like you got to find people because downtown. No, it's like people's houses where they're just teaching it. Well, what do they do about their neighbors and they're like pounding out a broad sword? You know, they've got they probably have enough property. But just like, but that's really cool. I'm starting to stop you, but it's like, you can't just say you've been dabbling in metal, go over that. That's crazy. So like you're talking about you go to their places in LA, where people have an anvil, right, and a hammer, right, or a whole workshop or things like that. And and and but that's just one thing. And but I what I've been realizing is all of the there are all these skills and trades of the of humanity that we've picked up and learned as critical survival skills that are going to disappear when people die because it's just all computer now, right? Right? Anything that's not on a laptop is seen as lesser than holy shit. And and and and that's really the cultural attitude. If it ain't been digitized, it don't matter. Right. That's the idea. It's got to be digitized. Anything that's not digitized, you just don't know it exists anymore. Right. There were Obama, I think, like six, seven months ago, wrote an article on medium, where he was trying to talk to the millennials, you know, in their own language. So he wrote a thing on medium, which was well written and well measured. He's, you know, and but he basically, he's talking about how millennials are working now and the challenges facing millennials. And if you read between the lines, if you read between the Obama language, what he's actually saying in there is kids, go work in tech or with something that involves technology because nothing else is left and you guys are fucked and that's your only option. And I think that that is so that that, you know, we've lost all the manufacturing jobs in this in this country, we've lost we've lost our heritage in a way. And I think that one of the primary benefits that there are so many benefits of magic to me, but one of them is is is finding out about things like that or even to, you know, to talk have the opportunity to talk about these things with people or you are to have form social connections around them. I mean, I don't I think that there is, you know, the most revolutionary act or the most revolutionary act set of acts that we can take right now is self education, you know, and I don't mean just on the internet, I mean, in a library, I mean, like getting smart because people do not want you to be free and people do not want you to be smart and not smart doesn't mean Wikipedia. Smart means like you actually do the work and the research and the reading. So self education, training oneself and skills and physical world connections, not on Facebook, not social media, but sitting down and having a conversation with somebody and making having a meal with somebody, all right, which is which is a, you know, podcasting allows us to do. Yeah, well, it's the only yeah, exactly. Yeah, creates a space for long form conversations to happen. Okay, well, that's that's it. That's really interesting. That's cool, man. I know you mean that like, learning all these lost things of which whatever this practice of magic is definitely a hidden art form that you, I mean, it has been digitized. I'm sure there's a billion Kindle books on magic, but most of the stuff is so complex, you know, I mean, like, you know, just today, just talking with you about it, like some stuff is really more clear in my mind. And that's the other thing. And God forgive me, you guys are seemingly about to launch into some advertisement for your online course, which you didn't ask me to do. But you know, the old school of this stuff, the way that it worked is you someone teaches it, it's not something and you've been you are taught, right? You are you, you are an apprentice of Genesis, pure and and and yeah, and I went all over the world, you know, learning the stuff and in Nepal and studying under a lot of different teachers, yeah, early Genesis. Yeah, so you you got a transmission. You got something of a transmission. And I think that there's like, you need it, like I need somebody like you that I that understands the chakras, so that I can like bounce ideas off, it just helps a lot. And that's something else that's missing. And especially when it comes to this stuff or anything in general, everyone thinks they can teach themselves this or that, like, not to like make it a super mundane, boring, non magical thing. But since I've been like, I have a trainer at the gym now. And before I had a trainer at the gym, I would go to the gym, I'd lift weights within my comfort zone, I'd lift the same weights every time I went, I'd leave the gym kind of mildly sweaty, having like done really no exercise at all, but convinced that I'm a healthy person, whereas like this guy, you know, now that I'm training, like you really work out, like they've been studying this shit for their entire lives, they understand the anatomy, the human anatomy, they understand the muscular system, they understand everything. When it comes to like physical therapy, they're physical therapists, basically. And so when you work out with them, it's this really precise activity that produces results and really shows you just how much you are limiting yourself by pretending that you knew how to work out when you didn't. And I think that it's exactly the same when it comes to metaphysics. And it's exactly the same when it comes to meditation, you can trick yourself, you can do it on your own, no offense, I'm not saying there has to be a guru or a teacher, you could do it on your own. Ultimately, everything is self education. Right. You've got to do it yourself and learn yourself. But it helps to have somebody who's like, here's what I've been around people who fucking fingernails have grown into their hands from meditating. And here's what I got from that experience. And there's, to me, it's just a big difference. So I think it's cool that you're doing that class, though, do you feel a little uneasy about becoming some kind of cult leader or some kind of, you know what I mean? You know, you're saying earlier, you don't want to be Deepak Chopra, but do you feel a little, does it make you a little nervous to be a teacher? Yeah, of course. I mean, how could it not? But I think that the, what I'm doing is, so I have a website now called magic.me, it's m-a-g-i-c-k dot m-e, so magic with a k. And it's, it's, there's probably six year 70 recorded hours of video on there now, and I'm constantly improving them. So there's, there's like 12 to 13 course modules you can take from, there's things on chaos magic, on traditional ceremonial magic, on astral travel, yoga, meditation, even on things like achieving peak physical energy, lucid dreaming, things like that, and, and that you can take them and learn them as skills from a video, from a, you know, a video instruction, chapter by chapter, that's all practical, you can watch it on any device, you can watch it on a self-paced, and I present it like that instead of as a dogma or a magical group or anything like that. And I was, I really enjoy teaching, so I've, I've really gotten into it, and I've found that it's actually been incredible for my own practice because now teaching it, it's like, okay, it's like now I need to know it, I need to know it, not just how, how I can get it to work for me, but I need to know it, know it, so that I can teach it precisely and accurately. Right. So that's been a quantum leap in my own growth, but I think that. And you don't think you have to, like, because one thing, like, you know, when I consider the concept of the teacher, like, so here's my question to you, and it's a question that comes from, like, on this podcast, I will, like, do, I'll say, you know, some people, I will say things, and I'm like, I don't think you are some kind of spiritual teacher, and, and I'll look at my life, you know, I'll look at, like, man, I, you know, I, I, I, like, screamed at my fucking poodle a couple of days ago, I, I, you know, got, got in a fight with my girlfriend, or I was a total dick, or, like, you know what I mean, I'll look at my, like, the shit that's going, like, your, your car's dinged up, your nabbing plantains from suit plantation. Here's my question, man, here's my question. It was just the once. Yeah, once is forever. I'm gonna see that. No, man, I want to address this because it's something that I think about, and I know what my teachers would tell me, which is just your fucking, just try to help the world, dumb, dumb, don't try to, don't think that if you're not a perfect person, you can't help people, you know, that's ridiculous, and that's just your ego trying to keep you from benefiting the world, because so, but how do you rationalize that though? Like, how do you, how do you wrap your mind around the idea of being so good at articulating this stuff? But if your life isn't perfect, if you haven't actualized yourself, can you then teach? There's actually a very precise way that I, that I look at this, which is in India, there's a difference between a guru and a pondi, right, and a guru is a fully realized, enlightened person who is not only enlightened and realized, but then offers to essentially guide people and carry people along that path, no matter what. Yes. And takes responsibility for people. Yes. And I'm not that, I'm not Ram Dass, I'm not, I don't know, I'm not Neem Karoli Baba, I'm not Yogananda, you know, I'm not a, I'm a guy, you know, I'm a pondi, which is basically, a pondi is basically like a college professor. It's like, I can lay out the intellectual framework for this stuff and communicate it clearly, but in terms of one's own practice, or, you know, I'm not responsible for that. I show the, I'm essentially, essentially what I'm doing is not really any different than writing books on this stuff. You know, it's just, I'm doing it in a video format and then offering it as lectures, just like a college professor. You're just teaching a craft and a philosophy, a series of philosophies that are super old that you are clearly an expert on more than anyone I've ever met when it comes to this stuff. There is no one that I, it was so funny that we ran into each other, you guys, at a VR expo that we were at, because we both like virtual reality, in a, you know, within like two seconds of us talking, you were like, yeah, I hope I'm allowed to say this. I'm going to write a book on Inokian magic, and then you mentioned John Dee, and I thought to myself, man, there, I don't know anybody in my life. I know very few people, maybe two, where I could say to them, John Dee, right? The Inokian angels, and I know very little about it, but I know enough about it to like, have a vague understanding of it. But it's so cool to have people like you in the world, because you remind me of, and I hope you take this in the right way, you remind me of a professor, what was the name of that, the university that H.P. Lovecraft wrote about? Arkham, Arkham University. Yeah, that's what you remind me of. You remind me of a teacher in an H.P. Lovecraft novel. That's hilarious. You really do, and I think it's so cool, man, and I think that it's such a specialized understanding that you have, and so anyway, all I'm saying, you guys, is try it out. It's so cool to like, I mean, you could see from this conversation how good he is. You're right in front of me. You're so good at this. It's totally, it seems like a worthwhile endeavor, and P.S., what the fuck do you have to lose? Like, at the very, you know, how much is a one class? Well, it's, the classes are 55 each. I also do live ones every weekend or so. The ones that are online are recorded. The classes are 55 each for three to five hours of material you get access to, but I also have a subscription plan that's $49 a month, and then you get access to everything. Do people get to talk to you? There is a, there's a Slack forum, if you know what Slack is, like a chat forum that is a new startup. So there's, there's community growing around it, and I'm, I'm involved in that. The live courses, I interact one-on-one with people. There's also people, you can get personal consultation time if you want. The, for listeners of this show, here comes the shameless plug. Here we go, guys. The, so it's 20% off the first month of the subscription plan, if you use the code Duncan, and then it's, it's literally like something like 30 bucks or 30 and some change for a whole month, and then you get to watch, you can watch everything, you can try everything. Give it a shot. I mean, what do you have to lose? What's the big deal? Just try it out. By the way, I'm not, I'm not being paid in any way. A lot of people are like, you know, if I can advertise, I'm not doing, I just like Jason, and as you guys know, I'm a big fan of magic, and it's just cool to have these conversations, and I want to help a brother out. Thank you. Well, I wanted to add one thing to that, which is, in terms of the, the guru, teacher thing, I, I really, in my ultimate vision for this, and one of the reasons why I hope people get involved, who are listening to this now is, you know, magic is really, it's basically like the lost science, and it was prior to the enlightenment, all of the, if you go back and you look at the history, all of the smartest people in Western civilization were deeply engaged in this. You know, Giorgiano Bruno, Newton, Isaac Newton, Daniel DeFoe, certainly John D, people like that. All of the founders of science were very steeped in alchemy and magic, and they had this understanding of all knowledge as a unified thing. So what they were trying to do was not, you know, science now, what they were trying to do is they were not trying to make bio weapons or make genetically modified crops or fill the coffers of some corporation. The original science was they were trying to understand reality. They were trying to understand that, and they saw reality as essentially God, and that magic was a way of understanding what this, this divine thing that we're in, right? And, but it was, of course, as science became more codified with the Royal Society in England, and progressing onward from that, you know, magic was simply just discarded as an embarrassment. And, but in the same way, but it led alchemy, created science, science came out of alchemy. And of course, as is put by JFC Fuller, one of Crowley students, from astronomy, we got, excuse me, from astrology, we got astronomy. From alchemy, we got chemistry. Right. So from if we were to re study, to re go, re pick up this intellectual project and look at the study of magic itself, what, what will we actually get from that when we scientifically understand that? What art will that become? And I want to approach this as a school because there is, of course, I there's nowhere in the world outside of maybe, I think even the programs in England, although there is renewed academic interest in magic from an academic standpoint, instead of a practical standpoint, there's nowhere in the world I can go and be a professor of magic is just, I have to do it myself. So what I would hope is to create an academic type setting around this where it's not about just me being a teacher, it's about almost like grad student type set up where people are talking about these things and performing experiments and taking notes and things like that. And it's just an experiment. If it doesn't work, it doesn't work. If nothing comes out of it, then nothing comes out of it. But I want to try and see and just as as an experiment to see what happens. It's its own magical experiment, isn't it? By the way, that name of the name of the school and I just thought of it love the name of the school in Lovecraft novels, just to avoid getting the comments is it's Miskatonic. That's right. Miskatonic Arkham Arkham Batman. I can't believe I got that wrong. Oh, it's in it's supposed to be in the town of Arkham. That's it. It's Miskatonic University. Yeah, Miskatonic University. That is who you just heard, my friends, a professor from Miskatonic University, Jason Loof. Thank you so much for coming on the show. Let's hear where people can contact you and I'll have these links posted on the site. Okay, so it's magic.me, m-a-g-i-c-k.me. And I should also mention I just have a I have a book out. There's an e-book on Anokian and there's also a new book out called Hyperworld Underworld, which is a collection of my journalism. There's magical writing in there, but there's also a lot of journalism on, you know, oil pipelines and trade agreements and things like that. And Duncan was very kind to do a quote for the back about it. So and so that's out now, but go to magic.me, m-a-g-i-c-k.me, and also ultraculture.org, u-l-t-u-r-e, c-u-l-t-u-r-e.org is the main blog connected to that from which, which is kind of the parents of magic.me, because we're most of my focuses now. But magic.me, that's the one to go to. And the code for the 20% off the first month is Duncan. Cool, man. Well, thanks so much. And those links are going to be at dunketrustle.com.

It is I, Duncan Trussell, and you're listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast. And if you're like millions and millions of people currently existing on this beautiful planet, floating in space, then you've tried a psychedelic drug before. You've taken LSD, mushrooms, maybe you've smoked some DMT, maybe you've taken MDMA. A lot of people say that's not a psychedelic. I think it is, but you've taken some kind of substance and somewhere in the heightened state of awareness that you were experiencing, somewhere in the midst of having an explosion of an epiphanies or realizing there's certain areas of your life that you need to work on or realizing that you need to maybe call your mom and tell her you're sorry for being such a jackass for the last 15 years or maybe just in the midst of having a really great picnic with some friends or maybe even while experiencing some of the most incredible sex that you've ever had in your life or maybe somewhere in between bites of some food that you've eaten for your entire life, but you're tasting for the first time right then or maybe somewhere as you're gazing down at the shadows of the trees as they move upon whatever body of water you're sitting in front of and you realize that those shadows almost look like some kind of ancient primordial language and it occurs to you that language itself could be the shadow of God or maybe just as you are enjoying a nice day alone at home in a heightened state of awareness, the terrible thought entered into your consciousness that the experience that you are having has been criminalized by your government and it probably gave you pause. It sure has given me pause more than a few times as I'm sitting wherever I happen to be sitting or walking wherever I happen to be walking feeling a kind of buoyant state of connection to my entire species and a desire to be kind and to listen and to give more and to help more and the sense of wanting to really make the most of my life. It's occurred to me during those moments that have been brought on by imbibing prohibited substances that this experience is not just an important experience but a vital experience and my own personal growth and that the fact that some government has made this experience illegal seems to be an indication of a terrible mistake and if not a mistake then something so incredibly sinister that if you think about it too long while under the influence of a psychoactive drug you might actually feel a shadow creeping into your trip you might begin to get a little paranoid or start looking around wondering if there's a police officer nearby who is going to notice that you have a radiant grin on your face and see that as probable cause to look through your stuff and if he happens to find anything in your bag or your pockets that has been deemed illegal by the government then he will have the right to throw handcuffs on you put you in the back of a squad car and take you to the dungeons and if you think about it too long things can get really dark and sinister and I think a lot of trips have gone from being pretty awesome to being pretty terrible just by that consideration that the incredible experience that these substances provide to us has for illogical or political or nefarious reasons been criminalized as far as I'm concerned this is one of the most absurd aspects of the modern society that we currently exist in but thankfully things have begun to shift they're shifting because of the tireless effort of folks like rick doblin and the people over at maps the multi-disciplinary association for psychedelic studies these are the folks doing the heavy lifting and if you're a psychonaut if you're somebody who recognizes the insanity of our current drug policy

trustle family our podcast rick doblin rick doblin thank you so much for coming on the podcast it is a real honor to get to talk with you today thank you duncan i'm so glad to be speaking with you as well and all the people listening to your podcast you are a in the in the world of psychedelics you are a hero and you are and forgive me for i don't mean to dehumanizing dehumanize you by putting you on to a platform here but you you are something of a saint you have sacrificed your spinal fluid in the pursuit of getting mdma as a prescription therapy so thank you on behalf of every person who stands to benefit for that and all of us who've experienced mdma and have immediately realized that this could do a lot of good for the world well thank you and and not just one spinal tap but two but i figured that the way i actually did it is two parts one is i first off i was sort of daring george rickardy to show that he could find damage in myself and friends who were using mdma but i started realizing that there's a war on drugs and you know in war people are willing to make certain kind of sacrifices and i was fighting on the side of freedom and drugs but the the real way that i was able to do it was to imagine that i was sort of giving birth to my spinal fluid and that if women can go through the pain of childbirth i felt like it's a relatively small thing to um have a needle go into my spinal column and um so so that's actually how i did it i imagined myself sort of giving birth to the spinal fluid and and it um you know it hurt but it didn't hurt that much for those folks out there who aren't aware of maps uh can you can you talk about the mission of maps sure sure um maps is multi-disciplinary association for psychedelic studies it's a non-profit organization that i started in 1986 after we had won an initial lawsuit against the dea which they started trying in 84 to criminalize mdma they they weren't aware of the therapeutic use of mdma but they had become aware of the recreational use of ecstasy right and so when they moved against ecstasy we took them by surprise and i went to dc and filed a lawsuit trying to preserve the therapeutic use of mdma and we had a long court case before a dea administrative law judge and won the case it was fantastic and the law judge had recommended to the head of the dea that mdma be illegal for non-medical use but it'd be schedule three meaning it could still be used therapeutically and the head of the dea rejected that recommendation and then we sued in the appeals court and won and the dea came up with a new rationale for keeping it illegal and then we sued again and then we won and then on the third time dea finally wised up and figured out how to keep it illegal and so i started maps in 86 recognizing that you know this was uh the Reagan era the escalation of the drug war that the only way to bring it back was through the fda and that the pharmaceutical industry the government the big foundations none of them were going to support this kind of controversial research and so i felt like it needed to be non-profit oriented and come from funding from individuals and so that's basically what i've been doing since 86 although um it wasn't until 1999 that the first drug was ever approved by fda through a non-profit organization and that drug turned out to be the abortion pill r u 46 wow and it was funded by the Rockefellers the Pritzker's and the buffets warren buffett donated over five million dollars to it wow and so i've sort of thought at that time and that was when i was working on my phd at the kennedy school of government at harvard on the regulation of the medical use of psychedelics in marijuana and i i always thought that that was really my dream team if i could get the Rockefellers the Pritzker's and the buffets together again to fund mdma research and so far we've gotten support from richard Rockefeller and some of his family members and then also from nick and susan pritzker and uh i'm just hoping on the buffets that is incredible because something that you i i've learned from uh researching you a little bit is that the people who you might expect to be completely against this kind of research really seem to to support it or be interested in it i i would never think that the Rockefellers would have any interest in psychedelic research or that uh some of the people in the upper echelons of government would be so open to it is what what's happened what's this change well i i think that it's all too easy to um sort of stereo to play people and so when we think about the Rockefellers you know john d rockefeller the richest person in the world kind of a vulture capitalist in some ways yes but you know down the generations people's attitudes change and richard Rockefeller who tragically died in a plane crash um became about you know about nine months ago a little bit more he became um the ideal partner for me we became close friends and we're working together and richard was somebody who was very remarkable um you know he felt that even though he had been given so much um freedom and resources and reputation from his family that he needed something that was his own to you know have a sense of pride and he decided that he would become a doctor and he actually was a family physician for a long time and he became the senior the chairman of the board of advisors of doctors without borders wow and as part of that work he became aware of whole populations that were traumatized that were refugees particularly in kosovo and Serbia and he started wondering how do you help whole populations that are traumatized we don't have the resources to do psychotherapy with every individual right psychotherapy doesn't always help a lot of people and he started looking into mdma as a possible way to deal with multi-generational trauma and he had the connections the inspiration and excuse me he also um you know had the sense of idealism that the rockfellers a lot of the rockfellers are actually quite liberal and you know the rockfeller brothers fund just announced that they were divesting all of their investments from oil yeah i saw that yeah so i think what what really motivated richard was this sense that down the generations when you have trauma like in israel and palestine yes and all sorts of other locations that this kind of trauma is really passed down and just conflicts can go on for hundreds of years thousands of years they seem insoluble and there has to be some way to break this cycle of multi-generational trauma so once richard started looking into mdma as potential therapy um and we started he read you know we started talking and he knew people that had had profound beneficial experiences with mdma for grieving for ptsd for military service he wanted to know what was the most important way that he could be helpful to us and that we could work together and i said that we had had 25 years of struggle with the department of defense in the veterans administration trying to interest them in mdma for post-traumatic stress disorder in soldiers and veterans and we've been working with lots of doctors and therapists who are close to the people that were suffering that were committing suicide that were desperate but the political level always blocked it and i said i need help with the department of defense and the va and it turned out that richard's cousin was senator j rockefeller from west virginia who was on the senate veterans affairs committee wow so we started a long project that um took many many years and you know i started realizing that from richard's point of view the fact that it was so hard was actually a good thing because he had so much capacity and he wanted to really do hard things and so we ended up exchanging you know thousands of emails getting to be close friends um and for me you know i talked a little bit about um you know 1984 with da cracking down an mdma and 1986 when i started maps but really for me it started in 1972 when i was a vietnam war draft resistor and i was um doing a lot of lsd but having difficult time integrating it you know somewhat like your comedy routine i had some very difficult lsd experiences but i had this glimmer that there was something healing about it and i i went to the um a guidance counselor at new college of sarasota florida and um said what can i do and this guidance counselor actually gave me a copy of a book by dr stanislav groff realms of the human unconscious wow and stan was the leading lsd researcher and theoretician and i was just so lucky that this but when i read that it's it all came together for me this idea of um science looking at spirituality and values and you know unit of mystical experiences as well as psychotherapy encased in a healing process but subject to critical testing through does it actually help people to get better so i felt like at that time that i would devote myself to bringing back psychedelics back to the mainstream and bringing back psychedelic research and because of the um fact that i was a draft resistor and i anticipated going to jail i felt like i couldn't have a normal career and so for me now after all of these years when richard comes along and and i said okay let's try to make peace with the military in a way when it comes to psychedelics yes um he took on that challenge and so i've actually had this remarkable experience of walking into the pentagon with richard rockefeller and dr michael midhofer who was our lead psychiatrist for our work with mdma and you know michael had had a ponytail for about 30 years that he cut off for the meeting at the pentagon oh wow and it was incredible because i remember abby hoffman and the yippies you know they part of the protests against the vietnam war they surrounded the pentagon and they talked okay we're gonna levitate yeah yeah and you know of course it didn't work and so here we are all these years later walking into the door talking about uh you know bringing psychedelics to the military that is so incredible and it's so and j rockfeller was willing to do it so we've had meetings in the pentagon with the senior people at the department of defense staff from the assistant secretary defense for health affairs and and things have turned around and i think it's because of the dire need of all these vets coming back from iraq and afghanistan and also the ones from vietnam but somehow that you know the the culture was too resistant during that several decades after the vietnam war but it's only more now with the maturation of the culture the disillusionment with prohibition and mass incarceration the racist nature of the drug war and people are and also the rise of medical marijuana and people's more comfort with marijuana legalization that we're finding a greater willingness among all aspects of the culture to really look at psychedelics and i think there's also this other big aspect of how we're not so much using the same rhetoric of um we've done psychedelics we're enlightened and we're smarter than everybody else and one dose miracle cure and you know timothy leary was was great as an advocate for individual freedom and individual liberty against the system but he was also portraying psychedelics as somehow or other inherently counter cultural that if you took these drugs you were always going to be against systems and always an enemy of the state and if you look historically through thousands of years most cultures have had an honored place for peoples who um alter their consciousness and it's like even from our own culture the greeks when we look back at the history of western thought the largest the longest running mystery ceremony ever was the elucinian mysteries that ran for almost 2000 years and ended around 396 squashed by the church because they were more of a direct access to spirituality rather than mediated through a power system but albert hoffman and uh gordon wassen and others carol ruck experts looked at the elucinian mysteries and found that there was a drink that they consumed called kikion and it had ryan barley and when we look more even closely at it when you have sort of moisture and kind of a fungus that air got grows on ryan barley and it contains drugs that are very much like lsd right so it's from our own tradition and other traditions like the native american church use of peyote and the use of mushrooms that go back thousands of years and iowaska that goes back a long time that we're a cultural aberration and there was a reasons for that even to that that are our mind our intellect was squashed by the church by religion by fundamentalism and we see that with kipernicus and galileo and and there was kind of a truce for four or five hundred years of religion staying out of science and science staying out of religion but now that's even coming together so there's tremendous scientific research at johns hopkins at the university of zurich elsewhere where people are looking at lifelong meditators spiritual leaders at the and giving them psychedelics and looking how that impacts them so we we see i think that in our current time with globalization with religions bumping up against each other that what we really need i think to survive is this sense of what we have in common rather than what we have that's different right and under the influence of psychedelics people can have these unit of mystical experiences that connect us up with you know billions of years of history and thousands and thousands of years of human evolution and you know and and people can understand how intimately connected we are with nature not separate from it and how really we're much more similar to even the the most different cultural human then we are different rick are you and if we can feel that and and for me this was confirmed in 1984 when i got in touch with a fellow named robert muhler who was the assistant secretary general of the united nations and he'd written this book called new genesis shaping a global spirituality and his basic idea was that we have united nations to mediate disputes between cultures and if you look more carefully a lot of those disputes are religious disputes and we need to get the mystics together to build this sense of alliance and for people to have a global spirituality which doesn't mean one world religion it just means that we realize that there's you know a whole rainbow of colors and they're all part of the spectrum and they're all ways to try to point to something deeper and we find that you know the religions that are more mystically based are are more tolerant and you know stan groff um wanted to go to israel i just came back from around three weeks in israel with stan where he had talks in jerusalem tell a big even spot sort of the mystical center of israel yes and and his idea is to eventually to have a conference that would focus on the common mystical roots of the abrahamic traditions judaism islam and christianity as a way to talk about fundamentalism being replaced by mysticism and that mysticism is an antidote to fundamentalism our mysticism is almost the fermentation of fundamentalism it's the after some certain amount of time you get a roomy or you get these mystics who are taking the fundamental hardcore stuff and converting it into something that's more passionate and juicy and beautiful yes exactly exactly and so i i think that's really the larger vision so when we talk about maps as a nonprofit pharmaceutical company that's really what we are that's our strategic approach that's what i've been trained in through the degree at the kennedy school and also through my training with stan groff but really it's about integrating psychedelics and even more beyond that not just psychedelics but non-ordinary states of consciousness into our culture where i think people can have a deeper sense of meaning a deeper sense of purpose more tolerance uh antidote to prejudice of all sorts and so i think given all the crises that we face as a nation as a culture as a world as a planetary species i think really that psychedelics can play on a major role in grounding people into something deeper and helping us really deal with the ways that we're all bumping up against people who are different than ourselves and see that as a source of pleasure and joy and curiosity rather than as a source of fear and isolationism right yeah that is uh it it's almost like some kind of drought that many cultures are going through which is a complete lack of access to psychoactive substances that have that seem to have spawned possibly spawned these religions spawned the myths or at least been co-pilots and spawning these ideas uh and it feels like a lot of the problems that you're talking about many of us think that those problems are directly related to removing from the bloodstream of a species chemicals that seem to have been part of the uh growth of that species of the subjective growth or the uh birth of of maybe even the birth of language not to get to Terrence McKenna level hippy on you but well I think he was on to something and and I think you're you're right and I think though you know to sort of talk in a balanced way though you know the irrational is really scary the beyond rationality so when you look at people leaders like Hitler or leaders like Paul Pott or you know others that are able to commit massive genocide um you know they they play on people's unconscious needs and fears and and so there is some wisdom in a sense of trying to you know focus on rationality but it really it was just a veneer it's not enough we have to refine the unconscious we have to refine the irrational rather than try to turn our backs on it become so if we look at what we've done with our modern culture I mean we have miraculous technology that has been accomplished I mean just the same way that I'm talking to you that you can do this podcast that people can listen from all over the world it's just miraculous and it's the product of a rational mind but it's not enough we cannot build a world that turns its back on the irrational and turns its back on the spiritual and just tries to persuade people on the basis of logical arguments we need to delve deep into the irrational and help refine it and so that's where one hopes that as time goes by as generations go down the the road here that we'll be able to use these psychedelic tools to bring their irrational up in safe enough supportive contexts so that enough people can become more balanced more grounded and they can be helpful as the species tries to move forward and not destroy ourselves I'm really interested in the safe and supportive setting that you're talking about which seems to be your description of what psychedelic therapy would look like can you talk a little bit about what a typical session a therapeutic session with MDMA would look like yeah yeah I'd be glad to I think that's a really good thing to focus on as well because again what we're talking about is MDMA assisted psychotherapy it's not the like the traditional pharmaceutical companies say here take this pill it's going to make you better what we're saying is these drugs the psychedelics are used in contexts and those contexts are crucial either therapeutic context or religious context for ayahuasca or peyote or so fun yeah it's just really the context makes more of a difference than the drug itself right and so a traditional MDMA session the first thing is that we are talking about a several month period of psychotherapy with weekly non-drug psychotherapy for several weeks of our hour and a half sessions for the therapist and the patient to build a therapeutic alliance get comfortable with each other yes and then once a month basically every three to five weeks for three times there's a day-long MDMA session or a day-long LSD or psilocybin session and then the subjects are asked to spend the night in the treatment center that's very important for our approach and then there's integrative psychotherapy the next day then once they go home we contact them on the phone every day for a week for 10 minutes 15 minutes a day just to see how they're doing then we repeat the weekly non-drug psychotherapy for three to five weeks and then repeat that several times so wow the question is though what happens during the actual MDMA session yes now the first part of what we're doing is that we talk about a two-person therapy team and it's a male female team now some people have said you know maybe you can have um you know a straight guy and a gay guy or you know a straight woman and a gay woman or you know and of course that could work and of course a lot of therapy is fine with just one person but in our current approach we're trying to maximize outcomes we're not trying to minimize costs okay that's why of course we're constantly asking people for donations yes but um but we feel that a male female therapy team particularly a two-person team and ideally male female works really really well because in psychedelic states with MDMA or LSD or psilocybin people often regress or bring up things that are from their childhood right or even from their birth process or even from you know symbols like um you know past life experiences epigenetics who knows spiritual experiences so we we use a male female team because it's it's kind of it's you know we're trying to sort of show a successful male female partnership and also it's exhausting for an eight-hour session somebody has to go to the bathroom somebody gets something to eat we always want somebody in the room and also we want two eyes two two intuitions kind of listening to what the person is going through what does the room look like can you describe the room like what is the setting because right now my brain is producing a clinical laboratory room like you know like sterile and flat is what what does the room actually look like well um you know there's art there's flowers there's a bed so the main thing is there's a bed yeah um couch where people can recline they have eye shades and headphones we have music the whole time or not the whole time sometimes people turn off the music and are just talking cool there's an adjacent bathroom so people can privately you know go to the bathroom cool and it's not a long walk there can be um windows skylights but again some of this takes place in hospital settings where we have to do a lot of work to kind of make it a comfortable room right but we've been able to negotiate with FDA DEA institutional review boards where we've been able to get permission to do research outside of clinical hospital settings in office settings that are more like homes right and that these are very comfortable situations and the setting matters a lot so there'll be fresh flowers they'll also be um fruit juices we tend to prefer um fruit juices things with electrolytes rather than just water people have heard about how mdma you could overheat you have to drink water yes but some people have died from drinking too much water right so you know things with electrolytes um and then there's um chairs where the two therapists are either on the same side of the bed or the different side um we also suggest that for mdma about half the time is spent in dialogue with the therapist but another half the time is spent with the people's eyes closed going inward and listening to to their own uh their own cells not not having to report back you know the the next day is kind of for review of what happened and integrating it but people are considered to be their own healers so in the sense we don't say that the therapists are the guides we never use the word guides really right the guide is the person's own inner unconscious cool and and the same way the metaphor i think works pretty well is that if you have a scratch on your hand um your body knows how to heal itself we don't know how to do it but somehow or other there's this unconscious there's this cellular knowledge built into our body to heal itself and what we need to do is clean out the wound we need to protect it from dirt but the body heals itself right and there's something similar going on with the psyche and this is now something that we believe something that we feel has been experimentally validated from even the early work with the lsd and psychedelics in the 50s and 60s and our current work over the last decades and currently so the idea is that there's a self-healing mechanism of the unconscious and that what comes to the surface during this session is something that is really guided by the person's unconscious and there's no one pathway or one sequence so some people under the influence of mdma will start talking about their trauma and what happened and and how it's bothering them some people will will go back to you know pleasant experiences in their lives and sort of reconnect with love and support and then they go into the painful trauma right there's no one way to do it and so we follow the lead of the the patient or the subject and we support them and we have the feeling that if there's anything that starts to come up that they can best look at it and try to integrate it rather than suppress it and we offer support for them to do it but we also recognize that sometimes things come up and it takes a while maybe they're too painful people put them away and then two hours later it comes back again when they're more prepared for it so we don't press we have an agreement that if something if during this eight hours of session if people don't talk about the trauma we'll bring it up but we've never had to do that people will always at some point start talking about their trauma because they know that's what they're there for that's what has been bothering them and this trauma is generally this is you're talking about uh ptsd these are veterans who've had experiences it will like awful experiences and that's the trauma is that yes yes although we just got permission to start a new study with mdma for people who have life-threatening illnesses and who are scared of dying right and we also have a study that is with autistic adults with social anxiety yeah these it's so incredible to listen to um how in depth and and how uh hard for lack of a better word how stringent this experience is when compared to the way so many of us recreationally take mdma which is you'll you or any psychedelic for that matter you you'll take the psychedelic uh if you if you if you plan it outright maybe you'll go on a camping trip or you'll go somewhere away from society with your friends and a lot of it's just laughing and talking you might go dancing uh but this idea of turning inward putting blindfolds on laying down and like doing the work on yourself it really is different i think than the way a lot of people perceive how to take a psychedelic yeah i think so and and even in terms of the music so what we try to do is avoid music with lyrics so we we don't want to sort of guide people into certain kinds of thinking or certain certain kinds of imagery we want it as much as possible to emerge from themselves so we'll have different kinds of music throughout the eight hours or so but it tends to be without lyrics sometimes there's voices but without words so we try to encourage sort of pure emotional release and it's even more different with lsd or psilocybin where probably it's 80% inner focused and 20% dialogue and we we also then try to say to people that they really need to think about it as a two-day experience not even a one-day experience and that the second day is for rest for reflection that's why we want people to spend the night in the treatment center also quietly reflecting on it we do let people significant others spend the night with them sometimes unless you know their sources of the the conflict or the problem right but i think when people can think about it as two days the second day is really for rest and reflection and integration so we don't give people supplements with mdma we don't give them five hdp or various things we just say the key is to rest and integrate and then that process continues in their dreams in other ways for weeks at a time and that's how we set the time for the second session is have they done a pretty complete job of integrating what happened in the first session and that's how we set the third session have they done a pretty good job of integrating the second session and so what we're saying to people is that um this is not about distracting yourself right really with pretty pictures and and that also has to do with the dose so we use pretty strong doses of mdma or lsd when we work with people and we try to say look you don't have to have any responsibilities about your physical bodily survival you don't have to navigate from here to there you don't have to walk you don't have to drive you don't have to get the door you don't have to get the phone all of this is for you to focus inward and you know i i don't know how many people who are listening who've ever done um gone into a flotation tank i've i've done it and it's incredible and i think a lot of people listening probably have or i think some of them are for sure yeah so it's kind of like that we want to take away as much of the outside distractions but we do give supportive music sometimes we'll hold people's hand a bit and we'll touch their shoulder you know we're there with them and for the therapists it's kind of like a meditation session where you're there you're watching a lot of it is watching nonverbal cues in their breathing and their body language and their musculature or how are they handling it are they and the key aspect is are they opening it up and letting it flow through them or are they resisting and you know as we know like with a light bulb you know what what causes the light is the resistance the electricity hits some resistance and then it heats up and so we found that with psychedelics the less resistance there is the more flow there is the more the less drama there is in a way and the more healing and so we try to encourage people to open up let it go we videotape and audio tape all the sessions and we give those tapes to people afterwards if they want to look at them and it's another way to say to people you don't have to grab onto something if you have an insight you know you can look at the videotape and bring it back we'll talk to you about it the next day if you say certain things we're writing down notes but that you don't have to grab and hold on to it just flow with it and the longer in my own experiences I've had too I find that when I'm resisting they last longer and when I'm opening to the energy just flowing to me they tend to last shorter and I'm more grounded what techniques do you I'm sorry what techniques do you give people to let go how do you this see this is this problem you're describing is feels like it's a universal problem yeah how are there any techniques you give people who come into contact with some dark realization or go into the dark place how do you how do you get them to let go in the room well that's a fantastic question and that is the key of the therapeutic process and one way to help them is to say that um you know looking away that that these are things that are influencing you and they have more power over you the more unconscious they are so that as things are coming to the surface and to consciousness even though it's painful and difficult it's it's like they they're there they're not if you don't look it's not like they go away right and so by opening up to them you can make some price so so the first part again is the trust that you create between the therapist and the subject also the therapists have done their own psychedelic work right so it's kind of a quiet sense of communication that you know if the therapists have never done psychedelics and patient reaches a frightening spot how you kind of have to know from your own experience then when you let things in that you've been suppressing that even though it could disrupt your life and cause you to make major changes that you're you're better off letting it in and trying to integrate it than not so we offer support that the idea of the second day with nothing to do is also really important because a lot of times when people are tripping recreationally yeah they don't budget that much amount of time and so when you're starting to take your psyche apart when your ego is dissolving if somewhere in the back of your mind you're thinking oh shit you know tomorrow I got a drive to work yes you're going to hold yourself back so we give them the time to really take themselves to let themselves come apart we offer support for the integration process and again here's where it's really difficult different than recreational use because in recreational use people are looking for an experience while they're under the drug that's valuable to them yes and that that's appropriate and that's okay but what we're doing in therapy is looking at not just primarily what you have but what you bring back to your daily non-drug life right and how you can make that different over time so when people are resisting one of the things that we'll we'll do is just ourselves we're not going to run away from it and we we encourage people to take a look to um to open up and and say that at the same time we try to say we're not making any decisions during this experience oh wow right of course it's really important then yes you know this is exploratory you know it's very important for you to explore but don't feel like any decisions are going to be made here and in fact um once you've integrated in the next days and weeks even be careful about making major changes so that gives people it's like a brainstorming session right we're we're to get people comfortable brainstorming you say don't criticize the ideas just come up with all these ideas and you know leave your critical mind use your imaginative mind and we'll look at it so i think that's another big part is people are freed from making decisions and if people say you know i've just decided i need to get divorced or i need to quit my job yes you know the thing is like hey we're saying not so fast right you know just you know don't box yourself in you're just exploring right now but so phones are gone for these two days are they gone are there no is there no access to the internet or texting or anything well during the first day yes yes we take people's phones there's no no um um you know we try to keep them there overnight the next day you know they can talk to people they can be grounded but we try to have a um inner focused lifetime which is you know increasingly rare in our technological culture right you know my daughter just the other day forgot her phone at home for a brief period of time and she was like panicked it's a nightmare oh god that feeling of not having access to all information on the planet at every second is terrible but um i want to talk to you a little bit about technology and if maps or if anybody out there doing this kind of research is considered the merging of this kind of therapy with virtual reality well it's very interesting you mentioned that so um in 2009 there was a conference in israel on uh treating ptsd and one of the speakers there was someone who had been funded by the military to develop virtual reality devices for combat soldiers who had ptsd from you know being in combat and there there was a woman who has developed one of the leading therapies for post-traumatic stress disorder called prolonged exposure and she was um i think making a little bit of a confusion between mdma and lsd and the classic psychedelics mdma is more gentle it doesn't affect your perceptions in the same way you can negotiate with it whereas with lsd or psilocybin you really have to just surrender to it and so she was not that sympathetic to the idea of mdma assisted psychotherapy for ptsd and and even a little bit frightened about it and so she said you know i don't really think you even need mdma why don't you go consider virtual reality and go talk to these people that are doing the virtual reality research oh man so i said all right that's interesting so i went to talk to the fella from who's doing the virtual reality stuff and he laughed and laughed and he said you know if you have mdma you don't need virtual reality because what what's actually going on is that virtual reality is trying to bring back similar feelings and experiences to the trauma but in a place where you feel safe right but it's never exactly your experience your experience is stored in your own memory in your own unconscious and so if you can feel safe in a therapeutic setting your own unconscious will bring out the experiences that were exactly the tailored to what happened to you right okay right yeah there can be a role now you know one of the other things that stan groff has done which is so admirable is that in the early 70s when psychedelic research was squashed all over the world most people who were involved went into looking at the integration process looking at non-drug approaches and most of them turn back turn their backs on psychedelics and and there was a classic example of ramdas you know being attributed to saying hey when you've got the message hang up the phone yeah yeah i thought that was alan watz but i guess those quotes i guess those quotes get dispersed among all the luminaries who knows but yes that's a good point so so yeah that that's if you know probably we can check that out on the internet in minutes and figure out who really said it first but you know but the idea is for me that um first off that the messages keep coming through the rest of your life and different messages at different stages of your life but what stan did is he developed a way through hyperventilation which he called holotropic breath work moving towards wholeness that can also bring up things similar to psychedelics so your question about how do we help people let go so there's ways where we work with holotropic breath work where people can stop the breathing stop the process more easily than once they've taken drugs how do you and that helps people feel a little bit more comfortable with so you you sort of practice a little bit with holotropic breath work then with the psychedelics the idea is that um it just helps to it doesn't really go away you know virtual reality can be helpful in certain ways because you can always shut off the program and you know but but what we're looking at is more and more this understanding of theories of memory and in particular what's now called memory reconciliation and so and and this will also explain to people too so it used to be thought that when you have a memory it's like you have a book on the shelf and you go read the book and then you put the book back on the shelf right well what we understand now is that the way memory works is when you pull the book off the shelf you actually have to reprint the book you have to recreate the book and you reconcile validate the memory you recreate the memory and you put it back on the shelf that's nuts yeah and that explains how memories change over time but that's the key to therapy in the sense because when you have a traumatic memory you are raped you are almost killed in a war you were in a car crash you know natural disaster something happens you're focusing on survival and the memory is encoded with the fear right MDMA reduces activity in the amygdala the fear processing part of the brain and you feel safe in this supportive setting and you trust the therapist we've made sure you've had a lot of meetings in the room and also with the therapist before you do the MDMA so you've developed this therapeutic alliance and so then when you bring back this memory when you're feeling safe when you reconsolidate the memory it doesn't have the tags of fear that it did before that is amazing what you're saying is that MDMA assisted psychotherapy is doing for memories what those volunteers do for birds after an oil spill it's sort of scrubbing the fear off of the memories and then putting it back and now it doesn't have the same high-powered emotional tone connected to it yes and more importantly even is that under the influence of MDMA we've seen veterans we've seen firefighters that were caught in fires that their memory is actually enhanced that there's parts of the trauma that was so difficult for them that they have basically blotted it out of their memory and under the influence of MDMA the full memories come back and so the important thing is that people learn from their trauma we don't want to obliterate the memory we don't want to make it so you don't recall because there's important lessons in trauma yes and in fact one of the measures that we use in our study now it's not the measure that will the FDA will say yes you can make this into a medicine but it's called the post traumatic growth inventory and what what is the case is that people who sometimes people who've almost died in a car crash or you know trauma causes you to reevaluate the meaning of your life the purpose of your life your relationships your job and that sometimes when you have a trauma and you can survive it you can actually grow from it and we hear people who have cancer say you know in some ways that was one of the best things that happened to me because now I survived but I really understand the the precious nature of life and I'm not wasting my life on a job that I don't care about yep so we use this post traumatic growth inventory as a way to evaluate the positive aspects of how people can grow from trauma because life has inherently has trauma life inherently has death death is you know woven into life inextricably and we will lose people we love and we will have accidents people will die and all sorts of sad tragic things will happen and there is no life without trauma and we need to grow from the trauma not run from it and that's one of the ways where um mdma can be very helpful to people to grow from trauma and so people have talked about the cannabinoids and how the cannabinoids can be helpful in ptsd in part because if you administer cannabinoids right at the trauma sometimes people won't remember the trauma and that makes me really nervous because we want people to realize that there are lessons in trauma if you're in a war we want people to realize how horrible war is if you you know trusted somebody and you were date raped we want you to realize that you have to be more discerning we don't want people to forget right the traumas if people are in a car crash and they were texting or something while they were doing it we don't want people to forget that this isn't some brave new world we're just going to numb you down or take take away this stuff it's more like facing your demons uh and it you know it's a what you're talking about it obviously applies not just to people who've had these severe traumas but every single person living today has had some kind of heartbreak or loss or pain it will it get to the point where mdma is prescribed not just for these extreme cases but what about just the basic crap all of us have to go through in this dimension well i think that's true and i think you point to something really important which is that what we're talking about while we're talking about research into the medical use of mdma there's a lot of people who are not clinically diagnosed with a psychiatric illness but who can make enormous benefits both in personal growth and spirituality and so what you're pointing to is that we need to have a post prohibition world and somehow or other we need to be able to build a post prohibition world where the fundamental human right of individuals to explore their consciousness is preeminent and it's beyond just saying i have a medical need yes that it also has to be beyond religious freedom in the sense because religious freedom requires religion and that's both a good thing and a bad thing in the sense that religion is a group process but spirituality can be individual absolutely yes so i think we need to recognize that mdma that we need to build a culture where people have access to tools for personal growth throughout the lifespan whether or not they have a medical diagnosable condition but right now as our culture is evolving from the nightmare of excuse me the nightmare of prohibition to a more open integrated sense of drugs and altered state non-ordinary states of consciousness that the opening wedge you could say the strategic path of least resistance in our culture we're used to drugs to treat everything drugs for this drugs for that drugs for you know illnesses that weren't even illnesses are you shy here's a medicine for you being shy here's you know so i think our culture if we look at actually what's happened with medical marijuana one of the favorite slides that i used in some of my power points presentations is a slide of public opinion over the last 40 plus years about the legalization of marijuana going back to the early 1970s and only about two years ago did it cross the 50 mark where more 50 percent of the voters are now in favor of marijuana legalization there was a slight increase from the early 70s up until the late 70s but it still wasn't great what happened in the late 70s was the backlash again the rise of the parents movement the nancy reagan just say no the escalation of the drug war and support stayed pretty flat from around 78 79 up until around 1996 and what happened in 96 was the medical marijuana initiatives passing in california and in arizona and that started spreading to other states and so the rise of the medical marijuana movement paralleled the rise of the change of people's attitudes towards marijuana legalization right and i think what we see there is that people have been given so much misinformation so much propaganda about the dangers of marijuana the dangers of psychedelics and not to say that they don't have their risks but that people don't know what to believe but when people can see somebody saying i use this for medicine and it helped me and it's somebody that they know so some of the exit polls have shown that the most important predictor of whether somebody is in favor of the legalization of marijuana it's not even do they use marijuana themselves it's they know but it's do they know a medical marijuana patient right you know that is a direct source of information that people can trust and so i think right now the medical use of marijuana has really primed our culture for what looks like a transition well underway towards the legalization of marijuana and i think the medicalization of psychedelics and the work that's being done with the legal freedoms for iowaska for native american churches peyote these are going to be priming our culture over the next 20 30 years for the eventual legalization of psychedelics which when do you see that happening your question you know people um you know we're all traumatized we're all scared of dying we're all life is tough and everybody can benefit but not here's the the other fundamental thing is that psychedelics are not essential and i think it's really important to say that that you people can access these states of mind without psychedelics it's much more difficult people have to meditate or do any number of things fasting or people transcend through pain like the the sundance that some of the native americans do there there's all different techniques that people have for many of us and certainly for me psychedelics have been the most reliable most useful path but they're not essential because psychedelics really stand i think set it really well he said lsd is a non-specific amplifier of the unconscious and what that means is that when you take lsd you don't have an lsd experience you have an experience of your own unconscious right yes that's good that's real good so i i think we don't want to say psychedelics are essential people can get to these states in other ways and they're all it's about where they get to not the vehicle and in fact in the work that's being done with understanding spirituality and the the role of psychedelics and mystical experiences starting in 1962 with the good friday experiment that was one of best things that timothy leary ever did and i did a 25-year follow-up it was an attempt to look at 20 divinity students who went into church on good friday and half got a psilocybin mushroom pill and the other half got a placebo and this was a harvard phd that walter pankey was a minister and a doctor and working on his phd and he spent over a year developing a questionnaire for how you would describe a universal mystical experience and he based it on the work of a religious scholar named wt stase and stase had this theory of causal indifference and what that meant is that you can describe the state and it's independent of the cause so somebody could have it worshiping in a catholic church somebody could have it worshiping in a church synagogue somebody could have it hyping hiking in nature somebody else could have it having you know beautiful sex and feeling you know transcending into a unit of mystical experience somebody could fast for god days or you know but it's the theory of causal indifference which also means that psychedelics are not essential they're just all parts different ways to open us up to core human experiences right now core human experiences is one word for it and a lot of us have a lot of other words for it that scientists aren't going to use scientists like you or doctors or people from that side of the universe are going to say that whereas people like me say it's god i'm i'm touching god when i take a psychedelic and i do it in the right way and the lessons that come to me from that state uh not only help my life but my whatever my community happens to be my relationships get better everything gets better from whatever outflow is coming from that core human value place that you're talking about and i think that it's really interesting to me that if you look at Kurzweil's predictions 2045 the birth of some new artificial intelligence that is sentient and alive and i hear you talking about the timeline for psychedelics becoming legal and i or prescribed and i consider the epiphanies that psychedelics tend to produce in people who use them in the right ways it almost seems like the amplification of technology and the end of the prohibition on psychedelics is somehow intertwined and that the end result that they both share a similar end result do you know what i'm saying there yeah i do and i think there's a lot to that um i think also i want to point out one thing that you said that that connects up with the science in a sense and also that the tradition over thousands of years of spirituality which is that the the ultimate test of a religious experience is called the fruits test so it's not so much how you describe the experience although that's important but it's what are the consequences of that experience and so that's where in in scholars of religion and you know it's like what is the fruit of the tree right and if this experience is really um positive and uplifting and produces more love then that's really what we're looking for and looking at and i again that focuses on the integration now i do think that many of the people that were involved with the early work with lsd sorry also made a link between uh particularly albert hoffman you know in 1938 he developed lsd they tested it they didn't see much of interest at sandos pharmaceuticals and in 1943 he re synthesized that he had a peculiar pre-sentiment that there was something there to it right and some mysterious way he accidentally dosed himself but he made a link between the technological advance of the human species specifically in terms of the splitting of the atom right and the creation of the destructive power of nuclear weaponry and the opening up of the splitting of the ego through psychedelics so that the development of lsd and the development of the destructive power of the atom or or even creative power of the atom you could say it's nuclear power if we can ever tame that that there's a parallel so that we have this incredible development of technology without the spiritual and emotional maturity to deal with it properly right and that's where the site and so albert einstein said that our technology has exceeded our humanity and he also said that the splitting of the atom has changed everything except our mode of thinking and hence we drift towards unparalleled catastrophe what shall be required if mankind is to survive as a whole new mode of thinking so i think this technological advance that curse well and others are talking about needs to be balanced by a emotional and spiritual development that i believe psychedelics can play a major role in creating and that's where i think it's so important for the human species that we integrate psychedelics and stop suppressing it that's right because it's not just that i think that it's not going to just be the a balance that comes from people having more people having access to these psychedelics that though that's a huge and vital aspect of this but it's also going to be the sort of innovations that are going to come from that place because it's it is a place that doesn't just produce healing it produces novelty it produces incredible ideas that you know a lot of people theorize some of you know whether or not it's true it's you know it's been disproved we do know that crick was hanging out with um huxley you know you know you know about that the dna he looks uh oh for sure and in fact um frances crick never um said it when he was alive some but um a friend of his after he died said that there was um experiments that were being done with low dose lsd right that crick was participating in and it was on a low dose lsd day that he had the vision of the double helix and that's that could be a myth that could that could be a rumor i've i've seen both sides of it it might not be real but we do know that crick was engaged in some way with uh psychedelics and we also know that steve jobs was engaged in this way and we also know that um some of the greatest musicians have been engaged in this way some of the greatest philosophers so it's not just an outflow of healing coming from this place that opens up but it's an outflow of innovation and and it makes me think that your work will somehow lead to an acceleration in uh technological advancements and not just a balance of the intention but for the for using the technology yeah and we also know carry mollus is one of the best examples he won the nobel prize for chemistry for developing the polymerase chain reaction which is used all the time now for DNA analysis and he attributes his creativity to marijuana and lsd there you go see that's that's crazy to think about that perhaps this prohibition it's not just keeping people from healing it's it's slowed down our progress as a species it has and one of the most things i think that people don't realize is that you know over the course of the last multiple decades with the drug war there's been an enormous pressure from the government on companies to do drug testing particularly companies that are getting government grants but if you look at the engines of innovation um apple computer microsoft sap oracle on and on at these companies do not do drug testing as a requirement of employment wow so the that the silicon valley innovation that's where we see that people don't do drug testing that there is this relationship and in fact there's a scientist uh named jim fateman who did work in the 60s with lsd and mescaline with people who had problems intellectual problems technical problems that they couldn't solve and that he worked with them with lsd and mescaline to help them come up with um new solutions so i i think that these drugs in fact are tools of innovation that's where we get people like leary and others saying this is always going to be a challenge to the status quo and these drugs will always be counter cultural they will always be suppressed it's just in their nature but i don't think that's true i think we can value innovation and we can build a healthy culture that sees those people that are innovators as scouts to the future not as enemies of the present wow as scouts to the future and just the same way that we tell people don't make decisions while you're under the influence of psychedelics we could say look these scouts are going out there they're having these ideas but what really matters is what do they bring back and then what do we test and does it really work and many times it does yeah and i think that's really where we look at our culture at the american competitive advantage is creativity innovation you know creating the new and psychedelics and marijuana are a key part of that i mean look at california is the way that's where you are duncan look at california is the um leading edge in a lot of different ways and that was the state in 1996 that started medical marijuana that's where the grateful dad that's where listen and you know to sum it up for for in addition to leery and the others here in boston one of my friends one of my friends brody stevens has one of my favorite jokes in comedy and forgive me brody for throwing this out there but it's so funny he says uh 90% of all comedians smoke marijuana the other 10% aren't funny it's such a great gag that's really funny yeah but um and it's not of course it's not complete it's just it's just joking there's sober comics that are hilarious like mark maron but uh the point is that these substances are not just the the stereotype of the recreational drug user getting blasted and forgetting about the world or whatever that is not what's going on here in every single field that comes into contact with these substances there are innovations that happen that i think wouldn't have happened uh minus that the substance entering into the bloodstream and uh and and that is to me one of the uh one of the great tragedies of the prohibition is that we don't know what we've missed so far we don't know what what potential luminary could have had that spark of intuition in the midst of some mushroom experience or lsd experience and what they could have brought back because so many of these scouts of the future that you're talking about they get thrown into dungeons they're thrown into dungeons for uh for what i would consider to be some of the most important work that uh humans can do which is venturing into the subconscious and bringing back whatever we can into this world it doesn't just heal us psychologically these psychedelics heal society as a whole and that says that healing comes through innovation if you ask me sorry for the rant yeah no for sure and in fact kerry mollus after he won the nobel prize and i had read some of his statements about attributing his creativity to lsd and uh marijuana you know not not only i mean he had a brilliant mind but but he he sent me a quote that was absolutely fantastic he said i think i might have been stupid in some respects if it weren't for my psychedelic experiences wow that's it so this is from a nobel prize winner and so i i think that what we need though also just to to be a little bit more balanced here again is that these are tools people can be diluted people can be um harmed and one of the big problems of our drug war is that we've tried to invest qualities in the drugs themselves we've got good drugs that are okay pharmaceutical companies sell them we've got bad drugs that are illegal right but we've sort of projected outward and given these power to these drugs and what we've lost is that it's really about the relationship that we develop with these drugs and that it's the relationship that determines whether it's beneficial whether it's harmful you know the surgeon's knife is the same as the thief's knife or the murderer's knife it's the same knife the lsd can cause somebody to become very disoriented and suicidal or else it can help somebody suicidal in a safe supportive way and and that leads me to one last question rick uh because we only have i think about 15 more minutes or 10 more minutes and it's a very important question so forgive me if i'm slightly cutting you off a little bit but not everybody has access to maps not everybody's going to be able to get into one of your trials probably most people aren't but personally and i'm sure the people listening hear you talk about this technique for taking a psychedelic and i would love for you to give if you can some advice for people who want to do this therapeutic work on themselves but don't have access to these types of therapists great question thank you duncan so the first thing to say is that because we're doing non-profit drug development we are open about everything that we're doing and sharing it so on the maps website and it's just maps maps dot org if you go to the mdma page we have what's called the treatment manual and that's a written description of how the therapy should be conducted now it's tailored for our actual protocols but there's a lot of information there about the attitude the approach of the therapists how they should handle things how they should be supportive and so i think if people can look at the treatment manual and we have what's called adherence criteria because i i said before that we have every all of our sessions are videotaped and audio taped and we have raiders to try to help optimize outcomes look at the videotapes and then score the therapists on you know are they being supportive are they being non-directive are they encouraging people to look inside rather than to look away so that people can learn a lot about the therapeutic approach by looking at the treatment manual on our our website the the other thing is there's a couple um projects that we're doing trying to create a context for a post-progression world so it used to be in the 60s 70s that the crackdown the backlash was about the link between psychedelics and people challenging the status quo right you know i talked about you know the yippies trying to levitate the pentagon or the b-rolls talking about make love not war and you know all you need is love and stop against the vietnam war but now that has faded and i think what's really going on is more about parents being scared about their kids and one of the biggest places is where kids young kids uh you know teens 20s go to these festivals like burning man like boom festival there's all these festivals and then a lot of heavy psychedelic use and it's part because the rituals that we have the rites of passage have been drained of their power and people are creating them themselves but we've created what we call the zendo project and that's where we bring trains like pietrus therapists volunteers social workers to help people who are having a difficult experience and try to make that a distinction between difficult is not the same as bad and if you can support people when they have difficult experiences sometimes in a very short amount of time you can integrate something and it can transform so if you go to the the maps website and look at the zendo project the psychedelic harm reduction we have a lot of information on how to help people if they're having a difficult psychedelic experience and it's basically the same as how you would conduct psychedelic psychotherapy so there's a lot of information on the website and in particular there's another book called the secret chief revealed now sasha shulgan was a brilliant brilliant chemist who devoted himself to trying to develop all sorts of different psychedelics he made a big success with dal chemical that gave him his own lab and in the 60s he decided to go off on his own and he and his close associates would have developed hundreds of new psychedelics including he's helped responsible for bringing back mdma to to the world right even though it was invented in 1912 by murk it was just forgotten but then he would find and this group of core group of his wife and around 10 12 other people would take drugs that they found to be particularly useful and then they would give them to therapists who would be working with them and the lead therapist was a fellow named leo zeff and he was called the secret chief and he's the one that really trained in the the late 70s and on hundreds of psychiatrists and therapists to work with mdma wow and myron stolaroff who also did work with psychedelics and creativity with jim fateman they myron interviewed leo and and we published a book the first book that maps ever published called the secret chief and then years later when it came to republish it we were able to identify who leo was and it's called now the secret chief revealed cool but we have it for free up on the the secret chief uh the book is for free on the maps website and that's pretty succinct description of the different range of psychedelics from lst to ibogaine to harmaline to ayahuasca to mdma and others and how they were used in therapy and what leo's approach was so i think that is kind of a primer for understanding psychedelic psychotherapy and and i guess i would just say to people who are um listening and thinking about it that it's very important when you approach a psychedelic experience to be open to the full range of things that might come up now it's okay i i believe there's a lot to be said for uh recreational celebratory use of psychedelics group dances group you know grateful dead concerts festivals but i think the key thing is that if you are just trying to have a certain slice of experience i only want to feel love and connection and happiness when something painful or sorrowful or past drama comes up if you're in the mood to suppress it you're going to end up worse off wow the attitude needs to be i'm going to take this i don't know what's going to happen i'm going to be open to whatever i'm going to try to steer this in certain ways but that if something difficult comes up i think you really need to be open to it that's really the core attitude and also i really think this idea of the second day to rest to give yourself time because psychedelics really are ego dissolvers in many ways and they are growth and agents of growth and if you are open to the new sometimes it takes a while to adjust and if you give yourself that time you can have a soft landing and if you don't um you know you're you're going to cause a lot of stress now just to say this at burning man we're going to have two sites in our villages um one is um a tea house going to be around the nine o'clock side the other is going to be around a two o'clock side with the zendo and so we're trying to demonstrate that if we could move into a situation where harm reduction was accepted as a principle as a policy and that we were in a post prohibition world that then i believe that we can really have a lot of positive growth of all sorts of kinds very minimize the risks although there always will be risks and and i think if people are actually want to get even deeper into it there's um some of the books of stan groff really if you can understand the um sort of the sweep of the unconscious meaning that one of the things that emerged from the years and years that stan groff and others spent with people under the influence of lsd um i mean stan talked about lsd as to the study of the unconscious what the microscope is to biology and the telescope is to astronomy wow and so freud basically looked at what happens during your life and he said that children are a tabla rasa you're born a clean slate and then your environment happens and you know but and then most of what's going on with traditional freudian psychoanalysis is talking about early childhood but there's the core process of actually being born that imprints us in multiple different ways and for stan that that's um he's got all sorts of theories about the the stages of the birth process amazing and but many people can sort of remember or re-experience the core sort of imprinting from the birth process and then that's the doorway to the transpersonal there are all sorts of experiences of spirituality of going beyond the ego states of confrontation with death you know there there's all sorts of kind transpersonal experiences so that if you have a model of the unconscious when you approach these things the sweep of the unconscious that it's not just about your life you can be overwhelmed by sadness let's say and it's just for the pain of the people that are starving to death right now or people being tortured or people in wars it's it's like it's part of the human collective unconscious and that's what yung talked about yes so that i think if you can have a broad sense of what is possible at the same time you can keep a a sort of skeptical perspective so for example when a lot of people talk about past life experiences yes we have found that in therapeutic settings people can have a past life experience that actually helps them resolve issues in their current life wow well you know with this stuff coming out with epigenetics you know i don't know if it's these past life experiences could just be contact with some kind of memory genetic that's encoded in us because it seems like they're finding out that in some way that that's being recorded inside of us the phobias of our ancestors are theoretically being transferred down generations so maybe that's what it is yeah yeah and so i think again it's like this theory of causal indifference the idea is that if you can process these experiences you may be able to feel better whether you decide later oh that was a real past life that was my actual life or that was a life i tapped into from the collective unconscious and it's just similar to the issues in my current life or whether it's epigenetics i mean that's where we get back to richard rockefeller where he was very concerned about how do we break these cycles of multi-generational trauma and i feel like it's it's appropriate for people to have an open skeptical mind but still go with the experience feel it out to its depth and see how you can integrate it and how we can all move forward and over time with more and more scientific research looking into spirituality looking into psychedelics looking at the psychedelic neuroscience i mean we're discovering incredible things with new brain scan stuff about lsd and psilocybin and mdma and how they work and you know but again how are those things going to translate into refining our therapeutic approach or really helping people get better and that's where i feel like so grateful for stan's approach there's something grounding about can people find ways to help those who are suffering and we're all suffering in different ways get better and and i think that we can and i think it's um a tremendous historical time so for people who are listening to this particularly young people i really want to say that if you have had a thought like maybe you want to become a psychedelic therapist or maybe you want to become a psychedelic neuroscience researcher now for really the first time in about 50 years if you want an above ground legal career in psychedelics anything psychedelic psychotherapy neuroscience you can do it the world is opening up and we need people to help us understand the the magical richness of the human psyche which psychedelics can help reveal and many other things too so now really for you know when when i was in 18 years old in 1972 and all of this was shut down i thought okay i'm going to devote myself to trying to bring this back and what i really want to do is become a psychedelic therapist and also go through my own psychedelic psychotherapy and now more and more it is possible for people to do that we but we have to do it carefully we want to avoid another backlash we not don't want to get grandiose we don't want to get ahead of ourselves but we have a tremendous hopeful opportunity to really bring about creativity innovation spirituality and you look around at the world and man we need all those things but in the end i'm extremely optimistic and hopeful more so than i've ever been before
